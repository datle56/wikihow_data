Graduate gemologist and accredited appraiser Edward Lewand explains that Dawn dish soap and warm water make a safe cleaning solution for most materials, including gold, platinum, and diamonds. To get started, fill a small bowl up with warm tap water, add some dish soap , and swish it all together."

[1] X Research source “If you think about what gets caught on a diamond ring, it’s going to be hand lotions and oils from your skin, which are things that dish soap is designed to break down,” so it's “one of the best materials to use to clean diamond jewelry,” explains master gemologist appraiser Kennon Young. Soaking your ring in the solution should help tackle any unpleasant odors, as well."

      "content": "Take your ring out and scrub it with a soft-bristled toothbrush. When your ring is done soaking, take it out of the water and scrub it gently with a soft-bristled baby or children’s toothbrush, says Young. As you scrub, pay special attention to any nooks or crannies where dirt and grime could be hiding, and make sure to get the underside of the diamond, too. Don’t use a firm toothbrush or any other kind of abrasive cloth or brush. These harsher materials could leave scratches on your jewelry."

      "content": "Let your ring air dry. After rinsing off your ring, set it in a safe place and allow it to try naturally. And that’s it! Your ring should be sparkling clean and good as new. If you don’t have time to air dry your ring, use a microfiber cloth to wipe it dry. Don’t use a regular paper towel—the material could be too abrasive and leave scratches, especially if your ring is made of gold, which is a softer, more scratch-prone metal. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Commercial jewelry cleaner “I recommend cleaning weekly with jewelry cleaner. It’s safe on diamonds and gold,” says jewelry professional Nicole Wegman. “You want to soak [the ring] for a few minutes, and then you want to scrub it with the little brush that often comes with jewelry cleaner. And, if you don’t have one, you can just use a soft toothbrush, then rinse it under warm water,” she says. You can usually buy commercial jewelry cleaners at jewelry stores, or you can order one online. Make sure to follow the instructions that come with the product you buy, and choose one that’s safe for whatever material your ring is made out of (platinum, gold, silver, etc)."

      "content": "Ultrasonic jewelry cleaners For most jewelry with gemstones (such as diamond engagement or wedding rings), it’s safe to use an ultrasonic cleaner . “[Ultrasonic cleaners] utilize high-frequency sound waves, in conjunction with water or other cleaners, to remove dirt and oil,” explains graduate gemologist Jerry R. Ehrenwald. However, it’s best to avoid this method if your ring has lots of tiny gemstones or pave set diamonds—the vibration from these machines can actually loosen the stones. [4] X Research source You’ll also want to avoid using an ultrasonic cleaner too frequently. If you do decide to try this method out, use it only for deep cleaning (not regular everyday cleaning), and make sure to follow the instructions that come with the product you purchase."

      "content": "Windex solution Jeweler and certified jewelry appraiser Cory Schifter recommends cleaning diamond jewelry with a little bit of Windex and water. He explains that this solution is actually pretty similar to commercial jewelry cleaning products, which is what makes it a good option. Since this cleaning method is a bit harsher than others, use it only for deep cleaning once in a while, not light cleaning on a regular basis. Don’t use this method if your ring has any other types of gemstones on it. Windex is only safe to use on diamonds, and it may damage other stones. [5] X Research source"

Pour a bit of a light gold brew onto a microfiber cloth, then use it to polish off any dirt, grime or tarnished bits. Just make sure you don't use a darker ale—this can leave stains on your ring!

      "title": "Clean your ring anywhere from once per week to once per month.",
      "content": "Clean your ring anywhere from once per week to once per month. Although it won’t harm your ring to wait a bit longer between washes, Wegman recommends a weekly cleaning to keep your ring looking as shiny as possible. “Lotion or just even natural body oils will stick to your diamond and start to make it look cloudy, and it's not going to sparkle as much. So the more often you clean it, the more brilliant it's going to look,” she says. However, if a weekly cleaning session seems like a bit too much for you, Young recommends cleaning the ring at least once per month to prevent excessive build-up of oil or grime. “If you let it go for too long, it can get so caked, particularly from underneath the stone, that it becomes very, very hard to clean without a professional,” Young says."

      "content": "Don’t use toothpaste to clean your ring. “An old wives tale is to use toothpaste, but please do not do this,” says Schifter. “It actually ruins gold and leaves a film over diamonds. I’m not sure who made this up, but it’s not something I would recommend,” he explains."

      "content": "Don’t use harsh brushes or cloths to wipe your ring. Instead, use a lint-free or microfiber cloth to avoid leaving scratches or small lint particles on your ring. This is especially important if it has a gold band, since gold is a softer metal. “The paper towel in itself is actually abrasive enough to slightly scratch gold jewelry. So if you want to just keep it as polished as possible, always use a soft cloth,” explains Wegman. If you don’t have a microfiber cloth, Wegman suggests using an old T-shirt as an alternative."

If you’re taking off your ring for a prolonged period of time, store it “in tarnish proof fabric or a clean fabric-lined space that is enclosed and airtight…this will prevent any moisture or outside air from tarnishing the jewelry,” says Ehrenwald. “Keep your jewelry away from the bathroom or any space that contains a lot of moisture or humidity, and be sure to store individual jewelry items separately and away from others, so that they won’t corrode from other materials,” Ehrenwald adds."

Some people are also a little bit more rough with their rings and would need [professional maintenance] more often,” Schifter adds."

For these metals, it’s safest to stick with a more gentle solution of water and dish soap."
