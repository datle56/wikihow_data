      "content": "Choose healthy gerbils over the age of 6 months. Pick a male and female gerbil that are the most docile and easy to handle. Make sure they don’t have any illnesses or deformities since these traits may get passed down to the litter. [1] X Research source Even though gerbils can start mating at the age of 3 months, it can harm them physically and mentally. Females can produce offspring until they’re 2 years old.

      "content": "Introduce the 2 gerbils in a split cage so they get used to one another. Gerbils that aren’t raised in the same cage may not initially get along if they’re introduced too quickly. Either split the existing cage you have in half or buy a split cage. Put 1 gerbil on each side of the cage. After a day or 2, switch the sides the gerbils are on so they can get used to each other’s scent. Continue swapping the sides 2 times a day for at least a week. [3] X Research source Split cages can be purchased online or from your local pet store."

      "content": "Put the gerbils together in the same cage once they’re comfortable. Over the time that your gerbils are in the split cage, you may notice them sleeping next to one another with the wall between them or them getting curious. After the first week, try putting your gerbils together to see if they interact well. Watch them closely for 30 minutes to see how they behave. [4] X Research source It’s normal for your gerbils to play fight and chase each other as they get used to sharing a space. If they actually start biting or you see blood, separate the gerbils again. Keep the gerbils apart for 10 days if you need to separate them again."

As they mate, you may notice them chasing one another followed by the male mounting the female. If your gerbil is healthy, you can expect it to be pregnant. [5] X Research source"

Leave 2-3 sunflower seeds or peanut halves in the food dish for the mother. You can also get a high-fat gerbil feed from your local pet store or online. [8] X Research source Make sure the feed’s fat content is still under 4%, or else the life expectancy of your gerbil could drop if it gets too overweight."

Don’t try to reach in and touch the new pups since the mother may bite you or she may reject the babies. [10] X Research source You may interact with the father gerbil for the first 48 hours after birth. The father will leave the mother alone with its pups during this time so they get used to one another."

Let the baby gerbils move around in your hand, making sure they don’t fall. They may try to lick or lightly bite so they grow accustomed to you. [12] X Research source Always wash your hands before and after you touch the babies or else the mother might reject them.

Keep the female and male gerbils in separate cages so they don’t start mating. [14] X Research source"
