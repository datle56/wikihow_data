      "content": "Find your TV's HDMI input. While TVs can use a variety of video inputs, HDMI is the most commonly used one for high-definition televisions. You'll have the best results using the HDMI input on your TV when connecting to your Mac. The HDMI port is usually on the back or the side of the TV. Most modern HDTVs have at least two HDMI ports. If your TV doesn't support HDMI, you'll need to figure out which input your TV uses for video and then buy an adapter once you know which output your Mac uses."

      "title": "Determine your Mac's video output.",
      "content": "Determine your Mac's video output. Macs manufactured in the last 8 years will output both video and audio through one of the following ports: [1] X Research source Thunderbolt 4 — Oval port (also known as USB-C) found on the backs of recent iMac computers and on all recent models of MacBook. If your Mac has a Thunderbolt 4 port, you'll need a USB-C to HDMI cable. Thunderbolt 4 is just a faster version of Thunderbolt 3, so Macs with either port can use the same USB-C to HDMI cable. Thunderbolt 2 — Squared-off port found on most older Mac computers. If your Mac has a Thunderbolt 2 port, you'll need a Thunderbolt 2 to HDMI cable (or a Thunderbolt 2 to HDMI adapter and an HDMI cable). If your Mac is old enough to have a Thunderbolt 1 port, Thunderbolt 2 cables should still be compatible with it. Mini DisplayPort — Before Thunderbolt came to replace it, Mini DisplayPort was Apple's most common form of video projection. The port is identical in shape to Thunderbolt 1 or 2. To use Mini DisplayPort with your TV, you'll need a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI connector (or a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter and an HDMI cable). Mini DisplayPort replaced DVI on most Macs, so any computer older than 2008 will likely feature a DVI port. HDMI — Found on older MacBook computers, or on the newest Mac Studio desktop. [2] X Research source If your Mac has an HDMI port, you can use a standard HDMI cable to connect your Mac to your TV."

      "content": "Buy the correct cable for your Mac. You can buy standard HDMI cables in most retail stores that have tech departments, but you may want to visit a tech store (or shop online) for a USB-C to HDMI cable or a Thunderbolt 2 to HDMI cable. Best Buy and Amazon are two of the most commonly used options for buying non-standard cables. If you have to buy an adapter because your TV doesn't support HDMI, look for a [Mac output] to [TV input] adapter (e.g., \"USB-C to VGA\" or \"Thunderbolt 2 to VGA\") along with an audio to RCA cable to connect audio to your TV. You most likely won't be able to find an RCA (component cable) adapter. HDMI, Thunderbolt 2, Thunderbolt 3, and Thunderbolt 4 cables (and their adapters) all support audio."
