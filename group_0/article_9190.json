The more they associate you with kindness, excitement, and pure bliss, the more they'll see you as irreplaceable. Tell jokes, play around, and go on adventures. While it might all seem like fun and games, these silly activities are actually very soulful because you'll both see your unfiltered selves. [8] X Research source When you both have a lot of fun, you'll likely see each other's auras —they may be really bright or colorful. If you do, these auras will probably be unforgettable. Even if the person is a mentor who's more like a parent or a teacher, you can still make witty observations to strengthen your intellectual bond.

[10] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Also accept affection from the person you hope to connect to—when you feel their energy, you'll experience a deeper connection with them. Because of the powerful way you can transfer energy through touch, you can even heal some of a person's emotional wounds.

Once you’re ready to build rapport with a stranger, new friend, or mentor, use soulful and deeply engaged eye contact. [12] X Research source Let a friend or intimate partner know you want to \"soul gaze.\" It's important that they consent to trying the special meditation with you. Deep eye contact will still help you create a meaningful bond with someone new and let them know they have your full attention. Engaged eye contact may also help someone feel an immediate “spark” with you."
