[1] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source For consistency, it helps to enter the number in consecutive cells in either a row or column, and for readability, a column is usually better. MODE.SNGL will only display one mode for a group of numbers. If your data has more than one mode (that is, multiple numbers that occur with equal frequency), this function will pick the first one in the set and ignore the others."

The MODE function's format is =MODE.SNGL(Cx:Dy) , where C and D represent the letters of the columns of the first and last cell in the range, and x and y represent the numbers of the first and last row in the range. If all your data is in a single column, the 2 column letters will be the same (e.g., A1:A7). [2] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source If you’re using a version of Excel older than 2010, write =MODE(Cx:Dy) without the .SNGL suffix. This will also work in the most recent versions of Excel. Either method will only return one mode result, even if there are multiple modes in the data set. You can also specify each cell individually, up to 255 cells, as in =MODE.SNGL(A1, A2, A3) , but this can get cumbersome if you have a big dataset. You can also use the function with constants, for example, =MODE.SNGL(4,4,6) , but this requires editing the function each time you wish to search for a different mode. You may want to format the cell in which the mode will display with bolding or italics to distinguish it from the numbers in the dataset, or put it in a separate column or row from the other numbers."

For a dataset of 10, 7, 9, 8, 7, 0, and 4 entered in cells 1 through 8 of Column A, the function =MODE.SNGL(A1:A8) will deliver a result of 7, because 7 appears more often in the data than any other number. If the data set contains more than one number that qualifies as the mode (such as 7 and 9 each appearing twice and every other number appearing only once), whichever mode number is listed first in the data set will be the result. If none of the numbers in the data set appear more often than any other, the MODE function will display the error result #N/A .

As an example of a data set with more than one mode, imagine that your group of numbers is 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 3, and 8. 8 and 7 both appear twice in the group, and both are more frequent than any of the other numbers.

You can also type the individual cells or constants in the data set into the formula in place of the range, but this is only practical for very small data sets that you don’t plan to change. By default, this function will return all the modes for the selected range in the form of a vertical array—that is, it will create a column listing all the modes in the selected data range.
