      "title": "This sign values intelligence, so blow his mind by outsmarting him.",
      "content": "This sign values intelligence, so blow his mind by outsmarting him. Race him to memorize lots of facts and trivia. The intellectual competition will drive him wild, and he’ll keep crawling back to see if he can finally outsmart you. [1] X Research source Figure out what he loves to study and make that your new homework. For example, if he’s into identifying plants, one up him and create the perfect garden. Keep on top of what you’re most passionate about, too. You’ll definitely have an advantage if you’re well-read on what you’re both into. Listen to small details and pay attention to what’s happening in your local community. You’ll become the go-to source for information."

      "title": "He's used to winning arguments, so he'll be impressed if your case is stronger.",
      "content": "He's used to winning arguments, so he'll be impressed if your case is stronger. Let him make a point, then follow it up with your own observation. Look for any holes in his logic. Smile and explain your perspective, letting your quirky and silly side shine through. Once you put all your effort into a case that he can’t knock down, you’ll work him up and inspire him. Tell him every opinion of yours. He’s intrigued by people who are even more outspoken than he is. Stick to polite and civil ways to tell him you disagree. He’ll have to try even harder to keep his cool. You’ll win even more points with him if other people take your side. He’ll be super jealous, but he’ll also have to admit you’re right."

      "title": "He’s full of passion, so he’ll love it when you stand up for yourself.",
      "content": "He’s full of passion, so he’ll love it when you stand up for yourself. Challenge him when he’s made a statement that you disagree with. Explain your perspective and encourage him to see your point of view. Remind him that you still respect him, but you’ll always voice your opinions and beliefs. You can start off and say something like: [2] X Research source “Hey, I just need to stop you there. I don’t completely agree with that…” “Actually, I’d like to give you my perspective on that subject…” “I’ve read a lot of research about that, and this is what I found out…”"

    {
      "title": "He loves unpredictability, so show you’re full of surprises.",
      "content": "He loves unpredictability, so show you’re full of surprises. Go to the same events or social circles that he does and tell everyone your newest stories. For example, if people are used to hearing about your work, tell them about how you’ve been out rock-climbing or backpacking. They’ll be shocked and entertained, and he’ll realize you’re the center of attention. [3] X Research source You can also post fun adventures you had on social media. That way, if he stumbles on it, it will look like he wasn’t on your mind at all. Feel free to talk about less extravagant updates, too. For example, you can try a beginning watercolor class. Experiment with how you carry yourself, too. For instance, if you usually make a lot of rounds talking to everyone at a party, you can stick around to help clean up. He’ll notice all your generosity. He probably likes things to be cutting edge, so do things a trendsetter would do. Show your creative and innovative sides to him."

      "content": "He turns heads, so put on your best outfit to get everyone's eyes on you. Dress for the occasion and make sure you’re in love with your look. Go for a cool and casual vibe for laidback get-togethers and effortless elegance for places that are more formal. You’ll get so many fans of your awesome fashion sense. He’ll envy that you have so many admirers, and he’ll hate that he can’t have you on his arm. [4] X Research source Show off your most unique accessories and your best features. People will give you lots of compliments, and Aquarius will overhear them all. For instance, wear a hint of something wild with your outfit, like a bright scarf or brooch. You’ll win extra points with him if he runs into you and you look amazing. For instance, if you’re well put-together even at the grocery store, he’ll be smitten. You can take lots of style risks, too. For instance, you can try on some wickedly tall platform boots. He’ll love how bold you are. Aquarius men usually like feet, so paint your toenails and wear sexy shoes and see what he thinks."

      "title": "He’s really proud of his popularity, so impress him by winning everyone over.",
      "content": "He’s really proud of his popularity, so impress him by winning everyone over. When you dazzle a crowd with witty conversation and a sparkling laugh, you’ll hypnotize him. He’ll realize that you’re the true star of the party. Then, he’ll want to get all your attention and shine in your eyes. [5] X Research source Learn everyone’s name and ask about both their work and passions. If you befriend every single person in the room, you’ll be even more popular than an Aquarius, as they need lovers who can also be friends. Keep mingling and give everyone else attention. He’ll see how outgoing you are and hope you eventually approach him."

      "content": "He's usually the best at stealing hearts, so you'll inspire him. After a bunch of chill dates or hang-out sessions, take his breath away with a gift or an amazing evening. He’ll recognize you’re the true romantic and admit defeat with a huge smile on his face. [6] X Research source Tell him that you were just randomly inspired. For example, you can pick up a pair of boots at the thrift store that are just his style and get them restored so they’re good as new. Pull him along for a getaway after you’ve spent a long time apart—about a month. For instance, you can go on a road trip and chat for hours, then settle down in a cabin. Praise and creativity are really important, too. Write a song, poem, or letter that expresses how you feel. You can just say your artsy side came out. You’ll leave him wondering."

      "content": "He’s a free spirit, so prove that you can disappear at any moment, too. Remind him that you can run off at any moment. Plan a trip that you really look forward to, then just go on it without telling him. When he asks where you went, act surprised that he’s curious. Say it’s totally normal for you to explore and he’ll daydream about how daring you are. [7] X Research source If you keep lots of details on the down-low and off social media, your spontaneity will come across as even more natural. Just make sure to check in with your close friends and family! When you catch up with him, tell him that you felt like you were meant to be somewhere else. Aquarians can sometimes feel like outcasts, so he’ll relate with the need to get away. Describe the place you went to and why it was the perfect for your unique tastes. For example, you can say: “I went up to the mountains because I really needed some peace.”"

[8] X Research source Talk about how you find satisfaction outside of romantic relationships. You can bring up how you bond with all your friends. He’ll go out of his way to prove his value to you. Share any DIY projects that you’re proud of. Maybe you painted a mural or repaired your car. He’ll be amazed by what you can do on your own. Tell him why you love time alone. For example, you can say, “I can catch up on all my work and then reflect on my dreams.”"

      "title": "He tries harder when he has to chase you, so make him wait to hang out.",
      "content": "He tries harder when he has to chase you, so make him wait to hang out. To keep him hooked, say you suddenly had some free time and invite him on a date. Give him your full focus. He’s addicted to deep conversations and anyone who dotes on him. Lean in and listen to his stories, then respond with lots of enthusiasm. Treat him to plenty of affection, too. He’ll savor the moments you have together and constantly miss you. [9] X Research source An Aquarius is really into compliments and sweet gestures. If you spend less time with him, tell him why he’s special and show your appreciation for him. For example, you can say, “You’re crazily well-read. I picked up these books for you, and I know you’ll probably finish them in a week!” Your kindness and tenderness will take his breath away, and he’ll replay all these dates in his head."

      "title": "He can seduce anyone, so you’ll work him up if you resist his charms.",
      "content": "He can seduce anyone, so you’ll work him up if you resist his charms. Tell him your boundaries and explain that you’ll only take things to a more physical level if you trust him. You’ll let him know that you’re more than just an option, and he’ll pull out all the stops to make you a priority. [10] X Research source You can still flirt and cuddle up to him. He’ll feel really warm about you, and you’ll create some fun tension. Laugh or smile if he mentions any of his other dates or anyone who flirts with him. You can just say, “Okay! Have fun with that!” He’ll be shocked that you’re so secure. Eventually, when he wants to settle down and commit, his mind will be stuck on you because he’s waited so long and built a strong bond."

    {
      "title": "He loves a creative sense of humor, so unique jokes will dazzle him.",
      "content": "He loves a creative sense of humor, so unique jokes will dazzle him. Make a bunch of comments that are open to interpretation. Point out funny observations with a straight face. For example, you can tell him that he’s always right in a really flat tone. He’ll wonder if you’re actually poking fun at him. If you stay vague and look like you’re a pro at hidden messages, you’ll be his favorite riddle to think about. [11] X Research source Make sure that your jokes are light-hearted even if you’re sarcastic. That will show him you have a good attitude and just love to play around. You can also admit your feelings but play them off in a silly way. For example, you can say, “Yeah, I’m totally in love with you.” He’ll wonder if you’re serious or not. If he ever gives you a confused confession, just smirk. He’ll try to make sense of your comment for days on end."

      "content": "He loves a good mystery, so he’ll beg for you to open up. Keep your own conversations with him light and friendly.

Over time, he’ll tell you all about his true feelings for you and how he’s wanted you all along. [12] X Research source If you do love or have strong feelings for him, you can express yourself in different ways. For example, you can listen if he’s had a hard day. You can even say, “I’m sorry you’ve had such a rough time.” Remember that you’re just protecting your heart. He can be patient and earn your trust over time. Once he’s revealed all of his feelings, then you know you’ve beat him at his own game. If you want, you can start a whole new chapter with him."
