      "title": "Write the author’s name in the quote introduction instead of the in-text citation.",
      "content": "Write the author’s name in the quote introduction instead of the in-text citation. In APA format, you may choose to include the author’s name in the introduction to the quote. This is the part of the sentence that is comprised of your own words and leads into the words of the quotation. In its most basic form, a quote introduction looks like this: “According to (author’s name)…” Use the author’s last name and first initial, followed by a period. For example: “According to J. O’Neil and J. Egan, “The gender-role journey metaphor provides a context for individuals to analyze their gender-role socialization and sexism in their lives” (1992, p. 111).” If you include the author’s name in the quote intro, you don’t need to include it in the parenthetical in-text citation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the author’s last name in the parenthetical citation if you omit it in the quote intro.",
      "content": "Put the author’s last name in the parenthetical citation if you omit it in the quote intro. If you don’t refer to the name of the book chapter’s author in the quote introduction, you need to include the last name in the parenthetical in-text citation that follows the quote. [1] X Research source For example: “(O’Neil, 1992, p. 111).” If you have 2 authors, include an ampersand sign (&) between the two last names, as seen here: “Recent research on gender role metaphors “provides a context for individuals to analyze their gender-role socialization and sexism in their lives” (O’Neil & Egan, 1992, p. 111).” If you have 3-5 authors, use commas to separate each name and include an ampersand before the final name. If you have more than 5 authors, just write the first listed author’s last name, followed by a comma, then “et al.” and a comma. Then add the publication date and page number, as necessary: “(Harris et al., 2001).”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Include the publication date and page number in parenthesis.",
      "content": "Include the publication date and page number in parenthesis. In your parenthetical in-text citation, write the author’s last name (if you didn’t include it in the quote intro), followed by a comma, then the publication date, followed by another comma, and end with the page number (p. X). Close the parenthesis and add a period to complete the sentence. [2] X Research source For example: “According to J. O’Neil and J. Egan, “The gender-role journey metaphor provides a context for individuals to analyze their gender-role socialization and sexism in their lives” (1992, p. 111).” Sometimes, you may want to include the publication date in parentheses in the quote introduction (to indicate recent research, etc.). In this case, you don’t need to list the publication date in the parenthetical citation. For example: “According to J. O’Neil and J. Egan (1992), “The gender-role journey metaphor provides a context for individuals to analyze their gender-role socialization and sexism in their lives” (p. 111).”"

For 2 authors, use a comma and an ampersand sign (&) to separate the names. For 3 to 7 authors, separate each name with a comma and put an ampersand before the last author's name. For more than 7 authors, place an ellipsis (...) between the sixth and last authors' names.
