      "content": "Cook the rest of your meal first. Scallops cook quickly, and they’re best when they’re fresh out of the pan. If you’re planning to serve up anything else with your scallops (such as pasta or a salad), prepare that first and have it ready to serve the moment the scallops are done. [1] X Research source For example, if you’d like to serve these scallops over toast, toast and butter the bread before you begin cooking the scallops. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the side-muscles if necessary. If your scallops still have their fibrous muscle tags attached, pull those off with your thumb and forefinger before you start cooking them. These muscles are easy to recognize because they feel tough and firm to the touch and their fibers go against the grain of the rest of the scallop. [3] X Research source Leaving the muscles attached won’t do any harm, but they’re much tougher and harder to chew than the rest of the scallop."

      "title": "Rinse the scallops thoroughly with cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse the scallops thoroughly with cool water. Before you cook the scallops, it’s a good idea to rinse them to remove any grit, sand, or other unwanted debris. Put them in a colander before running water over them so they can drain quickly. [4] X Research source Draining them quickly is key, since scallops will get waterlogged and mushy if they sit in water for too long."

      "title": "Pat the scallops dry with a paper towel.",
      "content": "Pat the scallops dry with a paper towel. After the scallops have drained for a few minutes, spread them out on a flat surface covered in paper towels. Use another clean paper towel to gently pat each scallop dry. If you don’t pat the scallops dry before searing them, you’ll end up with tougher steamed scallops instead of tender, pan-seared ones."

Place 1 tablespoon (14.2 grams) of unsalted butter or 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of olive oil in the pan and turn on the heat. Gently swirl the pan to coat the bottom evenly with the butter or oil. The pan needs to be very hot in order for the scallops to cook properly. [6] X Research source You can tell the pan is hot enough if you drop some water on the pan and it evaporates instantly."

The scallops won’t cook properly if the pan is overcrowded. [7] X Research source The first scallop should sizzle when you place it on the pan. If it doesn't, wait a few more seconds before adding the rest."

They should be firm, but somewhat squishy, when you press down on them. [11] X Research source Don't overcook the scallops, of they'll end up tough and chewy."

[12] X Research source You can serve these scallops over pasta or couscous with a little lemon or olive oil, or add them to a salad! If you don’t eat all of your scallops, you can store them in the refrigerator in a well-sealed container for 3-4 days. You can also freeze them in an airtight container for 2-3 months.

[29] X Research source The scallops should be done when the breading is golden brown. You can also test them by inserting a cake tester into the middle of the scallop and holding it below your lip—it should feel warm, but not hot.
