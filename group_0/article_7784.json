Pour the ammonia onto the grates before closing the bags so they’re airtight. The ammonia doesn’t have to completely cover the grates because the fumes will break down the grease. Use duct tape or rope to tie garbage bags closed so the fumes can’t escape. Avoid breathing in ammonia fumes, since it may cause nasal irritation."

Set the bags outside so your house doesn’t smell like ammonia if they accidentally break open. You can leave the grates in for longer if you have stuck-on food residue."

Wipe the grates dry with a lint-free towel before putting them back on your stove. Don’t use paper towels to dry your grates, since they may pill and leave behind residue."
