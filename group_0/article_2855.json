      "title": "Develop interests in unique and obscure things.",
      "content": "Develop interests in unique and obscure things. Whether it's a style of art or a brand of tea, quirky people are often engrossed in obscure niches. Look online for things that have a small cult following and do research on them. Engross yourself in hobbies and subjects that many people are unaware of. [4] X Research source Unique hobbies could include beekeeping, quilting, or doll collecting."

    {
      "title": "Be passionate about a few key causes.",
      "content": "Be passionate about a few key causes. Most quirky people will be deeply invested in important causes like environmental justice, civil rights, or women's rights. Some quirky people will find even more obscure issues to educate people on. Find an issue that's important to you and let everyone around you know how passionate you are about it. [5] X Research source Obscure issues might include saving a rare species of plant in the Amazon or demanding the return of your favorite actor in a sci-fi show."

      "title": "Don't act fake for the sake of being quirky.",
      "content": "Don't act fake for the sake of being quirky. If you’re always trying to come off quirky at any cost, people may find you to be disingenuous. Most quirky people will act and dress how they want, regardless of what other people think. Do things that you truly like and wear clothes that make you feel comfortable. Don't do things just so that you can appear more quirky."

    {
      "title": "Maintain a positive attitude.",
      "content": "Maintain a positive attitude. Quirky people are often described as happy and energetic. Don’t be negative or judgmental. Try to maintain a positive attitude and always look at the upside of a situation rather than the downside. For example, if you miss your train for a vacation you can say something like \"Well, at least it's nice outside! We can always catch the next one.\""

      "title": "Have conversations about random topics.",
      "content": "Have conversations about random topics. Don't hold back your thoughts when you're talking to other people, even if your thoughts may seem strange to other people. Try to look at all the aspects of a conversation and run with the first thing that comes into your head, even if it seems random or weird. For instance, you can have a conversation about the beauty of peach trees or the possibility that aliens may have invented the pyramids."

    {
      "title": "Don't follow the crowd.",
      "content": "Don't follow the crowd. Quirky people don’t follow norms and will do things that other people don’t even think of. Don't follow trends or pretend to like clothing, musicians, or movies just because they are new and everyone else likes them. At the same time, you shouldn't hate things just because they are popular. Listen to music and watch movies that you genuinely like! [6] X Research source For instance, if everyone is raving about a new album that you don't like, don't pretend that you like it just to fit in."

      "title": "Act as whimsical and adorable as possible.",
      "content": "Act as whimsical and adorable as possible. Even though you might act strange, you shouldn’t come across as offensive or rude. Quirkiness is about being endearingly weird, not creepy or mean. Try to seem innocent and oblivious to the world around you. You can stare off into space, daydream, or act oblivious to social cues. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Do the unexpected.",
      "content": "Do the unexpected. Quirky people don't follow the norms set by society. Approach situations and problems in a way that's perceived as \"strange\" or \"weird\" to other people. If someone asks you why you did something out of the ordinary, act like it's totally normal. [8] X Research source For instance, you can skip instead of walking, or you could hum even if there are people around you."

    {
      "title": "Create unique art.",
      "content": "Create unique art. Take photos, paint pictures, write poetry, or play a musical instrument. Try out different types of art and determine which ones you like to do most. Once you get used to a certain medium, don’t be afraid to push the boundaries and do things that other people haven't tried. [9] X Research source Popular instruments among quirky people include the guitar, bass, and ukulele."

    {
      "title": "Wear breezy and quaint clothes.",
      "content": "Wear breezy and quaint clothes. Quirky people are seen as cute and innocent rather than sexy. Avoid low cut dresses or things that show too much skin. Follow niche fashion trends and avoid wearing overly formal dresses or suits. You can wear flowy sundresses or longer skirts. Things like scarves, cropped pants, and sweaters can also make you look quirky."

    {
      "title": "Wear loud and colorful prints and designs.",
      "content": "Wear loud and colorful prints and designs. Stand out when it comes to the things that you wear. Wear clothes that have polka-dots, animal print, or bright floral colors. Find things to wear that aren’t trendy. The goal is to wear clothes that make you look interesting and different. Quirky colors include bright green, teal, pink, yellow, and purple. Mix different pieces to suit your personality. You can go to a thrift store to find clothes."

      "title": "Wear unusual and artistic accessories.",

You can also wear an uncommonly worn hat like a fedora or beret."

      "title": "Dress in things that make you happy.",
      "content": "Dress in things that make you happy. Don’t put yourself in a box when it comes to fashion. Choose clothes that you genuinely like, feel comfortable, and make you happy. Let go of being self-conscious when it comes to your clothing. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Dye your hair or have an alternative hairstyle.",
      "content": "Dye your hair or have an alternative hairstyle. To really stand out, dye your hair an unnatural color like purple or green. You could even add some streaks. This will give you a different look and will tell people that you’re not afraid to push boundaries and be yourself. If dying your hair isn't your thing, you can shave the sides of your head, cut your hair short, or rock bangs. [12] X Research source"
