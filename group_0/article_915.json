Use the phrase “Mr./Madam President, may I present.” In the United States, the president should not be introduced to someone, as this would seem disrespectful.

Former presidents do not keep the title of “president” once they leave office (contrary to how they’re often referred to in the media). If you’re writing a letter to a former president, the envelope should be addressed to: “The Honorable [first and last name].” [8] X Research source For example, you could address a letter to “The Honorable Jimmy Carter” or “The Honorable George Bush.”"

A letter to a former president is slightly less formal than correspondence to a sitting president since the recipient no longer holds the office of president. Do not use the term “honorable” in the introduction or body of your correspondence—“honorable” should be used on the envelope only.

      "content": "Address a former president as “Mr.” and their surname in person. An in-person address will also be less formal for a former president than it would for a sitting president. For example, you would address Barack Obama as “Mr. Obama,” not as “Mr. President.” [10] X Research source The rules about introductions are similarly less formal. As a general sign of respect, though, it’s still probably best to introduce a third party to the former president."
