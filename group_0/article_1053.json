For instance, you could have your first meal at 12 noon and the other at 7:00 pm. Then, fast for 17 hours after the second meal, sleeping and not eating \"breakfast\" until your fasting period ends.

If that's the case, set aside a 1-hour window to eat each day. For instance, you might fast for 23 hours, then eat a healthy, filling meal between 6 and 7 pm every evening.

      "content": "Choose an eating schedule that you can maintain. When implementing this diet, you’ll go without food for repeated periods of time (e.g., fasting 16 to 23 hours per 24-hour day) before you get to eat during the remaining 1 to 8 hours in your day. Intermittent fasting is often a way to lose weight, and is also a good way to regulate and schedule your food intake. [4] X Research source It’s important to form and stick with a daily fasting schedule, and set a daily time to eat your last meal in the eating window."

      "title": "Decrease your daily calorie consumption moderately.",
      "content": "Decrease your daily calorie consumption moderately. If you normally eat 2,000 or 3,000 calories per day, then you can cut the calories only a little during meal times. [5] X Research source Try not to exceed 1,500 or 2,000 calories a day. To meet this goal, tailor your diet to include healthy carbs, avoid white bread and white noodles, but have some complex carbs and some fats. Consume all of your daily calories during your one or two narrow meal times. You may find that the calorie reduction is easy to achieve, since you simply won’t have as much time to consume calories during a week. As part of this process, gradually alter your diet to decrease your consumption of processed foods, including processed meat, dairy, or soda."

      "title": "Do not dramatically alter your diet.",
      "content": "Do not dramatically alter your diet. When on an IF diet, there’s no need to cut out any specific food groups (e.g. carbs or fats). As long as you eat a healthy, balanced diet, and don’t exceed roughly 2,000 calories per day, you can eat the same types of food that you did before beginning the diet. The IF diet changes your eating schedule, not the types of foods that you eat. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source A well-balanced diet includes only small amounts of sodium-heavy processed foods and added sugars. Focus on healthy proteins (meats, including poultry and fish), fruits and vegetables, and moderate amounts of daily carbohydrates."

Ask about the pros and cons of the diet, and be sure to inform your doctor of any pre-existing medical conditions. [7] X Research source The IF diet can have a dramatic effect on your daily metabolism. Do not fast without consulting with your doctor if you are pregnant or are unwell. Caution: Type 1 diabetics on an IF diet would have difficulty regulating and maintaining healthy insulin levels, due to the deliberately infrequent food consumption."

      "content": "Eat your last non-fasting meal. Avoid the temptation to load up on junk food, sugar, and processed items in your last meal before fasting. Eat fresh vegetables and fruits, and make sure to eat plenty of proteins so that your energy level stays high. [8] X Research source For example, your last meal could include cooked chicken breast, a piece of garlic bread, and a salad including romaine lettuce, tomato, sliced onion, and vinaigrette dressing. Some people binge a little starting this strategy, though this means that you will spend more time digesting your food and less time in the “fasting adapted phase” of your food-abstinence period. Eat a full meal before you begin fasting. If you fill up on only sugar-heavy or carbohydrate-heavy foods, before your fast, you’ll become hungry again quickly. Eat plenty of protein and fats when you have a scheduled meal. Going too low on carbs and fat can be hard to maintain, as you’ll feel unsatisfied and constantly hungry when fasting."

You can ease into the diet by lengthening your times of fasting between meals or start by taking one day off from eating per week. This will benefit your body by reducing uncomfortable symptoms (which can include headache, low blood pressure, and fatigue, or irritability).

[10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Then, while you’re awake, you won’t feel food-deprived because you know you will get to eat a big meal soon. The first/main meal after your fast will be the reward for the fasting period. You will be hungry after fasting, so eat a full meal."

      "content": "Eat a light snack during your fasting window if you need to. One snack of 100 calories of protein and fat (nuts, cheese, etc.) will not impact the effectiveness of carrying out your fast. If you're really hungry or start to feel faint, have a healthy snack! Try to choose snacks with fewer than 30 calories, such as a few carrot or celery sticks, a quarter of an apple, 3 cherries, grapes, or raisins, 2 small crackers, or 1 ounce of chicken or fish until your fast ends."

In fact, it’s crucial that you stay hydrated while fasting, in order to keep your body working well. Drink water, herbal tea, and other no-calorie drinks. [11] X Research source Staying hydrated will also stave off hunger pains, as the liquids will take up room in your stomach."

Schedule a work out for just before your first meal (or, if you’re eating two meals a day, work out between meals). Your body will be able to use the calories most effectively at this point, so plan to consume about 60% of your daily calories right after working out. [14] X Research source To keep yourself healthy and increase muscle mass, don’t cut your calories to below 10 calories per pound of body weight. For example, a 180 pound man would need at least 1,800 calories per day to get lean, not by starving, while training moderately. If you cut too many calories, you’ll decrease your ability to stay healthy and build muscle tone."

If you’re simply trying to lose weight, focus on aerobics and cardio-based workouts. If you’re trying to add some muscle mass and bulk up, you’ll need focus on anaerobic exercises, such as weight training. [15] X Research source If you’re trying to lose weight, focus on aerobics or cardio exercises in long sessions. If you’d like a more muscled body, focus on short bursts of anaerobic exercise. Anaerobic means working out in short bursts, without raising your heart rate dramatically. It is based on short times of doing resistance or weight exercise, not long sessions of aerobics or cardio."
