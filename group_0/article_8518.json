      "content": "Fill a large pot halfway with water and place it on the stove to boil. Use a pot that's large enough to comfortably fit your teapot inside of it. If you have a large teapot, you might need to buy a larger pot at the local supermarket."

      "title": "Turn the heat off and fill 1/4 of the pot with vinegar.",
      "content": "Turn the heat off and fill 1/4 of the pot with vinegar. Once the water reaches the boil, switch the heat off and let the water bubble. You can use either white or brown vinegar but white vinegar is much better for cleaning purposes. When you've finished pouring the vinegar into the pot, the pot should be about 3/4 full. [1] X Research source Try the local cleaning store or online to see if you can find an industrial sized bottle of vinegar. Using 1 of these bottles will be cheaper than using a few small bottles of vinegar."

      "content": "Slice some lemons and place the slices in the water. Lemon juice has great cleaning properties because of its acidic components. The acidic lemon juice will mix into the boiling water and vinegar solution. [2] X Research source You can juice lemons as well and pour the lemon juice into the pot."

The acid in the vinegar combined with the boiling water will remove most of the stains from your teapot. Make sure you have the teapot submerged in the water when you place it in the pot. You can put a cover on the pot if you want. The cover will keep the heat in the pot for longer."

This item is usually used in styling and coloring hair, but it's great for cleaning porcelain or china. On top of this, you will also need gloves to protect your hands from the developer and a container to bleach the teapot in. A plastic container or a large pot will do."

Keep pouring it until the teapot is completely submerged by the developer. [7] X Research source Leave the container in a place where it won't be disturbed or bumped into.

Gently and slowly tip the container to pour the developer out of it. Make sure you don't tip it too quickly as your teapot could fly out of the container. [8] X Research source You can also pour it over asphalt or concrete if you want. Rinse it after with a hose."
