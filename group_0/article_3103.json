      "title": "Start at a comfortable reading level.",
      "content": "Start at a comfortable reading level. You can advance to more difficult reading materials from there. If you attempt to read material that is too challenging initially you are more likely to become discouraged. While challenging yourself to read at a more advanced level is a wonderful goal, studies have shown that if you allow yourself to become discouraged while reading you will be less likely to achieve that goal in the long run. Skim the first few pages. If you have trouble understanding what the author is trying to say, you may not enjoy the book. If you have chosen a book with a very narrow focus, like a scientific work or a specific historical treatise, you might want to instead familiarize yourself with books on more general topics first. Use the five finger rule. Pick a book, and read the first two or three pages. Put one finger up for every word you can't pronounce or don't know the meaning of. If you've put up 5 or more fingers, the book is probably too hard. Educators have been using this method for years, and it can be applied for children as well as adults .

      "content": "Expand your vocabulary . Building a greater vocabulary will make reading easier and more fun in the future. The more words you are exposed to, the more your vocabulary will grow. [3] X Research source If you don't understand a word, first try to use context clues to figure out what it means. Frequently, the rest of the words in a sentence will offer hints about what a particular word means. Look up words in the dictionary that you do not recognize or understand. Write down these words to review later to solidify them in your memory and make them a part of your vocabulary. Keep of a collection of these words for your own reference. Use new words you learn in your everyday speech. Putting words into action in your everyday life will ensure that you remember them."

      "title": "Practice, practice, practice.",
      "content": "Practice, practice, practice. Studies have shown that people who spend more time reading, and take in a greater volume of reading material, develop a more extensive vocabulary and greater reading comprehension. This improves their ability to take in knowledge more generally. [4] X Research source As with anything else, developing reading skills takes work. Set aside time to read every day. Literacy experts disagree about exactly how much time you should devote to reading, given that it varies according to age, skill level, and ability. A good rule to remember, however, is consistency. Try to read every day. If you need to take frequent breaks while reading, go ahead. Even while practicing, reading should be an enjoyable experience. Take a book with you on a morning bus or train commute, or read on your lunch break. Having access to reading materials during moments of down time makes it more likely that you will read regularly. Read the words out loud. Reading out loud, alone or to someone, can improve how you read and spell. However, don’t force a nervous reader to read aloud, especially in a group setting. Fear of shame and humiliation can make some unsure readers dread the experience. Visualize the story, pay attention to the introduction of characters and places. Try to see each in your mind. \"Seeing\" the story will make it more real to you and easier to remember."

      "content": "Read materials that interest you. You are much more likely to commit to reading when it is an enjoyable and engaging experience. If you are bored while reading, you are more likely to put the book down and engage in a different activity.

There are books that cover every topic imaginable, and the availability of local libraries, bookstores, and the Internet means that all of them are at your fingertips. Don't limit yourself to just monographs. Comic books and graphic novels are a great way to get children and young adults hooked on reading. Collections of short stories are a good option for those who don't want to commit to reading a longer work. Read magazines that cover your areas of interest. Whether your interests are in motorcycle maintenance, gardening, bird watching, or 19th-century architecture, there is a magazine that caters to you. Many of these contain lengthy, well-sourced articles."

      "content": "Create a pleasant reading environment. The more you associate reading with comfort and relaxation the more likely you are to continue developing your reading skills. Reading can become a treat, rather than a chore. [6] X Research source Find a quiet place to read so that you aren’t disturbed. Avoid distractions like TV or the radio, or other people prone to disturbing you. Make sure it is somewhere with good lighting where you can relax. Hold the book about 15 inches away from your face (approximately the distance from your elbow to your wrist). Make a cozy and fun reading area. A nicely lit corner with comfortable pillows creates a great ambiance for reading. If you are helping someone read, stay positive! Negative feedback will only discourage a fledgling reader, so keep the environment upbeat."

Making reading a social experience can inspire you to continue to improve. Friends can also provide encouragement for each other. Start an online blog reviewing the latest books you have read. Encourage others to dialogue about their opinions of the work. Go to a coffee shop or cafe readers frequent. Seeing others reading can inspire you, or expose you to interesting titles. Strike up a conversation with a fellow patron about what they have been reading. Consider taking a class at your local college, community college, or community center. You can learn a new skill, study a topic that interests you, and practice your reading skills at the same time. Read interesting passages to family or friends. You might encourage them to improve their reading as well."

It will also allow you to practice your reading skills. Parents can help their children be good readers by reading to them when they are young. Reading to children helps them develop language and listening skills, which prepares them to understand the written word. [7] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source Keep books handy in your household and keep age-appropriate books accessible to children to peruse on their own. Even if a child cannot read on their own yet, establishing initial skills for reading—such as how to correctly hold a book and turn the pages—is an important step to becoming a reader. Family reading time can provide a moment to bond with your children. Life can be very hectic, and it is often difficult to set aside quality time with your family. Try to schedule a moment to read with your children everyday as part of your routine. Be patient if your child begins to favor one book and wants to read it over and over again. A favorite story could be offering your child comfort or appealing to a particular interest they have at the moment. Also, re-reading the same words and sentences repeatedly helps your child begin to recognize words by sight."

Libraries are wonderful places to find a variety of books and librarians are there to help. Trained in how to most effectively help you make the most of your library experience, librarians are a resource you should not overlook. Ask the librarian for suggestions for books on a specific topic, or a more general genre, or to help you find a particular title. Finding materials that interest you is an important first step in improving your reading. Read the backs of books or the inside of the dust jacket for a brief summary of the plot. Usually, you will be able to tell right away if a book will not sustain your interest. Most libraries allow you to check out more than one title at once. Take home several books to give yourself a variety of reading materials to try."

You can easily find blogs online that include book reviews, which could lead you to explore other books and authors. Consider getting a portable reading device for easy access to digital material.

Many public libraries now allow you to \"check out\" e-books for free for a certain period of time, such as two weeks."
