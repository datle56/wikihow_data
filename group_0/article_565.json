And if there’s a whole number with your fraction, then that’s a mixed number.

When you add like fractions, you don’t add the denominators together. So when adding something like 1/3 + 5/3 , the denominator in the final answer will still be 3 , not 6. [2] X Research source Ex. 1 : For the equation 1/4 + 2/4 , the new numerator is 3 (1 + 2 = 3), and the denominator will still be 4 . This gives us an answer of 3/4 (1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4). Ex. 2 : In the equation 3/8 + 2/8 + 4/8 , the new numerator is 9 (3 + 2 + 4 = 9), and the denominator is still 8 . This yields the answer 9/8 (3/8 + 2/8 + 4/8 = 9/8).

      "content": "Simplify the new fraction if necessary. Either reduce the fraction by finding a common factor between the numerator and denominator, then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF. Or convert an improper fraction to a mixed number by diving the numerator by the denominator, placing the resulting whole number next to the fraction, and making the remainder the new numerator. The two processes look like the following: For example, the GCF of the numerator and denominator in the fraction 5/20 is 5 . After dividing both 5 and 20 by 5, you’re left with the reduced fraction 1/4 . To turn the improper fraction 9/8 into a mixed number, divide the top number by the bottom number. When you divide 9 by 8, you get 1 as a whole number and a remainder of 1 . Place the whole number in front of the fraction and the remainder in the numerator of the new fraction. Leave the denominator the same. The simplified version of 9/8 will thus be 1 1/8 ."
