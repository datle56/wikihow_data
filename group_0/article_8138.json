      "content": "Wipe marble surfaces with a wet cloth. Use only warm tap water, as many household cleaners are too harsh for marble counters. Wipe the length of the counter with a wet cloth. Microfiber cloths are best for this if you have them, they’ll give the counter a better scrub without needing to use a household cleaner. If you need to clean your counter more thoroughly, you can use commercial cleaners specifically designed for marble. For marble floors, passing a dust mop on the surface regularly should be enough for regular cleaning. However, if the floor is dirty and requires some extra cleaning, add a couple of drops of dish soap to a bucket of water and use a microfiber head mop to clean the floor with this solution. Dry the floor thoroughly after cleaning it. This kind of cleaning should be done daily to clear crumbs or any dust that may have accumulated on the counter, it won’t clean serious stains.

      "title": "Mix paper towel pieces, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide in a bowl.",
      "content": "Mix paper towel pieces, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide in a bowl. Rip up a couple sheets of paper towels and place them in a bowl. Note that the amount of paper towel you use depends on the size of the stain you’re trying to remove. Pour a few drops of ammonia in the bowl, and enough hydrogen peroxide to completely soak the paper towel chunks. When handling ammonia, you should wear gloves to avoid skin irritation and burns. If the stain you’re trying to remove is quite large, you may want to fold up a paper towel instead. Attempt this method if you’re dealing with old or tenacious stains that can’t be removed with more conventional means. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the paper towel poultice over the stain. Pick the saturated chunks out of the bowl and place them over the stain. Be careful not to apply too much pressure, or the hydrogen peroxide and ammonia might leak out over your marble. If you’re dealing with a vertical surface, the paper towel chunks should be wet enough to just stick on. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Seal the poultice with plastic wrap. Stretch a length of plastic wrap over the poultice and stain. Apply pressure to its sides, so that it completely seals the poultice, then use clear adhesive tape to secure the plastic wrap. Use a toothpick to poke a couple of holes in the plastic wrap to allow airflow. [5] X Research source Let the poultice sit for two to three days."
