Just fill in the numbers for your loan or savings account after paying/receiving interest. This simple equation can be used to find your basic interest rate. [1] X Research source I stands for the amount paid in interest that month/year/etc. P stands for the principle (the amount of money before interest). T stands for time periods (weeks, months, years, etc.) involved. R stands for the interest rate, as a decimal. [2] X Research source"

This is the percentage of every bill account of principle that is reflected in interest. So, if you got .34 as your rate before, you'd be paying 34% interest ( .34 ∗ 100 = 34 % {\\displaystyle .34*100=34\\%} ) [3] X Research source"

You should easily be able to find interest paid, the time period (when the bill/statement is from) and principle. For example, say you paid $2,344 in interest on a $12,000 loan last year. You want to know what your monthly interest rate was. To get it, you could input: Interest equation: I P T = R {\\displaystyle {\\frac {I}{PT}}=R} Plug in numbers: $ 2 , 344 $ 12 , 000 ∗ 12 m o = {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\$2,344}{\\$12,000*12mo}}=} Interest Rate Simplify equation: .01627 = {\\displaystyle .01627=} Interest Rate Multiply by 100 to get the final percentage: .01627 ∗ 100 = {\\displaystyle .01627*100=} 1.6% monthly interest rate."

      "content": "Make sure that your time and your rate are on the same scale. Say you're trying to figure out your monthly interest rate on a loan after one year. If you put \"1\" in for T, as in \"one year,\" your final interest rate will be the interest rate per year. If you want monthly, you need to use the correct amount of time elapsed. In this case, you'd aim for 12 months. The time should be the same amount of time as the interest paid. If you're calculating a year's worth of monthly interest payments, for example, then you've made 12 payments. Make sure you check when your interest is calculated -- monthly, yearly, weekly, etc.-- with your bank. [4] X Research source"

But tricky terms like APR (\"annual percentage rate,\" ie. \"interest\") and fluctuating rates may make it impossible to determine what a certain rate even means. These fluctuating rates are almost impossible to determine by hand, but free calculators online can help you find the specifics for difficult loans. Sites like Bankrate.com and CalculatorSoup are unaffiliated and trustworthy.

      "content": "Talk to your bankers to negotiate a lower interest rate. Getting a lower interest rate is usually just a matter of negotiating. To be successful, all you have to do is come prepared. Know how much money you want, how much interest you'd like to pay, and what rate is going to be too high for you to make a deal before walking in or calling up. Financially stable people with decent (650+) credit scores have the best chance to negotiate rates. Call up your credit card company and let them know that you've found better rates on other cards. If you're a regular customer who pays on time, they will likely try to keep your business. Talk to your banker about the lowest possible rate they can give. Research other options so you can point to other offers. Be wary of variable APR or interest -- it may look appealing at first, but these \"deals\" often turn into exorbitantly high interest rates after 1-2 years."

      "title": "Choose a less-frequent accrual rate to pay less in interest.",
      "content": "Choose a less-frequent accrual rate to pay less in interest. The accrual rate determines when interest is added to principal. So, if it is really high (such as daily) it means that whatever interest is unpaid at the end of the day gets added to principle. This means the next month's interest payment will be even higher since you have a higher principle. For example, note how a $100,000 loan with a 4% interest rate is compounded three different ways: Yearly : $110,412.17 Monthly : $110,512.24 Daily : $110,521.28 [6] X Research source"

Simply said -- the more you owe, the more money you pay in interest. If you can pay off some of the principle every month along with the interest, you may not lower your rate. But you will definitely lower your payments. [7] X Research source"
