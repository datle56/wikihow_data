      "content": "Capricorns hate drama. If you’re dating a Capricorn, you’ll realize very quickly that they don’t appreciate melodrama within their relationships. Since Capricorns are so logical and straightforward, dealing with dramatics can make them feel overwhelmed and stressed. The best thing you can do for your Capricorn partner is to talk things out logically and thoroughly before getting upset with them. For instance, maybe you’re annoyed that your Capricorn partner has been ignoring you lately. Instead of being passive-aggressive or avoiding the problem, approach them calmly and talk about your feelings ."

      "content": "They’re very goal-oriented, and may be workaholics. Yes, the rumors are true: a Capricorn's hard-working nature sometimes distracts them from their relationships. If you feel like you aren’t getting enough attention from your Capricorn partner, try setting up weekly date nights or asking them to put your hangout times in their schedule. Take turns planning dates so that you both feel like equals in the relationship."

      "content": "They love to help people, especially their partners. If there’s something a Capricorn will never do, it’s leave you in a lurch. When you're dating a Capricorn, they’ll be the first ones to come pick you up when your car is dead or buy you soup when you’re sick. You can repay their kindness by taking care of them when they’re in need, too. Capricorns can sometimes be hesitant to ask for your help. If you notice your Capricorn partner struggling, approach them with something like, “I notice you’ve been really stressed lately. Is there anything I can do?”"

      "content": "Capricorns need support when they start to doubt themselves. Many Capricorns struggle with self-doubt or low self-esteem. As their partner, it’s crucial that you know how to lift them up and encourage them when they’re having a bad day. Remind them of all their accomplishments and don’t let them forget how great of a partner they are. You might say, “I know you’re not feeling great right now, and that’s okay. I just want you to remember that this one bad day doesn’t define you. Remember how well you’ve been doing at work, and how good your art project is going?”"

      "content": "Capricorns are more practical than romantic. Your Capricorn partner might not show up with a dozen roses or sweep you off your feet for a surprise picnic. What they will do, though, is show love through practicalities: they might pack you a lunch before work or buy you a new keyboard when yours is broken. Keep an eye out for the little things that show they care. Repay that kindness by doing practical things for them, too. Pick up a new pair of shoelaces when you notice theirs are fraying, or grab milk on the way home when you notice they’re out. It really is the small stuff!"
