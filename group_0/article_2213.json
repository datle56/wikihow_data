      "title": "Drink only one alcoholic beverage an hour.",
      "content": "Drink only one alcoholic beverage an hour. A drink could be a shot, a beer, a glass of wine, or a mixed drink. Whatever it is, try and only drink one per hour. This will prevent you from getting drunk, since your liver can metabolize the alcohol and get it out of your system in an hour. If you stick to this schedule you'll be able to drink casually but stay sober. Sip your drink slowly. Try and enjoy it slowly instead of downing it."

      "title": "Set a limit for the night based on your alcohol tolerance.",
      "content": "Set a limit for the night based on your alcohol tolerance. Set your limit well in advance and stick to it. If you know that you're drunk after 3 beers, then you need to space those beers out far enough to avoid getting wasted. Everyone handles alcohol differently, so there is no perfect number to stick to. When in doubt, know that the recommended amounts are 3 drinks for men and 2 for women. Bring cash to the bar instead of a card, forcing you to stop drinking when you run out of money. Women will get drunk faster than men due to differences in body type. The more you weigh, the more alcohol you can generally consume before feeling drunk."

      "title": "Drink mindfully.",
      "content": "Drink mindfully. Drink for taste, not inebriation. Savor both the flavor and the aroma of the alcohol instead of downing it. Splurge on an expensive but extremely enjoyable drink, because it's going to be the only drink of the night. Whatever it is, appreciate its nuances slowly. Bring the glass to your lips every now and then and tilt it. Instead of drinking, however, simply inhale the aroma. Taste the drink as you swallow it. If it's not worth tasting then it's not worth drinking. Everyone has a different alcohol tolerance, so drink for yourself, not to prove something or keep up with a buddy."

      "content": "Drink water before, between, and after drinks. Water is proven to help alcohol absorption and breakdown and gives you something to drink before refilling your cup. [1] X Research source Aim to drink a glass of water before each drink, then have a glass between drinks as well. Sip the water slowly to put more time between alcoholic drinks. Reader Poll: We asked 223 wikiHow readers how they prefer to pace themselves while drinking, and 52% of them said drinking water in between alcoholic drinks. [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Stop drinking and eat something.",
      "content": "Stop drinking and eat something. Food, contrary to popular belief, does not prevent you from getting drunk. It can, however, slow down the time it takes the booze to make it to your brain. Eating also fills you up and prevents you from downing drinks in the interim. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Make mixed drinks yourself, diluting the alcohol.",
      "content": "Make mixed drinks yourself, diluting the alcohol. When drinking, stick to mixed drinks that you can control. You can, for example, use a half shot of alcohol instead of a full shot and fill the rest up with soda or mixer. This helps you stay involved in the party but prevents you from drinking too much too fast. Try a \"shandy,\" which is a light beer mixed with lemonade, to enjoy a little bit of alcohol responsibly."

      "title": "Have a partner.",
      "content": "Have a partner. See if a buddy is looking to drink the same amount as you and avoid getting drunk. You can look out for each other, gently cutting the other off if things seem to get out of hand. It also makes it easier to stay sober if everyone around you is getting sober, but you have your buddy on your level."

      "title": "Know what you're drinking.",
      "content": "Know what you're drinking. Do not just accept drinks, especially at parties. While one drink an hour is normally a good guideline, mixed drinks at house parties and events can vary wildly in strength. They are also sweetened so much that the actual alcohol content is masked. If you find yourself in this situation, stick to beer, wine, or mixing your own drinks. Don't mix types of alcohol, like liquor, beer, and wine, in the same night. It makes it much harder to know how much actual alcohol you're consuming. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Make moderation your best friend. At the end of the day, if alcohol is going into your body, you will get drunk. Once the chemicals are in your body, they have to naturally filter out through your liver, and they will head to the brain on the way through your blood. Drinking responsibly is your best bet. That said, the following tips should help you mitigate the effects a bit and prevent getting sloshed after a few beers."

      "title": "Eat greasy, fatty snacks while drinking.",
      "content": "Eat greasy, fatty snacks while drinking. Keep on knocking back some snacks, as the fat will help form a buffer against the alcohol. This makes the alcohol enter your body more slowly. Your waistline won't thank you, but your brain will. [4] X Research source Good options include: Fast Food Nuts Pizza Ice cream and milkshakes (dairy may also help slow down alcohol)."

      "content": "Eat a spoonful of yeast to negate some effects of the alcohol. A small spoonful of baker's yeast has been shown to break down alcohol the same way your liver does, preventing you from getting as drunk as you would without it. [5] X Research source Simply mix the yeast in with water or yogurt and down it before you start drinking. While the effects aren't enormous, they can potentially lower your blood alcohol content by 20-30%. [6] X Research source This will keep you from absorbing some of the alcohol, but it will not keep you from getting drunk by itself. Note, however, that there is some scientific debate about the effectiveness of using yeast."

      "title": "Build up a tolerance to alcohol over time.",
      "content": "Build up a tolerance to alcohol over time. The more regularly you drink, the faster your body will get used to the feeling of drunkenness. It will take more booze to feel drunk, allowing you to knock a few more back before feeling the spins. The more you drink, the greater your tolerance will be. Having a 1-2 glasses each night may make it easier to stay sober when drinking. Due to a wide variety of physical, mental, and social affects, it is not recommended that you drink purely to raise your tolerance. It can lead to health problems and alcohol addiction quickly."

    {
      "title": "Water down your drinks, especially mixed drinks.",
      "content": "Water down your drinks, especially mixed drinks. Put in more liquid and less alcohol. You'll still be able to drink, but you'll be able to space out the actual alcohol, keeping you soberer. You can even water down beer by mixing it with lemonade, crafting a \"shandy\" instead of a straight beer. Go alcohol free. There are many great alcohol-free beers and ciders and there are mocktails, sodas, juices, etc. that you can continue to enjoy guilt-free."

      "title": "Have a glass of milk before drinking, and another in the middle of the night.",
      "content": "Have a glass of milk before drinking, and another in the middle of the night. Dairy lines your stomach, making it less able to absorb alcohol. It will get into your body eventually, of course, but it will take a bit longer, allowing your liver to eliminate some of it before the rest hits your system. Carbonated beverages may disrupt this stomach lining, so it may not work with beer and cocktails with soda. Like many other methods, there is scientific debate on the effectiveness. But many stories attest to milk's positive effects."

      "title": "Be confident in your decision not to drink.",
      "content": "Be confident in your decision not to drink. Alcohol isn't for everyone, and it certainly isn't a \"healthy life choice.\" So don't feel like you are lame or unexciting because you don't want to drink. Understanding your own reasons not to drink will help you say no in even the trickiest situations. If you've made a decision not to drink, for whatever reason, stick to it. \"Just one drink\" is often the recipe for an unpleasant night. You do not owe anyone an explanation for why you don't want to drink. Alcohol is a recreational drug, not a way of life or philosophy. If you don't want to drink, then so be it."

      "content": "Avoid situations which frequently lead to drinking. Going to bars or house parties is like asking for temptation, especially if you are trying to quit drinking or are easily pressured. Suggest alternative events for your friends, find new places to hang out, and try and plan activities to do other than just sitting and drinking. You do not have to avoid all people who drink. Rather, make sure there won't be a strong drinking culture that could tempt you or lead others to pressure you to \"join the gang.\" Let your close friends know in advance that you are not drinking. Let them know why and ask them to help you stay sober so that they are on your side before the party starts. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn to say no quickly and confidently. When someone asks if you'd like a drink,the best response is a simple, firm \"No thank you.\" While this should be enough, oftentimes people will push you for an explanation or reason, or will plead with you to have a drink with them. You want a quick, direct, and honest \"no\" ready when offered. Make sure you make good eye contact and say your words clearly and firmly: [8] X Research source \"I don't drink anymore, thank you.\" \"I'm the designated driver tonight.\" \"I'm allergic to alcohol!\" is a great, joking way to lighten the mood when refusing."

      "content": "Hold another drink in your hand. This is often enough to convince people not to ask you to drink. It doesn't matter what it is, but sodas and other fizzy drinks are often great ways to imply that you're drinking without actually imbibing. Talk to the bartender ahead of time and let him know that you won't be drinking alcohol. Tip him/her anyway and thank them for soda and water. If someone is super persistent, just take the drink and leave it in your hand. Once you have the drink you should feel free to leave it without drinking, and most people won't know that it isn't simply a refilled glass"

      "content": "Find activities other than simply \"getting drunk. \" You're likely to drink a whole lot less when you're in a place with distractions such as food, games like bowling, darts or billiards, or going out to a show of concert. You're also more likely to forgo drinks if the lighting is up, the place isn't crowded, and you feel comfortable. Make sure people have something else to do or talk about and drinking will become a background activity, not the main event."

      "content": "Remove yourself from the situation if the pressure becomes too much. If the constant badgering to have a drink is beginning to ruin your night, it's time to go. Alcohol is not, and should not be, an activity by itself. If the only thing people are doing is getting drunk and they do not respect your decision to stay sober then you should leave."

      "content": "Find ways to avoid temptation. If you know you're going to want to drink more than you should, implement some methods to remind yourself to stop. Remember the reasons why you don't want to get drunk, and think about why a sober night is important to you. Some suggestions include: Use the rubber band flick trick. Wear a rubber band around your wrist. Every time you feel the temptation to drink, flick yourself back into making a conscious choice not to. Have a buddy remind you when enough is enough. This might be a buddy who doesn't drink or is good at knowing his or her own limits and stopping. Or it could be a family member. Remind yourself that the ultimate aim is to be healthy and happy and that this is the choice you have decided to make. You can tell other people this too, if they badger you. Distract yourself. Get up and dance, talk to someone for a while, or play a game of pool. Allow yourself different rewards, like a shopping spree, a favorite item of food, seeing a movie, or calling a friend long-distance, if you're able to refrain from alcohol."
