      "content": "Locate the studs behind the wall under your stairs. Hold a stud finder against your wall and turn it on. Slowly move the stud finder back and forth over your drywall until it beeps or a light turns on. Mark the location of the stud with a pencil so you know where it is later on. Continue across the wall under your stairs until you’ve located each of the studs. [1] X Research source Once you finish, the drawers will look like triangles or trapezoids since they go up to the stringer, or the angled support on your stairs. The drawers will pull straight out and have a large box for storage. If the area under your stairs doesn’t have drywall, then you can skip this step. If you don’t have a stud finder, then try knocking on the wall to find the stud. If you hear a hollow, echoing sound, then there isn’t a stud behind the wall. If the wall makes a solid thumping noise, then there is a stud."

      "content": "Use a drywall saw to cut out the drywall between the studs. Poke the end of the saw through the drywall so it lines up with the edge of one of the studs. Pull the saw down along the length of the stud until you reach the bottom. Continue cutting out the entire section of drywall between the studs until you can carefully pull it out of place. Keep removing other pieces of drywall between the other studs until you have enough spaces for the number of drawers you want to install. [2] X Research source You may also use a reciprocating saw to cut through the drywall faster. The height of the hole you cut out depends on how tall you want the drawers to extend."

      "content": "Install horizontal boards running from the bottom of the studs to the wall. Measure the distance from the back of the stud to the opposite side of the stairs to know what length you need for your supports. Cut 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) boards to the lengths you need and place them behind the studs so they are on their long, skinny sides. Place angle braces on top of each board so they’re next to the studs and screw them in using 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) screws. Secure the other side of the board to the studs on the opposite side. [3] X Research source You can buy angle braces from your local hardware store. Ask the employees at the store where you bought your wood to cut it for you if you don’t have the proper tools at home."

      "content": "Screw drawer runners onto the horizontal boards. Get drawer runners for each hole that can extend past the side of your stairwell and support up to 100 pounds (45 kg). Extend the runners fully to make sure they reach out past the drywall so you can access the drawers. Use 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) screws to secure one of the runners to the widest side of the horizontal support. Place another runner on the board across from it so it’s parallel with the first one. When you’re finished, each cut-out section between the studs will have 2 drawer runners along the bottom that are perpendicular to the drywall. [4] X Research source You can buy drawer runners from your local hardware or home improvement store. Make sure the drawer runners are perfectly level and in line with one another, or else they won’t slide open easily."

The parts of the drawer runners that extend out from the wall are too flimsy to hold a drawer on their own, so they need supports to keep them level. Measure the length of the runner section that extends out of the wall and cut enough 1 in × 3 in (2.5 cm × 7.6 cm) boards for each of the runners. Position the board on the extended part of the runner so the long narrow edge is on top and level. Screw the sides of the board into the runner using 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) screws. [5] X Research source If you try to attach drawers directly to the runners, they may bend or pull out of the studs."

Position the 1 in × 3 in (2.5 cm × 7.6 cm) supports along the front and back edges of the boards so they form a rectangle. Make sure the tops of the boards are perfectly level or else the drawer will teeter or rock when you try to set it. Screw the supports into each of the 1 in × 3 in (2.5 cm × 7.6 cm) boards attached to the runners. Continue adding supports to the rest of the drawers. [6] X Research source You can also add an additional support in the middle of the boards if you want, but it’s not required."

Measure the openings you cut out for your drawers with a tape measure so you know what dimensions you need for your drawers. Get enough 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) plywood so you can create boxes that sit on top of the 1 in × 3 in (2.5 cm × 7.6 cm) supports and extend to the back wall behind the stairs. Use a circular saw to cut through the wood along the outlines that you drew. [7] X Research source The exact sizes of the drawers depend on how tall you want them and how many you plan on adding. This build creates a single drawer between each stud, but you can construct shelves on top of them for additional storage space."

Put the bottom piece of the box on top of the frame and secure it in place with screws every 4–5 inches (10–13 cm) along the edge. Leave the top of the box open so you can access your belongings. [8] X Research source Set the box on top of the 1 in × 3 in (2.5 cm × 7.6 cm) supports and push it into the wall to make sure it fits inside of the hole snugly.

Medium-density fibreboard (MDF) is a lightweight wood that has a smooth finish and will make the end of your drawer look clean. Get a piece of MDF that’s 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) thick and use your circular saw to cut it down to the size you need for each opening in your wall. [10] X Research source You can get MDF from your local hardware or home improvement store. The employees at the store may be able to cut the MDF to size for you. You can also use regular plywood, but the wood grain will be visible when you’re finished."

Screw through the MDF every 6 inches (15 cm) to secure it to the front side of the drawer. When you’re finished, the drawer will have a smooth finish and be hidden when you close it. [11] X Research source Ask a helper to assist you to ensure the MDF doesn’t move around while you’re attaching it. You can choose to paint the MDF if you want, or leave it unfinished for a more rustic look. Screw handles or knobs onto the MDF if you want to make them easier to pull out."

Continue marking studs under the stairs so you know where you can place your box shelves.

Place the sides of the box directly on the edges of the studs so you can get the most storage. Take a few steps away from the wall and look at the layout of the boxes to see if you’re happy with it. Write down the dimensions of your boxes so you don’t forget them later. [13] X Research source You can make the boxes as short or tall as you want.

Once you cut out the full outline of the boxes, pull the drywall away from the wall. [14] X Research source You can get a drywall saw from your local hardware store.

Draw the pieces for all the boxes on your plywood so you can easily cut them out along the outlines. Put the wood on a flat surface and use a circular saw to cut out the pieces. [15] X Research source Wear safety glasses whenever you use power tools to protect your eyes. You may also use a handsaw to cut the wood, but it will take longer and the lines may be more crooked.

Place a flat piece of plywood on top of the frame and screw it along the edges to make the back of your shelf. Continue building the other boxes the same way.

Hold the drill perpendicular to the wood and drill 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) into the plywood. Place another hole at the same height as the first one so they’re 10–12 inches (25–30 cm) apart. Continue making parallel sets of holes every 3 in (7.6 cm) so they form straight lines. Repeat the process on the other side of the box so the holes line up across from one another.

Set the pins so they’re the same height as the shelves you want to make inside the box, and make sure the flat sides are parallel to the bottom.

Slide the plywood into the box so it rests on top of the shelf pins and fits snugly against the sides. Push down on top of the shelf to make sure it doesn’t wobble or come loose. [21] X Research source If the shelf wobbles, then check that the pins are at the same height. You can place as few or many shelves inside your box as you want."
