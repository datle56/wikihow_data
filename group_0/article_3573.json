      "content": "Find a website that offers “Lord” titles. Sites such as Elite Titles, Highland Titles, and Lord Titles all offer the opportunity of purchasing the title of Lord. You can find these websites by typing “purchase a Lord title” into your online search engine. Realize that these titles are just a novelty and don’t make you a legal Lord. [1] X Research source Under United Kingdom law, you're legally allowed to call yourself whatever you want as long as you aren't defrauding anyone or using the name change to evade some type of legal responsibility. Novelty titles do not grant you a seat in the House of Lords. Consider where your money goes. Some companies put the funds toward conservation work on specific estates [2] X Research source , so you're making a donation and receiving the novelty title in return."

      "content": "Choose a package including a title or plot of land. Some websites will simply send you a certificate with your new title on it, while others let you choose different sized plots of land or come with things like stationery, an ID card, or a commemorative medal. Click on the package once you’ve decided which one you want to purchase. [3] X Research source Each website has different pricing and gifts that come with their packages, costing between £18.95 and £995 ($28.97 and $1,521.29), so look at each one thoroughly to decide which is right for you. For example, look at different plots of land that come with your title at https://www.highlandtitles.com/buy-a-plot/ . You can visit and use your plot of land, but it will remain officially registered under the name of the company from which you purchased it. Look through the different title packages at https://www.lordtitles.co.uk/collections/lord-lady-title-packs ."

Once you’ve selected your package, you’ll be taken to a form to fill out information such as the name you’d like printed on your certificate, what you want to come in your package, and whether the title is being purchased as a gift. You’ll also fill out your payment information and address where the package will be shipped. [4] X Research source Double check the spelling of your name and information as you’re filling out the form so it appears correctly on your title. Be aware that you’ll be paying for the shipping cost as well."

Depending on where you live, it will take anywhere from 3-24 days to receive your title package in the mail. [5] X Research source If you need the title before it arrives in the mail, check your confirmation email to see if you’re able to download a PDF version. For example, if you live in the UK, it will take roughly 3 days to receive your title in the mail, while if you live in the United States or Canada, it will take 10-14 days."

      "content": "Bid on an open estate that comes with the title Lord. Sometimes estates will become available because their current owner is selling them. These types of estates often make the news, making it easier to find out which estates are for sale. The estates that come with the title of Lord are often millions of dollars, and the buyer is expected to preserve the estate just as it is. [6] X Research source To see if there are any estates for sale, type “lord estates for sale” or something similar into an online search engine. Know that these estates are very expensive and often go to millionaires."

They can recommend anyone they choose, though you’re more likely to be recommended if you’re a judge, bishop, or archbishop. [8] X Research source You can be nominated by regular members of the public, but the House of Lords Appointments Commission makes the ultimate recommendation."

To make yourself well known, you’ll need to have made distinct accomplishments or advancements that better the people. If you’re recommended to be part of the House of Lords, the King will confirm it. [9] X Research source Those who receive this title usually receive it for exemplary service to the country, and the title cannot be inherited by future generations. For example, Lord Garnier was appointed to the House of Lords for his work on topics such as Human Rights, while Lord Deben was appointed due to his focus on climate change and the environment."
