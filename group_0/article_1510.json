      "content": "Pluck and shape your eyebrows. Eyebrows help to define the shape of your eyes. Pluck your eyebrows to neaten them and, if you like, shape them by adding a gentle arch. Neat and well-shaped eyebrows open up the eye area, making them look larger. [1] X Research source Pluck from below your eyebrows, not from above. This will help open your eyes up and make them appear larger."

      "content": "Splash cold water on puffy eyes. Puffy eyes due to allergies, a fitful night of sleep or lack of sleep in general are very common. Unfortunately, puffy eyes make them look even smaller. Before you get started with makeup, splash your eye area gently with cold water, then pat dry. This can decrease puffiness. [2] X Research source You can also create a cold compress by filling a zip-lock baggie with ice and wrapping it inside a wash cloth. Apply the compress to your eye area for 10-15 minutes.

      "content": "Apply eye makeup primer. Primer helps your makeup last as long as possible by giving it something to stick to. Pat a thin layer of the primer onto your lids, working your way up to the eyebrow. If you plan to apply eyeshadow beneath your eyes (for instance, if you want to create a smoky eye look), apply primer there, as well. [4] X Research source If you don’t have any primer, use a thin layer of concealer instead. Follow it up with a dusting of translucent powder. This is an effective primer."

Select a concealer that’s one to two shades lighter than your skin tone. Apply it beneath your eyes in the shape of an upside down triangle. Use your fingers or a sponge to gently blend the concealer into your skin. [5] X Research source"

Use an eyeshadow brush to lightly apply a small amount of light-colored shimmery (not glittery) eyeshadow to the inner corners of both eyes. Use a white, nude or silver shimmer shadow for this. It only takes a small amount, so use a light touch. By using a lighter shade on the inner half of your eyes, you'll make them look more open and farther apart, which can make them seem larger.

Instead, use a nude or pale eyeliner pencil on your bottom waterline. Apply it from the inner corner of your eye all the way to the outer corner. [10] X Research source This will help make the whites of your eyes look like they're extended, giving you a doll-like appearance. [11] X Research source [v161376_b02]. 26 May 2020.

To open them up, line only the outer third of your eyes, and then blend the eyeliner. The starting place usually lines up directly above the pupil, but adjust for your needs (since eye shapes vary). Draw a soft line from there to the outer edge of the eye, then flick it out slightly at the end. [14] X Research source Line the outer third of your bottom lid, as well. To make the look more subtle, blend the liner or with a clean brush, cotton swab, or your finger. [15] X Research source [v161376_b02]. 26 May 2020."
