      "content": "Cut the broccoli head in half to separate the florets from the stem. Place the broccoli on a clean cutting board. Locate the part of the plant where the broccoli florets (i.e., the buds on the top) meet the stem. Cut the broccoli in half about an inch (approximately 2.5 cm) under this meeting point to separate florets from the stem."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the florets into bite-sized pieces.",
      "content": "Cut the florets into bite-sized pieces. Cut the stem that remains under the head of the broccoli vertically. Continue to cut it into smaller pieces until you are left with bite-sized florets. Try to make pieces that are similarly sized so that they cook evenly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Peel and cut the stem.",
      "content": "Peel and cut the stem. Using a paring knife, carefully remove any dark green leaves from the broccoli stalk. Use a vegetable peeler to strip away the outer layer of the stem, which is thick and difficult to eat. Use a sharp knife to cut the remaining stem into bite-sized pieces. Cut pieces of broccoli stems to be about the same size as the florets."

      "content": "Steam the broccoli for about five minutes. Allow your broccoli to steam in the pot for about five minutes, until you can pierce it with a fork. At that time, remove the pot from the burner and carefully lift off the lid. Spear a piece of broccoli with a fork to see if it is tender. [4] X Research source The fork should pierce through the broccoli with very little effort. If it does not, the broccoli is not finished cooking."

      "content": "Continue steaming the broccoli if needed. If your broccoli isn’t cooked through after five minutes, continue steaming it for one minute intervals. After a minute, test a piece of broccoli by piercing it with a fork. If it is still not cooked, continue steaming it and check it again after one minute. Checking the broccoli this frequently will prevent overcooking, which will leave it soft and mushy."

For each medium-sized head of broccoli that you use, add approximately 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) (1.5 oz.) of water to the dish. [5] X Research source The broccoli pieces do not need to be fully submerged. The steam created from the water will cook them."
