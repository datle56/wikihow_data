      "title": "Select two to three strands of hair.",
      "content": "Select two to three strands of hair. These are the strands that you are going to braid. You may pick strands on one side of your head or at the back of your head. It may be easier to start with strands on one side. Pick thin strands if you are using narrow beads and thicker strands if the beads are wide in diameter. [1] X Research source You may braid the strands a bit so the bead sits in the middle of the braid. Alternatively, you can put the bead in your hair first and then braid the rest of your hair."

      "title": "Tie the floss around the strands.",
      "content": "Tie the floss around the strands. Loop the floss around two to three strands of your hair. Then, tie the floss around the strands. Make a simple knot with the floss. [2] X Research source The strands should form a V-shape, if they are not already braided."

      "title": "Thread the ends of the floss through the bead.",
      "content": "Thread the ends of the floss through the bead. Slide the bead through the ends of the floss. Pull the bead down so it sits just above where the floss is tied onto your hair. You may start with plastic craft beads that are narrow and round. Over time, you can try using professional metal beads that are larger or narrower."

      "title": "Pull the floss and your hair through the bead.",
      "content": "Pull the floss and your hair through the bead. Pull the bead through the floss until it slides onto your hair. Gently pull your hair through the bead along with the floss. Your hair may make a “pop” sound as you slide it through the bead. If your hair does not slide through the bead with the floss easily, you may need to use a wider bead or use less hair in the braid. Start over with a wider bead or less hair."

    {
      "title": "Use an elastic to secure the bead.",
      "content": "Use an elastic to secure the bead. Once the bead slides onto your hair, remove the floss and use a clear elastic band to secure the bead to your hair. You can then slide the bead over the elastic to keep it in place. Alternatively, if your hair is thick enough, you may not need an elastic to secure the bead."

    {
      "title": "Braid around the bead.",
      "content": "Braid around the bead. Once the bead is secure, braid the rest of your hair and secure it with an elastic. You can also add more beads and then braid your hair, if you’d like. [3] X Research source Try braiding half way down your hair, then secure a bead, and continue braiding. Vary the types of braids you use in your hair, integrating beads as you go."

Leave half of the braid undone if you'd like the bead to appear in the middle of the braid. Finish the braid and leave the bottom undone if you'd like the bead to appear at the end of the braid."

Clip the bead pin to your braid and slide the bead over it so it stays put."
