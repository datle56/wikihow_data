[2] X Research source For example, if the stain is over a large area of the carpet, you might need the whole batch of solution. If the stain is only about 1 in (2.5 cm) wide, then you may only need 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of the solution."

Since slime stains on a wall can be especially stubborn, it is best to create a paste of baking soda, water, and vinegar to remove it. Mix together 4 tbs of baking soda, 1 tbs of water, and 1 tbs of vinegar. This should form a thick paste that you can apply to the stain on the wall. If the paste is too thick to spread, add 1 to 2 teaspoons of water to thin it. If the paste is too thin, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (14.8 to 29.6 ml) of baking soda to thicken it."

Throw away the paper towel with the baking soda paste when you are done. Repeat this as many times as needed to remove the stain on the wall."
