      "title": "Choose your thread.",
      "content": "Choose your thread. Before you can begin tatting, you will need to find a thread that you’d like to work with. Size 10 cotton crochet thread is a great choice for beginners because it is not too fine and it will not snag as easily as other threads. However, you can go with another kind of thread that appeals to you if you prefer. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that a small number on a thread size means it is actually wider than another thread with a larger number thread size. For example, a size 10 thread will be larger than a size 40 thread. Stick to a size 10 or 20 thread when you are just starting out. This will be easier to see. As your skills improve, you can move to finer threads, such as a size 50."

      "title": "Select a shuttle.",
      "content": "Select a shuttle. You also need a shuttle to tat. A shuttle is a spool with two pointed ends that are open, but that only allow the thread to pass through when you tug on it. This will help you to control the thread as you tat. Shuttles can be a little difficult to find. Check your local craft supply stores or buy a tatting shuttle online. The most common and budget friendly type of shuttle is a simple plastic one, which is a great choice if you are a beginner. You can also find shuttles that are made of wood or bone, but they are more expensive and the only benefit of these is that they may feel nicer in your hand while you are working. However, these shuttles work the same way as the less expensive plastic ones."

      "title": "Get a pair of scissors.",
      "content": "Get a pair of scissors. You will need to cut the thread regularly while tatting. Make sure that you have a sharp pair of scissors handy."

    {
      "title": "Be prepared to use your hands a lot.",
      "content": "Be prepared to use your hands a lot. The only other tool you use for tatting is your hands. Both of your hands will be engaged when you are tatting. You may want to remove your jewelry to keep it from snagging on the thread."

      "title": "Insert the thread through the hole in the center of the shuttle.",
      "content": "Insert the thread through the hole in the center of the shuttle. The shuttle has a small hole in the center of it which you will use to start threading your shuttle. Insert the thread through the hole and pull it out by a couple of inches (about 5cm) on the other side. Then, place one finger over the hole to hold the thread in place. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wrap the thread around the center of the shuttle.",
      "content": "Wrap the thread around the center of the shuttle. With your finger still on the thread, begin to wind the thread around the spool. Do this a few times to secure the thread, and then remove your finger and keep wrapping. Wind the thread around and around the spool until the thread is nearly even with the outside of the shuttle. [3] X Research source Do not wind the thread so much that it extends out past the edge of the shuttle."

      "content": "Hold the shuttle in your right hand. Grasp the shuttle at its center with the thumb and index finger of your right hand. It is important to hold the shuttle this way so that the thread can flow freely and unwind as you work. [5] X Research source Do not hold the shuttle by the sides or tips because this may prevent you from unwinding the thread."

It is important to grip the thread in this way so that your other fingers will be free to move the thread around as needed. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Spread out your fingers.",
      "content": "Spread out your fingers. Once you have a piece of thread pressed firmly between your thumb and index finger, spread out your other three fingers as if you are forming an “OK” sign. Then, loop the thread around these fingers to form a loop and press the other end of the thread between your index finger and thumb to secure the loop.

      "content": "Insert the shuttle through the loop. When you are just starting out with tatting, you will need to learn how to do double stiches. This is a very basic stitch that only requires a couple of different movements. The first movement is to insert the shuttle through the loop you have created. Pass the shuttle right through the center of the loop. [8] X Research source Double stitches are usually abbreviated as “ds” in tatting patterns."

As you do so, come downwards slightly with the shuttle and bring it through the new loop. Then, pull the thread to tighten the knot you just created. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a chain of double stitches . Once you know how to double stitch, you can use this important tatting skill to create basic tatting designs. To make a chain, you will be working double stitches onto a piece of thread instead of into a circle. You will need to hold a second piece of thread next to your circle to work in a chain. The stitches you work onto the thread will become your chain."

      "content": "Learn how to make rings . Rings are another basic skill in tatting. You can easily make a ring once you know how to double stitch. To make a ring, all you have to do is keep making double stitches around your circle. When the circle reaches the desired size, you can pull the tail to tighten it."

      "content": "Include some picots . To make a picot, begin making a double stitch, but pinch a portion of the thread before you pull the thread to tighten the stitch. This will leave a loop extending from the double stitch. You can make your picots as small or as large as you like."

      "title": "Choose your first project.",
      "content": "Choose your first project. Once you have mastered the basic skills of tatting, try choosing a beginner level project to work on. You can pick up a book of tatting patterns to start with, or look for a beginner level pattern online. After making a lace, you can attach it to a piece of cloth of your choice. You will need a thinner sewing machine needle to work. Use a poly blend thread stronger than cotton. Make sure your machine is set on the sewing setting to work on lace."

      "content": "Practice often and be patient. Tatting is a precise, slow art form. Any project you choose will take some time to make and you may make some mistakes along the way. Be patient and practice your new hobby for a little while every day. Try pulling out your tatting while you are waiting for the bus, taking a break at work or school, or during your spare time at home. With time and practice, you will notice your skills getting better every day."
