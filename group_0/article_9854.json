      "content": "Poke holes in the squash with a fork. Poking holes in the squash will allow steam to escape while the squash cooks in the microwave. Just like a potato, the squash needs to be able to vent while it cooks. Your holes don’t need to be more than 0.25 inches (6.4 mm) in, so don't worry if the squash is too hard to stab the fork very far. If you pierce the skin at all, steam will escape. Space the holes a few inches apart; you don’t need more than 15-20 holes."

This will soften the squash, which will help you cut it. Don't worry if you can't fit the whole squash onto one dish; it's fine if it sticks out."

      "content": "Cut the squash from top to bottom. Using a sharp chef's knife or serrated knife, cut the squash into 2 equal halves with a sawing motion. Cutting the squash will help it cook faster. When using your knife, hold the handle with your middle, ring and pinky finger, while using your thumb and index finger to hold the blade itself. This is called a \"blade grip\" and offers more control and balance than using all of your fingers to hold the handle. [3] X Research source"

Place the butternut squash halves flesh-side down on a microwave-safe dish. Again, the halves can be larger than the dish."

If it needs more time, put it in for another 5 minutes. The squash should be tender enough that you can stick a fork all the way through it."

      "content": "Cut off the top and bottom of the squash. Using a sharp chef’s knife or a serrated knife, saw the knife back and forth until the top inch and the bottom inch (2 centimeters) of the butternut squash are gone. Discard these pieces. When cutting a squash, hold your knife's handle with your middle, ring and pinky finger. Use your thumb and index finger to balance the blade. The \"blade grip\" offers more control and balance than a normal grip. Since butternut squash is circular, it has a tendency to roll around on the cutting board. Stabilize the squash with your non-dominant hand before cutting into it, and curl your non-dominant fingers under your palm in order to make a claw shape, pressing down on the squash with the first joints of your fingers.

Cut evenly through the piece so that the slices come out as perfect circles. To make the cubes, cut 2 or 3 evenly-spaced slices across the width of the circle. Then turn the circle and cut it again. This will create a cube shape. Remember that the cubes don't have to be perfect. Keep the irregular pieces to cut down on food waste."
