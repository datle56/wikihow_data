      "content": "Why is my Brother printer not connecting to Wi-Fi? There are a number of reasons you may not be able to get your printer to connect to Wi-Fi. These reasons are: Your printer is out of Wi-Fi range. To fix this, try moving your printer closer to your router or access point to see if that solves the issue. The network settings are incorrect. Make sure you selected the correct Wi-Fi network from the list of SSIDs, and ensure the password was typed in correctly (they are case-sensitive). There is a software issue with your printer. If this is the case, run the Full Driver & Software Package application and update your printer's drivers and firmware. If you don't have this software, go to Brother's support site , search for your printer model, then download and install the application. According to Luigi Oppido, computer and tech specialist, reinstalling printer drivers can fix a lot of problems, as they often install incorrectly the first time. \"Go through the setup like you just got the printer and nine times out of 10 you're back up and running,\" Oppido says."
