      "title": "Horizontal arrangement",
      "content": "Horizontal arrangement Create a horizontal grouping for a versatile look. Horizontal groupings work best for pictures of equal size. Arrange the three pictures horizontally side by side, either on their own or above a piece of furniture such as a couch for an accent. If you’re placing them above furniture, leave about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) of space between the bottoms of the pictures and the tops of the furniture. [1] X Research source Make sure that the space between each picture is even for a horizontal grouping. Around 3 inches (7.6 cm) is a good place to start, and you can adjust the spacing according to what you prefer. Try to space them no more than 6 inches (15 cm) apart. If you’re hanging your pictures on a wall by themselves, a good rule of thumb is to hang the pictures about 57 to 60 inches (140 to 150 cm) above the floor. If you’re using photos of family members, place a group photo between duo or solo portraits. If you’re arranging scenery photos, put the most captivating image in the center."

      "title": "Vertical arrangement",
      "content": "Vertical arrangement Form a vertical grouping in a narrow space. Make sure that all of the pictures are of the same size, and arrange them in a vertical line with 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) between each frame. [2] X Research source Vertical groupings look good on a tall, narrow wall, or in between windows. This arrangement will help the ceiling to look higher than it is, making your space look larger and more open. Hang your favorite picture in the center. The piece that is in the center of a horizontal or vertical grouping will be noticed first. It will also receive the most attention. Spotlight your favorite of the bunch."

      "title": "Triangle arrangement",
      "content": "Triangle arrangement Use a triangle arrangement for pictures of different sizes. If the pictures aren't the same size, place the largest piece in the bottom left of the gallery space. Hang the middle-sized picture in the top right and the smallest picture in the bottom right. This will create a sideways triangle appearance, with the largest picture representing the base, and the other two pictures representing the points. Place the largest picture approximately 57 inches (140 cm) high. This is the height that many art galleries hang their work at because it’s the average height of the human eye. [3] X Research source Salerno suggests matching frames to the pictures, not the walls or furniture. “You may change your furniture or paint your walls, but you’re probably going to have this piece of art for the rest of your life,” he explains."

      "title": "Diagonal arrangement (for stairs)",
      "content": "Diagonal arrangement (for stairs) Hang three square frames diagonally along a staircase. Hang the first picture in the center of the staircase, 52 inches (130 cm) up from the stairs. Measure one hand-width apart to the right and left and place the other images on each side. Make sure each image is 52 inches (130 cm) above the stair step that’s below it. 52 inches (130 cm) above the stairs is the ideal height to ensure that the picture is at the correct angle with the staircase. [4] X Research source Staircase arrangements work best for equally sized, square pictures. Placing differently sized pictures above a staircase may look disjointed since they’re already unbalanced before you stagger them."

      "title": "Contrast arrangement",
      "content": "Contrast arrangement Select a group of pictures that share a common element and scale them to three different sizes for an interesting arrangement on the wall. Arrange them eclectically in whatever grouping feels right to you. Try to avoid a horizontal or vertical arrangement that goes from largest to smallest, as that might appear unbalanced. [5] X Research source Experiment with different placements until you find the one you love."

      "title": "Split image (triptych) arrangement",
      "content": "Split image (triptych) arrangement Split one image across three canvases to make the most of your favourite picture. This could be a favorite family photo, a landscape, or an art print. Head to your local photo printing or department store and get the image split into three equally sized canvases. Arrange them horizontally so the whole image is visible. This arrangement is known as a triptych. [6] X Research source You don’t need to use canvases—this can work for photographs in frames. Just account for the frame border when splitting up the image. Beach scenes and landscapes work especially well when split across three canvases."

      "title": "Eclectic arrangement",
      "content": "Eclectic arrangement Mix photos, art, and objects to create an eclectic statement wall. Place your three pictures horizontally or in a triangular arrangement. Surround them with artwork and wall-mounted objects. [7] X Research source Example objects to include are mirrors, skis, baking items like spoons, small instruments, and hammers. When you’re hanging many pictures in a grid or other cluster arrangement, Salerno advises having two contact points between each picture and the wall to make them more stable and secure."

      "title": "Pyramid arrangement",
      "content": "Pyramid arrangement Hang your photos so that the right- and left-side pictures are across from each other and the central photo is between and above them. The result resembles a pyramid. Create an inverted pyramid arrangement by placing the right- and left-side pictures on the top row, with a central photo between and below them. Stick to the conventional distance of about 2 inches (5.1 cm) between each picture, or space them out further for a more dramatic visual."

      "title": "Different orientations arrangement",
      "content": "Different orientations arrangement Place your three pictures in a horizontal arrangement, but use different orientations to create a dynamic look. The easiest option is to choose a landscape (horizontal) photo for the central picture, flanked by two photos in portrait (vertical) orientation."

      "title": "Choose a common element for the three pictures to share.",
      "content": "Choose a common element for the three pictures to share. Look for pictures that have similar tones, patterns, or contexts. They don’t necessarily have to match exactly. Black and white photographs, deep blue tones, or floral patterns all make great themed groupings. [8] X Research source Pictures that don’t share anything in common can look mismatched and misplaced."

      "title": "Group pieces with the same dimensions to create a sense of balance.",
      "content": "Group pieces with the same dimensions to create a sense of balance. These can be canvases of the same size or frames of the same dimensions. Pieces that are the same size have a balanced and calm look. [9] X Research source Try using frames that are identical in both size and appearance for an even greater sense of balance and homogeneity. When hanging artwork , Salerno recommends spacing each piece 1.5 to 3.5 inches (3.8 to 8.9 cm) apart."

      "title": "Find pictures that complement the paint or wallpaper.",
      "content": "Find pictures that complement the paint or wallpaper. While the content and size of the pictures are important when deciding how to group them, remember to consider the space, too. Black-and-white pictures might look washed out when hung on a brightly colored wall. Conversely, you can spruce up a plain white wall with large, colorful pictures. [10] X Research source If you have vintage-looking wallpaper in the area you’re planning to hang the pictures, put black-and-white photographs or retro artwork for a cohesive theme. Use nail-free hanging methods to avoid damaging walls, especially if you’re renting your apartment or house."
