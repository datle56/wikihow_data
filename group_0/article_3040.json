      "title": "Show her that you care about what she has to say.",
      "content": "Show her that you care about what she has to say. Let’s say you’re chatting with someone, but they’re constantly glancing around and checking their phone. You’d feel like they didn’t care about what you had to say, right? The same logic applies when you’re talking with a girl (or anyone, for that matter!). Eye contact shows that you’re paying close attention and that you care about what she’s talking about. As a good rule of thumb, make eye contact 4-5 seconds at a time for about 70% of your conversation. That way, it won’t seem like you’re staring at her. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Cursing won’t help you make a good impression on her.",
      "content": "Cursing won’t help you make a good impression on her. Keep your day-to-day vocab as clean as possible, even if she tends to cuss a lot. Good manners are also really important—“please” and “thank you” mean a lot more than you may think!"

      "title": "Authentic questions are a great way to greet a woman like a gentleman.",
      "content": "Authentic questions are a great way to greet a woman like a gentleman. One-liners like “How much did it hurt when you fell from heaven?” will only earn you an eye-roll, not a genuine conversation. Instead, focus on getting to know her with genuine, creative questions. You could ask: “Would you rather live in the mountains or on the beach?” “What’s your absolute favorite place in the whole world?” “If you could instantly master something, what would it be?”"

      "title": "Gentlemen appreciate what’s beneath the surface.",
      "content": "Gentlemen appreciate what’s beneath the surface. Superficial comments feel… well, superficial. Complimenting a girl on her hair or outfit is nice, but it might come off the wrong way. Instead, say something that isn’t related to her looks, like: “You did such a great job with that presentation.” “You have such a nice laugh.” “You’re such a kind person.”"

      "title": "Active listening skills really set a gentleman apart from other guys.",
      "content": "Active listening skills really set a gentleman apart from other guys. Repeat what she says in your own words, so you know that you’re on the same page. If she’s having a pretty rough day, say something validating to show that you understand, rather than giving unsolicited advice. Ask some questions, too, to prove that you’re really paying attention.

      "title": "This proves that you value her opinions and thoughts.",
      "content": "This proves that you value her opinions and thoughts. Always let her finish what she has to say and don’t interrupt her, even if you have something great to add. Nobody enjoys talking to someone who doesn’t let them get a word in. Waiting your turn to speak also helps you look a lot more trusting and reliable."

      "title": "Referencing a previous convo shows that you care about her.",
      "content": "Referencing a previous convo shows that you care about her. Does her pet bulldog have an upcoming trip to the vet, or is she cramming for a bio test on Thursday? Remembering the little things about her life shows how caring and considerate you are, and that you really listen to what she has to say. [3] X Research source You might ask: “How did Buddy’s vet appointment go the other day?” “Did you survive that test? When do you get your scores back?” “I remember you mentioning that you liked the Red Sox, so I figured you’d find this article interesting.”"

      "title": "Humility is a far more attractive quality than arrogance.",
      "content": "Humility is a far more attractive quality than arrogance. No one wants to spend time around someone who’s always tooting their own horn. There’s nothing wrong with being proud of your achievements and accomplishments, but try to talk with her about them in a down-to-earth way. Instead of bragging about a goal you scored during a hockey game, credit the victory to the entire team. Instead of showing off the grade you got on a group project, compliment your team members who also contributed."

      "title": "Real gentlemen don’t always have to be right.",
      "content": "Real gentlemen don’t always have to be right. Try to look at things from her perspective, and see if you can find some common ground. At the end of the day, everyone is entitled to their opinion. Even if you don’t agree with her, you might say: “Wow, I never thought of it like that!” “That’s a really good point.” “I can definitely see where you’re coming from.”"

      "content": "You don’t want to accidentally offend her during your conversation. Don’t bring up politics, religion, or any other potentially controversial topics. Instead, chat about fun, light-hearted topics that definitely won’t ruffle any feathers. You might talk about: Her favorite vacation spots Whether Coke or Pepsi is the superior soda Her favorite sports teams The tastiest ice cream flavor"

      "content": "It’s not very polite to keep her waiting. This doesn’t mean that you have to get back to her within 10 seconds, but it’s not a good idea to wait hours or days to hit the “call” or “send” button. Prompt replies not only show that you’re interested, but that you also value her time."

      "title": "Crude messages and pictures definitely won’t make a good impression.",
      "content": "Crude messages and pictures definitely won’t make a good impression. Stick to light-hearted jokes and funny memes as you break the ice. Dirty jokes—or worse, dirty pictures—won’t paint you in a very positive light. Sending clean texts is a great way to show how much you respect her."

      "title": "Punctuality shows that you value her time.",
      "content": "Punctuality shows that you value her time. No girl wants to wait for 15, 20, or even 30 minutes for a guy to show up for something. Always do your best to be on time, or even early, if you can. If you do end up running rate, be sure to shoot her a text and let her know what’s going on."

      "content": "A shower, a comb, and a sharp outfit can make a big difference. Don’t worry—being a gentleman doesn’t mean breaking the bank on designer clothes and cologne! A simple, clean-cut outfit is more than enough to help you make a good impression, and it’ll definitely distinguish you from other guys who don’t put as much thought and care into how they look. Go the extra mile by swishing some mouthwash before heading out for the day."

      "title": "No woman wants to play second fiddle to your calls and texts.",
      "content": "No woman wants to play second fiddle to your calls and texts. Keep your phone on vibrate or silent when you spend time with her. Leave any calls, texts, and other notifications alone until your date is over. Constantly texting or using your phone during your get-together will only paint you in a negative light."

      "title": "A quick text really shows how much you care.",
      "content": "A quick text really shows how much you care. As you part ways, estimate how long it’ll take her to make it back home after her date. Then, shoot her a quick “Make it home okay?” or “Hope you made it home safe!” text after that amount of time has passed. You can also ask her to text you when she gets home."

      "content": "This date night gesture shows that you really care about her. Chances are, you and her won’t run into any trouble when you head up to her front door. Still, sticking around shows that you care about her safety and wellbeing, which really means a lot."

      "content": "Chivalry is a great way to flirt like a gentleman. Maybe you’re both walking into school at the same time, or you happen to be heading into the same coffee shop. Whatever the case, holding the door open for her helps you make a great impression, and shows that you don’t mind putting other people’s needs above your own. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a good impression when the weather gets chilly. Stuck outside waiting for the bus? Offer her your hoodie, jacket, or whatever extra layer you’re wearing at the time—just make sure it’s clean first! Fewer things are more gentlemanly than literally offering her the shirt off your back. You don’t have to turn your gesture into a pick-up line or anything. Just say something like, “Wow, it sure is a cold one. Wanna borrow my jacket?”"

      "content": "This chivalrous move makes a big impact on a date. If you’re heading to a restaurant or even just a cafe, pull out her chair before she starts to sit down. She’ll appreciate your thoughtfulness and willingness to put other people first."

      "content": "This simple act carries a lot of weight. Maybe you spot a girl struggling with her bag, or you see someone juggling a lot of textbooks and notebooks. Jump to her aid and see if you can take an item or 2 off her hands. Remember: being a true gentleman isn’t just about helping a lady in need—it’s about being kind, generous, and thoughtful to anyone who needs help, regardless of their age or gender."

      "content": "This makes you a physical shield between her and the street. Sure, you’re probably not going to run into any crazy drivers while you’re walking down the sidewalk together, but it’s the thought that counts. If nothing else, this gesture shows that you value her safety over your own—it doesn’t get much more gentlemanly than that!"
