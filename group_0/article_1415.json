      "content": "Press 2 strips together until you hear them click. Command Picture Hanging Strips come in 2 identical pieces that have an adhesive on one side and a hook-and-loop-like fastener on the other. Separate the strips if they’re connected along the edge by pulling them apart slowly. Then, line up the fastener side of one strip with the other, and push the strips together until you hear a click. You’ll usually need 4 pairs of strips (8 strips total) to securely hang a picture, so prep a few additional strips as well. [1] X Research source Picture Hanging Strips come in multiple sizes that each have different weight and size limits. Double-check the weight and size of the picture frame you’re hanging and choose the strips that match."

      "content": "Attach the strips to the back of the picture frame. Peel off the liner covering the adhesive on one of the strips you’re using. Place the sticky side of the strip down on the back of the frame in the top corner, and press it down firmly so the rounded tab points down. Place another set of strips in the other top corner the same way. Place the 2 remaining sets of strips about ⅔ of the way down the picture frame on each side. [2] X Research source If your picture frame already has hanging hardware on it, remove the pieces first to ensure it mounts flush with your wall. Avoid placing the strips on paper, fabric, or soft surfaces on the back of your picture frame because the adhesive may not form a strong bond or the material could tear. Avoid using Picture Hanging Strips to put up valuable items or clocks just in case the adhesive fails."

      "content": "Remove the liners and press the frame on a clean wall. Take off the rest of the liners from the strips on the back of the frame. Wipe the wall with rubbing alcohol to clean off any residue first. Once the surface is dry, push the frame against the wall and hold it firmly in place for 30 seconds so the adhesive has time to bond. [3] X Research source Command strips typically work best on smooth wall surfaces, like drywall, wood, tile, metal, glass, or laminate. However, they may not adhere properly to textured walls, vinyl, wallpaper, brick, fabric, or other rough surfaces. If you want to be precise about where you’re hanging your picture frame, measure and mark the wall beforehand. Command strips don't typically hold up well in humid environments, like bathrooms.

      "content": "Remove the frame and press the strips again for better adhesion. Hold onto the bottom corners of the frame, and gently lift it up toward you to separate it from the strips on the wall. Then, press against each of the wall strips for another 30 seconds to help them stick to the surface even better. [5] X Research source Avoid using a lot of force to remove the frame, or you may loosen the strips on the wall. Avoid hanging command strips directly above a heater since the heat could melt the adhesive and cause them to fall. [6] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020."

      "content": "Let the strips cure for 1 hour before reattaching your frame. During the first hour after applying your Command strips, leave them alone so the adhesive can fully bond with the wall. After that, align the strips on the back of the frame with the ones on the wall. Push the frame firmly onto the wall strips until you hear the strips click together. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Attach the red side of the Command strip to the back of the hook. Look for the side of the Command strip that has the red liner over the adhesive and peel it off. Line up the strip’s adhesive with the flat rectangular plate on the backside of the hook so the rounded pull tab is on the bottom. Press firmly along the length of the strip from the top downwards to attach it to the hook. [8] X Research source Indoor strips work well for temperatures between 50–105 °F (10–41 °C) while outdoor strips stay adhered between −20–105 °F (−29–41 °C) [9] X Research source Command Hooks come in multiple sizes, and larger hooks have a higher weight limit. Check the weight limit of each hook and the item you plan on hanging from it to ensure it will hold properly."

Clean the wall off with rubbing alcohol to get rid of dirt or dust, and then press the hook firmly onto the surface once it's dry. Hold the hook against the surface for 30 seconds to help make the adhesive bond securely. [10] X Research source Command Hooks work best on smooth surfaces, like drywall, wood, glass, or metal. Soft or irregular surfaces, like fabric, wallpaper, vinyl, and textured walls, could prevent the adhesive from sticking and cause the hook to fall down."

Then, push against the base against the wall with firm pressure for another 30 seconds. [11] X Research source Pressing the mounting base directly ensures that the adhesive will bond with maximum strength."

      "content": "Reattach the hook and let the adhesive set for 1 hour. Position the hook above the mounting base, and slide it down to reconnect it. Leave the hook alone for about 1 hour so the adhesive can create a strong bond and support the full weight of the item you’re hanging up. [12] X Research source If you’re worried about someone hanging an item by the hook before the adhesive sets, just wait until after an hour passes to reattach it to the base."

Clean the section of wall where you want to place the hook with rubbing alcohol to remove the dust and let it dry. Then, peel off the black liner labeled “Wall side” on the strip. Then, just press the strip against the wall firmly for about 30 seconds so the rounded pull tab points down. [13] X Research source Clear hooks are transparent and have see-through strips so they’re less noticeable on your wall. Clear hooks work best on hard, flat surfaces, like drywall, wood, tile, or glass. They do not work well on textured or soft surfaces, like wallpaper, brick, or fabric. Choose strips and hooks that have a weight limit that fully supports the item that you want to hang up."

Command Adjustables have workable adhesive that lets you reposition the strips a few times before they stick completely. Simply peel a strip off of the backing sheet and press it firmly for 5 seconds into the corner or along the edge of the object you’re hanging. Place a strip in each corner of the object for a more secure hold. [16] X Research source Adjustables are made to hang lightweight objects, such as posters, string lights, or other small paper decorations that aren’t in frames. About 4 strips can support 1 ⁄ 4 pound (110 g) of weight."
