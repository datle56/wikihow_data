      "content": "Try to trade with someone for their Arceus. This is the only legitimate way to get an Arceus in Diamond or Pearl. Arceus was available for a limited time as a reward for attending a Nintendo event in 2009 and 2010. It is now no longer possible to get an Arceus unless you trade for one or cheat to get one. Since Arceus is super rare, you'll likely need to offer up some big names to get your hands on one. Get ready to trade your most valued Pokémon, including Landorus or Deoxys. Shiny Legendary Pokémon such as a Shiny Mew can also make good trade offers."

You can use an Action Replay to cheat on your DS system, or you can use an emulator's built-in cheat tools to cheat when playing on your computer. You can transfer your save file from your DS to a computer (and vice versa) by using a flash cart like an R4 or Cyclo. See Mod a Nintendo DS with an R4 Flashcart for details on using a flash cart to access your DS files."

You can complete the National Pokédex by beating the Elite Four and seeing all 150 Pokémon from the Sinnoh Pokédex. You don't need to capture all 150, just encounter them. See Select the Best Pokémon to Beat the Elite Four in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl for tips on building the best Pokémon party to take on the Elite Four."

This means it will be one of the toughest fights you encounter in the entire game. Make sure your team is up to the task, and that you have a large selection of Poké Balls to throw at it. You may want to consider using your Master Ball on Arceus to capture it instantly. Having a Pokémon with False Swipe can make it easier to lower Arceus's health without knocking it out. Having a Pokémon with Sleep or Paralyze can make Arceus easier to catch as well."
