      "content": "Trade t-shirts for dresses and skirts. The easiest way to start looking more girly is to wear a dress or skirt. The loose, flowing silhouette will give you an instantly fresh look and you’ll be comfortable as well as stylish. There are many different cuts and shapes so you can find a style that fits you best. [1] X Research source You don’t need to wear a dress or skirt every single day, but at least once or twice a week will help you look and feel more feminine. Wear leggings or short spandex shorts under a dress or skirt if you’re worried about flashing anyone. Cover up with a cardigan or light sweater if the weather is chilly. Sit with your knees together, whether you cross your legs or keep them side by side. This is ladylike as well as modest."

      "content": "Update your wardrobe’s color scheme. Wear lighter colors with pastel or vibrant hues such as yellow, pink, blue, red, or purple. Navy, brown, and gray are all good neutrals for one article of clothing in an outfit, but using these as an overall outfit color is more manly than feminine. Black is a good accent color, but it’s best to pair it with a hot pink or another bright color. Don’t break the bank by getting rid of everything you own and buying a whole new wardrobe. Go through your closet and look for tops and bottoms you already have that can be paired together for girly outfits. Wear darker materials and colors for the fall and winter and bright linens and cotton for spring and summer. Incorporate pink into your daily style. It is a color that is traditionally girly and adds some feminine flair. Pick out a new pink top or a pair of heels to give any outfit a pop of color. [2] X Research source You don’t need to redo your whole closet and room with pink. Just add little hints of color with lipgloss or a belt to start. There are more shades than just hot pink. Ease yourself into the color with raspberry-colored accessories or a purple phone case."

      "title": "Begin wearing makeup.",
      "content": "Begin wearing makeup. Start with a simple makeup routine: foundation, a little blush, mascara, and lipstick or gloss. These all frame your face and give you an instant feminine flair. Eyeliner and lipstick require a little more finesse with the application but can have a more grown-up effect. [3] X Research source Start small if you’re worried about all of a sudden showing up places with makeup. Don’t cake on any products. Smearing too much eyeshadow and lipgloss on will make you look like a clown, unfortunately. Waterproof mascara and eyeliner are great options if you’re juggling sports with a social life. Match your foundation to your skin color. Test out colors in the store by dabbing some on your neck to check the color. Do not test on your hand because hands are often a different shade from your neck, resulting in you buying the wrong color. Play around with different colors for your lips and eyes. Some days you might want an understated color that matches your features or you could go with bright, daring colors for a night out or special event."

      "content": "Wear fitted pants or leggings. Stay away from sweatpants and gym clothes when you decide against a dress or skirt. Skinny or flared jeans look great with most shoes and can be flattering to most body shapes. Leggings are a modest solution to short skirts and dresses as well. Or, you can wear leggings on their own if you want a more fitted pants option. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Ditch the sneakers. Sneakers should be reserved for working out and sports only. Wearing shoes that have a slight heel to them will elevate your legs and rear and give your calves a workout. You'll also look taller and improve your posture. [5] X Research source Be creative while trying out different shoe types such as gladiator sandals, boots, and other kinds of footwear that have a stacked heel or supportive sole. Start with a low, one-inch heel or wedge to get used to a more feminine shoe style. High heels and stilettos take time getting used to. Practice wearing them at home if you’re uncomfortable wearing them all day. If you prefer a shoe without extra height, a fashionable flat is great for every-day wear."

      "content": "Wear more jewelry with your everyday outfits. Diamonds are a girls' best friend, but so are silver, gold, and anything with sparkle. Start picking out a pair of earrings to go with your outfit of the day, match your layered bracelets to the accents on your purse, or even change out your watch band to sleek white leather or metallic finish to add some bling to your day. You don’t have to go overboard with jewelry to look girly, sometimes simple is best. If you don’t have pierced ears, you can still accessorize with necklaces and bracelets."

      "content": "Experiment with different hairstyles every day. Ponytails can be functional but limiting. Try different hairstyles like braids, buns, and curls. Take the time to brush out your hair and maybe even curl it before heading out the door. Short hair can be accented with a cute headband or bow. Work with a stylist to find out what hair cut works best for your face if you’re ready for a whole new and updated look."

      "content": "Allow yourself to be emotional. Girly girls are open with their emotions. Be honest when you’re happy, mad, or any emotion in between. Don’t be afraid to tear up in front of others and have to dab your face to keep your makeup from running. It may take some time to become comfortable with letting other people see your emotions, but just take it one day at a time. [6] X Research source Never let your emotions get the best of you. You still want to be in control so that you don’t offend anyone in your anger or cause people to think that you’re overdramatic about the smallest inconvenience."

      "content": "Carry a purse or clutch with all of your daily essentials. Not only is a purse a cute accessory for your outfits, but it’s also functional as well. You should always carry some backup makeup, deodorant, a little perfume, a notebook or scheduler and pen, a hair accessory, your wallet, and any keys you need. [7] X Research source Extra purse essentials can include a portable sewing kit and safety pins for fashion emergencies, sunglasses, school books, or any other items for your day to day routine. If you still need to use a backpack or tote around heavy items, you can find bags in fun floral prints or colored leathers to upgrade your look. Start with one bag that matches most of your outfits and then start collecting others for other special occasions, school, and overnight trips."

      "content": "Keep from burping, passing gas, or grooming yourself in public. A lady needs to refrain from displaying any rude bodily functions of other people. Try and keep your gassier moments to yourself and preferably in the bathroom. Always cover your mouth with a tissue or handkerchief when you need to blow your nose, clear your throat, sneeze, or cough. [8] X Research source"

Even if an organization is not your strong suit, keep your desk and purse or backpack tidy so that you don’t lose track of important things or forget appointments. Being punctual is time-management etiquette that is helpful to practice. [9] X Research source Use a label maker or buy cute stationery to help keep your assignments and schedule organized and attractive. Your handwriting should be neat and legible so that both yourself and others can read it. You don’t have to dot your ‘i’s with little hearts, but it certainly makes your writing look more fun and girly."

      "content": "Avoid dirt and aggressive hobbies. Rough-housing and getting dirty are not appropriate activities for a lady. You don't want to ruin your nice clothes and it won’t help your image of being a girly girl. [10] X Research source For example, things like wrestling, tackling, or using power tools are not traditionally girly. You can be sporty as well as girly. Going to the gym to work-out is important and so are sports to stay healthy and social. Just know that there is a time and place for dirt and sweat. After a workout or sporting event, clean yourself up again to out into public."

      "content": "Steer away from coarse language and swearing. Being polite with your speech is incredibly important. Don’t pepper all of your sentences with curse words because it makes you look and sound abrasive. [11] X Research source Don’t get caught up in gossiping either. It can be difficult but refrain from talking badly about others, especially behind their back. Gossiping says more about you and your bad attitude than it does about the people you’re talking about."

      "content": "Hang out with girls more than guys. Start spending more time with girls so that you can watch them and learn how to be more girly. Go to the mall to shop, get manicures together, and simply spend time flipping through magazines together and talk about life with other girls. Being around girls more often will help distinguish you as a lady rather than looking like “one of the guys.” [12] X Research source Be calm around boys. As you start to see boys as more than friends and possible boyfriend material, don’t let that psych you out. They’re still people too, so don’t get flustered and nervous just because you start to see them differently. [13] X Research source Avoid picking up bad habits from guy friends. You can do this by hanging around girls more often, but be careful that you don’t slip into any old tomboy ways. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Set aside time to primp every morning. You need plenty of time to prep your hair, makeup, and accessories before leaving the house. Determine how much time you need from start to finish to get ready and presentable for the day. You may need to start waking up a little earlier to get ready on time. [15] X Research source Schedule time during your week for extra time to shave, care for your nails or do other hygienic upkeep that requires more time than your daily routine allows. Check the mirror before leaving the house. Never leave the house unprepared or half-dressed. You will get faster with your morning routine as you get used to it, so don’t worry if it seems like a lot of work at first. Balance your beauty sleep and primping time. Make sure you get enough rest so that you don’t have to try and cover dark circles or bags under your eyes with makeup. This may mean you need to go to bed earlier or consolidate your primping time."

      "title": "Eliminate any extra body hair.",
      "content": "Eliminate any extra body hair. As you begin to wear more revealing or feminine clothing like skirts or fashion tank-tops, start shaving or waxing regularly. Body hair is not an accessory that you need as a girly girl. Shave every day during your shower routine or every few days depending on how fast your hair grows out. Invest in a good razor or simply stock up on disposable ones and buy a shaving cream to protect your skin. Make sure to shave any parts of your legs that show and your armpits year-round. Include your bikini area during the summer when you’ll be wearing a swimsuit. Facial hair should also be taken care of. Tweeze or pluck your eyebrows to shape them and do the same for any upper lip hair. If you can’t stand plucking hairs yourself, have a professional do it for you or invest in waxing services. Waxing results will last longer but can be more expensive."

      "content": "Choose a feminine scent as your signature smell. First, you always want to be wearing deodorant so you don’t offend anyone with surprise body odor. Then, shop around for a perfume or body lotion that gives you a soft, girly scent. Vanilla, fruity mixtures, and lavender are all subtle yet distinct options. [16] X Research source You can find fun-smelling antiperspirant deodorants to help control any excessive sweating you might have. Don’t go overboard on spraying too much perfume. One way to apply perfume is to dab a little on your wrists and under your neck. Or instead, spray a cloud of perfume in the air in front of you and walk through it for a light misting."

      "content": "Clean your nails and keep them immaculate. It may seem like a small detail, but paying attention to details is important for maintaining the image of being a girly girl. Check under your fingernails for dirt and grime and wash under them with soap and water. Use a nail file every few days to keep your fingernails shaped and smooth. [17] X Research source Pushing back your cuticles will make your nails look longer. Even if you don’t like colored nail polish, a clear coat or nude color can clean up your hands. Every once in a while it’s fun to get a professional manicure and pedicure. Don’t forget your toes! When you wear sandals or open-toed shoes you want to be able to show off your pedicure."
