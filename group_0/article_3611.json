Many successful medical students major in biology but it is not a requirement for admission to medical school. Consider a major in neurobiology or neuroscience if these are offered. Your degree should include a core curriculum that consists of chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, calculus and physics courses with labs. Taking biochemistry, microbiology and human anatomy classes will increase your chances of getting into medical school and doing well there. A few medical schools offer combined undergraduate and medical school programs that last six or seven years. If this interests you, look into these programs."

Your first-year biology grades are especially important. Some schools will disqualify students with Cs and lower. Try to earn at least a 3.75 GPA your freshman year of college. Spend time studying throughout the week to review material covered in class. Join a study group and go over important information with friends. Purchase, borrow or rent course reviews and quizzes. If you need help, get a tutor through your college or hire an independent instructor. The higher you can get your grades, the better you will look to admissions committees.

Many students take the MCAT during their junior year after studying for several months, while others prefer to finish four years of college before taking the MCAT. You might decide to take the test sooner if you have taken some advanced placement coursework or classes during the summer. The MCAT tests foundational concepts, scientific inquiry, critical analysis and reasoning skills drawn from biology, biochemistry, organic chemistry, general chemistry, physics, psychology and sociology.

These mentors can help you put together your residency application and expose you to operating room and neurosurgery clinics. Enrolling in an elective during medical school can help you decide if being a neurosurgeon is right for you. If you are interested in neurosurgery, you should do sub-internships during the fourth year of medical school. You can also gain neurosurgery exposure by attending the weekly didactic sessions and grand rounds at your school’s neurosurgery residency program.

Look into faculty members credentials, interests and the research they are involved in. Talk to them about potential openings for students to participate. Let them know you are interested and find out what you need to do to apply. Publishing in a peer-reviewed journal about your research will look excellent on your application to residency programs. The summer after your first year of medical school may be an optimal time to begin researching and shadowing at this level.
