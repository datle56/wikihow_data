Happy birthday!” “No one watches the TV with their eyes closed like you.” “You’re finally at the age where the fire marshal won’t let us put real candles on your cake! Happy birthday, Dad!” “Dad, real heroes don’t wear capes. They make bad jokes. Thanks for being a real hero. Love you!” “As you get older, 3 things happen: first, your memory goes, and I can’t remember the other 2. Happy birthday, Dad!” “Happy birthday, Dad! Just like your car, your age is classic and appreciates in value.” “Dad, you’re not getting older—your hair’s just taking a leave of absence.

      "content": "Cut out a card in the shape of the word “dad.” On white cardstock , write the word “dad” in capitalized bubble letters, making sure each letter touches the next. Leave enough room at the top to fold the paper over the letters, then cut around them to create a folded card. Decorate the front of the card by drawing all of your dad’s favorite things! [1] X Research source For example, if your dad likes football and fishing, draw a football and a fish! Try drawing a bunch of smaller designs to make the card really colorful. To cut out the middle of the letters, fold the paper in half and make a slit with your scissors. A child may need an adult’s help with this. When making any birthday card , get creative! While children may prefer using crayons and markers, adults may want to add a more sophisticated touch by painting with watercolor."

      "content": "Make a DIY pop-up card. The easiest way to make a pop-up birthday card is to use a pre-made template, like this one .
