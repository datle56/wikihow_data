There are a few tricks to help you get started. Research machines and weights. Before you jump into using every machine at the gym, ask for a run-down on the functions of each machine. Be sure to ask what muscle groups the machine targets so you can develop a routine that works for you. Be consistent. Once you have started to work out, be consistent for at least two to four weeks. Try to work out on the same days or times to develop a routine. Develop good form. You do not want to start lifting a ton of weight right out of the gate. Practice forms before you add more weight to your routine."

      "content": "Examine the different types of weightlifting. Traditionally, there are five types of weightlifting programs: bodybuilding, powerlifting, circuit training, isometric, and high-volume training. Each of these training types of both benefits and downfalls. Bodybuilding — This routine solely focuses on building muscle mass. You will be focusing on one muscle group per workout. Typically, bodybuilders lift every day. The cons of this is that, while your muscles are getting bigger, you might not be gaining additional strength. Powerlifting — Like bodybuilding, powerlifting helps to gain muscle mass. However, powerlifting focuses on lifting the heaviest weights possible rather than focusing on appearance. You may be lifting heavy weights for shorter reps. Circuit Training — Circuit training will put your body through a routine of short workouts such as 20 box jumps, 20 jumping jacks, and 10 pushups in quick succession. This will help your body burn fat and keep your heart rate up. This, however, might not help you build muscle mass. Isometric — This helps builds stamina. Isometric training allows you to hold a weight in a certain position without going through a range of motion. This will probably not help you burn fat as quickly as circuit training, but will help you with stamina. High-volume training — This type of training helps the body achieve as many sets as possible in a workout. For example, you will try and achieve as many pushups as you can in a one minute period. This can be intense and is not necessarily recommended for beginners. Like circuit training, it can help to burn fat. [6] X Research source"
