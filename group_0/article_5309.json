Once you deal with these you will be able to easily take a date and mentally crunch the day of the week rapidly in your head just like Rainman."

      "content": "Starting with the year 2000 we assign the code 0 and then add one to each successive year. For example: [4] X Research source 2000 = 0 2001 = 1 2002 = 2 2003 = 3 2004 = 4 2005 = 5 2006 = 0 Etc. Of course this is problematic because a “Leap Year” occurs every four years so that has to be factored in or not. Leap Years occur every four years, 2008 was a leap year so: 2007 = 1 2008 = 3 2009 = 4 2010 = 5 2011 = 6 2012 = 1 2013 = 2 Notice the zero got moved around. The good news is there’s a shortcut, we’ll take the shortcut. Just take the last two digits of any year and divide it by four and ignore the remainder. (Anytime you don't have a remainder it's a Leap Year and then January Code is 5 and February Code is 1 as shown above) For Example: The year 2061 is handled as, (61 / 4) = 15 with a remainder of one (Discard the one), Then add that answer to the last two digits of the year (61 + 15) = 76"
