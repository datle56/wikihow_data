You can download the ISO for any flavor of Linux you want to install, including Debian and Linux Mint, and the process to create a bootable USB drive will be similar. [1] X Research source To download an ISO of Ubuntu, head over to https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop and click the Download link next to the latest stable version. Ubuntu is a good option if you want to try out Linux without installing it—once you boot from the flash drive, you'll be able to choose an option to try before you install. [2] X Research source To download a Debian ISO, go to https://www.debian.org/download . The download will start automatically. You can get the Linux Mint ISO from https://linuxmint.com/download.php . Just click the Download button next to the version you want to install.
