Picking the right time and place to ask her out is one of the most important things in getting a date. You don't want to ask at the wrong time or place, or you might blow your chance. There are a number of things you should consider when asking her out in person: Don’t pick a time or place where she is distracted. If you’re in a bar or club with friends, try to find a moment when you're alone. Otherwise, some of your or her friends might invite themselves and make it a group date. Don’t ask too early in your encounter. Ask toward the end of your encounter when you think you will part ways. Otherwise, you might seem too desperate."

      "content": "Call her with confidence. Perhaps you got her phone number at a club, and want to contact her the day after and set up a date. This is alright, but make sure your phone call and texting is confident and pleasant. You’ve done the hard work of making first contact and getting her number, don’t blow it now. Start off the conversation in a light way. Joke about something (appropriate). Try to get her laughing or relaxed. Demonstrate your interest by asking her questions, but nothing too prying. Focus on light things. Invite her out. Tell her you’d like to get to know her better. Based on personality, you can ask her to suggest something, or you can suggest something you think she likes. If she declines, she might tell you why. If it’s a scheduling issue, ask her when a good time is for her. If not, drop it and politely end the conversation – unless you want to pursue a friendship. If she accepts, try to end the conversation politely."

      "content": "Text concisely. Texting might be a way to follow up with her after you met the night before. It is a noncommittal way to communicate that many people are comfortable with. However, there are a number of things you can do wrong that will blow your shot at getting a date. Consider texting her the afternoon after you met her. By avoiding an immediate text, you're showing that you're thinking about her, but you're not obsessing. Start off with a light or humorous comment that will relax her and remind her of who you are. For example: \"Hey! Remember that devastatingly handsome guy you met last night?\" Don’t write a long message to her. Instead, be clear, concise, and articulate what you want – a date with her. For example: \"I'd like to take you out so we can get to know each other better.\" Don’t be forceful. Avoid telling her what she should do or what she'll be missing if she does not go out with you. Allow her time to respond. Don’t jump the gun if she doesn’t text back in 3 minutes and then shoot her another text. Wait a few hours or more. Chances are, if she wants to go out with you, she’ll respond. [2] X Research source"

Don't assume that women want to be the lesser party in the relationship and always defer to your judgement. Rather, assume that your relationship, if it goes forward, will be one of equals and one based on mutual respect. Never insult her or be rude to her. Always consider her opinion and taste.

Don't obsess, and if you do, try to control it. If she's interested in you, she'll let you know. If she turns you down, then call it quits. If she rejects you, don't try to read in between the lines and interpret it as her playing \"hard to get.\" If she rejects you, don't go out of your way to \"bump\" into her randomly. If she rejects you, don't be rude. Just move on. Once she has ended communication with you, it's over."

You want her to get the sense from how you’re carrying yourself that you are confident and want to get to know her a little better. Make sure you’re standing up straight, smiling, your shoulders are up, and your hands and arms are in a relaxed and non-defensive posture. There are several things you should avoid: Slouching over. Crossing your arms. This demonstrates that you’re in a defensive posture. Fidgeting with your hands. Don’t play with things in your hands, and don’t keep your hands in your pockets."

Avoid inserting a sense of urgency into the situation. Instead, act nonchalant, but interested. If you are tense and nervous when asking her out, she will feel just as tense and nervous. Make your invitation sound as if it was the most natural thing for you to do (and it should), and this will help her feel comfortable and at ease with the plan as well."

While your first date should be memorable, you don’t want it to be the sort of thing that could intimidate her or could signal to her that you’re jumping the gun on a relationship that does not even exist yet. The purpose of the first date is to spend time together and focus on each other rather than some very interesting activity that would distract you from each other. Avoid: Anything that requires traveling more than a half hour from your home city. You both should feel at ease and at home wherever it is. Events like concerts or music festivals. Such events will undermine the ability for both of you to communicate and form a bond. Events that the other person might not be interested in.
