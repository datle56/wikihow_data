Add an equal amount of water, then stir the mixture with a spoon until it turns into a paste. [1] X Research source The amount of baking soda and water you need to use depends on how large the plastic item you want to clean is. For example, if it is something small, like a TV remote, you can use about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of water and 1 tbsp (20 g) of baking soda. This method works to clean a variety of sticky plastic items like plastic kitchen utensils or dishes, TV remotes, plastic containers , toys, and many other types of solid plastic items."

Wipe away all the paste from the plastic item. Rinse out the cloth and repeat as needed until there is no more paste on the plastic. [3] X Research source If you are cleaning something with batteries, like a TV remote, make sure to open up and wipe out the battery compartment as well in case any paste got inside. If the item has any cracks or crevices that you can’t wipe the paste out of, you can use something like a toothpick or cotton swab to reach inside them and clean the paste out."

      "content": "Fold a clean rag into a square or rectangle that fits in your hand. Grab a clean, soft cloth that you don’t mind using to clean. Fold it in half once or twice so it fits neatly in your hand and is easy to work with. [5] X Research source If you don’t have a cloth you can use, fold up some paper towels or napkins instead. This method works well to clean off adhesive residue , such as that left behind by stickers or glue. If you are cleaning off an old soft plastic coating that has become sticky, keep in mind that the appearance of the item will likely be shinier and slightly different after you wipe it off with alcohol. However, it won’t be sticky anymore after you remove the deteriorated coating."

Be very careful to just wipe down the non-sensitive plastic surfaces like the tops of the keys on a keyboard. You can also use rubbing alcohol for this, as it contains isopropyl alcohol."
