You should have game passes or shirts to sell in your booth. The game passes can be for any world you have created. [7] X Research source Create game passes with different increments . You should have at least one game pass for increments of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 10,000, and 100,000 Robux. Don’t create a game pass for 1 Robux. You won’t get any Robux after Roblox, and the game developer takes their cut. Create multiple game passes at lower increments so people can donate more than once, really quickly. For example, you can add three game passes for increments of 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100. State what you’re raising money for on your sign . A lot of players have an empty sign and wonder why they’re not getting any donations. Your sign should clearly state what you are trying to raise Robux for (i.e., develop a game, make a YouTube video, develop products, purchase products, etc). Set a goal . It’s a good idea to set a goal when soliciting donations in Pls Donate. State how much you want to raise. This will encourage larger donations. Have a unique booth . You can purchase different types of booths from the shop. Decorate your booth and try to have eye-catching text. Pick the booths on the ends, if possible . The best booths are the ones next to the live donor boards. If you can’t get those, try to get one of the ones next to the walkways on the ends of the rows. You will get more foot traffic this way. Try hopping between different servers , especially if your server doesn’t have many people. You will meet more people this way and have a chance to promote yourself. Interact with other players . Have short conversations with other players in as many servers as possible. Try to get other players to check out your booth. Don’t immediately start asking them to donate. You don’t want to seem like you are begging. Let other players know what you are raising Robux for and try to get them to check out your booth. Use the voice chats on the servers."
