      "content": "Understand that she could say \"no.\" [1] X Research source The girl is not obligated to give you her number just because you ask for it. There may be many reasons why she does not want to give you a way to contact her. This can also give you confidence, though. Her saying \"no\" is the worst thing that can happen when you ask for her number. It is easy to build up all the things that could go wrong, but in reality, her saying \"no\" is the worst it could be. Be prepared for rejection. Rejection is difficult, but once you accept it, the whole ordeal will feel much less intimidating and scary."

      "content": "Try to psych yourself up to ask her. In addition to being an attractive trait, confidence will make you feel more comfortable while asking her. Read our article on how to be confident for some ideas. [2] X Research source A good way to be confident in this situation is to keep everything in perspective. Asking for her number may seem like a big deal at the time, but you will likely forget how afraid you were in a year's time. Remember that rejection can be overcome, but don't assume it will necessarily be the outcome. [3] X Research source While it may sound silly, try standing in a Superman pose for a few minutes before you ask her. Some experts do believe it really can help increase your confidence."

      "title": "Try sending a friend to talk to her and gauge her interest.",
      "content": "Try sending a friend to talk to her and gauge her interest. If you are feeling very doubtful that the girl even thinks of you, ask a friend to talk to her about you. Unless she adamantly says that she is completely not attracted to you, do not let her answer influence your decision too much. She may not think of you too much because you have never been confident enough to talk to her. Be sure that it is a friend you can trust. You do not want your friend to ruin your chances with the girl by making you sound creepy or invasive. The friend should be able to subtly bring you up in a conversation in order to gauge her opinion of you. The girl may respect this less than you simply asking for her number. It can help you gain confidence, but it also adds unnecessary stress to this fairly small situation."

      "title": "Understand that asking for her number is not a marriage proposal.",
      "content": "Understand that asking for her number is not a marriage proposal. Just because you have a girl's number, it does not mean that you are going out with the girl. Asking for her number is merely a way to stay in closer contact with her to hopefully build a relationship in the future. This should also help give you confidence and decrease the intimidation factor of asking for a girl's number. While the implication is that you are interested, it does not need to mean anything more than that right away."

      "title": "Go up to her and start a conversation.",
      "content": "Go up to her and start a conversation. Do not simply run up and ask for her number. Try to weave it into a conversation. [4] X Research source Try talking to her about a movie or show you have both recently seen. Ask her how her day was. The conversation can be about anything, but try to keep it light. Having a conversation will also help you gauge her interest. If all her responses are short, she may not be interested in you. If she gives long answers and asks you questions in return, she likely is interested. If she laughs at many of your jokes (even ones you know aren't funny), she is definitely interested and likely wants you to ask for her number.

If you go to school together, mention how you sometimes struggle with homework and would like to work together. If you work together, mention how you would like to grab dinner or coffee sometime. [6] X Research source Again, pay attention to how she responds to seeing you outside of the normal environment. Pay attention to things like a smile, a light in her eye, or her brushing her hair. These are all signs that she is flattered."

      "content": "Ask for her number. Do not dance around the topic for too long or you will appear unsure. It really is as simple as asking \"can I get your number?\" People tend to build it up because of the implication of a possible relationship, but it can be simple if you are straightforward. [7] X Research source Much of the stress behind asking for a number can be avoided by simply diving in and asking outright. It is better to ask her outright rather than trying any tricks like getting it from a friend or from a group project. Speak clearly when you ask for her number. As this question is the point of the entire conversation, be confident and articulate when asking. Don't make her have to ask you to repeat the question."

Text her about the conversation you had earlier or start a new conversation. [8] X Research source Do not just text \"hey.\" Be engaging and offer a line which can be made into a conversation. The responsibility is on you to start the conversation. Try to be funny, keep things light, and be yourself when you first start texting her. You don't want to get into a place where you have to keep on pretending to be someone else."

She may have just not wanted to reject you or she may see you more as a friend. Text with her for a while to try to gauge her opinion of you. In addition to continuing conversation with her at school or work, try to continue frequent conversations over text or on a phone call."
