      "title": "Use cooking oil to grease a large frying pan.",
      "content": "Use cooking oil to grease a large frying pan. You shouldn’t need a lot of oil for this. The oil is only needed to prevent the ham steaks from sticking, rather than to deep-fry them. Use whatever cooking oil you have on hand, or substitute a small pat of butter instead. [1] X Research source You can use a paper towel dipped in oil to apply only a very thin layer to the pan. Alternately, use a small amount of cooking spray to lightly grease the pan."

      "title": "Put the frying pan or skillet over a medium heat.",
      "content": "Put the frying pan or skillet over a medium heat. Turn a larger element on your stove to a medium to high heat and allow the oil to begin heating up. Keep an eye on the skillet as it heats up. If it begins to spit oil, both the amount of oil and the heat are likely too high. [2] X Research source If you are cooking with butter, keep the heat lower until you put the ham steak in the pan. The butter may brown and burn otherwise."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pat the ham steak dry with a few paper towels.",
      "content": "Pat the ham steak dry with a few paper towels. Ham steaks contain a lot of extra moisture that can keep them from browning fully. To reduce the amount of extra liquid going into the pan, dab at the outside of your ham steaks with a few paper towels to dry them as much as you can before cooking them. [3] X Research source If you skip this step or notice too much liquid in the bottom of the pan while the ham steaks cook, carefully pour some of it out. Be careful not to drop your ham steaks as you do!"

      "title": "Cook the ham steak on each side for 4 to 5 minutes, or until brown.",
      "content": "Cook the ham steak on each side for 4 to 5 minutes, or until brown. Add the ham steak to your preheated frying pan and let it brown on one side. After around 5 minutes, use a pair of tongs or a fork to flip the ham steak over. Cook until browned on both sides and warmed through. [4] X Research source If you want to apply a glaze to your ham steaks, brush it over the surface of the meat as you let the ham cook. Keep flipping your ham steaks until the glaze thickens or is cooked through."

      "content": "Serve your ham steaks immediately. Remove the ham steaks from the frying pan or skillet and serve while they’re still warm. You can also keep the ham steaks in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, reheating them just before serving.

      "title": "Brush down your grill with oil.",
      "content": "Brush down your grill with oil. Before heating your grill, use a paper towel dipped in a little cooking oil to grease the cooking surface. This will allow your steaks to be flipped much more easily as they are cooking. If you forget to oil your grill before beginning to preheat it, hold the oil-dipped paper towel with a long set of tongs to grease it."

      "title": "Turn your grill onto a medium to high heat.",
      "content": "Turn your grill onto a medium to high heat. Preheating your grill before cooking the ham steaks will allow them to cook faster, and give you more delicious browning across the meat. Leave the grill to heat up while you prepare your ham steaks. [6] X Research source If you don’t have an outdoor grill, you can use a grill or griddle pan indoors to achieve a similar effect."

If your ham steaks are still moist on the outside when put on the grill, the liquid will have to cook off before they begin browning. Use a couple of paper towels to remove any excess liquid on the outside of your ham steaks before cooking them. [7] X Research source"
