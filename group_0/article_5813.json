Transferring your account: You have the option to transfer your account to another person. Your family member or friend will have to come with you to process the transfer, and they are required to pay their first and last month dues upon transferring. If you would like to leave one Youfit location and transfer to another, simply speak to one of the front desk staff and they will facilitate your request. You will need to come into the club and sign a transfer form. [1] X Research source Freezing your account: For medical purposes that prevent you from using our health club or if you are serving in the military you may be eligible to freeze your account free of charge. Please note: an injury will require a note from your doctor. You may be eligible to freeze your account for 3 months at a time, twice a year (for a total of 6 months freezing free of charge). You also have the option to freeze your account if you plan on traveling. (With this option, your payment will be $5/month while membership is on freeze.)"
