      "content": "Gather the materials. To ensure you build the best and safest catapult, find durable and strong materials to withstand the extreme forces your catapult will use when shooting objects. There are a great many materials you could use in the construction of your catapult, but at minimum you will need: Broomstick or crank Padding Plywood (1/4\" to 1/2\" thick, 15\" by 18 and 1/2\") Rope (strong, stretchy preferred,like kernmantle rope) Screws or bolts Weights (optional) Wood (preferably non-flexible, like oak wood) If using 2x4 planks collect: two pieces at 36\", one piece at 30\", four pieces at 15\", and one piece at 18\" [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Contemplate base and weights.",
      "content": "Contemplate base and weights. Since your catapult utilizes such powerful forces to eject its payload, you will need a strong and sturdy platform for launching as well as a strong and stable foundation. Poor foundation can throw off your aim or cause your catapult to fail. Torsion catapults, which is the technical name for a normal catapult, have historically been built with heavy, reinforced sides, as these would allow for heavier payload, greater tensile force, and greater stability."

      "content": "Cut your plywood supports. For the base of this catapult, you will use a 2x4 base supported with plywood triangles. To prepare your plywood supports, take one rectangular piece of plywood 1/4\" to 1/2\" thick, 15\" by 18 and 1/2\", and cut it diagonally into two equal triangles."

      "title": "Choose the right material for your throwing arm.",
      "content": "Choose the right material for your throwing arm. Traditionally, spruce or fir wood were used for the throwing arm, as these woods were light and strong. Consult your local lumberyard to see if these are an affordable option and, if not, ask for some alternatives, two of which follow: Thick PVC pipe Metal pipe (lightweight, durable)"

      "title": "Cut your torsion handles.",
      "content": "Cut your torsion handles. You will need rope torsion to provide the launching force for your catapult. The more twists, the greater the torque, the more power your catapult will have. The amount of torsion (twisting) you can achieve is limited only by your strength and the strength of the materials you've used in making your catapult. [2] X Research source To make your torsion handles, take a broomstick and cut into two 15 inch segments."

      "content": "Attach your plywood triangle. Place it atop your 2x4 planks. The 18\" side of your plywood will be vertical to your 36\" plank, its base parallel with the 36\" plank, and its diagonal will approximately span the distance between the two ends each 2x4 plank. Screw down your triangle securely to your 2x4s. This forms one base leg of your catapult."

In the same fashion you constructed the right side, put your 36\" and 18\" 2x4 planks at a right angle 15\" from the end of the long piece, and screw your triangular plywood piece into place atop the two 2x4 planks, with the base parallel to the 36\" 2x4."

Using your two 15\" long 2x4 planks, screw your left and right side, with the base of your triangle and base of your 36\" 2x4 forming the bottom, leaving the hypotenuse (the diagonal) facing up. Use long screws to ensure your frame is sturdy. Do not use nails for this part of your frame. Nails are sensitive to the stress your catapult will exert, and could come loose over time."

      "title": "Pad the arm.",
      "content": "Pad the arm. The arm of your catapult operates by being pulled or winched back after applying tension to the rope that will be laced through the frame. Where the throwing arm of your catapult meets your cross brace, it's a good idea to add padding, like a blanket or several layers of wrapped rags. This will prevent your catapult from doing damage to itself when the arm is pulled back, released, and comes in contact with the cross brace."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lace the rope.",
      "content": "Lace the rope. You will need about 20' of rope to complete the lacing process. Tie the rope around your broomstick handle, then take it through the hole in the right side of the base, through the hole you drilled in the arm of the catapult, out the opposite side of the base and back out to your second broomstick handle. Loop it around your second handle, then take it back through the frame to your first handle, where you will loop the cord again. Do this several times. [5] X Research source When choosing rope, look for strong material that has some stretch to it. Kernmantle rope, like parachute cord, is an excellent option. [6] X Research source Take your cord back and forth through the frame and arm several times to ensure your rope is securely fastened to the frame. While lacing, don't worry about keeping the rope tight. When you turn your handles, you will tighten the rope and apply launching force."

    {
      "title": "Use an over under motion to complete lacing.",
      "content": "Use an over under motion to complete lacing. After you have run your cord through the base of your catapult and throwing arm several times to secure it to the frame and arm, starting with your second handle, bring the end of your cord around the second handle in a loop that passes through the hole in your frame and under the throwing arm, passing through to the hole on the other side to loop around your first handle. Continue this motion, following each over-lacing of the arm with an under-lacing with each pass of the cord through the frame. This should form a figure eight shape with your rope where you can clearly see the rope twisting together. The more twists you add through your over and under motion, the more tension and greater force your catapult will have. After securing your rope to arm and frame, you should not continue threading your line through the throwing arm. To achieve the tension necessary to throw a projectile, you must finish lacing by going through the frame holes, around the broom handles in loops, and over and under the throwing arm. Make sure your loops stay anchored around your broom handles."

      "title": "Knot the end of your cord to the side of the arm.",
      "content": "Knot the end of your cord to the side of the arm. When you are reaching the end of your rope, wrap it around the strings to one side of your catapult, then cross over and do the same on the other side. Now you can knot the end of your cord, ensuring it won't come lose with the added benefit of keeping your rope orderly."

    {
      "title": "Add a catch for your throwing arm.",
      "content": "Add a catch for your throwing arm. As you twist your handles, the torsion of the rope will cause your throwing arm to ascend until its tension holds it against the cross brace. First allow your arm to rest fully back in the launching position and judge where to best install your catch, then drill a hole and insert your hook. By installing a catch to the rear of your frame, you won't have to pull the arm back to launch your payload. Simply release the catch after applying tension, and your arm will spring forward, stopping at the cross brace and launching your payload."

    {
      "title": "Arm your catapult and apply torsion.",
      "content": "Arm your catapult and apply torsion. Your handles should now be off to each side of your catapult base, parallel to your 36\" pieces and attached to the frame and throwing arm by rope. Turn the handles to create torsion in the rope. This will give the catapult tension, simply add a payload to your cup, wind your broomstick cranks, release your catch and fire."
