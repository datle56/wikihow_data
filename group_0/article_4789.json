Gesso can be purchased in any craft or art supply store. Using a clean brush, apply the gesso in an even coat to the entire surface of the house. Use long, parallel strokes to ensure an even coating. Let the gesso dry completely before painting the house."

For the playhouse, you can use a larger brush. Paint the exterior walls first, being careful not to let the paint bleed over the lines you’ve sketched for your doors and windows. Paint the background first, then add the details. Clean the brush with fresh water when switching between colors. If you have to apply one color over another — a black doorknob on a red door, for example — let the bottom layer of paint dry completely before applying the second color. Apply the paint in thin layers, so it doesn’t drip down. Even if you have newspaper under the house, the dripping will leave an uneven texture on the surface of the house."

After an hour or two, lightly brush your finger along the paint surface to see if any comes off on your skin. If not, you’re ready to apply a second layer of paint to cover up the gesso underneath. Once your second layer of paint has dried, you’re finished."

It should be about an inch across. Cut out a simple spiral with two edges. Wave the lines as you cut. Beginning on the outside of the paper, roll up the spiral tightly. Once you've got it curled up, let it unravel slightly to form a flower. Glue the bottom of the spiral to the circle you made in the beginning."
