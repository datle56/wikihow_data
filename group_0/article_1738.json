The truth is that an Aquarius guy is just not used to it and might not have the vocabulary to share how he feels. As an Air sign, he's a great communicator—he just needs a little help with the language of emotions. Cancer, share and discuss your feelings with your Aquarius man frequently. He'll get used to emotions being a frequent topic of conversation and learn the words to use when talking about them. Aquarius, pay attention to your tone when you speak. Cancerians are sensitive and can be easily hurt by what they perceive as a harsh tone that you didn't intend."
