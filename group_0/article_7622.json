      "content": "Select an appropriate cleanser for your skin type. Most people can simply use regular soap – whatever you wash your body with in the shower – to clean behind their ears. [1] X Research source If you have sensitive skin, use a gentle foaming cleanser like a product you would use on your face. Use a cleanser that you’re familiar with – if it’s comfortable on your body or face, it probably won’t irritate the skin behind your ears."

      "content": "Use acne wash if you have blackheads. Some people are prone to getting acne outside and behind their ears. This can be due to oils from the hairline clogging pores. Wash with a mild acne wash if you’re prone to getting blackheads behind your ears. After you clean behind your ears, dab some rubbing alcohol on the affected area with a cotton swab. This can help to kill bacteria that live there and cause acne."

      "title": "Wash with shampoo for added convenience.",
      "content": "Wash with shampoo for added convenience. Use shampoo to wash behind your ears while you're in the shower. This is a good option if you often forget to clean behind your ears – it’s easy to remember to do while you’re shampooing your hair. Work up a good lather and use the sudsy foam to clean back there. Be sure to rinse it off thoroughly – shampoo can easily get stuck behind your ear."

      "content": "Use gentle products for children’s ears. Parents should clean behind their children’s ears regularly. Be sure to use a cleansing product that is safe and effective for kids. [2] X Research source Use your child’s tear-free shampoo or a baby-safe soap or cleanser. Babies have especially sensitive skin, so avoid using harsh soap on them."

      "title": "Soap up some warm water in the shower.",
      "content": "Soap up some warm water in the shower. Stand in the shower under a stream of warm water. Lather up some of your cleanser in your hands so you get a good foam. Make sure the water is warm, but not hot enough to burn your skin. Instead of showering, you can also wash your ears while leaning over your bathroom sink. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Gently scrub with a clean cloth.",
      "content": "Gently scrub with a clean cloth. Lather up a clean washcloth with your soap suds. Gently scrub the skin behind your ears. [4] X Research source It may help to use one hand to pull your ear forward (gently!) so you have more space to clean back there. If you have sensitive skin, try just lathering up the area with your fingertips. A cloth may be too rough for you."

      "title": "Rinse thoroughly.",
      "content": "Rinse thoroughly. Stand under the warm water or splash warm water onto the area to clean it. Make sure you rinse all the soap off – leaving soap suds behind your ear may irritate your skin or cause crusting."

      "title": "Dry the area well.",
      "content": "Dry the area well. Use a clean, soft towel to thoroughly dry the skin behind your ear. [5] X Research source Pat the area dry - don’t scrub it. Dry inside any folds of skin back there, and don’t be afraid to gently pull your ear forward to access that small space. If you blowdry your hair, you can also dry behind your ear with the hair dryer on a cool setting."

      "content": "Give the area a wipe with tea tree oil. Put a drop of tea tree oil on a cotton ball. Gently wipe the area behind your ear that you just cleaned. This can help to remove any leftover soap residue. [6] X Research source You can get tea tree oil at most drug stores, pharmacies, or some health food stores. If using tea tree oil causes redness, itching, or pain, stop using it right away. Tea tree oil may be too harsh for sensitive skin. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Prepare the cotton swab with your cleanser. Cotton swabs can be very useful to clean small spaces like the area behind your ear. You can also clean behind your child’s ear with cotton swabs – this can be done more regularly and easily than bathing. [8] X Research source Select the appropriate cleanser and wet both sides of a clean, fresh cotton swab – use one end for each ear."

      "title": "Wipe dirt away gently.",
      "content": "Wipe dirt away gently. Whether you’re cleaning your own ears or a child’s ears, be gentle – pulling hard on the ear can cause discomfort. Use small vertical wiping motions to remove any dirt or crust that’s behind the ear. Wipe in a single direction, up or down, to sweep the dirt away. Wipe away any visible debris with a washcloth, another cotton swab, or a cotton ball. Be sure to wipe inside any small nooks and crevices on the outside of your ear. [9] X Research source If the cotton swab dries out, rewet it with your cleanser."

      "content": "Only use cotton swabs on the outside of the ear. Do NOT put cotton swabs or any other objects inside your ear. Despite being a popular practice, this does not help to remove earwax and can even damage your ears. [10] X Research source Reserve cleaning with cotton swabs for outside the ear only, and clean inside your ears with peroxide , oil, or other liquid products."
