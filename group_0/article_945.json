      "title": "Unscrew the aerator from the end of your faucet with channel lock pliers.",
      "content": "Unscrew the aerator from the end of your faucet with channel lock pliers. The aerator looks like a cylindrical piece with mesh at the end of your faucet, and it is used to filter out fine sediment from your water. Tighten channel lock pliers around the aerator and twist it counterclockwise to loosen it. Once it’s loose, you should be able to unscrew it by hand. [1] X Research source If you’re worried about scratching the metal on your aerator, put a rag between it and the pliers."

    {
      "title": "Rinse out any debris inside the aerator.",
      "content": "Rinse out any debris inside the aerator. You may notice sediment or debris inside the mesh of your aerator. Turn the aerator upside down and run it underneath warm water to get rid of any material that’s still stuck inside. If the debris isn’t rinsing out on its own, try using a toothbrush to gently scrape it out. [2] X Research source Make sure your sink is plugged so you don’t lose any pieces of your aerator. Only use a toothbrush meant for cleaning purposes."

    {
      "title": "Soak the aerator in white vinegar overnight.",
      "content": "Soak the aerator in white vinegar overnight. Even if you rinse your aerator, there may be built-up lime and debris inside it. Fill a glass with enough vinegar to fully submerge the aerator. Leave the aerator in the vinegar overnight so the lime and debris can break apart. When you take the aerator out, rinse it with clean water. [3] X Research source You can also use a lime cleaner like Formula 409."

      "title": "Run the faucet for 10 seconds to clear any debris.",
      "content": "Run the faucet for 10 seconds to clear any debris. Before you reattach your aerator, turn on the faucet to rinse out any sediment that’s leftover inside of it. This ensures that debris won’t catch in your aerator right after you’ve cleaned it. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Screw the aerator back on to test your faucet.",
      "content": "Screw the aerator back on to test your faucet. Turn the aerator clockwise on your faucet by hand. Keep turning the aerator by hand until you have a tight seal. Use your channel lock pliers again to make sure the aerator is on as tight as it can go. Turn on your faucet to see if the water pressure changed. [5] X Research source If the aerator still gives you trouble, try buying another one from your local hardware store. Make sure it fits the model faucet that you have."

      "content": "Unscrew the handle of your faucet with channel lock pliers. If your sink has a faucet with a hose that you can remove from the base, pull it out so you can access the bottom of the handle. Grip the nut at the bottom of your handle with channel lock pliers and rotate it counterclockwise to loosen it. When it’s loose, the handle should easily come apart. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Pull out the filter and rinse it. The filter is located at the base of the handle and looks like a cylinder with metal mesh layers. Pull the filter out from the handle by hand. Run the filter underneath warm water to rinse out any of the debris or buildup inside it. Use a stiff-bristled toothbrush if sediment is stuck on the mesh. [7] X Research source You can also remove the aerator from the handle to clean it as well."

Hold the handle up to the end of the hose so you can easily screw it back together. Tighten the nut by hand as far as you can before using your channel lock pliers to seal it. [9] X Research source If your faucet still has low water pressure, then you may have a problem with your supply line or pipes."

      "content": "Turn the valves counterclockwise to open them and increase water pressure. If you have low water pressure, make sure the valves are in the open position. Rotate each of the valves counterclockwise until the arrow is pointing in the direction of the pipes. This means the water valve is fully opened and you should get the maximum amount of pressure. [11] X Research source Make sure both of the valves are all the way on so you can control the water temperature easier."

If you turn 1 of the valves, make sure to turn the other valve the same amount.

Loosen the nut until you can disconnect the supply line from the valve. Hold the end of the supply line over a bucket so it doesn’t spill any water.
