[1] X Research source Make sure that the straws aren’t bendy. If you can only find bendy straws, cut of the bendy portion of the straw and make a smaller bridge. If you want a longer bridge, purchase 34 straws."

This extends the length of the bridge, whilst maintaining its strength. These straws will form the base of the bridge. [2] X Research source"

Make a total of 8 chains. If you need a wider bridge, connect more straws together. [3] X Research source If you want a longer bridge, squeeze another straw and push it into one of the openings of the existing bridge base. Repeat this for each of the straws on the bridge base."

Cut a small piece of tape that is approximately 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) and wrap it around the joining point of the straws. Make sure that the tape touches the surface of both straws: otherwise, it won’t hold them in place. If you have added a third straw to the length of the bridge, you will need to tape the second connection point as well. [4] X Research source"

Place the cut straws perpendicular to the base of the bridge and evenly distribute them across the bottom side of the bridge base. Cut a small piece of tape and stick it over the piece of cut straw and onto the bridge base. [7] X Research source Repeat this process for each supporting straw.

Balance the ends of the bridge on 2 flat surfaces and let the your straw bridge cover the gap. Balance a toy car, or a small weight, in the middle of the bridge to prove that it is stable. [8] X Research source If you want a longer bridge, add more straws to the base. You will need to use extra tape to support the extra length. Try using piles of books to balance the bridge on. The bridge is designed to hold small items. Avoid putting heavy items on the bridge as this will cause the bridge to break. Slowly increase the weight you put on the bridge to test how much it can hold."

[13] X Research source Make sure to assemble the straws on a flat surface. The zig-zag pattern needs to extend the entire length of the bridge.
