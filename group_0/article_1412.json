      "title": "Wash your hair with shampoo.",
      "content": "Wash your hair with shampoo. You should always start with clean hair so the clay doesn’t have to compete with your natural oils or leftover product. Use your shampoo like you normally would, then rinse it out. [1] X Research source If your hair is already clean, you can get it damp again using a spray bottle. Hair clay works best on short-medium hair for an extra bit of hold throughout the day."

      "title": "Towel dry your hair for about 20 seconds.",
      "content": "Towel dry your hair for about 20 seconds. You don’t want your hair to be dripping wet, but it should be damp still. Use a towel to rub your hair gently until the majority of the water is out. [2] X Research source If your hair is too wet, the clay won’t be able to stick as well, and it could slide right off your hair."

      "title": "Scoop out a dime-sized dollop of hair clay with your finger.",
      "content": "Scoop out a dime-sized dollop of hair clay with your finger. Open up your hair clay and use your pointer finger to gently scoop just a little bit out. You don’t need a ton of hair clay to cover your whole head, so start out with less than you think you need. [3] X Research source Hair clay is already soft, so you shouldn’t have any trouble scooping it out."

      "title": "Rub the clay in between your palms.",
      "content": "Rub the clay in between your palms. Spend a few seconds warming the clay up to get it ready for your hair. Smooth it in between your palms to thoroughly coat your hands for an even application. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Run your hands back and forth through your hair.",
      "content": "Run your hands back and forth through your hair. Start by raking your fingers from back to front, then go side to side, and front to back. Make sure you coat all of your hair with your hair clay as thoroughly as possible. [5] X Research source Your hair might look a little messy at this point, but that’s okay! You’ll be able to fix it in just a moment."

    {
      "title": "Smooth down flyaways with your hand or a comb.",
      "content": "Smooth down flyaways with your hand or a comb. Use your hands to part your hair in the direction you’d like it to sit. Then, use a fine-toothed comb or your hands to gently press down on any flyaway pieces and stick them in place. [6] X Research source As the clay dries, it will keep your hair in place without creating a hard shell like gel does. The clay will create a cast in your hair that will dry as your hair does. Heat styling tools, like hair dryers and straighteners, might make the clay feel crunchy, so stay away from them after you’ve put the clay in your hair."

    {
      "title": "Mix the clay with water until it’s smooth.",
      "content": "Mix the clay with water until it’s smooth. The exact amount of clay you’ll need depends on how much hair you have, so start with about 1 cup (128 g) in a large bowl. Add in 1 c (240 mL) of water and stir your mixture together. [7] X Research source Aim for a yogurt-like consistency. Read the instructions on your clay mask before you start. Some require you to mix in apple cider vinegar instead of water. You can find bentonite clay masks or Aztec clay masks at most beauty supply stores. Clay masks may help your hair feel softer and cleaner, but there isn’t any scientific evidence to support it. Use your clay mask on your own hair to find out if it’s right for you.

      "title": "Wet your hair down with water.",
      "content": "Wet your hair down with water. You can use a spray bottle for a light misting or head to the shower. Make sure your hair isn’t dripping wet, but just damp enough for the clay to adhere to. [9] X Research source Clay dries out quickly when it reacts with air, so it’s super hard to put on dry hair. Wetting your hair down will make it go on smoother and come off easier."

      "title": "Section your hair into 3 to 4 sections.",
      "content": "Section your hair into 3 to 4 sections. Aim for 2 sections on either side of your head to make your application easier. Put up each section with a hair clip to keep it up and out of the way. [10] X Research source If you have a lot of hair, do 5 to 6 sections instead."

      "title": "Massage the clay into your hair from roots to ends.",
      "content": "Massage the clay into your hair from roots to ends. Grab a handful of clay and rub it in between your palms. Pick a section of hair and gently rub the clay onto your roots and your scalp, moving downwards toward the end of your hair. Keep adding clay until your entire head is covered. [11] X Research source If the clay starts to dry out, mist it with a spray bottle to keep it moist."

      "title": "Cover your hair with a shower cap for 5 to 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Cover your hair with a shower cap for 5 to 20 minutes. This will lock in moisture to keep the clay from drying. As it sits on your hair, the clay will moisturize and refresh your scalp and your hair, leaving it shiny and clean. [12] X Research source If you leave the clay on for too long, it will dry out. It’s not bad for your hair, but it won’t moisturize or refresh your hair once it’s dry."

      "title": "Wash the clay out with shampoo and warm water.",
      "content": "Wash the clay out with shampoo and warm water. Head to your shower or sink and gently wash the clay out of your hair. Take the time to really wash all the clay out, as leaving it in your hair can lead to dryness and itching. [13] X Research source You can also condition your hair after you wash out the clay if you’d like to. You can use a clay mask about once a week."
