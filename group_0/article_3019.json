      "content": "Choose what you are (and aren't) going to shave. When it comes to the look of a drag queen, there's no right or wrong way to do it. Some queens shave their entire bodies , some just shave their faces and their chests, and others don't shave at all. The latter is referred to as \"bear\" or \"skag\" drag. [1] X Research source If you've got a lot of hair and you do want to shave it, trim it with safety scissors first. Then shave right after a shower for the best results. You could also go for a full-body wax. You'll walk out with a hairless body and a newfound appreciation for what women go through."

      "title": "Decide on your persona’s body type.",
      "content": "Decide on your persona’s body type. Choose whether you'll go big or small. Hip pads add curves if you want a voluptuous body, but many queens go for a thin look, as well. Ultimately, it's up to you, and there isn’t a right or wrong way to go. [2] X Research source If you’re having trouble deciding on a body type, consider your queen’s personality. If she’s larger than life, consider giving her larger curves. If she’s more demur, go for a petite look. Waist cinchers also come in handy, especially if you're a little heavy in the middle. They help compress your stomach to give the appearance of a slimmer waist, which in turn can make your hips appear more curvy. Take a look at your body type. How broad is your chest? How narrow are your hips? Are they vastly different or about the same? If you don't have an automatic response, you may find it useful to just try on a few dresses with and without padding in place. Then you can see which side of the spectrum you prefer."

      "title": "Tuck your genitals between your legs",
      "content": "Tuck your genitals between your legs to prevent a bulge. Women's panties are snug and smooth enough to hold it all in place, though you could also get a gaff (very similar to women's panties). Support garments like Spanx or pantyhose work great too. If you do get a gaff, lie down with the gaff pulled up to your thighs. Tuck each testicle up into your abdominal cavity. Then, tuck your penis between your legs and pull up the gaff.

      "title": "Get a good bra.",
      "content": "Get a good bra. To find your bra size , measure around your chest a few inches below your nipples. For the cup size, bigger isn’t always better; B or C looks more natural. Anything will fill those cups , but chicken cutlets or silicone breast enhancers will look and feel real. As for cleavage, it's an illusion created with pecs and tape. Start by holding in your pecs with one hand. Take a strip of medical tape , and apply it like a sash, running from your underarm to your chest cavity. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear some wild makeup.",
      "content": "Wear some wild makeup. No drag queen is complete without her face on, and most \"faces\" are made up of wild shades of make-up (and false eyelashes) that can be seen from 50 rows back. It's not easy, either. Some queens report not being happy with their ability to do their own make-up for a whole year. [5] X Research source So start doing your own now; you'll appreciate the practice. It can be tempting to have someone else do it for you, but you don't want to have to depend on anyone else being at the reigns of your performance. And if you can do it yourself, you can mold your mask as your persona evolves. Not sure where to start? There are tons of tutorials for doing drag makeup online. It's also a good idea to talk to friends and confidants that have expertise in this area. They could do it for you once to create a template and you could work off that from there."

      "content": "Create your new persona's wardrobe. Is your other half a dynamic diva? Is she the girl next door, or is she fiery and fierce? Would she wear long, elegant dresses or mini-skirts and tube tops? Along with the makeup, this is where drag starts getting expensive. Start by just assembling one or two outfits. As you develop your act, you can assemble more. [6] X Research source To dress femininely , wear skirts and dresses to hide what you need to hide. They're comfortable and feminine, too. Choose tops with wider shoulders, longer sleeves, and lowered waistlines for longer torsos. Wear high heels . Nothing makes your legs sexier than a pair of high heels, but they're hard to find in big sizes at generic stores. Cross-dressing websites really come in handy here."

      "title": "Buy a nice wig.",
      "content": "Buy a nice wig. Odds are you won't be able to grow a healthy head of long, wavy, luxurious hair in the next few weeks, so wearing a wig is your best bet. In general, when it comes to wigs, the bigger the better, but as always, you’ll want your wig to accurately reflect your persona. Is she a blonde, a brunette, or a redhead? Curly or straight? Don’t be afraid to go for a bold color like pink or blue, either! [7] X Research source Consider shopping for you first wig in person so you can figure out which style best fits your face shape. For example, if you have a round face, a wig with long layers would help accentuate your cheekbones. Be sure to take good care of your wig. Wigs get surprisingly unkempt very easily. When you purchase yours (ideally you'll purchase it in person so you can try it on then and there), ask about care. How can you lengthen the life of your wig? The expert you're dealing with will give you tips on brushing and storage. If possible, hold on to your wig’s original packaging for storage. If you don’t have it, invest in a wig head to keep it from getting tangled. Human hair wigs are more expensive than synthetic wigs , but they last longer and look more realistic."

      "title": "Choose your drag name.",
      "content": "Choose your drag name. Your drag name and personality need to go hand-in-hand. Do you want something more refined like Latrice Royale, or something edgy, like Detox? Is your persona a diva, a dancer, a rule breaker? How does she interact with others? Is she sweet and sultry or spicy and bossy? Many drag queens like to use word play with their names, so take some time and come up with something fun and unique. [8] X Research source You can either choose your drag name first and build your persona around it, or vice versa! Many queens choose a last name, usually borrowing that of their \"drag mother\" (the drag queen their style is most heavily influenced by). However, you don't need to do this. If you don’t know where to start with your name, research other drag queens’ names to see what kind of wordplay they use. You can also get inspiration from pop culture, like your favorite movie or singer."

      "title": "Develop what kind of character you want to be.",
      "content": "Develop what kind of character you want to be. A lot of people have this conception of a drag queen as some ultimate diva, big-breasted and snarky, with an attitude pointier than her six-inch heels. This isn't always the case. In fact, not being this can make your act more interesting. Here is some inspiration: [9] X Research source The beauty queen type, like Shangela, is someone you'd never know was a man. Dena Cass is the dancer. When you see her on stage, you know you're in for great choreo. Detox is a fashionista. One look at her outfits and your jaw's on the floor. Nina West is a good example of the unique type. She dances to the beat of her own drum, and it works. While you may be inspired by your favorite drag queens, make sure your look and persona are unique to you. Having a distinct persona makes you more likely to stand out and gain a following, and it prevents possible tension between you and another drag queen if she thinks you copied her look."

      "title": "Figure out your act.",
      "content": "Figure out your act. Having an entertaining act is just as important as looking and acting the part. Lip-syncing is a fun and expected aspect of drag shows, so choose a song or two that fit your persona and come up with a dance to go with them. If you’re not much of a dancer, take a more comedic approach and wow the audience with dramatic gestures, facial expressions, and fun skits. [10] X Research source In the beginning, just worry about having two or three songs under your belt. You can do these over and over at different venues. As you become more well-known, you'll want to increase your repertoire. While lip-syncing is definitely one of the most common drag acts, it’s not the only one. These days, drag shows range from burlesque-style performances to sing-alongs and storytimes. You can also forgo the singing altogether and do a comedy act. Some drag queens, like Trixie Mattel, even perform live music. Themed drag brunches have also become super popular, in which the whole show is based around one singer or movie, like Dolly Parton or Twilight . Consider basing your act around something you love. Be sure to interact with the crowd, as this will get you more tips!"

      "content": "Let your look evolve. As you develop your character, you'll notice that she and her \"mask\" evolve over time. The things you used to do won't seem applicable anymore, and that also goes for her hair, make-up, and clothes. When something doesn't feel right anymore, it means you’ve outgrown it. That's a completely normal, good feeling. It means you're refining your queen into who she should be."

      "title": "Ignore the adversity.",
      "content": "Ignore the adversity. Let's face it: being a drag queen is no easy task. If you’re gay, life can be even more difficult, and if you're not, you can expect questions about your personal life till the cows come home. There will be people who \"don't get it,\" who think you want to be a woman, and who judge you. They serve no place in your life. Brush it off, because you are fabulous. [11] X Research source Let good thoughts be your sword and your shield. The community you're in will help you develop your positivity . When you're surrounded by others who help you feel good and make you your best, it's hard not to think positively. When the adversity comes, you can band together, making each of you individually stronger."

      "title": "Embrace and accept yourself for who you are.",
      "content": "Embrace and accept yourself for who you are. No matter who you are, no matter what you look like, no matter your home life or your career skills, you can be accepted into the drag community. The only requirement is that you let yourself shine as bright as you can shine. Are you ready to take the leap? [12] X Research source You don't even have to be a man to be a drag queen. With a larger-than-life personality and a nice set of false eyelashes, you can take on the world, no matter who you are or how you identify."

      "title": "Audition at local clubs and for events.",
      "content": "Audition at local clubs and for events. Find out where drag shows are held in your area and attend as many as possible. See how they work, and talk to the girls, the owner, and/or the hostess to find out how you can audition. The more involved you are with the community, in drag or not, the easier it’ll be to get a spot on stage. [13] X Research source This is no theatre audition. When you do show them your stuff, dress to the 9's in full hair and makeup and your best costume. Hopefully, you'll nab a weekly spot in their show. Be willing to start working for next to nothing, or even for free. When your career is just budding, the money won't be rolling in. Some venues simply offer experience as pay, others offer free drinks, and the higher end might roll in $50-$100. So don't quit your day job just yet; wait until you're the one naming prices. Charity events are a huge part of most drag queens' career experiences. They’re a great way to get your name out there and to show your support. However, charity events generally don't pay. You're not doing this for money; you're doing this to be a part of a community. Always be on time, whether that’s for an audition or a show of your own. No one likes waiting and it’s important to be respectful to your fellow drag queens and your audience! [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Build your online presence. These days, drag is more popular than ever, so it’s important to reach as large of an audience as possible. Make social media accounts, like on Instagram and TikTok, for your drag persona. Post videos of your performances, doing your makeup, and generally entertaining your audience. This serves as a portfolio for potential venues and promoters. [15] X Research source Be sure to interact with your fans and respond to their comments! The more engaging you are, the more likely you are to build a loyal following. Follow and interact with fellow drag queens, too! This helps you branch out and meet people outside of your local community, which opens up even more opportunities."

      "content": "Invest in supplies and accessories to further your career. Drag is not cheap. In addition to being a lifestyle, it is also a very expensive hobby. Expect to spend hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars on make-up, wigs, clothes, and shoes. You've got to look good! In this industry, you'll need to spend money to look good and you've got to look good to make money. [16] X Research source Very few drag queens make drag their full-time job. The vast majority do it in their spare time as their after-work passion."

      "content": "Develop a wider, more expansive repertoire as your experience grows. Just like a comedian can only get so many shows out of their material before they have to come up with a new sketch, a drag queen can only perform \"Hit Me Baby One More Time\" so many times before she has to work on a new act. When you feel ready for a new challenge, go for it. What other songs would your persona take on? Would she do them straight or would she play up the comedy? Does she work the crowd and use audience participation? What makes her song unique? [17] X Research source And with this comes new costumes and new make-up. If you're on a tight budget, see what pieces from your previous outfit you can work into a new one, maybe with new accessories and shoes."

      "title": "Support other queens and the community, no matter what.",
      "content": "Support other queens and the community, no matter what. For many, doing drag isn't just about doing drag. It's about being home. Not only are you at home in your persona, but you're at home with your fellow queens and fans. After you walk off the stage, your job isn't done. They cheered you on, and now you cheer them on. The camaraderie is what keeps many going, and instead of feeling competitive, most drag environments are about giving off an aura of love and acceptance. [18] X Research source The people willing to do drag and be in this environment are looking for you to be family, not looking for your faults. Many people, though by no means all, are going through some transition or some inner conflict, and it's this type of environment that makes them feel good. Be a part of it, and you'll fall in love with drag even more."
