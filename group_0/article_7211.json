If you do not have a \"Start\" button, look for other indicators that show what operating system you have. A Microsoft Windows logo or flag may mean you have a version of Windows that predates Windows 95, such as Windows 3.11. If you see a red hat in a corner of your screen, you are running the Red Hat Linux operating system. If you see a green or blue \"L\" in a screen corner, you have Lindows or Linspire. A gray or black footprint in a screen corner indicates you are using a graphical user interface (GUI) called GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME) on a form of Linux or UNIX. The Sun Solaris operating system is being used with X, a graphics system for UNIX, if you have a purple background with \"Sun\" or \"Solaris\" being visually indicated on your screen."
