      "content": "This sets you up to box out an opposing player and get the rebound. It doesn’t matter if you’re on offense or defense. Wait for the ball to be in the air on its way to the basket, then run and position yourself close to the backboard, anticipating the rebound. Often, watching an opponent pass the ball with peripheral vision can be mistaken for a shot, particularly if it is a lob pass across the court. Listen for your teammates yelling, \"shot\" in case someone takes a shot that you don’t see right away. If you see a shot taken, yell \"shot\" yourself so others can hear you."

      "content": "This allows you to anticipate the direction the rebound comes. Get in front of the player you’re boxing out and face the net, keeping your body between your opponent and the basket. Get ready to think quickly and go for the ball when it bounces off the rim or backboard! If you’re on defense and you are facing the player you’re guarding, make contact with your opponent’s chest using your forearm. Then, quickly turn your body to the opposite side of the arm you extended to back pivot into them and face the net. [1] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview. 9 March 2021."

      "title": "The player you box out can vary depending on what defense is being played.",
      "content": "The player you box out can vary depending on what defense is being played. If you’re playing man-to-man defense, box out whoever you are assigned to guard. Box out the closest person to you if you’re playing zone defense. Once you’re near the backboard after a shot, find the player and get ready to box them out. If it’s clear that a teammate will not be able to box out their own man, and their man is closer to the basket than your man, move to box out the opponent closest to the basket instead. If you're playing a high position in the zone, or closer to the top of the key, past the free throw line, try to select an opponent who is also above the key. If you're playing a low position, closer to the basket, try to find someone near you in the paint."

      "content": "This lets you use your base and core to keep the opponent away. Set your feet in a wide stance, preferably wider than your opponent’s. Squat down, stay balanced, and extend your buttocks slightly back towards the player you’re boxing out. [2] X Research source It’s okay to make contact with the player you’re guarding, just don’t aggressively shove them or anything like that or you might get a foul."

      "content": "Putting your arms out wide makes it harder to get around you. Keep your arms up, but make sure not to wrap them around your opponent. Trying to hold the player you’re guarding in place is a foul. Make sure to keep both your arms and legs spread wide to create a “box” that’s hard for the player you’re guarding to get around and go for the rebound from."

      "content": "This is the most effective way to get your opponent out of your zone. Use your arms to feel which direction the player is trying to get around you in and move with them. Stay in front of the player and push backwards with your butt to push them away from the basket. [3] X Research source If you feel that the opponent is moving in one direction, try to push them the opposite way to counteract their movement. Keep your wide stance and stay low as you move, using your body weight to keep the player you’re guarding from getting to the ball."

      "content": "Once you have your opponent boxed out, it’s time to go for the rebound. Keep your eyes on the ball, anticipating where it’s going to go, and get ready to move in the direction of the rebound. Don’t wait for the ball to come to you, but rather be ready to release your box out position and jump for the ball. [4] X Research source Stopping your opponent’s momentum is often enough to keep them from attempting a rebound, and even if they try to keep going, you have an advantage of position."

      "content": "Now it’s time to get that rebound. When the shot bounces off the basket in your direction, move into position where you think it’s coming and jump up to grab it with your arms fully extended. Try to meet the ball at the highest point of your jump and snatch the basketball firmly for a successful rebound. [5] X Research source As long as you time it right, it should be very difficult for the player you boxed out to get the rebound, even if they are taller than you."

      "content": "”Chinning” is the most effective way to secure the ball after a rebound. Do this by putting the ball underneath your chin and sticking your elbows out. Hold the ball tightly and refrain from dribbling for a second or two as many defenders will attempt to hit it out of your hands. [6] X Research source Don't swing your elbows, you don't want to commit a foul or hurt anyone, but bring them out as wide as possible to protect the ball."

      "content": "The heat’s on you now, so get rid of the ball to an open teammate. Look to throw an outlet pass to a streaking player or to a guard located near the sidelines. Ideally, Look for your point-guard and pass them the ball if they’re open. [7] X Research source If you just got a defensive rebound and you are the point-guard, look up the court for an open teammate close to the basket. Otherwise, look to set up your offense. If you’re a guard and you just got the defensive rebound, you can wait for the defenders to clear and dribble the ball up the court yourself."
