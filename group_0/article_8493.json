Wring out any excess water, so that the washcloth is not dripping. [1] X Research source Mice do not like water, so make sure the washcloth is not too soaked! It should be damp. [2] X Research source Be careful to not make the water hot or cold, as either end can upset a mouse’s skin if directly applied. Choose the softest washcloth available to you."

      "content": "Rub the mouse with water and puppy shampoo for an even deeper clean. If water alone could not get rid of that pesky smell, you can use a gentle puppy shampoo to help. [5] X Research source Use a washcloth to softly rub over and under the mouse’s fur. Continue this action until the smell is gone. Do not apply puppy shampoo directly to the mouse. Add the shampoo to water, which you can then dip your washcloth into. Ring out any excess. [6] X Research source Use a tiny amount of puppy shampoo. You will not need more than a few drops. [7] X Research source If the smell is not going away, it is likely that your mouse has a health issue. Take it to a veterinarian to get examined. [8] X Research source"

[10] X Research source Use a soft washcloth, as a harsh one can hurt the mouse. Do not air-dry or blow-dry the mouse.

Rinse thoroughly with water and dry well. [14] X Research source You can get disinfectant at your local pet store, grocery store, or online. If you cannot get disinfectant, you can use a water-soap mixture as a temporary substitute. [15] X Research source Make sure you dry the cage completely. A damp cage will add unwanted moisture to the new bedding. [16] X Research source"

Continue filling until the layer of bedding is around one inch thick. [18] X Research source Do not use pine or cedar wood shavings. They can release fumes that can make your mouse ill. [19] X Research source You can add shredded paper towels or straw to the bedding. These are soft materials that can also be used by your mouse to make a comfy nest.
