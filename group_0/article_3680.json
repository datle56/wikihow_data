      "content": "Try to alter your normal speaking range. Listen carefully as you speak during the course of the first day. When we don't pay good attention to how we use our speaking voices, we usually default to our lower registers. To increase your range upwards, add a \"lilt\" to your speaking style, or you might mimic the voice of a person younger than yourself, or you could even pretend to yourself that you're in a very happy, giddy mood. Use whatever works to get yourself to speak in overall higher tones. [1] X Research source Remember, speaking uses your vocal cords just like singing, so the way you speak might improve your singing style."

      "content": "Start working on your singing while speaking in a \"higher voice\", if you can. If you know how to do vocal exercises, start creeping up the scale a little every day. However, if you usually just sing regular songs, pick a song that is just a little uncomfortably high for you, and limit yourself to singing it gently and softly about 3 times per day. You stretch your vocal cords to sing higher notes, so you must sing them softly. Remember that voices are made of muscle, and it will take time to teach your muscles a new trick.
