Find the “adjusted closing prices” data, which will help you calculate your daily returns. Some sites may not include the adjusted closing prices or they may list the estimated closing price. If it doesn’t include the adjusted closing prices (which have been adjusted to be fully accurate), try looking up the company on another finance site."

Then, take that value and multiply it by 100 to find out the percentage of the return. [7] X Research source If your company’s stock closed at $200 a share and your daily return is $2 a share, you’d divide $2 by $200 to get a value of .01.

Add together the daily return values and then divide by the number of days in the time period to find out how much your stock’s price moves on an average day. [12] X Research source For instance, if you’re evaluating your stock over a 3-week period, you’d add together all of the daily return values and then divide by 21 to see how the stock performs on average. Another way to help evaluate a stock is to calculate its volatility to find out how variable its price is. Stock volatility is a numerical indication of how much the price of a specific stock varies. Remember, there's no way to predict what a stock will do over time—you can really only evaluate how it's currently performing.

Once your money is invested, you generally don’t have to do anything except allow the market to generate passive income on your stocks. But after a really good or a really bad day for the market, check your daily returns to get an idea of how your stocks are impacted. [14] X Research source For instance, if you hear that the market had a record-setting day, check your daily return to see how well your stocks did."

      "content": "Invest in stocks that perform well together by calculating the correlation coefficient . If you own stock in multiple companies, find out if they’re both performing well and seem to be correlated. Use the correlation value to help decide which of your stocks you want to invest more in and which ones you want to start thinking about selling. For instance, if you’re investing in 5 companies, and the stocks of 2 of them are both increasing in value, you could start investing more into them and less into the other 3 companies. Ideally, you should invest in a variety of stocks to protect your money. That way, if one performs badly, you won't lose everything you've invested.
