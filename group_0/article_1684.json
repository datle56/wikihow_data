    {
      "title": "An arcane focus is an item that acts as a conduit for arcane spells.",
      "content": "An arcane focus is an item that acts as a conduit for arcane spells. Any player character (PC) casting arcane spells can wield an arcane focus, using it in place of free material components to channel power for their spells. Arcane focuses are designed to make spellcasting easier for players, eliminating the need to constantly gather and stockpile material components. [1] X Research source There are three component types in 5e: verbal, somatic, and material. Verbal means a spell requires spoken words. Somatic means a spell requires hand gestures. Material means a spell requires physical ingredients (like incense or the petrified eye of a newt)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Arcane focuses can replace a spell’s free material components.",
      "content": "Arcane focuses can replace a spell’s free material components. Many spells require material components to cast—but if no monetary value is listed in the spell’s description, it means the components don’t cost any money. You can use an arcane focus to cast any spell with material components that don’t have an associated cost, with the focus taking the place of those components. [2] X Research source For example, say you want to cast the Dancing Lights cantrip. Its required material components are “a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm.” Since the description doesn’t include monetary values, you can use an arcane focus to cast Dancing Lights (instead of keeping phosphorus or wychwood on hand)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Characters must hold a focus and be proficient to use it.",
      "content": "Characters must hold a focus and be proficient to use it. Generally, unless otherwise stated in the rules, your PC has to be able to hold their arcane focus (and perform any other verbal or somatic components) to cast a spell successfully. Furthermore, if the arcane focus is something PCs can gain proficiency in, your character must have that proficiency. [3] X Research source For example, a crystal doesn’t require any proficiencies, but it’s possible to be proficient with a staff. So, if your PC has a staff focus, they must be proficient with it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Arcane focuses can’t replace other component types.",
      "content": "Arcane focuses can’t replace other component types. They can’t take the place of any verbal or somatic components. Most importantly, they can’t be used to replace material components with a monetary cost. So, if you want to cast a spell that explicitly requires material components worth a certain amount of money, you must have those components—not an arcane focus. [4] X Research source For example, Find Familiar is a simple 1st-level wizard spell that calls for 10 gold pieces (gp) worth of incense, charcoal, and herbs. So, you can’t use an arcane focus to cast Find Familiar—you must make sure to buy (or find) 10 gp worth of the required materials."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sorcerers, wizards, and warlocks can use an arcane focus.",
      "content": "Sorcerers, wizards, and warlocks can use an arcane focus. That’s because they’re all considered arcane spellcasters. However, other spellcasting classes in 5e can use different focuses. “Spellcasting focus” is the general term for all focuses, including arcane; sorcerers, wizards, and warlocks use arcane focuses, druids use druidic focuses, and clerics and paladins use holy symbols. [5] X Research source Similarly, bards typically use their instruments as a focus (although this isn’t explicitly stated in the rules for spellcasting focuses). All spellcasting focuses have the same function (the ability to replace free material components), even if they’re not technically considered arcane focuses."
    },
    {
      "title": "Multiclass characters can also use an arcane focus.",
      "content": "Multiclass characters can also use an arcane focus. Multiclassing in 5e means leveling up in more than one class. If your PC has any levels in sorcerer, wizard, or warlock (even if they also have levels in a different class), they can use an arcane focus. However, the arcane focus only applies to spells of the corresponding class. [6] X Research source For example, if your PC is a paladin/sorcerer multiclass, they can use an arcane focus for their sorcerer spells, but they’ll need a holy symbol for paladin spells. As of 5e’s 2024 Basic Rules, spellcasting subclasses (like Eldritch Knight fighters and Arcane Trickster rogues) can also use arcane focuses."
    },
    {
      "title": "Arcane focus",
      "content": "Arcane focus Arcane focuses can take multiple forms as described by 5e’s Basic Rules, but they’re generally bejeweled or carved for the purpose of casting magic. Arcane focuses can be any of the following: [7] X Research source Crystal Weight : 1 lb. Price : 10 gp Orb Weight : 3 lb. Price : 20 gp Rod Weight : 2 lb. Price : 10 gp Staff (Quarterstaff) Weight : 4 lb. Price : 5 gp Wand Weight : 1 lb. Price : 10 gp"
    },
    {
      "title": "Druidic focus",
      "content": "Druidic focus A druidic focus is a spellcasting focus specifically made for a druid character. Druids revere nature and, as a result, wield primal divine magic. Their druidic focuses are typically carved, painted, or tied with ribbon and can be any of the following: [8] X Research source Sprig of mistletoe Weight : none Price : 1 gp Wooden staff (Quarterstaff) Weight : 4 lb. Price : 5 gp Yew wand Weight : 1 lb. Price : 10 gp"
    },
    {
      "title": "Holy symbol",
      "content": "Holy symbol Clerics and paladins are holy warriors who channel power directly from the gods (or, in the case of paladins, from sacred oaths they make). Thus, both classes use holy symbols as spellcasting focuses—typically a symbol of the deity or power they revere. Holy symbols can be any of the following: [9] X Research source Amulet (can be worn or held) Weight : 1 lb. Price : 5 gp Emblem (can be worn on fabric or a shield) Weight : none Price : 5 gp Reliquary (must be held) Weight : 2 lb. Price : 5 gp"
    },
    {
      "title": "Players can work with their DM to create a homebrew arcane focus.",
      "content": "Players can work with their DM to create a homebrew arcane focus. If you have an idea for an arcane focus that isn’t listed above (like a weapon, magic item, or trinket unique to your PC), tell your DM! Homebrewing and house rules are very common in D&D, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with putting your own spin on an arcane focus so long as it’s DM-approved. [10] X Research source For example, say you’re playing a Hexblade warlock and want to use their pact weapon as a focus. You could ask your DM about it (and would likely be able to do that). Even Jeremy Crawford (a lead rules designer for D&D 4e and 5e) has said on X (Twitter at the time) that it wouldn’t be unreasonable for a DM to allow an Eldritch Knight to use their bonded weapon as a focus."
    },
    {
      "title": "A focus isn’t mandatory but is extremely useful for most spellcasters.",
      "content": "A focus isn’t mandatory but is extremely useful for most spellcasters. Technically, you aren’t required to use an arcane focus. However, since you’ll automatically get one while creating a sorcerer, wizard, or warlock from level 1—and because they can save you from having to hunt down spell reagents—it definitely makes the most sense to use one. [11] X Research source Instead of an arcane focus, you can alternatively use a component pouch. Component pouches are small belt pouches designed to hold all spell components without a specific cost (so you can just use the pouch instead of keeping track of each individual component)."
