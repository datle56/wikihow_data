You probably already have some in your pantry! [1] X Research source Alternatively, make the mixture in a bowl or cup and apply it with a cloth. Combining equal parts apple cider vinegar and water also works well."

If the surface isn’t clean enough for you after a single application, you can repeat the process until the grime is gone. [3] X Research source If your fridge is stainless steel, wipe in the direction of the stainless steel’s grain. For stainless steel fridges, you can also polish the surface after wiping down the vinegar solution: add 2-3 drops of olive oil to a microfiber cloth, and then buff in the direction of the grain. Repeat once a week or as needed. [4] X Research source"
