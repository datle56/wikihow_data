      "content": "The Ayatul Kursi is the most powerful verse in the Qur’an. The Ayatul Kursi (آيَةُ ٱلْكُرْسِيِّ), also known as the Throne Verse, is the 255th verse of Al-Baqara (الْبَقَرَة), the second chapter of the Qu’ran. This verse speaks about how Allah (الله) is the one and only God and that there is nothing that can compare to Him. The Ayatul Kursi tells of Allah’s all-powerfulness and His reign over Heaven and Earth. [1] X Research source Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud (عبد الله بن مسعود), a companion of the prophet Muhammad (مُحَمَّد), claimed that the Ayatul Kursi was the greatest verse in the Qur’an."

To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.

Just say the Ayatul Kursi before you go to sleep and Allah will send someone to guard you from the Devil. [3] X Research source There’s another belief that you must recite the first 4 verses of Al-Baqara (the second chapter of the Qur’an), the Ayatul Kursi, the 2 verses that follow the Ayatul Kursi, and the last 3 verses of the chapter to be protected through the night.

Upon discovering that he was being followed by the jinn, he recited the Ayatul Kursi. When he recited the line “His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not,” the jinn were no longer able to follow him. He recited this line over and over until the jinn faded away. [6] X Research source Because of this story, some followers of Islam believe that reciting the Ayatul Kursi will keep these invisible creatures away."

Saying the Ayatul Kursi after salah (صَلَاة), the 5 daily prayers, is considered by many Muslims to be one of the greatest good deeds. Abu Umamah al Bahili (أبو أمامة البَاهليّ), a companion of Muhammad, said, “Whoever recites the ‘verse of the Throne’ after every prescribed prayer, there will be nothing standing between him and entry into Paradise but his death.” [7] X Research source The prayers of salah occur at dawn, noon, later afternoon, after sunset, and at dusk."
