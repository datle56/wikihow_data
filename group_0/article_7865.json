      "content": "Remove your showerhead from the fixture by twisting it off. To soak your showerhead in vinegar to clean it, start by taking it off of the fixture. Most showerheads can simply be twisted counterclockwise to unscrew them. Some showerheads have a nut holding the threading together that requires a wrench to unscrew them. [1] X Research source Showerheads that can be lifted off of the fixture and held usually have two buttons on the side. Press both buttons at the same time and hold them down. Then, lift the showerhead out of the water supply line to remove it. If it isn’t difficult for you to remove the showerhead from your fixture, this is the best way to remove limescale."

The amount of vinegar and water you use is dependent upon the size of your bowl and the size of your showerhead. Add enough water and vinegar to submerge the showerhead entirely.

[6] X Research source If you simply unscrewed the showerhead, screw it back on the opposite way. If you pressed 2 buttons and lifted the showerhead out, press the 2 buttons again and slide it back in. Use a wrench to tighten any nuts that you loosened to remove the showerhead."

If you have a rain showerhead, you may need to use a garbage bag. Thinner fixtures can use a sandwich or carrier bag. Your bag cannot have any holes in it, so if you aren’t sure if your bag is airtight, partially fill it with a little water to see if it leaks. If it’s really difficult for you to remove the showerhead from the fixture, this is the easiest way to remove limescale from your showerhead."

Insert each toothpick 1–2 centimetres (10–20 mm) into each nozzle to clear any limescale that has been trapped inside.
