      "content": "Try basic, non-rhyming quarter calls if you're a beginner. The purpose of quarter calls is to call on the elements of the 4 corners of the earth, which represent earth, air, fire, and water. When you're first getting started, it's easiest just to appeal directly to the elements and ask them to come help you. In your calls, you can use “guardians” and “spirits” interchangeably. Similarly, it's okay to use the direction and the element interchangeably, such as north/earth, east/air, south/fire, and west/water."
