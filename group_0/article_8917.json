    {
      "title": "Shorten or lengthen the first name.",
      "content": "Shorten or lengthen the first name. The most basic and common type of nickname is a shortened version of someone’s real name. For example, Alexander is shortened to Alex or Al, Katherine to Kate or Katie, Richard to Rick or Dick, and so on. [1] X Research source You can also lengthen your name by adding an “ee” sound with the letters “-ey” or “-ie.” For example, the name Hazel can become “Hazey,” or the name “Fran” can become “Frannie.”"

      "title": "Create a cool nickname using initials.",
      "content": "Create a cool nickname using initials. Combine the first letter of your first and last names or the first letter of your first and middle names. Going by your initials can help differentiate you from others if you have a common name or make a difficult or long name easier to pronounce. [2] X Research source This works well if your middle or last name begins with “J,” “D,” or “T.” For example, Daniel Joseph can be shortened to “DJ,” Andrew Johnson to “AJ,” Jonathon Jameson to “JJ,” or James Taylor to “JT.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a last name as a nickname.",
      "content": "Use a last name as a nickname. You can also abbreviate or shorten your last name. For example, someone with the name Alison Tadmor could go by just “Tadmor” or the shorter “Tadz.” This works well in sports or at work, especially if you have a common first name. Most athletes go by their last name since it’s on the back of their jerseys."

    {
      "title": "Describe a unique physical attribute or personality trait.",
      "content": "Describe a unique physical attribute or personality trait. Think of a good feature about yourself or a friend and use that as inspiration for a nickname. For example, the 16th U.S. president, Abraham Lincoln, is often called “Honest Abe” for his integrity. Be careful not to offend anyone and focus on positive, not negative, attributes. If someone is smart, call them “Prof” or “Doc.” Similarly, a creative person could be called “Muse” or “Da Vinci.”"

    {
      "title": "Create a nickname based on a job or hobby.",
      "content": "Create a nickname based on a job or hobby. Find inspiration from where you’re from or what you do. You can go by “Chef” if you like to cook, “Mustang” if you like cars, or “Wormy” if you like to read. [3] X Research source These nicknames could apply to hobbies or your actual occupation. Some people assign career-based nicknames to differentiate two people they know with the same name. For example, they may distinguish between two friends named “Hannah” in conversation by referring to them as “Teacher Hannah” and “Dentist Hannah.”"

      "title": "Base a nickname around where someone lives or is from.",
      "content": "Base a nickname around where someone lives or is from. Some states have nicknames specific to them, like how people from Indiana are called “Hoosiers.” You could also call a friend who lives in the city a “City Slicker” or combine a name with an alliterative geography word like “Southern Sammy” or “Townie Tim.”"

    {
      "title": "Use linguistic diminutives to make your nickname.",
      "content": "Use linguistic diminutives to make your nickname. Many cultures and languages use diminutives to add more affection to a name. If you or the person you’re creating a cool nickname for has a cultural heritage or family tradition regarding names, you can craft the nickname using those. Spanish speakers often add “-ito” or “-ita” to the end of the name, like Sara → Sarita or Juan → Juanito. [4] X Research source In Indian languages like Hindi or Tamil, they often take the first syllable and add “u,” like Namrata → Namu or Ashvini → Ashu. In Japanese, suffixes like “kun” (くん) or chan (ちゃん) are added to male and female names, respectively."

      "title": "Use a childhood nickname.",
      "content": "Use a childhood nickname. Rediscovering a nickname from childhood can be a fun way to bring nostalgia and uniqueness to your name. Ask parents or family members about any cute or funny nicknames they used to use. For example, maybe your best friend’s parents called her “Ducky” as a toddler because her favorite toy was a rubber duck. If she’s okay with it, you could start calling her “Ducky” now that you’re older!"

      "title": "Use a retro or vintage nickname.",
      "content": "Use a retro or vintage nickname. Revive a nickname that used to be popular but has since fallen out of use. For example, nicknames “Slick,” “Skippy,” “Biff,” “Dottie,” and “Kittie” were all popular in the 1940s and 1950s. Popular nicknames during the Victorian Era include “Josie,” “Millie,” “Maisie,” “Fritz,” and “Augie.” [5] X Research source Look for inspiration from old TV shows or movies. For example, character nicknames on The Little Rascals include Alfalfa, Junior, Froggy, Pineapple, and Buckwheat. The popular musical and movie Grease (1978) includes members of the “Pink Ladies” (Rizzo, Frenchy, and Marty) and the “T-Birds” (Doody and Kenickie). [6] X Research source"

For example, if someone’s name is Ellie, you could call them “‘Ells Bells” as a play off the phrase “hells bells.” To make an anagram from someone’s name, rearrange the letters like the singer “Halsey” did to create a stage name from her real first name, “Ashley.” [7] X Research source Add an alliterative word or rhyme to the name, like “Groovy Greta” or “Anna Banana.”"
