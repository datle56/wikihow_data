There is no universally-accepted, federal registration form—you’ll have to interface with your state’s own, separate web portal in order to register. This makes specific instruction more difficult, but state-by-state help exists . Luckily, the U.S. Government has built a website to point you in the right direction. Even heading to the Democratic National Committee’s website doesn’t provide any appropriate links, unfortunately. It will, however, provide you with a wealth of information once you’re good and registered! Every state doesn’t have an online registration form yet. Currently, only 23 states support online registration.

Some states also revoke the voting rights of convicted felons."

In selecting Florida, we’re instead presented with a graphic detailing a three-step mail-in process. For states requiring mail-in forms, you’ll click the button to download the form, then follow all subsequent instructions for mailing it in. If you don’t have a printer, they’re often available for use at your local public library. In selecting New Hampshire, we’ll be dealing with a state that does not support online registration or recognize the National Mail Voter Registration Form . Instead, we must register in person at our local election office. Clicking the button in the window will provide a list to help us determine where the most convenient office is."
