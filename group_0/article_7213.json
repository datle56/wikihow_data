      "title": "Check each outlet to see if all of them are affected.",
      "content": "Check each outlet to see if all of them are affected. If you have more than one phone jack, test each jack individually to determine if it’s a particular jack or if the phone line itself is having issues. First, unplug all of the devices in your home, including phones, fax machines , and modems. Then, use a phone to test each jack to see if only one is affected. [5] X Research source If only one jack is affected, call your phone company to get a service call for that individual jack. This might save you money since you know where the problem is occurring."

      "content": "Listen for a dial tone on your phone’s receiver. Hang up your phone to make sure the line is clear. Then, see if there’s a dial tone. If you hear a dial tone, the problem with your phone line is inside your house. If this is the case, you’ll likely need to get the phone line inside your home repaired. If you don’t hear a dial tone, there is likely an issue with the phone company’s lines that are coming to your home. Call your telephone provider and request that they check your line."

      "content": "Test the phone company signal by touching the voltmeter to the wires. This is optional but you can confirm that you’re getting a signal from the phone company. Set your voltmeter to volts or VDC. Then, touch the negative probe to the red telephone wire and the positive probe to the green telephone wire. Check the meter to make sure there’s a voltage reading, which is typically 45-48 mV. [16] X Research source If there’s no reading, or it’s zero or near zero, you likely aren’t getting a signal from the phone company. Call the phone company to schedule a service call for repairs. If you have a second line, you can test the second line by touching the negative probe to the yellow wire, and the positive probe to the black wire."

      "title": "Touch each multimeter or voltmeter lead to one of the phone wires.",
      "content": "Touch each multimeter or voltmeter lead to one of the phone wires. Mitchell explains that to test continuity with a multimeter, you'll need to touch the leads to the ends of each wire. Touch the leads to the wires that line up to reduce the risk of the wires crossing. If you’re using a voltmeter, touch the negative probe to the red wire and the positive probe to the green wire. [19] X Research source If you have a second line, you can test the second line by touching the negative probe to the yellow wire, and the positive probe to the black wire."

      "title": "Check for continuity to see if the line has a fault.",
      "content": "Check for continuity to see if the line has a fault. Mitchell, who uses a Fluke to test for continuity, explains that you should get a reading and/or hear a beep if there's continuity. If there is no continuity, it’s a sign that the wires are touching somewhere in your home or that you have a jack that’s burnt out. When the wires touch, it creates a phone line fault that prevents your phone service from working properly. [20] X Research source Generally, you’re responsible for repairing the wiring inside your home. Your phone company may send a service person out to fix the wiring at your cost. However, they might recommend hiring a general contractor to access wiring inside your walls. If you are unsure if your multimeter is working properly, you can test it by measuring the volts from a battery or testing the continuity of a fuse."

      "title": "Test each pair of phone wires to see if there are any faulty lines.",
      "content": "Test each pair of phone wires to see if there are any faulty lines. Check the external wiring first. If there are no connectivity issues, it’s likely that your wiring is not faulty. If you detect a connectivity issue, test the wiring that goes into each phone jack to see where the issue is occurring. When you call the phone company, tell them that your internal wiring is not showing any problems or specify which telephone jack appears to be the issue. This may help them fix the problem faster and could save you money since you know the problem isn’t on your end."

      "title": "Dial the phone number you want to check.",
      "content": "Dial the phone number you want to check. The best way to find out if a line is busy is to call it. Use your mobile phone or a landline to make the call. If the line is open, you’ll hear the line ringing. If you hear a busy signal, someone is likely using that phone line. You’ll also get a busy signal if the phone was accidentally left off the hook or someone else is dialing the number at the same time you are. In some cases, you might get a fast busy signal or a busy signal after a ring if your phone number is blocked. It’s best to try the number several times before you assume something is wrong. However, spread out your calls so you aren’t constantly dialing the number. It’s possible that there is a fault in the phone line if you’re constantly getting a busy signal. [21] X Research source"
