[1] X Research source The inspector will give you advice on regulations for stairs, handrails, guards and other elements that may be subject to municipal codes. Draw up your final plans based on the inspector's recommendations and requirements, and get all necessary permits before you begin building—especially electrical permits, if that will be part of your new deck."

      "content": "Lay out the deck around the pool using stakes driven into the ground. Pull a string line from the corners to establish the outside perimeter of the deck. For our example, we'll assume a 21-foot pool. Mark the location of an interior post about 1' (30 cm) from the edge of the pool. Locate the next post 4 feet (1.2 m) away from that point. The perimeter edge of your deck shouldn't be more than 4 feet (1.2 m) away from a post. To find out how many interior posts you will need, add the distance from pool to post, multiply that by 2 and add it to the diameter of the pool, then multiply the total by pi (3.14159). That will give you the circumference. Now divide that number by 4 to get the number of posts you will need. In this case, the post is 1 foot (0.3 m) from the pool, and the pool is 21 feet (6.4 m) in diameter: (1x2 + 21) * π ÷ 4 = (23 * π) ÷ 4 = 18.06. You will need 18 posts for the inner ring."

Use spacers between decking boards to allow for drainage and expansion. 1/4\" or 3/8\" spacers are common, but you can use 1/2\" spacers if more expansion is expected.
