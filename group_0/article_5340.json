[5] X Research source For example, the digits in 3,989,978,579,968,769,877 add up to 141. You can then add again: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 {\\displaystyle 1+4+1=6} .

[6] X Research source Note that only even numbers are divisible by 4. Multiples of 100 are always divisible by 4. [7] X Research source Another way to check for divisibility by 4 is to divide the number by 2 twice. If the quotient is still a whole number, the original number is divisible by 4. [8] X Research source For example, 876 2 = 438 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {876}{2}}=438} , and then 438 2 = 219 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {438}{2}}=219} .

If the difference is divisible by 7, then the whole number is divisible by 7. [11] X Research source For example, to find out if 567 is divisible by 7, first separate the last digit from the number. This gives you 56 and 7. Double the last digit, 7: 7 × 2 = 14 {\\displaystyle 7\\times 2=14} . Then, subtract 14 from 56: 56 − 14 = 42 {\\displaystyle 56-14=42} .

[14] X Research source If, after adding up the sum of all the component parts of a number which comes out to another two digit or bigger number the sum is exposed, take that number and add it's component parts. (Take for example 189: 1+8+9=18...if you then take 1+8 you will get 9. Therefore, 189 is evenly divisible by 9.) You can repeat the addition of digits if the original sum is too long for you to gauge divisibility by 9. [15] X Research source For example, the digits in 3,989,978,579,968,769,877 add up to 141.

First determine whether the number is even. 456 is even, since it ends in 6. Then, determine whether the sum of the digits is divisible by 3. So, you would calculate 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 {\\displaystyle 4+5+6=15} . The number 15 is divisible by 3. Since 456 passes both tests, it is divisible by 6."

Which digits will evenly divide into this number? 1 divides evenly into the number, since any number is divisible by 1. 2 divides evenly into the number, since 1,336 is even. 3 does not divide evenly into the number, since the sum of its digits is 13, and 13 is not divisible by 3. 4 divides evenly into the number, since the last two digits, 36, is divisible by 4. 5 does not divide evenly into the number, since 1,336 does not end in 5 or 0. 6 does not divide evenly into the number. While it is an even number, the sum of its digits is not divisible by 3. 7 does not divide evenly into the number. When you double the last digit (6), and subtract it from the remaining digits, you get 133 − 12 = 121 {\\displaystyle 133-12=121} . Since 121 is not divisible by 7, neither is 1,336. 8 divides evenly into the number, since the last three digits, 336, is divisible by 8. 9 does not divide evenly into the number, since the sum of its digits is 13, and 13 is not divisible by 9."
