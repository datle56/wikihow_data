Dressing for current trends just shows that you put way too much thought into that outfit and that you’ve been following fashion news like a broker watching stocks. Choose classic styles in classic cuts for a more effortless look that looks good for years.

What colors are popular and what colors are considered absolutely hideous is very dependent on time and place. Just look at your mom’s clothes from the 1970s, for example. In order to look effortlessly stylish, you’re going to want a more timeless look, which means sticking to more muted and neutral colors. This can, however, be broken up with bold accent colors, especially on accessories. [6] X Expert Source Alice Wu Image Consultant Expert Interview. 12 June 2020 Muted colors include tan, black, white, denim/navy blue, and gray. Good accent colors include most shades of red, many shades of blue, plum/eggplant purple, golden yellow (like rubber ducks or tulips), and emerald green. Be careful of certain colors. Be wary of other greens and yellows, and generally avoid oranges, as these colors are very prone to going in and out of fashion, but, if you think they are stylish, go for it."

If you really want to put the effortless into effortless style, you’ll want a wardrobe where nearly all of the pieces match with each other. This will let you get dressed based on comfort, style preference, or weather conditions, instead of being limited by color or style combinations. Use a single clothing style (vintage, modern, etc.) and the use a single color palette (this should be helped if you followed our advice to use muted colors with limited bold accents)."

Get them tailored, of course! Find a reliable tailor in your area to alter your clothes so that they are perfect for your body. Even some department stores will do this for you. It’s not as expensive as it sounds. Tailoring a shirt often costs as little as $10-20, pants around $30-40. It may seem like a silly added expense, but having clothes tailored once and keeping them maintained will help you look amazing for the next ten years. It’s a worthy investment."

Since your clothes themselves should generally be in muted, neutral colors, you’ll want to make your accessories your accent pieces. These should draw attention and look extra cool. It is easier to have accessories that conform to the latest fashions and trends, so don’t worry about that as much (in this area, it’s usually okay). [13] X Research source For example, you could pair a floppy hat and patterned fashion scarf with a brown jacket, blue tee, white skinny jeans, and brown boots. Another example would be to wear a black dress and pair it with red earrings and a bracelet. Just make sure you keep your color palette across the whole outfit. Accent accessories colors should generally be the same or compliment each other."

This means no gel or hairspray! It is best to consider updating your hairstyle annually.

Do you know a guy who wears a tracksuit and still somehow manages to look totally fashionable? What the fashion industry doesn’t want you to know is that a lot of looking stylish really comes down to projecting confidence. You don’t have to actually be confident, of course, but if you walk down the street in clothes that you clearly think you look great in, people will usually be inclined to agree that (at a minimum) those clothes are perfect for you. Act like you don’t care - or, actually don't care. The effortless part of the stylish look should of course be presented by giving off an air that you don’t care, or that you just threw on the first outfit you could find. Be humble or indifferent when people compliment your clothes."
