If her favorite music has a danceable beat, put some on and challenge her to a dance duel. If that doesn’t feel right, you can always do a silly little jig for her every time you hear a specific song. [1] X Research source If she loves a particular movie with a dance scene in it, try to recreate it with her."

      "content": "Start a pillow fight when she least expects it. Wait until you’re watching a movie or just chilling on the couch, then lightly bonk her on the head or shoulder with a soft pillow and yell, “Pillow fight!” Hopefully, she’ll squeal with laughter, grab the nearest pillow, and join in. Be sure to do this when things are calm and normal. If you know she’s upset about something or you just had a serious conversation, it’s not a good idea. Don’t hit her too hard! A light bonk is all you need to start a pillow duel. If it’s summertime, consider a water balloon fight instead!"

Then, just start building the fort. It won’t take her long to ask you what on earth you’re doing. Reply in a serious voice, “Building a blanket fort for movie night, of course. Wanna help?” When you’re done, snuggle up in your blanket fort and watch a movie or listen to music."

      "content": "Keep banter positive and lighthearted. There are different ways to be funny in conversation, but if your goal is to be silly and fun, avoid negative humor. Generally, teasing her and ridiculing her aren’t good strategies – even if it’s all in good fun, there can be a negative edge to it. Ridiculing and teasing other people to make her laugh also isn’t a great look. Sarcasm and self-deprecating humor can be hit or miss, too. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you’re certain your girlfriend enjoys sarcastic remarks, dark humor, or light teasing, go for it! It all depends on her humor style. If you aren't sure, don't go there."

For example, change the language setting on her phone or leave her a ransom note for something ridiculous, like her running shoes or a sandwich. You might take her sandwich out of the fridge and leave a note that says, “I'm holding your precious sandwich hostage. Unless you meet my demand of 10 kisses, you won’t be having lunch today.”"

When you’re in the room together, narrate every little thing that’s happening: what you’re thinking, what she’s thinking, what you’re seeing, etc. You can even narrate in a particular genre or style, like a detective/thriller or nature documentary. Hopefully, she’ll join in and you can trade off! For example, for a nature documentary narration, you could say something like, “Watch the elusive Kristin as she devours a pizza slice in her natural habitat. She stalks her slice from the couch before she goes in for the kill...”"
