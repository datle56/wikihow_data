      "content": "Enclose short quotes in double quotation marks. The MLA defines a \"short\" quotation as one that is fewer than 4 lines of text. This refers to 4 lines of your paper, not lines in the original source. Place double quotation marks at the start and the end of the quoted material.

      "title": "Use a block quote to set off quotations longer than 4 lines.",
      "content": "Use a block quote to set off quotations longer than 4 lines. Start block quotes on a new line. Indent the entire paragraph 5 spaces or one standard paragraph indent from the left margin of the rest of your paper. Maintain double-spaced lines, just as in the rest of your paper. [2] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Do not use double quotation marks around the outside of a block quote. If the quoted material crosses a paragraph break, use a block quote even if the quoted material is less than 4 lines. Indent the first line of the second paragraph to indicate that it is the start of a new paragraph."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your parenthetical citation immediately after the quoted material.",
      "content": "Place your parenthetical citation immediately after the quoted material. The parenthetical citation includes the last name of the author and the page number (or range) where the quoted material appears in the original source. [3] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Cite short quotes after the closing quotation marks, but before the closing punctuation. For example: Dreams may express \"profound aspects of personality\" (Foulkes 184). If a short quote is used in the middle of a sentence of your own words, cite immediately after the quote. For example: According to some, dreams express \"profound aspects of personality\" (Foulkes 184), though others disagree. With block quotes, type the parenthetical citation outside the closing punctuation."

    {
      "title": "Use brackets around changes in quoted text.",
      "content": "Use brackets around changes in quoted text. You may need to modify a quotation so that it flows seamlessly into your own writing. Place square brackets around the changed material to show that the original has been altered. [4] X Research source Example: Margaret Atwood wants her readers to see that \"[r]eading is also a process and it also changes [them]\" (30). You may also need to adjust for tense. For example: According to Margaret Atwood, reading can \"also change[ ] you\" (30). The brackets around the space indicate that the s was removed from the end of the word changes . If you find that you're having to change a significant portion of the quotation, try recasting your own surrounding sentences so that the quotation fits better. You might also want to paraphrase it rather than using a direct quotation."

    {
      "title": "Make note of errors in the original but don't change them.",
      "content": "Make note of errors in the original but don't change them. You may find a typographical or grammatical error in a passage that you still want to quote. Place the word sic in square brackets immediately after the error. This indicates that's how the passage appears in the original source, and the error isn't yours. Since sic is a Latin word, it should be italicized. [5] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Example: Wang, Koh, Song, and Hou hypothesized that \"compared with their Asian American counterparts, European American[s] . . . would endorse more self, social and emotion regulation functions and less [ sic ] directive functions\" (28). Avoid going overboard with your sic notations. Use it only for typographical or grammatical errors, not to make editorial statements about the word choice of your source. If a passage has too many errors, either try to find a more authoritative reference or paraphrase the source."

    {
      "title": "Place ellipsis where words are omitted in your quote.",
      "content": "Place ellipsis where words are omitted in your quote. If you only want to quote parts of a sentence, an ellipsis (3 dots or periods separated by spaces) lets your readers know you've left part of it out. MLA recommends putting the ellipsis in brackets, so your readers know the ellipsis itself is not part of the original passage. [6] X Research source Example: According to one scholar, \"There are many indications that many of Picasso's circle [. . .] already saw Picasso and Matisse as [. . .] the two rival personalities most likely to influence the course of twentieth century painting\" (Golding 155)."

      "title": "Use double quotations for quotes fewer than 40 words.",
      "content": "Use double quotations for quotes fewer than 40 words. Only the shortest quotations are kept in line with the body of your paper in APA style. Enclose the directly quoted material in double quotation marks. APA favors embedding brief quoted material within a sentence of your own words. [7] X Research source Example: Several commentators have suggested that \"business education may have a deleterious effect on the morality and ethics of managers\" (Assudani et. al., 2011, p. 104)."

    {
      "title": "Cite short quotations immediately after the closing quotation marks.",
      "content": "Cite short quotations immediately after the closing quotation marks. For in-line quotations of fewer than 40 words, include a parenthetical citation inside the closing punctuation. A full parenthetical citation contains the author's last name, year, and page number. [8] X Research source Example: In fact, \"a flexible mind is a healthy mind\" (Palladino & Wade, 2010, p. 147). If you include the names of the authors in your text, don't include them in the parenthetical citation. Place a parenthetical with the year after the authors' names, then include a parenthetical with the page number at the end of the quotation. For example: According to Palladino and Wade (2010), \"a flexible mind is a healthy mind\" (p. 147). If you include the year and the names of the authors in your text, your parenthetical would only include the page number. For example: In 2010, Palladino and Wade noted that \"a flexible mind is a healthy mind\" (p. 147)."

      "title": "Set off longer quotes from the rest of your text.",
      "content": "Set off longer quotes from the rest of your text. If you want to quote a passage of greater than 40 words, APA style requires a block quote. Start the quotation on a new line, and indent the entire block quote a standard paragraph indent from the left margin of the rest of your text. [9] X Research source Unlike with in-line quotations, the parenthetical citation at the end of the block quote is placed after the closing punctuation. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make limited changes to quoted text as necessary.",
      "content": "Make limited changes to quoted text as necessary. APA style normally does not permit changing quoted material to fit the flow of your sentence, or to match your writing in tense, subject, or number. However, you can change the first letter of a quote to upper- or lowercase to fit in line with your sentence. You do not have to make note of this change. [11] X Research source Format the text exactly as it appears in the original source. However, if you want to emphasize certain words or phrases in the quotation, you can italicize them. Type \"emphasis added\" in the parenthetical following the quotation. For example: The APA's Publication Manual (2010) states that \"the first letter of the first word in a quotation may be changed to an uppercase or a lowercase letter \" without noting this change in the citation (p. 172, emphasis added)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add nouns to quotations to clarify pronoun usage.",
      "content": "Add nouns to quotations to clarify pronoun usage. APA style permits the addition of a noun to quoted text if it is necessary to clarify the subject of the quotation. Normally this will be necessary when the original author uses a pronoun after previously naming the subject. Enclose your additions in square brackets. [12] X Research source For example, suppose your original source states \"when they get the diploma, they'll more likely get the job.\" You want to use this quotation in your paper, but it's unclear who they are in the quotation. You could use the noun in your sentence, or you could change the first they to the subject noun: \"when [students] get the diploma, they'll more likely get the job.\""

      "title": "Use sic in square brackets to mark mistakes in the original text.",
      "content": "Use sic in square brackets to mark mistakes in the original text. If you run across a typographical or grammatical error in a source, don't change it. Mark it so your readers know the mistake wasn't yours. [13] X Research source Example: The study questioned the effectiveness of the new drug, since \"sickness occurred even when reel [ sic ] drugs were administered\" (Miele, 1993, p.124)."

      "title": "Use an ellipsis to indicate omissions of parts of the quoted work.",
      "content": "Use an ellipsis to indicate omissions of parts of the quoted work. Three spaced periods indicates the omission of a few words from the middle of a sentence. If your omission crosses more than one sentence, use 4 spaced periods. Include any original punctuation on either side of the omitted material. [14] X Research source For example, you could write: To make a high-performing employee visible to the community, “some industries have formal rankings that broadcast the best and brightest workers . . ., and some organizations provide companywide performance results and publicly recognize top performers” (Call et al., 2015, p. 629). Do not place ellipsis points at the beginning or end of a quotation."

      "title": "Place direct quotes in double quotation marks.",
      "content": "Place direct quotes in double quotation marks. For shorter quotes that are fewer than 100 words or approximately 5 lines of text, type them in line with the body of your paper, enclosed in double quotation marks. Place a superscript number for the footnote at the end of the quote, outside the closing quotation marks. [15] X Research source Text example: Martin Luther King Jr. said of the Emancipation Proclamation, \"This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering justice.\" 7 Footnote example: 7. Martin Luther King Jr., \"I Have a Dream\" (speech, Washington, DC, August 28, 1963), American Rhetoric, http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm."

      "title": "Create block quotes for direct quotations of more than 100 words.",
      "content": "Create block quotes for direct quotations of more than 100 words. Longer quotations start on a new line and are indented the standard paragraph indentation. Indent all lines, not just the first one. Do not enclose the text in quotation marks. Place the superscript number for the footnote at the end of the block quote, outside the closing punctuation. [16] X Research source Typically, 100 words are 5 lines or more. If you're unsure, type the quote out and highlight it on your word processing program to get the word count. Also use block quotes if you're quoting a passage that crosses 2 paragraphs, such as the last sentence of one paragraph and the first sentence of the next, even if the quoted portion is less than 100 words."

    {
      "title": "Include the specific page number in footnotes for direct quotations.",
      "content": "Include the specific page number in footnotes for direct quotations. Cite the specific page number where the quoted material appears as the last element of your footnote. Place a period after the page number. [17] X Research source Example: Salman Rushdie, The Ground beneath Her Feet (New York: Henry Holt, 1999), 25. If the source is not paginated, use a chapter or paragraph number, if available. For example: Mullan, How Novels Work , chap. 2, Recollections."

      "title": "Edit quotations to flow with your text.",
      "content": "Edit quotations to flow with your text. Chicago style permits liberal adjustments to allow quotations embedded into your own sentences to match your tense and subject. Just enclose any changes you make in square brackets to indicate they did not appear in the original text. [18] X Research source For example: Looking back on her life with multiple sclerosis, Nancy Mairs declares that \"[she] was never a beautiful woman, and for that reason [she has] spent most of [her] life . . . suffering from the shame of falling short of an unattainable standard.\""

    {
      "title": "Correct obvious typographical errors without comment.",
      "content": "Correct obvious typographical errors without comment. Many other styles suggest using the word sic in brackets after typographical or grammatical errors in a quotation. Chicago style is unique in allowing writers to simply correct the error. [19] X Research source For example, if the text of your source said \"sickness occurred even when reel drugs were administered,\" you could change it in your quote to read \"sickness occurred even when real drugs were administered.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Retain original punctuation where necessary with an ellipsis.",
      "content": "Retain original punctuation where necessary with an ellipsis. Use 3 ellipsis points to indicate omissions from a single sentence. If the language you're omitting crosses multiple sentences, use a period followed by 3 ellipses points to indicate the sentence break. Include punctuation that occurs before or after the omitted language, if it is necessary for the sentence to remain grammatically correct. [20] X Research source For example, suppose you want to quote an original passage from Thoreau that reads \"Man’s capacities have never been measured; nor are we to judge of what he can do by any precedents, so little has been tried.\" If you wanted to leave out the middle clause, you would write \"Man's capacities have never been measured; . . . so little has been tried.\" The semi-colon is necessary for the sentence to be grammatically correct. The comma is not. Ellipsis points normally are not used to show an omission either at the beginning or the end of the quotation. However, if the start or stop of your quote interrupts a thought, the ellipsis may be necessary for clarification. Use your own best judgment, or ask your instructor or advisor for guidance."
