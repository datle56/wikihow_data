      "content": "Use an eraser. Make sure it’s clean. The best way to erase a chalkboard is to use an up-and-down motion while cleaning the board. Start by removing the obvious chalk dust with the eraser. Using an up-and-down motion will stop the chalk dust from forming irregular patterns. Begin wiping the chalkboard clean with the eraser by starting in the upper left corner of the board. Wiping up and down across the board, end up in the upper right corner of the chalkboard. A felt eraser is a good choice for cleaning a chalkboard. You can also wipe the board straight across in horizontal lines. Avoid wiping the chalkboard in circular patterns, though. Once you’re done using the eraser, wipe the chalkboard with a clean, lint-free and dry cloth or chamois."

      "content": "Try soda pop! Coke sounds like it would make your chalkboard sticky and unusable, but a lot of people have used the soda product as a cleaning agent, and they report that it cleans chalkboards more thoroughly than water. [4] X Research source Pour a half cup of Coke into a bowl. Take a damp cloth, and dip it into the bowl, getting some of the Coke on the cloth. Any brand of soda should work, though, including Pepsi or diet soda. Take the Coke-covered cloth, and wipe it on the chalkboard.

      "content": "Use vinegar and water. Try mixing water and white vinegar together, and use a cloth to wipe the chalkboard with it. Not only will this concoction smell good, but it will also prevent streaks. [5] X Research source White vinegar is the best choice because other vinegar (such as balsamic) has coloring that can harm the blackboard’s appearance. Add half a cup of vinegar to four cups of lukewarm water before putting a cloth into the mixture. Wipe the board down. Wring out the cloth before wiping the board so it’s not dripping wet. It’s best to let the chalkboard air dry when you’re done removing all of the chalk dust from its surface. It’s possible to use only water to wipe down a chalkboard; the vinegar increases the cleaning power."

      "title": "Try water with household cleaner.",
      "content": "Try water with household cleaner. Sometimes chalkboards need tougher cleaning action. This is especially true if your chalkboard is marred with ink, fingerprint, or crayon stains. Apply a mild cleaner to water, such as a few drops of dish soap, and use it to remove the stains with a cloth. Choose a non-oily cleaner that is not abrasive. You could try to clean the chalkboard with only water and a rag, but when it dries it may have gray residue on it from the lingering chalk. [6] X Research source Applying water to a chalkboard will cause a phenomenon known as ghosting. This means that, even though you’ve wiped away the chalk dust, there’s an outline left. Applying cleaner to the water should reduce the chances this will happen. You could use a squeegee to remove the water solution from the chalkboard after wiping the chalkboard with it."
