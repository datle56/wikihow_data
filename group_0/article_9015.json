      "content": "Complimenting a guy’s smile and eyes often go hand in hand. A genuine smile does wonders for a man’s facial features, especially the eyes. Plus, telling a guy you like his smile is a guaranteed way to make him crack a blushy grin in a heartbeat. [1] X Research source You could say: “That smile plus those eyes? I’m weak!” “I love the way your eyes sparkle when you smile.” “The smile in your eyes is as big as the smile on your face.” “You’re smizing better than Tyra right now!”"

      "content": "Make flirty eye contact and smile while you compliment him. It shows that you have a real interest in him and makes your flattery seem more believable and genuine. Flash a sincere, warm smile to emphasize that you mean what you say and that you want him to feel good. [2] X Research source Eye contact gives you another chance to look at his eyes and make sure you’ve got the details right. It’d be pretty awkward to talk about his blue eyes when they’re actually brown!"

      "title": "Keep your compliments short, sweet, and casual.",
      "content": "Keep your compliments short, sweet, and casual. Tell him you love his deep hazel eyes and then carry on with your conversation like normal. Even if you're crushing on him super hard, it's usually best to act calm, cool, and collected when you're dishing out compliments. Try weaving it into casual conversation, like: “I just noticed how great your eyes look when you smile! Anyway…” “Can you believe all this rain? I like that jacket on you though, it really makes your eyes stand out.” “By the way, has anyone told you what a beautiful brown your eyes are? Just thought I’d mention it! OK, where was I?”"

      "title": "Comment on his eye color to show you notice his unique shade.",
      "content": "Comment on his eye color to show you notice his unique shade. Look closely—is his eye color light or dark? Are there hints of gray or amber? What does the color remind you of? The more you notice, the more authentic and personal your compliment seems. [3] X Research source Tell him things like: “I love the blue-gray of your eyes. It’s like looking out over the ocean during a storm.” “You have the brightest green eyes I’ve ever seen.” “You have sparkling gold flecks in your hazel eyes, they’re beautiful.” “Your eyes are so blue, they match the sky.” “I can’t stop looking at your golden eyes.” “No St. Patrick’s Day decoration is greener than your eyes.”"

      "title": "A compliment on eye shape is thoughtful and unexpected.",
      "content": "A compliment on eye shape is thoughtful and unexpected. It shows how attentive you are and shines a light on a physical feature he probably hasn’t thought much about. Describe his eye shape and how special or attractive you think it is with phrases like: “Your eyes are so big, I could get lost in them forever.” “I like downturned eyes. Yours are spectacular.” “Your eyes are so perfectly round, I can’t look away.” “I always smile when I think of your wide eyes.”"

      "content": "He’ll be flattered to know his eyes have an effect on you. Tell him how you feel when you make eye contact—giddy? Safe? Excited? He’s sure to blush and smile after you lay this one on him (and remember it every time he looks at you). [4] X Research source Try something like: “I can’t help blushing when I look into your eyes.” “I feel safe when you look at me like that.” “I’m happiest when you’re gazing right at me.” “I get all giggly when you look at me!”"

      "title": "Men like to think they have a commanding, confident gaze.",
      "content": "Men like to think they have a commanding, confident gaze. Tell him how strong, deep, or thoughtful his stare is and notice how he stands up a little taller and prouder. Don’t be afraid to mention the softer qualities you see too—kindness, empathy, and humor are all things he’d love to hear about from you. Try: “You have such a nice, intense stare. I can’t help but stop and listen to you.” “Your eyes look so kind and thoughtful.” “You have this witty sparkle in your eye. I knew you were funny before I even heard you talk.” “You just have this confidence in your eyes, like you’re a natural leader.” Remember—the best compliments go beyond the surface level."

      "title": "It’s always flattering to get compared to hot celeb.",
      "content": "It’s always flattering to get compared to hot celeb. Tell him his eyes remind you of your favorite singer or male actor. He’ll love knowing you think he’s in the same bracket as your handsome celebrity crush. Say his eyes are even better for a nice finishing touch. You could say: “Your eyes are even more piercing than Matt Bomer’s, I love it!” “I think Jude Law has the hottest eyes ever, after yours of course.” “It’s like I’m staring into Gerard Butler’s eyes, but better.” “Your eyes are even more intense than Thor’s!”"

      "title": "Include his eyes in compliments about his clothes, style, or accessories.",
      "content": "Include his eyes in compliments about his clothes, style, or accessories. Certain colors or glasses shapes can really accentuate the windows to his soul (and you get to praise two different things in one compliment!). He’ll feel quite dapper when he thinks his look is on point and his eyes are dazzling. Tell him something like: “Wear that nice green tie! It matches your eyes.” “I love those glasses on you, they frame your eyes perfectly.” “I didn’t think your eyes could be prettier, but that suit really makes them sparkle.” “Whoa, that guy liner makes your eyes look so defined. It’s hot!”"

      "title": "A compliment means more when you make it specific.",
      "content": "A compliment means more when you make it specific. If you want him to remember the compliment (and you) for a long time, tell him exactly what stands out to you—“Those light brown, oval eyes of yours are mesmerizing.” He’ll value something like that for a long time! For example: “I love how icy blue your eyes are” is more descriptive and specific than “Nice eyes!” “I’m hooked on those almond-shaped eyes” says more than “I like your eye shape.” Try “I feel so safe and comfortable when I look in your eyes” instead of “Your eyes make me feel good.”"

      "content": "The way you deliver your compliment has a big impact on its reception. Speak warmly and from the heart. Eyes are highly personal, so you want your guy to feel good after you talk about them. [5] X Research source Put a soft emphasis on words that describe his eyes or how you feel about them. For example: “Your eyes are perfect .” “I love the amber flecks in your eye color.” “Your eyes look great with that shirt.”"
