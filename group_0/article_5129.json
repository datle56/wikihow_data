      "content": "Determine how much citric acid you need to buy. The amount you need will determine where you should shop for citric acid. Smaller quantities can generally be purchased at the grocery store, while larger quantities may need be purchased at a bulk store or online. Consult the instructions for your activity or recipe to see how much citric acid they indicate you need to use for your project. Increase the amount of citric acid if you plan to make multiple batches of a recipe or want to have an ample amount for repeating the activity. For example, if you plan to use citric acid for cheese-making, and you want to make your own cheese on a regular basis, you will want to buy enough citric acid for multiple uses."

      "content": "Shop online. Online retailers sell small to large containers of citric acid and many online stores sell it by the pound. You can skip the shopping and have the citric acid delivered right to your door. If you are using the citric acid in something that will be consumed, remember to order food grade citric acid. Take into account that shipping costs may make it more expensive to buy citric acid online than at a local restaurant supply or warehouse store. However, online prices are generally more competitive than supermarket prices per ounce."

      "content": "Choose which form of citric acid you want to purchase. Citric acid is available as a monohydrate and in anhydrous form. Anhydrous means there is no water, so the citric acid is more powdery than the monohydrate form that has water. [5] X Research source Anhydrous citric acid is usually used in bath bombs, but the monohydrate form will also work. Unless the project specifies the use of one form over the other, either one should work."
