      "content": "Be who you want to be and don't be afraid to show off your true self! Express yourself through creative hobbies like writing, painting, drawing, or making music. These activities can be a great outlet to share your thoughts and ideas, plus help you develop self-confidence."

      "content": "Practice self-care and be kind to yourself, even when things get tough. You can't expect people to look up to you and adore you if you don't love yourself! Treat yourself like a goddess and give yourself the best—eat well, stay active, and get enough sleep each night. With that being said, don’t overdo it. If you act as though you are above everyone else, you can come across as a narcissistic person and nobody wants that."

      "title": "Be curious, passionate, and unpredictable!",
      "content": "Be curious, passionate, and unpredictable! Ask thoughtful questions when talking to others to make them feel good. Discover a hobby or interest that you’re excited about and pursue it. Try new things whenever you can. This can attract a lot of attention from the people around you and make them want to know you better."

      "content": "Add designer or couture-looking pieces to your wardrobe. You need to dress in a very stylish way - just like a model off vogue magazine or the Chanel runway. Try to wear as much designer brands as you can. Save the designers such as Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci for when you're a little older, because this may lead to people thinking that your clothes are knockoffs. If you can't afford these brands, try going to high end high street shops and find clothes that are reasonably priced but look very couture. If you still can't afford these brands, go to places that have nice clothing that is in style and your style. You can also find some cool clothes second hand, which jot only will be cheaper, but also more unique."

      "title": "Wear high-quality accessories to look like a million bucks.",
      "content": "Wear high-quality accessories to look like a million bucks. Try choosing finer jewelry rather than cheap $20 necklaces from Forever 21 or £10 necklaces from Topshop. Tiffany and Co, Links of London, Wright and Teague, Pandora are great brands to look into. As for bags, some popular brands are Telfar, Fendi, Ferragamo, Yves Saint Laurent and Louis Vuitton. Ensure that you grow a fairly large fine jewelry collection and get a nice display case for it to protect it from any damage. Keep away from *shudder* cubic zirconia! If you're not all for the big purses, get a purse that is still a good brand but downsize them, get one that is smaller than the totes or the big fancy purses. Go for quality over quantity. Rather than buying loads of cheap jewelry, buy a few pieces of high quality jewelry which will last."

      "content": "Learn how to apply makeup that enhances your facial features. A little tinted moisturizer, mascara, and lip color goes a long way, but feel free to contour, highlight, and go full glam for special occasions. Make sure you get the best makeup brands because, after all, the It Girl deserves the best of the best (plus they are better for your skin compared to those cheap make-up brands). Take care of your skin before applying make-up. Depending on how sensitive your skin is will also depend on how much make-up you are able to apply (before and after effects). If you are awful at doing makeup, hire a professional makeup artist instead. If you can't afford a professional, practice doing your makeup and look up good tutorials on YouTube so you can get really good at it."

Don't follow magazines too religiously, though. You can take inspiration from them, but add a personal touch too!"

      "content": "Take notes during class and develop a study schedule. You have to feel good about your intellect to become the “it” girl. Take notes to help you understand the material better, and study topics as you go to help your brain retain information. Getting good grades is definitely key because people know you know your stuff, teachers and other students appreciate it when a student knows what she needs to know and more."

      "content": "Set boundaries and stand up for yourself. Practice being direct, honest, and open in your communication. Don’t be afraid to say “no” to people and deliver messages that might be uncomfortable (but necessary). Remind yourself that you deserve respect, and express your feelings and needs accordingly."

      "content": "This can consist of 2-4 other girls, excluding yourself. You must be the leader of the clique, and you may choose 2-4 of the following to be in your group: The Sweetheart, The Party Animal, The Prep, The Shy Girl, The Athletic One, The Fashion Obsessed One or The Quirky Kitsch One. Make sure that all of the people in your clique are pretty, intelligent and are faithful and nice to one another. These are your \"best friends forever\" whom you rule the school together with. These are the girls who always know what's up with you before anyone else. Make sure that no scrapes or wannabees get in though."

      "content": "Eat lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Choose foods from the 5 main food groups to get a variety of nutrients, and try to fill half your plate with fruit and vegetables at each meal. Cut back on processed or high-sugar foods, and do not skip breakfast or starve yourself."
