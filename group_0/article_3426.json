      "content": "To become a pope, you must be male, Catholic, and a cardinal. Because only men are allowed into the Catholic priesthood, says Bailey, you must be male and a practicing Catholic to qualify as a pope. It's also extremely rare for anyone but a cardinal to be the pope, so that means you must be appointed as one during your lifetime. [1] X Research source A cardinal is the second-highest-ranking member of the Catholic clergy. They offer advice to the pope, help him with administrative duties, and elect a new pope when the previous one dies or steps down. Collectively, they're called the College of Cardinals."

      "content": "Convert to a practicing Catholic. If you weren't baptized and raised in Catholicism as a child, you must become a Catholic . This process is called the Order of Christian Initiation of Adults (OCIA). Contact your local Catholic church priest to begin the process. [2] X Research source OCIA isn't just a simple undertaking. It's an exploration of faith that can take a different amount of time for each person. Some of the requirements include becoming educated in the Catholic faith and church doctrine, undergoing spiritual purification, and receiving the sacraments (Baptism, First Eucharist, and Confirmation)."

      "title": "Consider if being a priest is your calling.",
      "content": "Consider if being a priest is your calling. Being a priest isn't just a job, it's a lifestyle. Make sure you're aware of all of the requirements. For example, priests in the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, which is the largest part of the Catholic Church, take vows of celibacy. This means they don't marry or have sexual relationships. This is done out of imitation of Jesus, who was not married. [3] X Research source Spend some time considering your vocation and consider your gifts. Are you compassionate? Is your faith strong? Are you happy with your vocation? Are you ready to take solemn vows of celibacy? These are important qualities for priests. Get some advice. Talk to your priest and ask about his experience. Ask specific questions, such as what a priest does. Then pray for God's guidance and take some time to reflect on the path you feel you should take."

      "title": "Contact a vocation director and apply for the seminary.",
      "content": "Contact a vocation director and apply for the seminary. Once you're a practicing Catholic, reach out to the vocation director in your diocese. A diocese is a territory overseen by a bishop. A vocation director, says Bailey, is \"usually a priest in that diocese whose job is to start vetting candidates [for priesthood] and finding out where they are in the discernment process.\" If they approve your candidacy, they'll send you to a seminary: a school that educates potential priests."

      "title": "Attend a seminary and become a priest.",
      "content": "Attend a seminary and become a priest . It takes about 6-7 years to become ordained as a priest through a seminary, according to Bailey. During this time, you'll obtain degrees in Philosophy and Theology. Then, 6 months before your ordination, the seminarian will ordain you as a deacon, so you can practice overseeing baptisms, weddings, and funerals. \"Finally,\" says Bailey, \"at the end of [your] seminary formation, [you are] ordained a priest.\" Here's a breakdown of a typical seminary education, year by year: Year 1: (Propaedeutic phase): The student focuses on \"prayer and discernment\" to ensure that being ordained is their true calling. Years 2-3 : The student studies for an undergraduate degree in Philosophy. Years 3-6 : The student studies for a graduate degree in Theology and is ordained as a deacon. They also take vows of \"obedience, celibacy, and prayer for the Church.\" You may be able to progress through your seminary education a little bit faster if you already have an undergraduate degree or college credits. But, Bailey explains, you also don't have to have any previous college experience before applying for a seminary. The minimum requirement is a high school diploma or a GED."

      "content": "Be an effective priest. Once you become a priest, use everything you learned at the seminary to perform all your duties properly and with faith and enthusiasm. This is the best way to get the attention of the bishops in your area and earn their recommendation to rise higher in the church ranks. A good priest doesn't just conduct Mass, perform sacraments, and hear confessions. He's also active in his community, visits the sick and the needy, and counsels members of his church when they need spiritual guidance. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Hone your people skills.",
      "content": "Hone your people skills. After you're ordained as a priest, any promotion you receive will be by appointment. This means you need to make a good impression on people in leadership positions above you. Work on relating well to others in your field. [5] X Research source Be an effective communicator . Learn to be comfortable speaking in front of a crowd. You already do this as a priest, and it will become more important as you advance in the church. Be confident and clear when you speak. Work well with others. As a bishop or cardinal, you'll be required to manage and advise other priests. Practice listening to other people's needs and empathize with their feelings."

    {
      "title": "Become a bishop.",
      "content": "Become a bishop. A bishop is essentially the chief priest of a diocese. When a bishop steps down or passes away, the archbishop who governs his diocese must ask the other bishops in his area about potential replacements. The bishops vote at their next province meeting, and then the archbishop forwards the final votes to the Apostolic Nuncio. The Apostolic Nuncio is an advisor to the pope. He investigates the candidates for the open bishop positions and makes recommendations. Ultimately, though, the pope is responsible for making the final decision. [6] X Research source It can take up to 8 months (or longer) from the time a bishop position becomes available to the time the pope chooses who will fill it. Communicate regularly with the archbishop for your region, as well as the bishop for your diocese. Establish a good rapport with them and keep them up-to-date on your church-related activities."

      "title": "Become a cardinal.",
      "content": "Become a cardinal. A cardinal is a bishop chosen by the pope to become a member of the College of Cardinals. His job is to support the pope with church administrative duties, as well as to elect new popes. There are 200-300 cardinals from all around the world, Bailey estimates. Any one of them can, theoretically, become the next pope. [7] X Research source There isn't a formal application or interview process to become a cardinal . You must be appointed by the pope. However, you're more likely to become a cardinal if you're selected as the bishop of a major metropolitan area like Baltimore or Boston."

      "title": "Prepare for the pope election process.",
      "content": "Prepare for the pope election process. According to Bailey, a new pope is elected every 12 years, on average. When the most recent pope dies or steps down, the College of Cardinals assembles in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, Italy, to vote on who among them will take his place. This meeting is called the conclave. As the conclave approaches, continue fulfilling your cardinal duties and make it clear to your colleagues that you're open to being nominated. The conclave is very secretive, says Bailey: \"[A]ll cardinals are sworn to secrecy and are not allowed to discuss what happens inside.\" However, one thing is clear: politicking and campaigning to become pope is forbidden. Some of the recent popes didn't even want to be elected, but were chosen because of their good works and piety."

      "content": "Get the most votes for pope. While it's not considered appropriate to \"campaign\" for pope, being a well-known and respected cardinal is a job only a select few hold. There are usually only a small group of candidates considered at the conclave. The man with the most votes is elected as the new pope, so that's the only way you can rise to that position."

      "title": "The pope is elected by a two-thirds majority of cardinals.",
      "content": "The pope is elected by a two-thirds majority of cardinals. During the big, secretive meeting called the conclave, the cardinals gather in the Sistine Chapel to vote for candidates for the pope. According to Fr. Bailey, each one writes down who he thinks should become the next pope on a piece of paper. If at least two-thirds of the cardinals vote for the same person, that man is the pope. If the cardinals can't agree on a pope in the first vote, they'll vote 3 times a day for as many days as necessary until they reach a majority. You can't vote for yourself to become pope. After every vote, the cardinals burn the ballots to communicate with the public about whether they've chosen a new pope or not. Black smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel chimney means they're going to have to vote again. White smoke means the pope has been elected."

      "content": "After a pope is elected, he must accept the position. When the cardinals reach a two-thirds majority on who should be the next pope, they must ask that person if he accepts the position. \"The moment he says, 'I accept,' he is officially the Pope—there’s no further ceremony required to make it official,\" says Bailey. After that, the bishops burn the ballots with a chemical to produce white smoke, and the new pope greets the public from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica."

His primary job is to lead Catholics all over the world in their faith and serve as their spiritual teacher and guide. He also presides over major religious celebrations, such as Christmas and Easter, and appoints bishops and cardinals. He meets with world leaders and offers his opinion on current events as they apply to Catholics. Finally, he presides over a weekly blessing for people visiting the Vatican and offers a general audience each week."

A new pope is chosen by the College of Cardinals around every 12 years, but only one person among 200-300 candidates is selected. Instead of focusing on becoming the pope, continue serving God, the church, and your community in the best way you can according to Catholic principles."
