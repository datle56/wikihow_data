      "content": "Determine your computer's primary use. Before you buy any components or establish a budget, start by identifying what the computer is for. Standard desktop PCs which are used for things like browsing and simple programs (e.g., Microsoft Word and Excel) can use older, less expensive parts, while gaming- or editing computers will require powerful, up-to-date parts.

      "title": "Establish a budget for your PC.",
      "content": "Establish a budget for your PC. Matt Ham points out that it's too easy to start buying attractive parts without sticking to a budget, only to realize that you're out of money and don't have all of the necessary equipment to build your PC. Figure out a soft limit (e.g., $300) and a hard limit (e.g., $400) and try to stay within that range. Common sense should guide your purchasing as well. For example, if the processor for which you budget is $100 but a nicer, newer model is discounted from $200 to $120 at your local tech store, spending the extra $20 is probably a better long-term investment."

      "content": "Learn the basics about each part you have to buy. No matter how expensive your computer is, you will need the following components for your project: [2] X Research source Processor (CPU) — This is the \"brain\" of your computer. In most builds, the CPU is the second-most expensive component. CPU Cooler — The CPU requires dedicated cooling to avoid overheating. You can use an air cooler, which is cheaper, or an AIO (all-in-one) cooler that uses antifreeze to liquid cool the chip. Motherboard — This serves as the interface between all of your computer's components and the processor. It’s sort of like the foundation of a home. RAM — Random Access Memory. RAM increases your computer's performance by handling short-term memory and data storage. The more RAM you have, the more complex tasks your computer can perform. Storage Drives (HDD or SSD) — These store data. You can buy a traditional hard disk drive (HDD), or a slightly more expensive solid-state drive (SSD). These days, SSDs are relatively cheap and usually worth the extra spend. Power supply — This powers all of your computer's individual components. This is what you plug into the wall socket. Graphics card (GPU) — This renders images on your computer. Ham explains that while most processors have a built-in graphics processing unit (GPU), buying a dedicated graphics card is essential if you plan on doing anything beyond web browsing. Fans — This includes case fans and coolers for specific parts and keeps the inside of your case at a safe temperature. Case — This is necessary for storing and cooling your components."

      "content": "Use PC Part Picker to craft your components list as you go. PC Part Picker is basically essential these days. It allows PC builders to list the components they want to buy so that they confirm everything is compatible. The site also allows you to track the prices of each component so you can ensure you get the best deal. [3] X Research source As you choose the components you want, add them to your build. If you ever change your mind, just swap the piece out on your list and reconfirm the build is compatible (PC Part Picker will tell you if it isn’t). PC Part Picker is 100% free. PC Part Picker is also a great place to start if you have zero idea which RAM cards you want or which CPU is ideal, etc. The site pulls performance data and component popularity for every potential component."

      "title": "Buy your components over time to get the best deal.",
      "content": "Buy your components over time to get the best deal. In-store locations such as Best Buy will stock computer components, but you can usually find comparable parts for cheaper if you shop online. Common online locations include Amazon, eBay, and NewEgg. If you want the best prices, wait for sales on the individual component in your list—you’d be surprised how often parts go on sale. Waiting for sales (e.g. Black Friday Sales) can often pay off, as parts can be heavily discounted, allowing you to either save money or opt for better components for the same price. Some online retailers may offer a 'free shipping' deal if you spend a certain amount of money. Consider buying enough parts from those sites to save on shipping, which is often expensive. This doesn't mean you should pay more for components cheaper elsewhere though!"

      "title": "Research every component you intend to purchase.",
      "content": "Research every component you intend to purchase. Ham explains that you should read online consumer review sites for more information. Remember, this is one of the most important steps, because everything will depend on your hardware working correctly and together. As you get more in the reeds, you may want to check out: How to Build a Cheap Gaming Computer, How to Choose Components for Building a Computer, and How to Build a Powerful Quiet Computer. The most reputable hardware reviewers around today include Linus Tech Tips, Tom's Hardware, and Gamer’s Nexus. Once you've found a decently reviewed component, look for negative reviews of the component. You may find that the component is great for certain uses, but inappropriate for your own preferences."

      "title": "Choose a CPU with enough power to suit your needs.",
      "content": "Choose a CPU with enough power to suit your needs. The CPU (central processing unit) is the core of your computer's performance. The higher the processor's speed in gigahertz (GHz), the faster it can process data. Many applications use multiple threads at the same time, so more cores can improve performance. The processor will usually entail a large part of your budget. Processors typically come in quad-core, hexa-core or higher. Unless you're building an ultra-high-performance gaming PC, you should stick to around 6 cores. These days, you have two choices for CPUs: Intel and AMD . AMD’s offerings are considered “stronger” but Intel’s chips are more compatible with aftermarket software."

      "content": "Get a motherboard that fits your CPU. If you buy an AMD CPU, your motherboard must be designed for AMD chips (and vice versa for Intel). Other aspects to look for in a motherboard include the following: [4] X Research source Onboard Wi-Fi (ensures that your computer will have wireless capabilities) Bluetooth Multiple RAM slots/high RAM capacity Support for graphics cards if necessary (PCIe x16 slot) Support for multiple SSD drives (if you want multiple solid-state drives) Enough USB slots for the number of fans you want to include"

      "title": "Purchase RAM based on how much multitasking/editing you do.",
      "content": "Purchase RAM based on how much multitasking/editing you do. RAM is responsible for storing data from running programs, so having enough of it is important. Not having enough RAM will be most noticeable under two scenarios: multitasking and flipping between programs, and when you’re doing intensive gaming or editing. Before buying RAM, be sure to check both your processor and your motherboard for the type of RAM which is supported. [5] X Research source How much RAM do I really need? 8 GB is plenty for basic web surfing. If you’re a gamer, 16 GB is considered the minimum these days. 32 GB is the sweet spot for high-end gaming and multitasking, and 64 GB is only necessary if you’re doing a ton of video or audio editing. Depending on your motherboard, you'll need to buy either DDR4 RAM or the newer DDR5 RAM. Do not build a PC with DDR3 RAM unless you have zero interest in modern computing programs."

      "title": "Pick a storage device (SSD or HDD) with enough room for your needs.",
      "content": "Pick a storage device (SSD or HDD) with enough room for your needs. Comparatively speaking, purchasing a storage device is easy—most drives are compatible with virtually all motherboards and processors. For this step, choose whether you want a hard disk drive (HDD) or a solid-state drive (SSD). Do I need an SSD or HDD? SSDs are much faster than traditional HDDs and they’re much more reliable. SSDs contain no moving parts so they can’t physically fail the way HDDs do. If you’re going for a very basic build and don’t care about potentially losing your data one day, an HDD is fine. Most users will benefit from upgrading to an SSD, though. What if I’m on a budget but want an SSD? Find a cheaper, smaller capacity (200-500GB) SSD to use as your boot drive (the drive the operating system runs on). Then, use a larger (500GB-1TB) HDD for files, photos, videos, etc. This makes the computer run much faster than just using a single HDD. There are two types of SSD, M2 and SATA drives. M2 cards go right into the face of your motherboard. SATA drives connect to the power supply and then run to a port on the motherboard."

      "content": "Purchase a GPU with enough juice to run your programs. A dedicated graphics card (sometimes called a GPU or video card) is essential for playing the latest games, but you can skip the GPU if you buy a CPU with integrated graphics and you only want to browse the web. Most users will want to buy a GPU, though. [6] X Research source There are three options for GPU manufacturers: Nvidia , AMD , and Intel . Your GPU manufacturer does not have to match the CPU manufacturer. The GPU is the most expensive component, so choose your GPU carefully. How much should I spend on a GPU? If you want to play brand new games at the highest settings, it’s worth splurging on a GPU. If you really don’t care about incredible gaming graphics, this is where you can save some money—buy a card from a previous generation. You’ll be fine."

      "title": "Make sure your power supply can handle the load.",
      "content": "Make sure your power supply can handle the load. The power supply powers all of your components in your computer. The power supply must be powerful enough to power all of your components; don't worry about it being so powerful that you waste electricity by powering more than you need, as it will only output as many watts as you use and the number on its wattage is only its max capacity. It's best to buy more watts than you need, as this will make future component upgrades easier."

      "title": "Pick up a case that is both functional and easy on the eyes.",
      "content": "Pick up a case that is both functional and easy on the eyes. The case is what holds your computer components. A few cases come with a power supply included, but if you are making a gaming build then getting a separate power supply is recommended, as the power supplies that come with cases are usually not very high quality. [7] X Research source The size of the case will be based on how many drives bays and card slots it has, as well as the size and type of your motherboard. Be sure to select a case which can fit all of your components, including your hard drive. Cases might obstruct air flow causing some higher-end components with larger power draw to overheat. If you're looking to save money, this is one area where you can spend a little less and not compromise on performance. A note on cases and high-end GPUs: Newer GPUs (like the Nvidia 4000 cards) are, to put it frankly, comically gigantic. Double-check the dimensions and clearance room for your GPU in the case if you plan on buying a newer GPU."

      "title": "Ground yourself",
      "content": "Ground yourself to avoid frying a component with static electricity. Use an antistatic wrist-strap cable to prevent electrostatic discharge (ESD) which can be deadly to computer electronics. Alternatively, touch a large metal body like a radiator to discharge yourself. Don’t want to buy a fancy wrist strap? No worries. Just build your PC on a wood surface with a tile or wood floor. Don’t wear socks and avoid carpet. Touch bare metal every 30-45 minutes to discharge any potential static buildup. You should be fine."

      "title": "Disassemble the case so you can access all the compartments.",
      "content": "Disassemble the case so you can access all the compartments. Unscrew the side panels (or slide them toward the back of the case). Set them aside. If you can remove the ceiling and floor of the case, do that too. The actual build process is kind of like putting Legos together—it’s not particularly hard since the pieces only snap together if they fit. Fitting those Legos in the case is more like a puzzle where the pieces need to be arranged in a particular way. The more room you have to work, the better."

      "title": "Install the power supply but leave the cables aside.",
      "content": "Install the power supply but leave the cables aside. Some cases come with the power supply already installed, while others will require you to purchase the power supply separately and install it yourself. Make sure that the power supply is installed in the correct orientation, and that nothing is blocking the power supply's fans. [8] X Research source The power supply will usually go near the top or the bottom rear of the case. You can determine where the power supply is supposed to sit by looking for a missing section on the back of the case. Don’t start hooking up the cables. That will be one of the last things you do after putting everything in."

      "title": "Add the CPU and RAM to the motherboard.",
      "content": "Add the CPU and RAM to the motherboard. Do this before you install the motherboard in the case, as the case can limit your ability to wire components: [9] X Research source Attach the CPU to the motherboard by finding the processor port on the motherboard's surface. There is usually a small, golden triangle on the corner of every CPU which matches up with a similar triangle on your motherboard. Line those up and lock the CPU in place by folding down the little metal arm. Don’t touch the CPU pins! Only touch the CPU by holding the rim. If you touch the gold pins that go into the motherboard, you could bend them and ruin the CPU. Attach your RAM to the motherboard by finding the RAM slots and inserting the RAM appropriately (they should only fit one way)."

      "content": "Attach the CPU cooler on top of the CPU. This varies from cooler to cooler, so read the instructions for your processor. Most coolers attach directly over the processor and screw into the motherboard. Some coolers may have brackets that need to be attached underneath the motherboard. [11] X Research source Installing an air cooler: Orient the cooler so that the fan blows in your preferred location (usually to the back of the case). Install the 4 screws and tighten them. Installing an AIO: Install the radiator first by securing it to your case. Then, connect the CPU block with the 4 screws. Important safety note on AIOs: The hoses for the AIO must feed up from the CPU. If you install the AIO under the CPU (or upside down on the front of the case), air bubbles will accumulate in the hoses and your CPU will overheat."

      "title": "Prepare your case.",
      "content": "Prepare your case. You may need to knock the plates out of the back of the case in order to fit your components into the correct positions. If your case has separate shelving units to hold your hard drive, install the units using the included screws. You may need to install and wire your case's fans before you can install any components. If so, follow your case's fan installation instructions."

      "title": "Secure the motherboard to the case.",
      "content": "Secure the motherboard to the case. Once the standoffs are installed, place the motherboard in the case and push it up against the backplate. All of the back ports should fit into the holes in the I/O backplate. Use the screws provided to secure the motherboard to the standoffs through the shielded screw holes on the motherboard. Now you can start hooking up power supply cables. You can start connecting the SATA and USB cables whenever it makes the most sense to you. With the motherboard in the case, the foundation of the computer is in place and the order of operations is up to you."

The order in which these are connected will depend on which is easiest. Make sure that you connect the USB ports, the Power and Reset switches, the LED power and hard drive lights, and the audio cable. Your motherboard’s documentation will show you where on your motherboard these connectors attach. [12] X Research source What if something doesn’t fit? There is typically only one way that these connectors can attach to the motherboard. Don’t try to force anything to fit. The pins of these connectors are often very thin and delicate, so if something doesn’t slot automatically into place, it’s probably not meant to be there."

      "content": "Install your SSD and/or HDD storage devices. This process will vary slightly depending on your case and the type of drive, but should typically go as follows: [13] X Research source Plug any SATA SSD drive's SATA cable into the SATA slot on the motherboard. Tuck the SATA SSD anywhere it seems like it’d fit safely. Connect any HDD to the motherboard with a SATA cable. Tuck the HDD into any slot on the back of the case. If you're using an M.2 SSD , slot this into the motherboard and screw it down to the small post on the end opposite to the slot. Many motherboards have heatsinks over M.2 slots, so make sure you remove any plastic backing after installing your drive and replacing the heatsink."

      "content": "Install the fans inside of your case last. The fans are easily the most frustrating part of PC building if you have more than 2-3 of them. The blades must be oriented so that you get the airflow you want, and each fan has two cables (if they have RGB capabilities). Take your time to screw in all of the fans and connect them to the relevant ports on the motherboard. [15] X Research source A note on airflow: As a rule of thumb, you want some fans for intake to blow cold air into the case, and some fans for outtake to remove hot air from the case. Usually, builders put outtake fans in the back and top of the case since hot air rises. Intake goes in the front or bottom (or both)."
