      "title": "Purchase a deicer.",
      "content": "Purchase a deicer. You should be able to find these at your local hardware store. It is best to buy several bags at the beginning of the season. Once the first snow storm hits, it is possible that stores will sell out of the product. [1] X Research source You should store your deicer in a dry place, preferably inside an airtight container keeping it free from moisture and sunlight. [2] X Research source These are largely made of rock salt, or sodium chloride, which has a lower freezing point than water. This allows it to seep through the ice, breaking it up and creating a layer of water beneath it."

      "title": "Use the right product correctly.",
      "content": "Use the right product correctly. Deicers can be harmful to your health, your sidewalk, your lawn and your pets. Don’t use too much of it, and sweep it up after the ice has thawed. If you feel the need to use more than 2-4 ounces per square yard, you may be using the wrong product for your purposes. Ice melts function at a variety of temperatures and melt at different speeds. [3] X Research source Hygroscopic ice melt removes moisture and can be severely damaging to skin and sidewalks. [4] X Research source Some of these products involve more chemicals than others. Urea is sometimes included in the mixture, but can cause damage to your sidewalk. Calcium chloride will melt ice at even lower temperatures than salt mixtures without it. It can function at -20 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas salt is only good down to 15 degrees Fahrenheit. This is useful for melting ice quickly when you need it on stairs or walkways, but will need to be reapplied often. Rock salt takes longer to melt the ice, but will not require being reapplied as often. Use this in areas used less often, like driveways."

      "title": "Sprinkle a small amount of deicer on the icy sidewalk.",
      "content": "Sprinkle a small amount of deicer on the icy sidewalk. It is not necessary to use a lot of salt. Create a thin layer of salt on top of the ice. You want to use about 2-4 ounce or 1-2 handfuls per square yard. [5] X Research source It is best to sprinkle this layer of salt as soon as it starts to snow. Once the ice gets thicker, it will be more difficult for the salt to be effective. The salt should start working in 15-30 minutes. It will not melt the ice, but should have seeped through and made a layer of water between the ice and the sidewalk, as well as breaking up the layer of ice and making it easier to shovel."

    {
      "title": "Shovel the ice off your sidewalk.",
      "content": "Shovel the ice off your sidewalk. Now that the ice has been broken down, it should be easy to break apart and remove with a snow shovel. Tap the tip of the blade of the shovel against the ice to break it apart. Holding one hand on the top of the handle and the other down another foot or so along the length of the shovel, wedge the blade under the broken ice. Scoop the shovel under as much ice as you can and lift it off the sidewalk. Turn and tip the load of ice over to the side of the sidewalk and continue shoveling until it is cleared."

      "title": "Lay down a second layer of salt.",
      "content": "Lay down a second layer of salt. You can use salt before, during and after a snowstorm. Laying down a layer after you complete your shoveling will help keep more ice from forming. If the snow continues or returns, you will already have your deicer working at the lower level to make future ice removal easier. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill a gallon jug with warm water. You will want to fill the container half way for a total of 1/2 gallon of warm water. Don’t worry about making the water very hot. It should still be cool enough to handle. [7] X Research source"

Add these two ounces of rubbing alcohol to the gallon jug. [8] X Research source Rubbing alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol, can be hazardous. Take precautions when handling it. Avoid contact with skin by wearing gloves. Don't touch your face after handling rubbing alcohol. Wash your hands with a lot of soap and water. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Shovel the ice.",
      "content": "Shovel the ice. You will want to remove the ice safely and efficiently. This means getting the ice and snow out of the path for walking and driving without hurting yourself in the process. [11] X Research source Use a lightweight snow shovel which is not too heavy for you. Decide where you will pile the snow and ice before you start so that you don’t end up blocking a walking or driving path and needing to start over in that area. Ideally, just push the snow and ice out of the way without lifting it. If you do lift, keep your knees bent and back straight. Remember to do the lifting with your legs and only lift as high as necessary to move the ice to your pile. If you are turning, turn your whole body instead of twisting at the waist."

      "title": "Choose a heavy duty machine.",
      "content": "Choose a heavy duty machine. Snowblowers can possibly handle some ice and save your back from shoveling injuries. If there are chunks of ice mixed in with your snow, the right snow blower can handle the job. Avoid single-stage blowers which use paddles and choose a dual-stage snow blower, which employs augers. Some augers have sharper or longer teeth, which are useful in breaking up the ice. Gas blowers tend to be more reliable and stronger than electric blowers."

      "title": "Break up the ice.",
      "content": "Break up the ice. Snow blowers will not be able to remove a sheet of ice. This will likely register as solid ground and the blower will roll over it. Break up large sheets of ice with a shovel before using the snow blower."

    {
      "title": "Read the owner’s manual.",
      "content": "Read the owner’s manual. Each snow blower will come with different controls, options and instructions. Be sure that you understand all of the moving parts and how to use them by reading the instruction manual before using the blower. Pay specific attention to how to operate the auger, chute direction, drive clutch and steering levers. Prepare the snowblower with gasoline, oil, stabilizers or necessary extension cords. Look for accessories which may have come with your snow blower, like blades, skid shoes and shear pins."

      "content": "Plan your route. Know where you want to place the snow and ice. Decide which side of the sidewalk you would like to blow and pile the snow. Never blow ice and snow toward cars, houses or other people. Don’t move the snow from your sidewalk into someone else’s path. [12] X Research source If it is a windy day, don’t blow the snow into the wind. This will blow it back in your direction. Avoid picking up and shooting gravel through the blower. If you are clearing a gravel surface, leave a little snow on top of the gravel by lifting the necessary blades or augers to a height which does not reach completely to the ground."

      "title": "Move the snowblower slowly over the area you are clearing.",
      "content": "Move the snowblower slowly over the area you are clearing. Use both hands to push the blower at a slow and steady pace, much like mowing the lawn. Follow your planned route and take care when making turns. [14] X Research source Some second-stage blowers have power steering options to assist in making turns. Disengage augers when making turns and make sure that the chute is facing the correct direction before starting the augers back up. Continue pushing the snow blower over the area and making turns until the sidewalk is completely cleared."
