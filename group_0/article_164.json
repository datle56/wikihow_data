      "content": "“867” is a texting code for getting drunk and waking up in someone’s bed. Most people experience an “867” (or “get 867’ed”) by drinking too much alcohol and blacking out. They probably don’t know when, how, or why they’re in a person’s bed, or for how long they’ve been there. [1] X Research source “I 867’ed and I don’t remember anything 😫” “I’m never drinking tequila again. I 867’ed and I don’t know their name 😭💀😭💀” “Did you get 867’ed last night? I noticed you weren’t home when I got back.” The exact origin of the texting code “867” is unknown, but it may have started in the late 90s when people used pagers to communicate with each other."

      "content": "“867-5309” is a reference to the 1981 pop song by Tommy Tutone. In slang, the number “867” can be a nod to the famous phone number from the chorus of the song, which is called “867-5309/Jenny.” The song is not related to the texting code “867” in any way, but it's about a man who finds a phone number on a wall, with the name “Jenny” next to it. He becomes obsessed with the idea of having a romantic relationship with Jenny, but is too nervous to call her. [2] X Research source The song peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart in May 1982. [3] X Research source However, it was the only major success from the band, giving Tommy Tutone the reputation as a “one-hit wonder.”"

      "content": "Co-writer Alex Call says he came up with the phone number randomly. While there are conflicting stories about the creation of the song, Call has explained in several interviews that the name “Jenny” and the phone number “867-5309” came to him “out of ether,” and that neither him or lead guitarist Jim Keller had a real person or number in mind. [4] X Research source In fact, some people say that other members of the band make up a new story every time they’re asked about the origins of the song. Tommy Heath, the lead singer, once claimed that he got the phone number from a girl who wanted him to give it to Jim Keller. Additionally, Jim Keller has claimed that Jenny was a girl he knew and that some of his friends wrote her number on the wall of a men’s room as a joke."

[5] X Research source This wave of prank calling may have helped cement “867-5309/Jenny” in pop culture. The song is associated with humor and nostalgia, and has been featured in marketing and advertising campaigns, TV shows, movies, comedy sketches, Internet memes and more. Businesses are interested in the number because it’s recognizable and easy to remember, so some people seek the number for the sole purpose of selling it. [6] X Research source Single people can also use it as a fake number when they don’t want to give out their real number. The song title has sparked debate among fans, with some calling it “867-5309” and others calling it “867-5309 (Jenny).” Many people also confuse the “6” and the “7,” misremembering the number as “876-5309.” On major streaming platforms, the song is listed as “867-5309/Jenny.” [7] X Research source"
