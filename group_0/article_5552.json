      "title": "Check the costs with your service provider.",
      "content": "Check the costs with your service provider. International calls can get expensive in a hurry. Contact your phone company to see what rates they offer. Make sure to ask about any potential extra charges or lesser-known fees, as these can add up in no time. Another option is purchasing an international calling card. Calls to cell phones are often more expensive than calls to landlines, so take time to note what type of number you are calling. International calling cards are popular because you can purchase one for a flat fee and receive a certain number of minutes. For example, a card could cost 5 dollars for 100 minutes of calls to Africa. Cards are generally priced between 1 to 20 dollars and can be found at most convenience stores. If all of these options are too pricey, try an online method instead."

      "title": "Dial the international access code.",
      "content": "Dial the international access code. This is 011 for callers in the U.S. and Canada. The code works on both mobile and fixed lines. If you are dialing from a cell phone, you can enter a “+” instead of the 011 code. To do this, press and hold the “0” key. If you are not in the U.S. or Canada and would like to call a European country, you will need a different international access code. For example, the code for calling from India is \"900\"."
    },
    {
      "title": "Type in the country code.",
      "content": "Type in the country code. Each European country has a different one, two or three-digit code that you dial immediately after the international access code. For example, Russia’s country code is 7, France’s is 33 and Ireland’s is 353. [1] X Research source If you were making a phone call from the U.S. to France, it would begin with 011-33 and then you'd type in the specific number."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enter the phone number itself.",
      "content": "Enter the phone number itself. If the number begins with a “0”, you usually don’t need to type it in. Italy is the only country in Europe where you need to type the “0”. It is normal for some countries to have numbers with different lengths. [2] X Research source The number for a call to Paris would look something like this: 011-33-1-40-00-00-00 Some places feature a seven-digit phone number and an eight-digit mobile number."

      "title": "Use Skype to get in touch with friends and family.",
      "content": "Use Skype to get in touch with friends and family. Skype-to-skype calls are always free, so if the person you are trying to reach has Skype, using it is the most cost-effective way to communicate overseas. You can also call a landline or mobile phone on Skype, but there is a small fee that comes with doing this. It is completely free to download Skype and set up a basic account. The fee for using Skype to call a phone number is generally cheaper than a regular phone call. Be sure to check with your service provider anyway to best keep track of all potential costs. Though some countries have restrictions on Skype use, none of them are in Europe."

      "content": "Download WhatsApp and make calls to Europe for free. WhatsApp uses your phone’s internet connection instead of your cellular plan, meaning you can call anyone in the world without extra charges if you are connected to the internet. The app is free to download and gives you the option of doing a video call or a voice call. [3] X Research source If you can’t find an internet connection, data charges may apply to your WhatsApp call. WhatsApp allows you to talk with up to three other people at once, but only as a voice call. Video calls are limited to one-on-one chats."

      "title": "Try Viber or Google+ Hangouts to make either video or voice calls.",
      "content": "Try Viber or Google+ Hangouts to make either video or voice calls. Viber and Hangouts, like Skype, can make both computer-to-computer calls and computer-to-phone calls. Both are free to download. You do not need a Viber account to use the application, but you will need a Google account to use Hangouts. [4] X Research source The biggest challenge is finding a strong internet connection. A solid signal leads to great sound quality and a smooth call, while a weak signal can distort the audio and make the video choppy. If your internet connection is weak, turn off the video and continue the call with audio only."
