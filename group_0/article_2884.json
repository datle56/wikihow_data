      "title": "Confess your sins through prayer to communicate with God.",
      "content": "Confess your sins through prayer to communicate with God. When you commit a sin, sit down and take time to think about what happened. Use the time to pray in whatever manner you prefer, and be honest about what happened and why it happened. For instance, you might say something like “Dear Father, I’ve been having a hard time controlling my temper lately, and I lashed out and yelled at a friend today. Truly, I’m worried about disappointing my friends, and I don’t want to hurt them anymore.” [1] X Research source It’s important to be honest about the situation and your intentions. As long as you’re honest, you can ask for forgiveness."

      "title": "Recite a prayer asking for forgiveness when you sin.",
      "content": "Recite a prayer asking for forgiveness when you sin. Once you’ve prayed about your sin, you can ask for forgiveness. Recite a “sinner’s prayer” of your choice, or make up your own to be specific to your situation. Emphasize that you are truly sorry for your actions, and think of ways that you will try harder to act in Jesus’ image. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pray for the salvation of non-believers.",
      "content": "Pray for the salvation of non-believers. If your friends and family haven’t accepted Jesus as the Son of God, you can pray for their salvation too. Communicate with God about how much you love them, and think about all of the ways they have helped you grow closer to God. Ask for God’s help in showing them the beauty of salvation through the Lord. [3] X Research source It’s okay to pray for the salvation of people who have a different religion from you. They don’t have to change their beliefs, but you can still pray for them."

      "title": "Make a plan to avoid temptation and sin.",
      "content": "Make a plan to avoid temptation and sin. If you continue to commit the same sins over and over, try coming up with a way to remove yourself from the situation or avoid it altogether. Talk to your pastor, spiritual guide, or an adult who you trust about the situation. Finally, pray to Jesus to ask for guidance about how to resist temptation in your life. [4] X Research source For example, if you tend to take the Lord’s name in vain when you’re mad, try to come up with other ways to verbally express your frustration. If you frequently say “Jesus Christ” or “Oh my God” you could say something like “Goodness Gracious” or “Sheesh!”"

    {
      "title": "Accept Jesus as the Son of God.",
      "content": "Accept Jesus as the Son of God. According to the Bible, all Christians who recognize Jesus as the Son of God are able to be saved. If you truly believe that God and Jesus are one entity, created the universe and everything in it, and are kind and forgiving, you are considered a Christian. In the Bible, only Christians are able to accept the gift of salvation. It’s important that you do this, because without accepting Jesus into your life, you can’t be considered a Christian."

    {
      "title": "Read about Jesus’ death on the cross to understand salvation.",
      "content": "Read about Jesus’ death on the cross to understand salvation. In the Bible, God sends Jesus to Earth so that he can die and absolve humanity of original sin. Focus your reading on the books of Mark, Luke, and Matthew, each of which includes detailed stories about how Jesus died on the cross and his acceptance into Heaven by God. Each of these books tells the individual Apostle’s recollection of the life of Jesus, and will help you understand who Jesus is. [5] X Research source This is considered Jesus’s first act of “salvation,” and acts as a reminder that no matter what your sins are, Jesus can forgive them if you’re truly sorry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Devote yourself fully to God in everything you do.",
      "content": "Devote yourself fully to God in everything you do. Live your life with the teachings of Jesus and God in mind, which will show that you are dedicated to having a holy life. Follow the Ten Commandments, which are instructions from God about how to be a good Christian. Do your best in school, work, and other activities to bring glory to God. [6] X Research source For example, you can do kind things for your parents in order to live out the commandment that says that you should “honor your father and mother.” One way to show your devotion to God is by attending an organized church service. However, if you don’t attend church, you can still be saved through Jesus."

      "title": "Be kind and respectful of other people.",
      "content": "Be kind and respectful of other people. In every interaction, try to remain upbeat and positive, and think the best of other people. As a general rule, it’s best to treat others the way you want to be treated, and act through love. Even when someone does something that hurts your feelings or pride, remember that Jesus loved everyone, including the people who sentenced him to die on the cross. [7] X Research source For example, if one of your friends is spreading a rumor about you, you should talk to them about what’s going on, rather than talking about them behind their back. Once you talk about the issue, you can forgive them just as Jesus forgives all sinners. If you’re having a particularly hard time with a conflict, try asking yourself “What would Jesus do?” to remind yourself of the forgiveness that Jesus exhibits."

      "title": "Volunteer and serve your community to spread love and kindness.",
      "content": "Volunteer and serve your community to spread love and kindness. In your free time, do good deeds and help others without expecting anything in return, just as Jesus did in the Bible. Follow Jesus’ teachings about treating others as you would want to be treated by volunteering for those in need. These will help you maintain a positive outlook in life and can remind you how Jesus’ love can help everyone, no matter their situation in life. [8] X Research source For example, you could volunteer weekly at a local soup kitchen or organize a community day with proceeds that benefit a local non-profit. Avoid talking about religion while you’re volunteering unless you’re taking part in a special mission trip through a church. Some people may not agree with your views, and you can help them whether you agree with them or not."
