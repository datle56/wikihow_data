      "title": "Use “=” to define a variable.",
      "content": "Use “=” to define a variable. A single “=” is used to declare a variable and assign a value to it. You can use this to set a variable to null. A value of “0” and null are not the same and will behave differently. variableName = null;"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use “==” to check a variable’s value.",
      "content": "Use “==” to check a variable’s value. A “==” is used to check that the two values on either side are equal. If you set a variable to null with “=” then checking that the variable is equal to null would return true. variableName == null; You can also use “!=” to check that a value is NOT equal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use an “if” statement to create a condition for the null.",
      "content": "Use an “if” statement to create a condition for the null. The result of the expression will be a boolean (true or false) value. You can use the boolean value as a condition for what the statement does next. For example, if the value is null, then print text “object is null”. If “==” does not find the variable to be null, then it will skip the condition or can take a different path. Object object = null ; if ( object == null ) { System . out . print ( \"object is null \" ); }"

    {
      "title": "Use null as an unknown value.",
      "content": "Use null as an unknown value. It is common to use null as a default in lieu of any assigned value. string() means the value is null until it is actually used."

      "title": "Use null as a condition for ending a process.",
      "content": "Use null as a condition for ending a process. Returning a null value can be used to trigger the end of a loop or break a process. This is more commonly used to throw an error or exception when something has gone wrong or an undesired condition has been hit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use null to indicate an uninitiated state.",
      "content": "Use null to indicate an uninitiated state. Similarly, null can be used as flag to show that a process has not yet started or as a condition to mark to be beginning of a process. For example: do something while object is null or do nothing until an object is NOT null. synchronized method () { while ( method ()== null ); method (). nowCanDoStuff (); }"
