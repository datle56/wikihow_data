[1] X Research source Even if you do change your mind after the breakup and agree to get back together, you will have created lasting damage to the relationship that may be irreparable. If you really still love this person and want to make the relationship work but don't know how, consider couples therapy. A therapist can teach you skills that will help you have a healthier relationship. [2] X Expert Source Sarah Schewitz, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 April 2019."

      "content": "Avoid breaking up for the wrong reasons. You must decide whether your relationship is worth ending. [3] X Research source You have to think about the future for not only yourself, but also your partner. Never avoid breaking up with somebody because you are afraid of being single. The only way you can find the right person for you is to get out there and be on your own. Never avoid breaking up with somebody because you are afraid of hurting their feelings. Breaking up may seem cruel, but continuing to be with somebody you are not in love with anymore is even worse. [4] X Research source Don't suggest a \"break.\" Breaks are usually just a segue into a full-on breakup; if you feel that you need a break from the person you're with, then chances are that you actually want to break up but are too afraid of being alone. Rather than asking for a break, wait until you're ready to fully end the relationship and then do it."

      "title": "Make the necessary arrangements.",
      "content": "Make the necessary arrangements. If you live together, then decide on who will move out and who will stay (of course, you may want to leave this open to discussion). If you expect your partner to move out, you will need to allow ample time for them to find other living arrangements, and should find somewhere else to stay during that time. Ask your parents or close friends whether you can stay with them for a few days, or rent a room at a hotel for a couple of nights. If you don't live together but see each other daily at either work or school, then you will need to consider whether it's worth re-adjusting your schedule/circumstances. If you think that seeing each other on a regular basis is going to make moving on difficult, then consider changing jobs or rearranging your class schedule to avoid having to constantly interact with this person."

      "title": "Choose the right time.",
      "content": "Choose the right time. There's never going to be a perfect time to break up with the person you love, but there are definitely certain situations that you should avoid. Among them are the following: When your partner is dealing with a personal crisis like a death in the family, diagnosis of an illness, or loss of a job. If they are in the middle of a crisis, allow some time to pass before you break up to avoid adding on extra pain. In the middle of a fight. Never end a relationship in the heat of the moment; you may end up saying things that you don't really mean, and come to regret your decision once the argument is over. In front of other people. If you choose to break up with them in public, be sure to at least find a quiet table or corner to have the conversation. Remember that one or both of you may become very emotional and need some privacy. Over text, e-mail, or the telephone. If you really love this person, then you owe it to them to have the discussion face-to-face. The only exception to this rule is if you are in a long-distance relationship and seeing each other in person is impractical. Even then, try to do it over Skype or the telephone rather than the more impersonal venues of text or email."

      "content": "Prepare your partner for the conversation. In other words, don't surprise this person with the news by blurting it out in the middle of a conversation or while they are busy doing something else. Pull your partner aside and say \"I want to talk to you about something,\" or \"I think that we should talk.\" You may want to send an e-mail or text message to your partner asking to talk prior to getting together. This will give them ample time to emotionally prepare for a serious conversation. You do not want to break up with the person through text, but let them know a serious conversation will happen in the near future."

      "title": "Use “I” statements.",
      "content": "Use “I” statements. These statements more effectively deflect feelings of judgement, and concisely get your point across. For example, you may say something like: \"I really feel like kids are not part of my plan.\" This might be a better way of saying: \"You want kids and I don’t.\" \"I think I need to spend more time on my own right now.\" This might be a better way of saying: \"You want to spend too much time together.\" \"I need to think about my future.\" This might be a better way of saying \"We are not going anywhere.\""

      "content": "Be honest, but not unnecessarily harsh. Everybody deserves to be told the truth, but at the same time, there are certain things that will only hurt your partner's feelings without serving any constructive purpose. If there is something explicitly wrong with the relationship, like having incompatible interests, then you should tell your partner that. [5] X Research source Being honest and eliminating some of the mystery may help the person move on more quickly rather than constantly wondering why you ended the relationship and what they could have done differently. This might be something like: \"I know you are really into going out all the time, but I just don't enjoy it. I don't think we'll continue to be happy with this incompatibility.\" Find a nice way to phrase your criticisms. If you love the person, then you should make an effort to protect their self-esteem. For example, instead of saying \"I don't find you attractive anymore,\" say something like \"I no longer feel that there's any chemistry between us.\" Try to stay away from any insults or comments that go \"below the belt\" and would unnecessarily hurt your partner's feelings. Reassure your partner that you still love and genuinely care for them. This will help ease some of the feelings associated with being rejected. You might say something like: “I think you’re a really great person. You’re very smart and have a lot of ambitions. I just think my ambitions are different.”"

      "content": "Suggest staying friends. If you genuinely want to stay friends with this person, then you should express the sentiment at the end of the breakup. Again, be prepared for the possibility that they will be too hurt to stay friends with you, at least initially. Respect your partner's needs and give them space if needed. Don't continue to call or text your ex on a regular basis once the breakup is over. This will send mixed signals and make moving on impossible. Even if you have decided to stay friends, you should take some time apart just after the breakup during which you don't see or speak to each other. After some time has passed after the breakup and the feelings are not quite as raw, consider opening up to your ex. This might be a group outing (it might be best to avoid a one-on-one outing to avoid sending mixed signals.) You might want to try and say something like: “Hey, some friends and I are going to watch that new movie. Do you want to come?”"

Though it may seem impossible to totally cut off contact with somebody you love, staying in contact constantly will actually make things a great deal more painful. If you feel tempted, block your partner’s number from your phone. Block their username from social media sites. This will help with the temptation. [6] X Research source"

This might be an indication that you should take some time to get to know yourself and to readjust to being single before jumping into a new relationship. Look at this as a learning opportunity and a chance to grow as a person. Reflect on your relationship and think about what role you played in it not working out. You don't need to blame yourself or feel guilty, but it can be helpful to take an honest look at what happened so you can learn from it.
