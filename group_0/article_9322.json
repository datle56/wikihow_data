      "content": "The Hue Bridge is not designed to connect to Wi-Fi directly. The biggest advantage of connecting a Hue Bridge to Wi-Fi is being able to place it anywhere you want. Unfortunately, there’s no practical way to do this. However, there are some workarounds you can do to extend the range of your Bridge. You will need to plug the Bridge into your Wi-Fi router with a cable to enable it to connect wirelessly to your lights."

      "title": "Connect the Bridge to your router with an ethernet cable.",
      "content": "Connect the Bridge to your router with an ethernet cable. The Hue Bridge connects to any available ethernet port on your wireless router using an ethernet cable. This is the standard way to connect a Hue Bridge to the internet. Plug the provided ethernet cable into the Bridge and the opposite end into an open ethernet slot on your router. Once the four lights on the Bridge light up, it is ready to set up."

      "title": "Use Wi-Fi extenders to increase the range of the Bridge.",
      "content": "Use Wi-Fi extenders to increase the range of the Bridge. Wi-Fi extenders expand your Wi-Fi network coverage . You plug them into your wall, and they pick up the Wi-Fi signal from the router and boost it. If you have a Wi-Fi extender set up and it has an ethernet port on it, you can connect your Hue Bridge to the Wi-Fi extender. This allows you to place your Hue Bridge in a more centralized location."

      "title": "Try a powerline adapter so you can place the Bridge more centrally.",
      "content": "Try a powerline adapter so you can place the Bridge more centrally. Powerline adapters work similarly to Wi-Fi extenders. To set up your Bridge with powerline adapters: Connect one powerline adapter connected to the router via an ethernet cable and then plug it into the wall. You can then plug a second powerline adapter into another electrical outlet. The first powerline adapter can send an internet signal to the second powerline adapter via the powerline. Connect your Hue Bridge to the second powerline adapter to connect it to the internet in a more centralized location."

      "title": "Set up a second router in bridge mode to boost your signal.",
      "content": "Set up a second router in bridge mode to boost your signal. In addition to Wi-Fi extenders and powerline adapters, you can also use another router as a Wi-Fi extender. To do this, you must connect the second router to the main router using an ethernet cable. Then you need to set up the second router to function in bridge mode . This turns the router into a Wi-Fi extender. You can then connect your Hue Bridge to the second wireless router using an ethernet cable."

The bad news is, it's disabled by default. Activating it requires knowledge of circuit boards and computer programming. It will also void your warranty. [1] X Research source To get this to work: You will need to open the Hue Bridge case and solder a 1x6 header to J1. Then you will need to connect a 3.3V board connector to the pins. Next, you will need to connect it to your computer and open a remote connection using an SSH program , such as PuTTY. Finally, you’ll have to gain root access and change the settings. This will require knowledge of the Linux OpenWrt operating system. You can find a complete guide here ."
