Look for anything that needs cleaning at least once everyday, even if it's not a scheduled cleaning day. Cleaning your hamster's cage too often or too little can cause them undue stress [1] X Research source , so make sure you are cleaning the right amount when needed. Look for any droppings or wet areas in the bedding material. You can spot remove some areas. However, if there are a lot of them you should change the bedding. Pick out any leftover food that your hamster may have left laying around the cage. Change the water daily. If the bedding material has become soaked or damp near the water dispenser, you may want to change the bedding out. If the walls of the enclosure are looking dirty or smudged, it may be time for a full cleaning. If the cage smells you must clean it fully. Hamsters have a very sensitive sense of smell and can fall ill if the cage is unclean or the air quality is too poor. [2] X Research source"
