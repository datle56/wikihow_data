    {
      "title": "Use the title of “professor.”",
      "content": "Use the title of “professor.” Whoever you are writing to most likely holds this title due to a position in an academic setting. This means that you must address them formally as “professor.” If the professor has a doctorate, you may refer to them as \"Dr. Smith\" or whatever their last name is. If they do not have a doctorate, simply saying \"Hello professor\" is fine. Avoid using first names or other names until you've been told by the professor that it's OK to use those names. If you're addressing multiple professors in an email, mention all of their names at the start of the email unless there are more than 3 people."

    {
      "title": "Use formal language and words.",
      "content": "Use formal language and words. Every interaction that you have with a professor should be treated as a professional one. To be treated as a mature, respectful adult, you must act like one. This means that using colloquialisms, slang, or other informal vernacular is not appropriate. Instead of saying, \"hi professor, can i plz be in ur research lab for bio?\" say something like, \"Hi professor, I am wondering if there is any room in your Biology 101 lab?\" Once you have established a relationship with a professor, there might be room for branching out in this area, but always start with formal language."

      "title": "Be concise with your writing.",
      "content": "Be concise with your writing. Professors are typically exceptionally busy people so keeping your writing concise and to the point is of the utmost importance. Avoid using superfluous language or over-explaining yourself. [1] X Research source Getting straight to your message after saying \"Hello professor\" is a good option. Try and save the casual chit-chat for in-person conversations where a more informal demeanor may be appropriate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Proofread your message thoroughly before sending it.",
      "content": "Proofread your message thoroughly before sending it. You are looking to be treated as a social and intellectual peer by this person. Because of this, making sure your writing is free from typos or grammatical errors is really important. Reading your message out loud may help you pinpoint any errors you have made if this is an area you struggle with. Feel free to get a friend to proofread your message as a second pair of eyes is often really useful for finding errors."

    {
      "title": "Address them by their correct title.",
      "content": "Address them by their correct title. When conversing with a professor it’s important to call them by their formal title. It’s always safe, if it’s an academic setting, to simply call them “professor.” First names and nicknames should always be avoided. Many professors prefer their students call them by their first name or some other name but unless this has been established prior, avoid this. If the professor has a doctorate degree, it's also acceptable to call them \"doctor\" followed by their last name. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Introduce yourself when you first get the chance.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself when you first get the chance. It’s always a good thing to have a positive relationship with your professor, or any professor for that matter. As such, introduce yourself on the first day of class or during your first interaction. [3] X Research source An example of a good introduction may be: \"Hello professor Smith, my name is Joe and I'm hoping to talk to you about your biology class.\" Doing this can mean that when you need your professor’s help or assistance on something down the line, you have a prior relationship established."

    {
      "title": "Ask them if now is a good time to speak with you.",
      "content": "Ask them if now is a good time to speak with you. As professors are perpetually busy, it’s a nice gesture to just check that they have the time to talk to you rather than just assuming they do and beginning to talk. Alternatively, signing up for a time with them via email or some other method is a good idea. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Be clear with what you are asking of them.",
      "content": "Be clear with what you are asking of them. If you have a question, try and be direct and concise. As you’re talking in person, it’s OK to have a brief introductory bit of conversation. After this, however, try and convey what you’re asking of them nice and succinctly. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Drop in to their office hours to have a more casual chat.",
      "content": "Drop in to their office hours to have a more casual chat. Most professors are required by their school to open their doors up to students on a walk-in basis a few times per week. However, these times are rarely utilized by students, so the professor may be free to chat during their office hours. [6] X Research source These times provide great opportunities to get to know your professor on a slightly more personal level. Take the opportunity to let them know what interests you about their class, what possible research you have in mind for the future, or even a little bit about their past and their interests."
