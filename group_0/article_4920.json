      "content": "This will help you choose an appropriate boat design. You can’t build a boat that will do everything, so make sure to do your research and narrow down your options. For example, you shouldn’t build a 24' Tolman Alaskan Skiff expecting to use it on a small lake, Midwest river, or pond. On the other hand, taking your 12' rowboat 10 miles (16 km) out in the Gulf of Mexico is probably not the best idea either!"

Free boat plans on the internet are usually outdated and difficult to read, so try to invest in a modern plan that provides clear instructions and helpful tips. It might not be free, but it will save you money (and headaches) in the long run.

      "content": "Use marine grade plywood and quality epoxy resin. A plywood boat can be beautiful if built, finished, and painted correctly . Using cheap materials will result in poor performance and could be dangerous to your health, depending on which body of water you are using your boat, how far from land you are, and how well you sealed your hull! Use fir, meranti, or okoume plywood. They do not have voids and will not delaminate. It will also use much less epoxy resin as it won't have voids that are common to many cheaper residential construction-grade plywood. [2] X Research source Some good brands of epoxy resin include: Aeromarine, System Three, West Marine, and Mas. The boat designer should include the amount of epoxy needed to build the boat design you choose in their plan. Buy a 5–15 gallon (18.9–56.8 L) epoxy resin kit to save money. If you are building a larger boat, you may be able to have your epoxy supplier drop ship your epoxy on a pallet to save you money on shipping."

[3] X Research source There are dozens of good marine supply stores online that will sell you a quality fiberglass and your boat plans should have the amount (length in yards) and weight (ounces) of cloth you will use on your boat."

      "content": "Use marine paint to seal your fiberglass work and make your boat shine. Giving your boat a nice finish with marine paint is the key to the longevity of your fiberglass work and the appearance of your boat. Fairing (smoothing and filling your fiberglass cloth grid) and sanding are key to a beautiful show quality finish, but may not be necessary for a work boat in the bayou."
