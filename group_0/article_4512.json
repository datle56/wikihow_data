However, when it comes to escaping abuse, stepping out of your comfort zone is a really positive move. [2] X Expert Source Jeremy Bartz, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 8 January 2021."

There's a good chance that your abuser will attempt to lead you to believe that you deserve the abuse; that you did something wrong and are being punished for it. Remember, though, that it is never acceptable for one human being to abuse another. Also, abuse doesn't have to mean consistent physical violence; it can also include cases where: [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source You have never been physically hit. Abuse can be primarily emotional or verbal. The abuse doesn’t seem as bad as other instances of abuse you’ve heard about. You have been hit once or a couple of times. If your abuser has struck you once, there's a good chance he will do it again. The abuse stopped after you gave into your abuser's demands."

This hope may be fueled in part by the abuser's honeymooning behaviors. Do not let his behavior in the honeymoon phase fool you.

This feeling may be compounded by circumstances, such as poverty or fear of being alone. You may not have the means to relocate, you may be holding onto hope that your abuser will change, you may not trust authority figures, your self-esteem may be so low you believe your abuser, or you may face other daunting blockades to leaving your abuser. It will not be easy. It will be uncomfortable and difficult. But by finding ways to empower yourself and increase your self-confidence, you can begin to take steps to get help. Ways you might increase your self-esteem include spending time with friends or family who support you, exercising, making a detailed escape plan so you know you can get away if necessary, seek counseling or talking to a doctor or social worker, participating in activities you enjoy and make you feel good about yourself, connecting to your community through religious services or volunteer work.
