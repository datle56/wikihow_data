      "content": "Water the lucky bamboo only when the top few centimeters are dry. Bamboo is thirsty and vulnerable to overwatering, so finding the perfect balance is crucial. Water thoroughly once the top few centimeters are dry. Use your finger to inspect the soil. Reduce watering in the winter. [1] X Research source Alternatively, wait for the top 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) of soil to dry out before each watering session. If the soil stays moist for over a day, reduce the water. There should be enough water to run out of the pot's base. If the top of the soil dries out too quickly, dig down to 4 in (10 cm) deep to check for moisture. [2] X Research source This depth should stay lightly moist, especially during the first three months after planting. Lucky bamboo is not a traditional bamboo plant; it’s actually a type of tropical water lily called Dracaena Sanderiana. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Maintain a humid environment between 65–90 °F (18–32 °C). Most varieties of bamboo plants prefer humid air, especially in hot water. To create humidity in your home, place a pot over a humidity tray , lightly mist the leaves with a spray bottle every few days, run a humidifier , or keep plants close together. [4] X Research source If you’re placing plants close together, be aware this may increase disease risk."

[5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For lucky bamboo, though, the plant does best in moderate levels of indirect sunlight. Direct exposure can be too strong for the leaves, causing it to warp and turn brown. [6] X Research source If your plant needs more light than your climate provides, install evening growing lights. If the stalks turn white, the plant is distressed and requires a shady environment. [7] X Research source Popular indoor bamboo species include Lucky Bamboo, Silverstripe, Kimmei, Yellow Groove, Koi, and Viridis. [8] X Research source If you don’t know the species, start with these rules of thumb: Needs more light: –plants with small leaves –tropical species –plants kept in warm rooms Needs less light: –plants with large leaves –temperate species during dormant winter periods –plants kept in cool rooms"

      "content": "Add a drop of fertilizer every 6 to 8 weeks. Fortunately, many bamboo species don’t require a constant diet of fertilizer. In fact, if you’re growing bamboo in water, it gets all the nutrients it needs from the nitrogen in the water! [9] X Research source But, if you want to give your plant a little extra boost, opt for a balanced liquid or a bamboo-specific fertilizer with an N-P-K ratio of 10:10:10 or 20:20:20. [10] X Research source N-P-K stands for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Skip fertilizing within the first 6 months of purchasing your bamboo. Most plants get enough fertilizer from the nursery. Avoid seaweed-based fertilizers due to their excessive salt content. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Prune the stems regularly during any season.",
      "content": "Prune the stems regularly during any season. Most bamboo plants tolerate pruning, so don’t hesitate to shape it once it’s established or healthy. Cut just above a node if you’re pruning to reduce height. Cut as close to the soil if you’re thinning dead, stunted, or old stems. Make the cut straight across with sterilized shears . [12] X Research source Thin branches regularly if you want to encourage vertical growth. Plant Specialist Ryan Glynn advises against pruning the leaves of a Lucky Bamboo. “It’s a plant that doesn’t keep leaves all along its trunk. It’s really just at the top [where] it has leaves for photosynthesis. So [you’ll] want to leave those alone.”"

      "content": "Re-pot or divide the bamboo when it outgrows its container. Plant Specialist Lindsey M Swett suggests for bamboo growing in soil, ensure the roots have enough space. Once they reach the maximum growing point, increase the pot size to accommodate the roots in the spring. To split dense clumps, use a mattock, axe, or saw and carefully lift the plant, shaking off the excess soil. Then, break the root mass into two sections. Pull the roots apart gently until you have separate plants. [13] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source To restrict growth, dig up the plant, cut away about ⅓ of the roots, and replant in the same container with fresh potting mix. Bamboo can grow in two different patterns depending on the species. \"Runners\" send out long shoots to start new plants and will spiral around a large container within three to five years. \"Clumpers\" grow steadily outward and may last up to six years in the same pot."

      "title": "Take a cutting from an established plant to propagate bamboo.",
      "content": "Take a cutting from an established plant to propagate bamboo. Select a lucky bamboo that is at least 1-2 years old and free of disease to take a cutting from. Use sterilized, sharp cutting shears to cut from the main stalk. Cut just below a node, where its leaves or side shoots sprout. Each cutting should contain 3-4 intact nodes to ensure new roots and shoots. [14] X Research source Remove the bottom-most pair of leaves from the cutting to conserve energy for root establishment. Ryan Glenn recommends having at least 5–6 in (13–15 cm) worth of a healthy stalk. These will easily propagate once plopped into the water. If you’re growing a hardier bamboo, propagate during March or April; May or early June for tropical varieties. [15] X Research source"

Submerge the bottom portion of the stem so it can propagate. It takes up to 30 days for roots to appear. Once they do, plant the cutting into soil or water. [16] X Research source Propagation may not work on bamboo with no hole or tiny holes in the center of the stalk. [17] X Research source You can also dip the cut end of the stalk in colored melted wax to seal the cut and discourage disease entry before placing it in water. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Select a pot twice the root ball’s diameter to give it space to grow.",
      "content": "Select a pot twice the root ball’s diameter to give it space to grow. Opt for a wide, squat pot so the bamboo roots have plenty of space to grow. Choose a container twice the diameter of the root ball or with at least 2 in (5.1 cm) of space between the root ball and the pot's walls. Similarly, good drainage is key to the survival of most bamboo species, so ensure there are sizeable holes in the pot's base. [19] X Research source Line the container with a plastic root barrier if the pot is cement (which can damage the bamboo) or wood (which lasts longer if protected from moisture)."

      "content": "Use a humidity tray to add moisture to the air. Lucky bamboo loves humidity, which can make indoor growing a challenge. Keeping water under the bamboo without letting it soak the roots is the easiest way to add moisture to the air. There are two ways to set this up: Pebble tray 1. Fill a tray with a layer of pebbles. 2. Add a shallow layer of water to the tray. 3. Place the pot on top of the pebbles without touching the water. Gravel 1. Put a layer of gravel in the bottom of the pot. 2. Place the pot in a shallow tray of water."

      "content": "Opt for a fast-draining potting soil with a pH level of 6.0 to 6.5. Bamboo needs light to moderate density soil: wellt-draining but able to hold moisture. You can use a standard potting mix or make your own from ⅓ loam, ⅓ perlite (or washed sand), and ⅓ peat moss (or well-rotted compost). [20] X Research source You can use decent-quality soil from your garden instead of potting soil. Avoid heavy clay soil, which drains poorly and is difficult to improve. Bamboo tends to do best in slightly acidic soil, with a pH between 6.0 and 6.5, but most species tolerate a pH up to 7.5. Most soil falls into this range. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill the container with the soil, placing the bamboo at a shallow depth. Keep the stem and the top of the root ball slightly lower than the container, so it has 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil covering the surface. This helps prevent rot. Press the soil down to remove air bubbles, and water the plant with a good soak. Add a layer of mulch or compost to trap the moisture.

      "title": "Bamboo may lose leaves after being moved indoors or transplanted.",
      "content": "Bamboo may lose leaves after being moved indoors or transplanted. Wilted or falling leaves indicate your bamboo is unhappy with the temperature—either too hot or too cold. This is especially prevalent after moving the plant from outside to indoors or when it’s first transplanted. Stabilize its climate by keeping it away from draft windows or direct sunlight. [26] X Research source Temperate species often drop leaves during low-light conditions. A cool, low-light dormant period in winter is good for these plants and reduces leaf drop. The fewer green leaves there are, the less water the plant needs. Many species drop leaves in spring (or, less commonly, fall), gradually replacing them with new ones. The plant is probably fine if there's a mix of green, yellow, and new, unfurling leaves."

      "title": "Add more fertilizer if the leaves are pale and yellow.",
      "content": "Add more fertilizer if the leaves are pale and yellow. It’s common for leaves to turn yellow during a bamboo’s dormant season (winter). However, outside of its dormant season, Plant Specialist Lindsey M Swett says, “Leaves that slowly become paler and more yellow usually have a nutrient deficiency. Add fertilizer with added minerals [to help it grow.]” A sudden color change after fertilizing points to over-fertilizing. Treat this problem by removing any remaining fertilizer and watering abundantly to leach out the excess minerals."

      "title": "Use an insecticide or other commercial sprays for insect infestations.",
      "content": "Use an insecticide or other commercial sprays for insect infestations. Indoor bamboo plants are more vulnerable to these problems, especially if the room has low airflow. If there is a light insect infestation, wash the leaves with insecticidal soap , or spray it outdoors with an insecticide spray. If this doesn't work, or if you think the plant has a disease, try to identify it and respond: A black \"sooty\" mold is usually caused by insects. Remove aphids and ants . [28] X Research source Circular fungus rings, or grey/brown scales usually do not harm the plant. An anti-fungus treatment from a garden store can remove it. [29] X Research source Wet, rotting patches are a sign of overwatering or infestations. Dry them out and treat them with insecticide or fungicide. Sticky white webbing may hide bamboo mites or other insects. Spray it off and apply insecticide. There are over 1,400 species of bamboo, so no one guide will cover all problems. If your plant has a disease that doesn't match the description above, consult a local garden center or university agricultural extension about diseases in your area."
