      "title": "Put your basic needs first.",
      "content": "Put your basic needs first. When you notice yourself needing something whether it is intimacy, affection, or attention, give yourself what you need. If you need attention, take a day to pamper yourself in some way or reach out to someone you love. If you need intimacy, spend time writing in a journal or exploring nature. If you need affection, give yourself affection by thinking about what you love about yourself or taking yourself out for dinner and a movie. The more easily you can meet your own emotional needs, the healthier your relationships will be because you will know and understand yourself and be better able to express yourself to your partner. It's great to take care of other people. But don't let that take away from your own core needs. You can't pour from an empty cup, and you can't help others if you aren't taking care of yourself."

      "content": "Don't compare yourself to other women. Having a female role model to look up to is great. Just be careful that you don’t fall into jealousy. Although jealousy is natural to some degree, western society tends to exacerbate female jealousy through advertisements and films that feature unrealistic standards. Remember, it's not fair to compare someone else's highlights reel to your bloopers. Every woman struggles with something behind the scenes. This jealousy and “catty-ness” is called \"relational aggression.\" [1] X Research source Coyne, S.M., Linder, J.R., Nelson, D.A., &amp; Gentile, D.A. (2012). ‘Frenemies, fraitors, and mean-em-aitors’: Priming effects of viewing physical and relational aggression in the media on women. Aggressive Behavior, 38(2), p. 141-149. doi: 10.1002/ab.21410 Studies have shown that media plays an important role in modeling relational aggression in women. Women who are victims of relational aggression are more likely to suffer from low self-esteem and feel rejected and lonely. [2] X Research source Ostrov, J.M., Hart, E.J., Kamper, K.E., Godleski, S.A. (2011). Relational aggression in women during emerging adulthood: A social processes model. Behavioral Sciences &amp; The Law, 29(5), 695-710. doi:10.1002/bsl.1002 The result is a culture of women who feel insecure and unhappy with themselves. Recognize when you experience jealousy. The first step to overcoming jealousy is to recognize when you are experiencing it. If you find yourself reading a magazine and comparing your own body to those of the models, stop for a moment. Do you compare everyone you see in the street to magazine models? Probably not, so spare yourself that judgment too. Models are people who happen to have features that make a good fit for what magazines are looking for, and they are people who are dedicating their lives to modeling as a job. They are no \"better\" or \"worse\" than you."

For example, set boundaries with regards to as how much time you spend with someone, or the kinds of criticisms you are not willing to hear. Be sure you have other things going on in your life outside of any romantic relationship, whether it is school, work, friends, a fitness routine, or your family. Set clear boundaries with the individual and communicate to this person your need to be your own independent person. Once the boundaries have been discussed, stick to them."

You must learn how to stand up for yourself at school, at work, and in your social life. Work on asserting yourself . Don’t be ashamed or apologetic about asserting yourself. Assertiveness is the middle ground between passivity and aggression. People who are effectively assertive are more happy in relationships and have higher self-esteem. [3] X Research source Use “I” statements . These types of statements are less accusatory, and instead they convey that you are taking responsibility for your own actions and feelings. For example, instead of saying, “You never listen to me,” you can say, “I feel ignored when you constantly check your phone while talking to me.” Learn to say no. Put your own needs first instead of always trying to accommodate other people first. If someone keeps asking to borrow money, for example, you can decline their request. If a friend keeps borrowing your car, you can tell her that the car is not available for her anymore."

It can be difficult to become more comfortable with how you look, but try focusing on a part of your body that you like. Think about different parts of your body and how they look right for your body. Focus less on what your body looks like, and more on what it can do.

It's also important to say no to well-meaning people who might not know what your comfort zone is. You can say no anytime someone wants to do something that you'd rather not do. Be honest. To turn down a date, try \"I'm flattered, but not interested.\" In other situations, you can say things like \"No thanks,\" \"I don't like that,\" \"I'm not ready for that yet,\" or whatever feels true in the situation. Politely saying no almost always works. If someone ignores it, you may have to be firm. If someone repeatedly ignores a no, go ahead and make a scene. Yelp or recoil from their touch. Start crying, loudly, and ask why they won't leave you alone. This is a perfectly reasonable reaction to someone who ignores a polite \"no\" and it puts them on the spot for not respecting your boundaries. If someone forces themselves on you, reach out for help.

If you take medication, follow the instructions and use alarms or pill organizers to help you stay consistent. Some doctors don't take women's health problems seriously. It's okay to get a second opinion if your doctor isn't listening. For example, maybe one doctor says you just need to lose weight to solve your incapacitating period pain, but the next one finds and diagnoses the issue. Beware online rumors that circulate based on vague personal anecdotes and no research evidence. The internet rumor mill can spread lots of myths and conspiracy theories about health.
