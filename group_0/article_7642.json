      "content": "Determine if you have brass-plated metal. [2] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Professional Cleaner Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. There are two kinds of brass hinges: solid brass hinges, and hinges made of brass-plated steel, zinc, or cast iron. Place a magnet next to the brass hinge you’re interested in cleaning. If it sticks, you’ll know it is not made of solid brass. [3] X Research source If the brass hinge you’re interested in cleaning is made of brass-plated zinc, cast iron, or steel, clean it very gently or the brass coating might come off."

      "content": "Wipe the brass hinge with soapy water. Mix hot water with a few drops of liquid dish soap. There is no need to measure the volume of soap or water – just get the solution sudsy. Dip a warm sponge or cloth in the water and wipe the hinge down.

      "content": "Use ammonia on unlacquered brass plate. If your brass-plated hinges are unlacquered, you could wipe the hinge with an old toothbrush or rag dipped in ammonia if soapy water doesn’t do the trick. Rinse the hinges off in your sink beneath swiftly-flowing water. Dry with a clean, soft cloth. Do not use this method if your hinges are lacquered, as you will damage the coating. To determine if your brass-plated hinges are lacquered, conduct a visual inspection. The lacquer forms a thin, clear shell over the brass-plated hinge. Brass plate is almost always lacquered."

      "content": "Use a commercial cleaning product. A wide variety of commercial cleaning products can help you clean brass. While the specific directions for these products vary with manufacturer, generally you will spray the product on the brass hinge, then wipe it down with a clean cloth. Popular brass cleaning products include Wright’s Premium Brass Cleaning Polish and Brasso Multipurpose Polish. Test the cleaning product on an inconspicuous area of the hinge before applying it to the whole thing. If the cleaning product causes the brass plate to flake off, discontinue use of that product and try another instead. Consult manufacturer directions before using any brass cleaning product."

      "content": "Coat the hinges in yogurt. Use a spatula to lightly cover the hinge in plain yogurt.

      "title": "Simmer the hinges in milk.",
      "content": "Simmer the hinges in milk. Another dairy-based cleaning solution involves combing equal parts water and milk. For instance, you might mix five tablespoons of water and five tablespoons of milk in small pot. Whatever volume of each you choose to combine, ensure it coats the hinges completely. Place the hinges in the pot, bring it to a boil, then turn the heat to its lowest setting. The amount of time it takes to get your brass hinges clean by simmering them in milk depends on the extent of grime and tarnish the hinges have acquired. Use tongs to pull the hinges out every 10 minutes and examine them. If they’re clean, turn the stovetop off and rinse your hinges in water. If the hinges are not clean, drop them back in their milk bath."

      "content": "Remove paint from your hinges with a crockpot. Place your brass hinges in a crockpot. Cover the hinges with water. Set the crockpot to low and let the hinges “cook” for a few hours. Pull the hinges out using tongs or just conduct a visual inspection to discern whether the paint is coming off. If the paint is coming off, remove it and restore the hinge to its rightful place. If it is not, place it back in the crockpot for another few hours. If, after another dip in the crockpot, the paint is still not coming off or has only partially come off, rub a cloth dampened with mineral spirits over the entire surface of the hinge. This should further loosen the paint. This technique also works for removing lacquer from brass hinges."
