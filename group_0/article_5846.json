      "title": "Use a trigger capo.",
      "content": "Use a trigger capo. Trigger capos work by using a spring-loaded clamp to hold their tension. This clamp is simply is squeezed to open and close the capo. Players like trigger capos because they can be quickly and easily repositioned using just one hand, making them great for live performances. [1] X Research source This is the recommended type of capo for beginners, as it is simple and easy to use."

      "content": "Try using a screw capo if you want greater control over your capo's pressure against the strings. Screw capos work using an adjustable knob that can be screwed to your desired amount of pressure. The downfall about screw capos is their impracticality – it's hard to do a live show when you have to keep screwing and unscrewing your capo in place. However, these capos are sometimes preferred when recording music because of the amount of control they give the guitar player. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy a Shubb capo.",
      "content": "Buy a Shubb capo. This design combines the speed of a trigger capo with the precision of a screw capo. Shubb capos use a simple lever, which can be adjusted for tension, and can easily be flipped on or off. Though they’re more expensive than the previous capos mentioned, they are very popular amongst seasoned guitar players."

      "title": "Invest in a premium capo.",
      "content": "Invest in a premium capo. The G7th performance capos have become a favorite amongst many guitar players, as they are gentle, practical, and give the player great control. These capos allow for easy tension adjustment – all you need to do is squeeze it down over the desired location, and the G7th performance capo automatically locks in place. To release the capo, all you have to do is flip a lever. Some reviews claim that this capo is actually better at preserving the tone of your guitar as well."

      "title": "Hold your guitar and capo in the proper position.",
      "content": "Hold your guitar and capo in the proper position. Set your guitar on your lap, or place it around your shoulders using your guitar strap. You should position your guitar how you would typically play it, even if you were not using a capo. Hold your capo in your fretting hand so you can easily clip it in place."

      "title": "Place your capo on the desired fret.",
      "content": "Place your capo on the desired fret. Using a capo raises the key one half-step for every fret. If you place the capo on the first fret, the new key will be one half-step higher. If you place the capo on the second fret, the new key will be two half-steps higher. This continues with every fret. [3] X Research source For a specific example, let's use a standard E tuning. Say you've placed a capo on the third fret. The E strings become Gs (three half steps higher in pitch than E). All the strings become three half steps higher in pitch once the capo is applied — B becomes D; G becomes Bb; D becomes F; and A becomes C. [4] X Research source If you're reading a tab sheet, the tab will typically tell you which fret to place your capo on. [5] X Research source (Example: Capo 4, meaning capo on the fourth fret)."

      "content": "Open the capo and clamp it down in the fret, slightly behind the fret bar. There are a few kinds of capos that operate slightly differently, though they essentially do the same thing. All have two thick rubber paddings that clamp down on the strings of your guitar. The longer side of the capo that comes in contact with the strings is the front. The back of the capo is usually shorter and clamps down on the back of the guitar neck. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your capo properly on the neck of your guitar.",
      "content": "Place your capo properly on the neck of your guitar. If you place your capo on the wrong part of your guitar, it can easily become out of tune. The capo should be placed in the fret, just behind the fret bar. Do not leave a large space between the capo and the fret bar, but don't place it directly on top of the fret bar either. If you place the capo too far back in the fret, it may cause your guitar to go sharp."

      "title": "Play below the capo.",
      "content": "Play below the capo. Once you place a capo on your guitar, only the strings below the capo will be in the new raised key. The section below the capo is the part of the neck closer to the body of your guitar. The section above the capo is the part of the neck closer to the head and tuning pegs of the guitar. Be sure to only play below the capo once you've placed it on your guitar. [7] X Research source All of the chords you play below the capo will sound like they're in a higher key. Play the chords as you normally would."

      "title": "Use your capo in a live performance.",
      "content": "Use your capo in a live performance. Many guitarists choose to clip their capo on the head of their guitar during a live performance so that it is easily accessible throughout their show. This allows the guitarist to easily use the capo for some songs and take it back off for others."

      "content": "Find the best key for a singer. All voices are different, so the original keys of some songs may not be a fit for every singer. Capos come in handy when you have to find a new key of a song for a singer. Using a capo will allow you to play the song in the new key without having to learn entirely new chords.

      "title": "Use a capo to get a different timbre.",
      "content": "Use a capo to get a different timbre. A guitar capo can do much more than simply change the key of a song, it can create an entirely different sonic experience. For example, playing in the key of A with and without a capo will have entirely different feels even though you're playing in the same key, so experiment with your capo to hear the differences. Essentially, you'll be using different voicing to play the same chords, which produce entirely different sounds."
