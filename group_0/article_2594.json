      "title": "Opt for a functional pair of fancy cowboy or cowgirl boots.",
      "content": "Opt for a functional pair of fancy cowboy or cowgirl boots. Boots should be functional first and foremost because they are meant to protect your feet and ankles as you ride. However, you can also have a fancy pair for going into town. Whatever kind you choose, they are the perfect complement to any outfit. [1] X Research source Boots can be made from anything, including leather, snakeskin, and even ostrich."

    {
      "title": "Get a pair of long jeans.",
      "content": "Get a pair of long jeans. Jeans should gather on top of your boots. That's because if you get on a horse, you don't want the bottom of your jeans to lift above the tops of your boots. The jeans should also be boot-cut, meaning they fit over your boots but still stay close to your legs. [2] X Research source Wrangler jeans are a good option because the seams are on the outer edges rather than the inside. That means they won't chafe as much. You can also opt for overalls if you prefer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tuck in a button-down shirt.",
      "content": "Tuck in a button-down shirt. A button-down shirt is the perfect complement to a good pair of jeans. Long-sleeve is traditional, but you can wear short-sleeve if that's more comfortable. Plaid is always a good choice, but you can also wear prints or plain colors if you'd like. [3] X Research source It's important to tuck it in if you want the classic country look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try a loose dress over skinny jeans and boots.",
      "content": "Try a loose dress over skinny jeans and boots. Another classic look is wearing a maxi dress or a shorter dress over skinny jeans. If you opt for skinny jeans, though, make sure to tuck them into your boots instead of the other way around. [4] X Research source Any kind of dress will work for this look, really, but aim for one that has a loose fit over the bottom half of your body."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add accessories like belts and hats.",
      "content": "Add accessories like belts and hats. A hat isn't strictly necessary, but it's a good way to top off your outfit. The only option is a western-style cowboy hat, which helps to keep the sun off while you're outside. Suede or leather are your best choices. A leather belt is also a good addition in brown or black. [5] X Research source A large belt buckle with a western theme is optional but fun."

    {
      "title": "Dress how you want and be comfortable.",
      "content": "Dress how you want and be comfortable. Sure, you can don a pair of cowboy boots, jeans, and a button-down shirt, but really, life in the country is about being practical and comfortable. You don't need to worry about designer labels (unless it's that fancy brand of cowboy boots). Just dress how you want instead of trying to impress people with fancy labels. [6] X Research source Keep in mind, though, that if you wear stilettos and a short black dress to the grocery store, you might stick out a little bit."

      "title": "Relax and appreciate the small things.",
      "content": "Relax and appreciate the small things. While you can go to a fancy new restaurant or a hip club every night, you need to learn to slow down and be grateful for the small joys in life for a country attitude. Make yourself some fresh lemonade, plant some lovely smelling flowers, or take a walk through the country or a park. Pet your dog or just cook yourself a fresh meal with ingredients from your garden or the local farmer's market. It's these little things that make country life special."

      "title": "Greet neighbors and strangers alike.",
      "content": "Greet neighbors and strangers alike. In the country, life is a little slower, and people tend to be a little nicer. It's common to wave to your neighbors and to hold a conversation with the clerk while you're checking out at the grocery store. Don't be afraid to say hello or strike up a conversation when you meet people. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Embrace the quiet and solitude.",
      "content": "Embrace the quiet and solitude. While many small-town communities are close-knit, you're still going to be spending a lot of time on your own. Be ready to entertain yourself with books and hobbies, while enjoying life with your family, if you have one. If you don't live in the country, try embracing solitude in your city life by spending time alone in your home or out in nature. [8] X Research source Spend time outdoors enjoying the view and take in the night stars!"

      "title": "Reduce and reuse",
      "content": "Reduce and reuse everything. When you live in the country, it takes more work to get the things you need. You learn to be resourceful and reuse the things you have so you don't have to run into town every few minutes. Don't have a flowerpot? Use that old bucket you had for washing your car. Need a food dish for your dog? Cut up an old coffee container and wash it out thoroughly. Plus, when you live in the country, you may not have trash pickup. You'll want to reduce your waste as much as possible! That same principle is just as smart if you live in a city."

      "content": "Get involved in town and community events. Many people who live in the country get involved in their local communities, and you can do the same. Try going to local festivals that are unique to what's grown in the area, such as a watermelon festival or even a sorghum festival! Your area may have events that cropped due to people who immigrated to the area, such as Italian, Polish, German, or Greek festivals. Alternatively, try participating in events at your library or going to political events. Your local church or community center may have community events, too. Keep an eye out when you're in town. You're sure to see posters for local events!"

      "content": "Be kind to your neighbors. In the country, everyone tends to look out for one another, and you can do the same. Check in on your neighbors when they're sick, for instance, or invite them over for dinner. Alternatively, share your bounty with them. Maybe you have an abundance of herbs growing on your windowsill or you just made your grandma's molasses cookies. Sharing with your neighbors is a country tradition! Plus, it's a great way to meet people and make friends with those who live nearby."

      "content": "Enjoy the views and wildlife with friends and family. There are many ways to enjoy the outside world, from having a barbecue to hosting a bonfire! You can also take hikes or go fishing. Just take time to be outside and enjoy nature. Being together with friends and family is a great way to create bonds that will last a lifetime.

      "content": "Try your hand at canning and jam-making . Canning and jam-making are popular in the country because it's an easy way to save an overabundant harvest for later. When canning, always boil your lids and jars first so they're sterile. Fill up the jars with what you're canning, making sure the liquid comes up to about 0.25 to 0.5 inches (0.64 to 1.27 cm) from the top of the jar. Use a clean rag to go around the top before putting the lids on. Use canning tongs to set the jars in water and boil them for the recommended time to complete the canning process. [10] X Research source How long you process the jars depends on what you're canning. After you've removed the jars with tongs, listen for the \"ping\" of the lids, which means they're popping down and sealing the jars."

      "content": "Learn to sew . You can of course still buy your clothes from the store, but sewing your own clothes or linens can be a fun country pastime since you don't have quick access to the store. Watch some videos online or take a course on how to use a sewing machine. After that, try reading a pattern. Start with something basic, like a pillow, before jumping into something like a shirt or dress. [11] X Research source For a simple sewing project, place 2 squares of fabric together with the wrong side out. Sew around the outside 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the edges. Leave 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) unsewn and turn it inside out. Stuff the inside, then use a slip stitch to finish your pillow."

      "content": "Plant a garden . Gardening is a long-standing country tradition since you have the space to grow your own food. To start a garden, begin your seeds in potting soil 2 weeks before the last frost, which you can look up online. Till an area in a sunny location in your garden and mix in some compost for fertilizer. Plant your seedlings in the garden once they reach 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm), noting how far they should be spaced apart on the seed package. Keep your garden watered throughout the summer. [12] X Research source Some vegetables will be ready to harvest in mid-summer, such as tomatoes and lettuce. You can also plant lettuce at 2 different times so you have it available for longer. Try veggies like tomatoes, cucumbers, watermelon, and lettuce."

      "content": "Raise chickens or other farm animals. Raising animals is popular in the country because you have the space and time to do it. Farm animals can be a source of food (chicken eggs) and milk (goats or cows). Research the animals you'd like to raise, and then put together a proper habitat for them. You'll also need to research food, medical care, and supplements. [13] X Research source Chickens and ducks are both easy to raise, though chickens will need a coop to roost in at night. Goats and cows will need to be milked each day and will also need a habitat."
