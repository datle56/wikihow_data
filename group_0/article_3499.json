      "content": "Find a space where you can stretch and practice every day. An ideal practice space has hard flooring, plenty of room for movement, and a large mirror to practice in front of. If you’re training at home, the “ideal” space might not be available, so work with what you’ve got! Most importantly, you need ample space to move around. Choose a space that's well-lit for your own safety. [1] X Research source Carpeted floors are fine if that’s all you have. You could even dance outside in the grass as long as the ground is flat. It’s best to find a place that’s relatively private so you can dance without interruption or prying eyes."

      "content": "Warm up for 5-10 minutes before training sessions to prevent injury. Since you’re training without an instructor, it’s crucial that you warm up and stretch properly to avoid hurting yourself. You can jog in place, do jumping jacks, or skip rope to warm up for a training session. The goal is to gently raise your heart rate and stimulate your muscles.

      "title": "Stretch",
      "content": "Stretch for at least 30 minutes a day to improve your flexibility. Hold each stretch for 10-15 seconds. Never push yourself into a stretch that you can’t hold. Try to fit your 30-minute stretching session in whenever you can—stretching in front of the television is still stretching! [3] X Research source Try doing the butterfly stretch to loosen up your inner thighs. Other leg stretches , like hamstring and quadriceps stretches, are also crucial. To stretch your arms and shoulders, start by standing with your feet shoulder width apart. Then, bend your right arm at the elbow and reach behind your back as far to your left side as possible. You can gently grab your right forearm with your left hand to increase the stretch. Hold for 15 seconds and repeat on the other side. Always stretch before and after your training sessions. You can hold stretches for 30 seconds after training, since you’re already warmed up. A lot of flexibility can be gained during the post-training stretching session! Consider taking up yoga to increase your flexibility and strength."
