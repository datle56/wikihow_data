This project requires brown, black, and white acrylic paint (and other colors, if you wish), an empty tuna can, an empty cylindrical oatmeal container, toothpicks, string, a transparency sheet, brown construction paper, a pencil, and some small rocks and pieces of grass (artificial grass, if you wish).

      "title": "Paint the tuna can and oatmeal container.",
      "content": "Paint the tuna can and oatmeal container. Paint the tuna can completely white. Paint the oatmeal container white, too, including its bottom. The oatmeal container will represent the main body of the lighthouse, so use other colors to paint windows and a door on it. You could also paint diagonal stripes around the oatmeal container if you wish. [3] X Research source Put down newspaper when painting. Paint in a well-ventilated area. After painting them, set the tuna can and oatmeal container aside to dry."

      "content": "Roll the clay into a long, thin string and place it on the oatmeal container. Press the clay into the top edge of the oatmeal container, then stick the toothpicks in it. Place the toothpicks at equal distances from one another. The toothpicks should come straight up and out of the clay. [4] X Research source You could roll the clay between your hands or against a flat surface to shape it into a string."

      "title": "Glue the string into place around the toothpicks.",
      "content": "Glue the string into place around the toothpicks. Cut two pieces of string just slightly longer than the circumference of the oatmeal container. At the top of each toothpick, apply a small dab of glue with your glue gun, then press one string into the glue. [5] X Research source Apply glue to the mid-points of each toothpick and stretch the second string along this second set of points."

      "content": "Glue the tuna can upside-down onto the top of the oatmeal container. Apply glue along the top edge of the tuna can, then turn it upside-down and press it gently onto the oatmeal container. The tuna can will be inside the ring of toothpicks, so be careful not to bump them. [6] X Research source The length of time required for the glue to dry depends on the type of glue you’re using. Consult manufacturer directions for more information."

      "title": "Place a transparency cylinder on top of the tuna can.",
      "content": "Place a transparency cylinder on top of the tuna can. Cut a piece from your transparency sheet that is 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide and just slightly shorter than the circumference of the tuna can. Tape the two ends of the transparency piece together so that it forms a cylinder and apply a thin line of glue along one edge. Center the glued edge over the tuna can and press it down gently. [7] X Research source A transparency cylinder is a rolled-up cylinder made of a transparency sheet. The purpose of the transparency cylinder is to lend the lighthouse model a realistic look and provide a base for the model’s roof. If you do not have a transparency sheet to make a transparency cylinder, get one from your local arts and crafts store."

Gently pull the two sides of the cut toward each other so that they overlap slightly, making a shallow cone. Apply a piece of tape to the underside of the cone so that the paper retains this shape, then apply a few dabs of glue to the top edge of the transparency cylinder and set the brown paper cone on it.

      "content": "Add some embellishments like grass and rocks. Place the oatmeal container on a piece of plywood and arrange a few small pebbles and some loose grass around its base. If you have small animal figurines, you could incorporate them into the scene, too. You could also paint the wooden base the lighthouse is standing on to give it the appearance of dirt or create a winding path. [9] X Research source"

To build the lighthouse, you’ll need some materials you probably already have, including various acrylic paints and paintbrushes, tacky craft glue, a pencil, scissors, 6 brass paper fasteners, a knife, a ruler, old newspapers, a plastic lid from a small margarine container that measures 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) in diameter, and a D battery. You’ll also need to go to the craft store for some materials, including: A 9 x 3-7/8 in (22.9 x 9.8 cm) styrofoam cone A thick piece of cardboard measuring 12 by 12 inches (30 by 30 cm) Two 16-inch (40.6 cm) pieces of #18 insulated wire A small socket with a lightbulb"

Using wire strippers, grip the wire at the point where you want to strip the coating away, then pull the wire strippers toward the end you’re stripping. If you don’t have wire strippers, use a sharp knife to cut slowly into the wire 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the end. Cut all the way around the wire without cutting through it, then pull the coating off the end. [10] X Research source"

There is no right or wrong way to paint your model lighthouse, so paint it as you like. [12] X Research source Acrylic craft paint is the best type of paint to use on styrofoam. Styrofoam is absorbent, so paint on a few thick layers to ensure the paint is visible. Before you start painting, protect your work surface by placing a few old newspapers on it."
