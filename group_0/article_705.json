      "content": "Braid your hair for lasting texture. For lasting texture and beachy waves, braid your hair while it’s damp and let it dry. Alternatively, you can set the braids with your flat iron if your hair is dry. Clamp and iron braids down while working through sections the same width as your iron. Loosen the braids, then toss and lift your roots to work hairspray underneath. Braid your hair into several sections to create even waves. If you use only 1 braid, the hair around your crown and hairline won’t be wavy. Instead, place 1 braid on each side starting above your ears and 1 in the back starting at your nape.

      "content": "Give your roots a boost with hook-and-loop fastener rollers. Hook-and-loop fastener rollers work by giving you soft lift off your scalp. Start with a section the same width as your roller in your crown area. Use 3 rollers back to back and roll 1 to 2 more perpendicularly on each side. Continue this pattern all the way to your front hairline if you want maximum volume. Make sure you roll each section directly off and perpendicular to your scalp. Add extra volume by over-directing the roller at a 45 degree angle from your head."
