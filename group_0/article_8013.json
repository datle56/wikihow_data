Before starting your cleaning routine, use a grill brush to scrub any leftover residue from the grill. A good grill brush has wire bristles that will remove any burnt food and some of the rust. [2] X Research source To get off more residue, preheat up the grill for 15 minutes before scrubbing it. This will loosen any leftover food and grease and make it easier to remove. Turn the grill and then start scrubbing while it’s still hot. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill a large bucket with hot water, dish soap, and baking soda. Get a bucket large enough to fit your grill grates. Then pour in some hot water until the bucket is almost full. Add in 1 cup (240 mL) of dish soap and 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of baking soda. Baking soda is a mild abrasive, so it will do a great job getting that rust off your grill. Mix it together until it forms a paste. [4] X Research source You can also use vinegar with dish soap in the same way."

      "content": "Remove the grill grates and soak them in the bucket for 1 hour. If your grill grates are removable, take them off the grill and put them in your bucket. Let it soak in the baking soda mixture for at least 1 hour. This will allow the baking soda and soap to penetrate and loosen the rust. [5] X Research source If your grill grates are too large to submerge in a bucket, just scrub the baking soda mixture on the grill with a brush. However, keep in mind this may be less effective than letting the grill grates soak, especially if there is a significant amount of rust."

      "content": "Mix 1 cup (240 mL) of table salt and 2 cups (470 mL) of white vinegar in a bowl. Vinegar is a widely used substance to remove rust. Its natural properties react with rust and dissolve it from metal, while the salt is used to improve the cleaning action of the vinegar. Use a measuring cup to accurately measure out the salt and vinegar, and then pour it in a medium bowl. Finally, stir the mixture with a spoon until the salt completely dissolves.
