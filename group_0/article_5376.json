But if you're a networking student or just want to know how to do this by hand, you can check out our guide on converting decimals to binary . For example, if the IP address is 192.168.1.3, the binary address is 111000000.10101000.00000001.00000011. If the subnet mask is 255.255.224.0, which is /19 in CIDR notation, the binary address would be 11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000. We will use the /19 example in this method."
