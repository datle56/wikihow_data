      "content": "Precision Attack increases an Attack Roll’s chance to hit an opponent. Precision Attack is a Passive Feature, used by Battle Masters (a Fighter subclass), that allows you to spend a Superiority Die (1d8) and add it to the result of your Attack Roll. [1] X Research source This increases your chance of hitting an enemy (but not the damage they take). [2] X Research source Cost: 1 Superiority Die Range: Self Duration: Until Long Rest How to learn: Reach class level 3 as a Battle Master Fighter, or choose the Martial Adept feat"

      "content": "Precision Attack can reduce Attack Roll penalties from other feats. One of the biggest benefits of Precision Attack is that it can reduce the Attack Roll costs caused by other feats like Sharpshooter or Great Weapon Master. These feats dole out serious damage but have a lower chance of hitting an enemy—casting Precision Attack can help increase your chances to hit. [3] X Research source Sharpshooter can give ranged weapons you’re proficient with a -5 penalty to their Attack Roll, but deal an extra 10 damage if you do hit. [4] X Research source Similarly, Great Weapon Master can give heavy melee weapons you’re proficient with an additional 10 damage, but there’s also a -5 Attack Roll penalty. [5] X Research source Casting Precision Attack before using a ranged weapon with the Sharpshooter or Great Weapon Master feats toggled adds the 1d8 to that -5 penalty, possibly canceling it out entirely. You can also combine Precision Attack with other Battle Master attacks and spell scrolls."

      "title": "Precision Attack is useful against high armor class enemies.",
      "content": "Precision Attack is useful against high armor class enemies. Since the ability increases your chances of hitting a target, it can be incredibly helpful when fighting an enemy with a high armor class (AC), which requires you to roll a higher Attack Roll in order to hit it. [6] X Research source Precision Attack can be great in late-game combat when enemies typically have a higher AC. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "You can use Precision Attack without spending an Action.",
      "content": "You can use Precision Attack without spending an Action. In BG3, you get a limited number of Action and Bonus Action points (represented by the green circle and orange triangle above your hotbar). Precision Attack doesn’t cost an Action or Bonus Action, which means you can use it at any point during your turn without sacrificing the option to use something different. [8] X Research source You get 1 Action and 1 Bonus Action per turn by default. Some abilities may grant you more, but using this feat without costing an Action can be super helpful because you don’t have many. However, this is a 1-time feature that only refreshes after you take a Long Rest, so it may be best to save it for a battle you know is going to be particularly difficult."

      "content": "You have to cast Precision Attack before you make an Attack. In D&D 5e, which Baldur’s Gate 3 is based on, you can use Precision Attack after an Attack Roll. This allows you to take a roll that you know is going to be a miss and turn it into a hit. [9] X Research source In Baldur’s Gate 3, however, Precision Attack can only be used before you roll, which eliminates this advantage. No one is sure why Larian Studios, the team behind BG3, didn’t include this advantage in the game. Some have speculated that 5e’s rules may have made Precision Attack too overpowered."

This makes Feinting Attack pretty costly if you only have 1 of each Action type.

Instead, it deals 1d8 of damage using your Action and Bonus Action. Precision Attack doesn’t deal any damage at all—instead, it adds the Superiority Die roll to your chances to hit a target.

Knocking an enemy Prone can be extremely useful because it allows your party to pile on attacks and skip the enemy’s upcoming turn. [23] X Research source When a target is Prone, it means they can’t move or take Actions, Bonus Actions, or Reactions. Attacks made against a Prone target have Advantage if they’re made within 10 ft (3.0 m). The one downside is that this maneuver can’t be used on Huge (or Gargantuan) enemies, like Giants or Dragons.

[27] X Research source To get the most use out of Rally, choose it within the first batch of Battle Maneuvers at level 3. At level 5 and higher, it usually becomes less useful. Rally might be most useful to revive Downed party members in early-game battles. [28] X Research source"
