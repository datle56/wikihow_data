      "title": "Sauté the pork legs in oil over medium heat until they brown.",
      "content": "Sauté the pork legs in oil over medium heat until they brown. Heat about 4 to 5 tablespoons (60 to 75 mL) of cooking oil in a wok, then add 3.3 pounds (1½ kg) of pork leg, sliced into 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) sections. Sauté the pork leg pieces until they are lightly browned on all sides. Use metal tongs to turn the pork legs as they cook so that they brown evenly on all sides. If you don’t have a wok, use a heavy-bottomed pot instead. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the pork pieces and set them aside on a plate.",
      "content": "Remove the pork pieces and set them aside on a plate. Don't pour out the oil, however; leave that in the wok or saucepan. Instead, use a pair of metal tongs to take the pork pieces out and set them on a plate. You don't have to drain the fat from the pork; you just need to get it out of the way while you prepare the garlic."

      "title": "Sauté the garlic in the wok over medium heat until it turns fragrant.",
      "content": "Sauté the garlic in the wok over medium heat until it turns fragrant. Peel and mince 8 to 10 cloves garlic, then add them into the oiled wok. Sauté them over medium heat, stirring often with a wooden spatula, until they turn fragrant. This will take a few minutes. Alternatively, try 1 medium onion, peeled and sliced and 4 to 5 minced garlic cloves instead. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Add the pork, water, soy sauce, and half of the vinegar into the wok.",
      "content": "Add the pork, water, soy sauce, and half of the vinegar into the wok. Place the pork legs back into the wok or saucepan. Pour in 2 cups (470 mL) of water, 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of soy sauce, and 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of vinegar. For a more sour flavor, try 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of vinegar instead. You’ll need another 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) later. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Bring the stew to a boil, then simmer it over low heat for 1.5 to 2 hours. The stew is ready when the meat starts to turn tender. Don't overcook it, however; you still have another 15 to 20 minutes of cooking left. Plan accordingly. You can also transfer the stew to a pressure cooker, then cook it for about 30 minutes, or until the meat is tender. [4] X Research source"

Add ¼ cup (50 g) of brown sugar and ½ cup (100 g) of dried banana blossoms. If you can’t find dried banana blossoms, try dried lily buds.

Next, pour the water out, then scrub the pot clean so that there isn't any pork fat sticking to it. [10] X Research source Alternatively, you can pour the water through a strainer, then set the pork pieces caught inside it on a plate.

Check the water every 10 to 15 minutes, and add more water if it starts to get too low. [12] X Research source You need just enough water to cover the pork legs. If you can see the pork legs, add more water. How much water you add depends on how fast it is evaporating. Just use enough to cover the pork legs back up again."
