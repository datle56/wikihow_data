      "content": "The book emojis represent reading, studying, and writing. There are a plethora of book-related emojis people use when texting, and they all generally carry the same meaning. If someone sends you one of these emojis, they’re likely hinting at the fact that they’re studying hard, reading one of their favorite novels, or maybe even writing a book of their own. These emojis come in a few different styles, including: [1] X Research source The 📚 (books) emoji The 📖 (open book) emoji The 📕 (textbook) emoji. This also comes in other colors including orange, green, and blue (📙📗📘). The 📓 (notebook) emoji.

The 📖 emoji is the perfect thing to add if you’re trying to tell someone that you’re in the middle of reading a book right now, and you can take this opportunity to gush all about how amazing of a read it is. Or, if you’re reading a series, it might make sense to send 📕📙📗📘. On top of that, if you’re trying to tell someone you have a lot on your to-read list, send them 📚. [3] X Research source “Reading inside on a rainy day with a hot drink gives the ultimate cozy vibes 🌧📖☕️” “My friend just introduced me to this fantasy series and it’s so good! 10/10 recommend 📕📙📗📘” I just bought 3 more books even though I still haven’t read the one I got last week 😅📚📚”"

It’s 10 hours long, so don’t expect to hear from me this weekend hehe 🎧📖” “Bless audiobooks because I can only read for so long before getting a headache 😍🎧📚”"
