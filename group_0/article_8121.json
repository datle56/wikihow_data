      "content": "Rinse off dirt and debris with clean water. Vinyl windows can be easily scratched and discolored, so caution is needed when cleaning them. Use fresh, clean water to rinse off any loose particles and dirt from the surface by gently pouring water from a pitcher or wringing it out of a clean wet rag. Avoid wiping debris-covered windows without rinsing them first. To avoid scratching, you should also remove any rings, bracelets and watches you’re wearing before you begin. These can puncture the vinyl. [1] X Research source Avoid cleaning the glass in direct sunlight."

Mix together ¼ cup (30 milliliters) of mild, non-detergent soap (such as Woolite, Dreft or Murphy Oil Soap) and a gallon (3.79 liters) of warm water in a large bucket. Never use alcohol or ammonia based products, Windex, dishwashing detergents or any other cleaning products that contain abrasive chemicals. If used, these substances will damage the vinyl (and most likely void your warranty, as well). [2] X Research source"
