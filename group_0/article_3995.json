A sense of humor and funny toasts go hand-in-hand, but be sure the birthday jokes or stories you tell are appropriate for the birthday person and the audience. You can use toasts that poke fun at the celebrant’s age or talk about what beautiful, handsome, talented, or amazing friends they have in you. To our favorite old hippie. Let me assure you that this is a real celebration, and not an acid flashback. To the most closely guarded secret in this country—your real age. To middle age, when we begin to exchange our emotions for ­symptoms. [5] X Research source To your very good health. May you live to be as old as your jokes. Don’t let aging get you down. It’s too hard to get up again. Forget about the past; you can’t change it. Forget about the future; you can’t predict it. Forget about the present; I didn’t get you one. Here’s to a man after my own heart. And after my house and my wife. Wise, kind, gentle, generous, sexy… but enough about me. Here’s to you. “Here’s champagne to our real friends. And real pain to our sham friends.” — Francis Bacon [6] X Research source Age is nothing but a number, as long as it’s not higher than the number of thousands you owe to the bank.

      "title": "Practice beforehand.",
      "content": "Practice beforehand. Even if you don’t get nervous before giving a toast or speech, it’s a good idea to stand in front of a mirror and practice saying your toast a few times. It helps gauge the length of your toast and how it might sound to an audience. You can also work out any issues with your body language and how well you make eye contact. [26] X Research source If you need reminders of topics during your toast, write or type out a few bullet points on an index card. It’s best not to read your toast from a script, but it’s fine to look at reminders as you need them. Don’t drink before giving your toast. No matter how much you want to celebrate the birthday, it’s more important that you are focused, have a clear mind, and are totally present when giving a toast. Kirkham has these tips for getting rid of nerves beforehand: “Say something to yourself like 'I get to speak' instead of 'I have to speak’ so there's a big difference in mindset. Let go of as much nervous energy as you can beforehand with jumping jacks, running, or getting a good sweat on before you speak.”"

      "title": "Start your toast with a hook (and raise your glass).",
      "content": "Start your toast with a hook (and raise your glass). Let the audience know what you’re going to share about the person being honored. The idea is to gently tease listeners by promising to reveal or tell them something memorable about the celebrant. Remember that your toast is a gift to your romantic partner, colleague, friend, or family member, so it can begin by focusing on them. Don’t forget to raise your glass, since the whole point of a toast is to say “cheers” to the person being honored. Some examples follow: [27] X Research source Today, you’re going to learn 3 things you never knew about the birthday boy/girl. By the end of this toast, you’ll know exactly what makes [name] so special. You may think you know the man/woman of honor, but did you know they were famous before the age of 10?"

Use any nicknames you both share, or bring up a memory or situation that illustrates how close a relationship you have. Be brief, and use this opportunity to set up the main part of your birthday toast. Find examples of background information ahead: [28] X Research source I was the birthday girl’s best friend growing up, also known as her “sister from another mister.” [Name] and I may be brothers, but I like to call us “partners in crime” from the age of 16 to 25. You may know me as the birthday girl’s husband, but I’m actually her pool boy, soulmate, and garbage man on occasion. You can also bring up a surprising fact (or a few, depending on the amount of time you have) about the guest of honor. It makes a great lead-in to a short anecdote, joke, or story about them."

      "content": "Use humor with caution. Making people laugh is an important part of many toasts, but be sure to double-check with the guest of honor first, along with their family or romantic partner if needed. It’s also important to read the room, which means deciding if the funny story you want to tell will come across as entertaining to guests at the gathering (and not offend anyone). [29] X Research source For example, if you’re speaking at a family birthday party, it may not be the best time to tell a risque story about a wild night you and the guest of honor spent in college. If you’re toasting to your romantic partner at their birthday, think about whether the crowd (or your partner) would appreciate an anecdote about a fight you both had at one time."

Take a deep breath if you’re nervous, and be sure to make as much regular, natural eye contact as possible. Address different people in the crowd, and look directly at the celebrant themselves at least once or twice. Kirkham says you should be “standing firmly on your feet, not with one hip out. Make sure that you're not tweaking your feet. Breathe deeper and practice pausing, while really looking people in the eyes.” Muñoz agrees and adds that you should speak “slowly and deliberately.” He says to “get comfortable with silence. Take pauses when you speak, so you don't have to be talking constantly at a rushed rate. By taking pauses, you can start to eliminate unnecessary ums.”"
