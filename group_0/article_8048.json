      "content": "Check the label to make sure it’s safe to machine wash your shoes. Most sneakers can be cleaned in the washing machine, but it’s always a good idea to double-check beforehand. If the label says “hand wash only,” you may want to consider cleaning the shoes by hand. If your shoes don’t have a label, search the brand online to get cleaning recommendations. [1] X Expert Source Marc Sigal Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 15 January 2020. If your shoes have any leather or suede, it is not a good idea to machine wash them, as the water can damage those parts of the shoes."

      "content": "Use a scrub brush to brush away any visible clumps of dirt. Preferably, do this over a trash can or outside to keep the dirt from getting all over your floor. If the dirt is wet, let it dry completely first. Dry dirt brushes away more easily than wet dirt does. [2] X Expert Source Marc Sigal Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 15 January 2020.

      "content": "Remove the laces and treat dirty sections with laundry detergent. Check them out to see if there are any areas that are particularly dirty. If so, take a little bit of laundry detergent and use your fingers to rub it into the shoelaces. This pretreating will help the dirt come out more easily.

      "content": "Put the shoes into a mesh bag and wash them along with towels. If you don’t have mesh laundry bags, you can buy them online or at department stores for about $10. Put the bag with your shoes in it, the one with the laces, and a load of towels into the washing machine. [4] X Research source Washing the shoes along with towels keeps the shoes from banging around in the washing machine, which could potentially damage your shoes or the machine itself."

      "content": "Run a gentle cycle with cool water. Use the same amount of detergent you normally would, and avoid using hot water. Choose the gentle cycle if you have the option. [5] X Research source Don’t overdo it on the detergent. Excess detergent can cause soap residue to build up on your shoes, making them stiff and possibly even staining them."

      "content": "Let the pair of shoes air dry. You can put them in front of a dehumidifier, a fan, or an open window, but avoid putting them in front of any type of heat source or into the dryer. If the shoes have insoles, take them out and let them dry separately to speed up the process. [6] X Expert Source Marc Sigal Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 15 January 2020.

It should take anywhere from 8 to 12 hours for your shoes to dry, just depending on whether or not you do anything else to speed up the process. Once they’re dry, put the insoles back in place and re-lace them. [7] X Research source If your shoes still look really dirty, you may need to treat the soles separately or perhaps try putting them through the laundry again.

      "content": "Remove the laces from your shoes. As you take out the laces, pay attention to their condition—are they grungy? Are they fraying? If they’re just dirty, you’ll be able to clean them, but if they’re fraying and threadbare, it may be time to buy a new pair. [8] X Research source If you do need to buy new laces, measure your current ones to see what length they are. That way, you’ll be sure to purchase replacements that are long enough for your shoes."

      "content": "Rub laundry detergent into the stained areas of the laces. For this purpose, it’s helpful to pour a small amount of laundry detergent into a bowl; 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) should do. Dip your finger into the laundry detergent, and then rub it into grungy sections of your shoelaces. Repeat this step until both laces have been treated. [9] X Research source Rubbing the laundry detergent into the laces causes the soap to start reacting with and breaking down the ground-in dirt."

Rinse each shoelace, taking time to rub along the entire length to remove all the dirt and soap. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear and your laces are clean. Dry them off with a clean towel and set them to the side. [10] X Research source If your laces are particularly dirty, you could also fill your sink with warm water and leave the shoelaces to soak for 10 to 15 minutes while you clean the rest of your shoes."

      "content": "Clean the eyelets with a toothbrush and a little bit of laundry detergent. The eyelets are the little holes that the shoelaces wind through. Continue using the small bowl of laundry detergent from earlier, and dip a clean toothbrush into it. Scrub the eyelets with the toothbrush to remove any built-up dirt or grime, then wipe them clean with a damp sponge. [11] X Research source When rinsing away the laundry detergent, avoid using an overly-wet sponge. Wet the sponge then wring it out so it’s not dripping wet. This’ll keep the suds from spreading too far and your shoes won’t get over-saturated."

Let it dry completely first—it’ll be much easier to remove once it’s dry. If there are stuck pebbles, use a pair of tweezers to scrape them out."

Whatever you choose to use, dip it into the laundry detergent and water mixture, and then proceed to scrub the entire body of each shoe. Clean the body of the shoe, the tongue, the soles, and even the inside of the shoe. Use a circular motion to dislodge ground-in dirt. [14] X Research source Re-wet the toothbrush as many times as you need to while you clean. Don’t forget that insole ! Remove it and clean it the same way you did the exterior of the shoe.

You can speed up the drying process by putting the shoes in front of a fan or an open window, but don’t put them in front of any kind of heat source because the heat could warp the shoes or even shrink them. Once they’re dry, replace the insoles and re-lace the shoes. [17] X Research source If your shoes were really stinky , sprinkle some baking soda over the insides while they dry overnight.

[21] X Research source Use a sponge rather than running the shoes under a stream of water. The sponge will keep the rest of the shoe from getting wet, which means you won’t have to wait for them to dry after you’ve cleaned them."
