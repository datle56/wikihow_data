However, Instagram will notify the other user if you screenshot anything sent in Vanish Mode (now known as disappearing messages ) and content marked as \"View once.\" This includes messages, photos, shared posts, and videos. [1] X Research source You can screenshot the following content without notifications: Profile photo posts Story posts (public only) Profile pictures Reels Comments Live streams Direct Messages without a time limit (outside of Vanish Mode) Shared posts in Direct Messages (outside of Vanish Mode) If you want to screenshot content within your Direct Messages, make sure Vanish Mode is disabled first. With a recent update, Instagram now notifies users if you screenshot a post set as View once . These posts also have \"screenshot prevention\", which will block the image from your screenshot. This is similar to seeing a black screen when trying to screen record DMCA-protected content, such as TV shows or movies. [2] X Research source"
