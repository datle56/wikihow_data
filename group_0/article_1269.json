You can do this by right clicking and selecting the cel or clicking on specific cels and selecting the cel. Alternatively, you can select the frame you want the animation cel to be on and click “new animation cel” and it will create a cel on that frame for you."

      "content": "(Optional) Open the animation cels palette. Click on “Enable Light Table” and then choose between common light table(shows for all the cels) and light table specific (only shows up when editing that specific cel). While this isn't needed for a simple animation of a ball falling, it is useful for referring to key frames and references to keep animations consistent Drag layers into the light table sections or import images to register that cel. This allows you to flip between specific frames."

      "content": "Delete cels from the animation by clicking the “Delete specified cels” icon. This doesn’t actually delete the cel from the file, just removes it from the animation.

Or, go to \"Layer > Create folder and insert layer\" for each rough cel—you might want to make a shortcut or auto action to make this much quicker. If you choose the first method, you have to re-assign cels in the timeline to match that of your rough animation. If you choose the second method, make sure to hide or delete the rough animation cel."

Simply go to \"File > Export Animation >Movie... \" Note that only the parts between the blue markers will be exported. You can export it as a gif as well, but keep in mind that the colors will be limited to 256 colors per frame. You can check the dithering option for a smoother blending, but it will increase the file size of your gif. You can export your animation cels by going to \"File > Export Animation > Export animation cels…\" All visible cels within the animation folders will be exported and separated into different folders depending on what animation folder it is."
