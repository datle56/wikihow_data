    {
      "title": "Pick a time and place when you feel calm and relaxed.",
      "content": "Pick a time and place when you feel calm and relaxed. You might meditate for a couple of minutes, or you could simply wait until you’re not stressed or anxious about anything. The more connected you feel to the universe, the more likely it is that you’ll receive a sign or a message."

    {
      "title": "Close your eyes.",
      "content": "Close your eyes. This is all about doing what feels right for you. Some people put their hands on their hearts, some raise their palms to the sky, and some just sit quietly. Close your eyes and focus on reaching out toward the universe."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask the universe out loud for a sign.",
      "content": "Ask the universe out loud for a sign. You can choose a specific sign that you’d like to receive, or you can ask for a general “sign” of the universe’s liking. Ask the universe to give you a sign to help you make a decision or get out of a tough situation. [1] X Research source “If I’m on the right path, please show me a butterfly in the next 24 hours.” “If I’m meant to move across the country, send me a white feather by tomorrow.” “Please send me a clear sign that I’m doing the right thing.”"

    {
      "title": "Be ready to accept the sign and act upon it.",
      "content": "Be ready to accept the sign and act upon it. Open up your heart and be willing to make changes or shift your perspective if the universe tells you to. If you’re closed off and unwilling, you may not be ready for a sign."

    {
      "title": "Animals",
      "content": "Animals Animals are all around us, and often, we don’t notice them. You might see a bird fly by your window, or a squirrel crawl up a tree. Or, the animal might not even physically be in front of you: you could scroll by a picture of a tiger online, or buy a shirt with a turtle on it. [2] X Research source For instance, maybe you asked the universe for a general sign to let you know you’re on the right path. The universe might show you a nature documentary focused on your favorite animal, the elephant, as you flip through channels."

    {
      "title": "Numbers",
      "content": "Numbers Repeating numbers are often thought to be signs from the universe, since they’re fairly uncommon. Angel numbers like 1111 , 444, and 1133 have their own specific meanings along with being signs from the universe. The universe could show you a sign when you drive to a new friend’s house. When you glance at the address, you might notice a repeating number, like 1133, as your sign."

    {
      "title": "Objects",
      "content": "Objects Losing or finding objects is a common way that the universe will speak to us. Maybe you suddenly find the doll from your childhood that you thought was lost years ago. Or, maybe you can’t find your favorite notebook, even though you always keep it in the same spot. Misplacing or finding items around your home is a clear sign from the universe. Objects that hold sentimental value are also very common signs from the universe. Maybe you suddenly find the music box that your grandma gave you as a child—this could be a sign that the universe is speaking to you."

    {
      "title": "Songs",
      "content": "Songs Listening to music is a great way to connect to the universe and the world around you. As you jam out to your usual playlist, pay attention to the lyrics or the song titles that pop up. The universe may be trying to speak to you using your favorite tunes. If you’re looking for a sign that you’re on the right path, the universe might play “Don’t Worry, Be Happy.”"

      "title": "Movie and book titles",
      "content": "Movie and book titles Book titles and movie titles are often interpreted as signs from the universe. Keep an eye out as you go about your daily life for any media that jumps out at you. If you’ve recently asked for a sign from the universe, the media you encounter every day could be part of that sign. For instance, maybe you’re struggling to decide if you should quit your job or not. A sign from the universe could be a book you stumble across titled 10 Reasons to Change Your Career and Be Happier ."

    {
      "title": "Try not to actively look for a sign from the universe.",
      "content": "Try not to actively look for a sign from the universe. Don’t spend a ton of time each day looking around for your sign. Instead, live your life as you normally would, not doing anything special or out of the ordinary. When a sign comes to you, you’ll know it. However, you should definitely pay attention to your surroundings. For instance, instead of scrolling through social media while you ride the bus, try looking out the window instead. Try to interpret your dreams, too. Your dreams may be showing you signs that your conscious mind isn’t aware of. The universe will typically show you a sign within 24 hours."

    {
      "title": "Thank the universe for sending you a sign.",
      "content": "Thank the universe for sending you a sign. It’s important to let the universe know that you’re grateful for the sign you’ve received. In your head or out loud, say a small prayer thanking the universe for its guidance. “Thank you, universe, for giving me clarity and confidence.”"

    {
      "title": "Act upon the sign.",
      "content": "Act upon the sign. Take the sign as what it is: the universe sending you a message. Whatever you were struggling with, now is your chance to use this sign to your advantage. Let it boost your confidence to make the right decision and continue forward with your life. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "No sign at all typically means “no.”",
      "content": "No sign at all typically means “no.” Not getting a sign from the universe is a sign in and of itself. For instance, maybe you asked the universe to show you if you were on the right path. If you wait a full day and don’t receive a sign, that probably means the universe is telling you that you’re on the wrong path. Or, maybe you asked the universe to show you an elephant if you’re meant to move across the country. If you don’t see an elephant, the universe is likely telling you not to move."
