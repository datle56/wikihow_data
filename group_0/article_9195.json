If your router is dual-band, make sure you’ve chosen the same band on both devices. To connect your iMac to WiFi , click the WiFi icon on the top right side of your screen. Select the network you want from the list of available networks and enter the WiFi password if prompted. To connect to WiFi on your Surface Pro , click the Network icon in the Taskbar and make sure WiFi is enabled (the WiFi icon should be blue). Click the network you want to connect with. You may be prompted to enter the network password. Warning: Some network brands will call both 2.4 and 5ghz bands the same name now as a \"workaround.\" The names could be the same but you may not be on the same networks depending on the factory settings or how the tech professional set them up. Because of this, one machine would not see the other receiver."
