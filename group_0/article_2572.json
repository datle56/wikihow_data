      "title": "Find the right heel height.",
      "content": "Find the right heel height. If you don’t have much experience with wearing high heels, choose a lower heel to start. Start small, with a one inch heel, and continue increasing height as you become more comfortable walking. Once you’ve mastered the one inch heel, try a one and a half inch heel, and keep increasing your heel height by half of an inch. If you want to try different kinds of heels without breaking the bank, try purchasing different types of shoes with heels that can be worn with different outfits. Start with a one inch heeled boot, then try a two inch heeled sandal, and eventually a three or four inch stiletto!"

      "content": "Invest in solid heels. Heel height is not the only factor to consider when choosing the right heels for you. Shoes with a wedge or chunky heel can be much easier to walk in, especially if you’re unsure about your new footwear. Look for heels that will provide the support you need while you’re learning to walk in heels. Wedge heels are a great option for a stable heel. Wedge heels come in a variety of heights and widths, and often times are significantly easier on your feet than other types of heels. Stacked heels are wide enough that they are easy to walk in and also come in a variety of styles and heights. Platforms are a great way to make heels feel shorter without losing any height. A four inch heel with a one inch platform gives the same stylish look, but feels more like walking in a three inch heel."

      "content": "Make comfort a priority. A well made pair of high heels should cause minimal discomfort to the wearer, despite the stigma that suggest high heels are always uncomfortable. Don’t be afraid to purchase heels that are a size up or down from your regular size. Keep in mind that certain brands of heels may have a smaller fit and some have a larger fit. Ask the retailer if they have high heels that contain hidden platform supports. Hidden platforms make heels easier to walk in, so you can feel confident and secure in your heels. If it has been a while since you had your foot sized, ask the retailer to size your foot. Over time, the size of your foot may have changed, so having your foot professionally sized is always a good idea when investing in new shoes."

      "title": "Focus on the fit.",
      "content": "Focus on the fit. When you’re trying on new heels, focus on how the width suits your foot. Certain high heeled shoes are better suited for those with a narrow foot, while some work better for a wide foot. Make sure you are measuring the length and width of your feet before determining which heels to purchase. Heels with a boxed toe often work better for those with wider feet, while pointed toes often work better for a narrow foot. If your feet are sized slightly differently, purchase the shoe size that is more suitable for the larger foot. You can always pad the other shoe with tissues or specialty padding material. [2] X Research source There should be no extra space in between the sides of the shoe and your foot. Any extra space can cause sliding around, which may lead to blistering or discomfort.

Maintaining good posture while you’re wearing your heels will make them easier to walk in. If you’ve made a habit of slouching to appear more petite, make an even stronger effort to stand tall!"

      "content": "Wear your heels confidently. Once you’ve found the perfect pair of heels, strut your stuff! The key to wearing heels well is wearing heels that you love, that give your outfit a polished look, and that you are able to walk confidently in. Learning to walk in your heels perfectly takes practice, but it will all pay off when you’re getting compliments on your beautiful shoes. When you’re wearing your heels, walk heel to toe. Make sure you’re setting your heel down first and then setting down the ball of your foot, as this will make your walk look natural and confident.

Wear your heels around the house, so you can walk with confidence when you wear them out of the house. Make an effort to practice walking on a variety of floors, even going so far as to walk outside on pavement."

When choosing your outfits to go with your new heels, ask yourself what look you want create. Heels are a great way to dress up a casual outfit, a stylish pair of high heels can make the most casual of outfits feel more elegant. High heels can also give you a boost if the hem of a dress or pant leg hangs a bit too low. Wear high heels with skinny jeans to make your outfit appear less casual. Try wearing a pair of high heeled boots with a skirt that falls around your thighs to showcase your beautiful boots. Wear a pair of heels to elevate yourself in a dress that may be a touch too long to prevent the skirt from dragging and becoming damaged."

Remember, you are not wearing heels to impress anyone, you are wearing them because you love how they look and how they make you feel. People who make rude comments about are often doing so because they are dealing with their own insecurities. If someone says, “Do you really need to be any taller?” keep your cool and respond politely by saying, “No, but I do need to wear shoes that I love!” If someone says, “Tall girls shouldn’t wear heels,” do not engage with them at all. If you feel compelled to respond, say something such as, “All girls should wear what makes them feel good about themselves,” and leave it at that. You know your shoes look great and don’t need to spend time convincing anyone else that they do."
