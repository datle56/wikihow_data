    {
      "title": "Think about the \"type\" of the username you want.",
      "content": "Think about the \"type\" of the username you want. This means if you want a one-word username, a two-word username, one with numbers, etc. One-word usernames can be hard to figure out if you want them to make sense and ability for people to pronounce them, but it is a great way if you want your username to be simple. Adding more words increases the chances of getting an available username, but it makes it a bit more complex and long (if you want a short username). Adding numbers is great to make it more unique, but if you're trying to \"be like the rest\", use numbers wisely, or not add them at all."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about things you like.",
      "content": "Think about things you like. Whether it's from rabbits or popsicles, the things you like make your username more creative. If you are going to do this, think about how youâ€™re going to order it. For example, you have the words Whisperer' and Tiger . Are you going to put in WhispererTiger or TigerWhisperer?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider adding common prefixes or suffixes.",
      "content": "Consider adding common prefixes or suffixes. These can add more letters to a one-word username if it is taken. Prefixes that are frequently used are \"i\" (as in iMarble), \"ii\" (as in iiCherry), or \"x\" (as in xSecretEdition). Suffixes that are used frequently are \"ism\" (as in Solidism), \"ize\", (as in Lyricize), or \"XD\" (as in PastelCatsXD)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add certain letters and numbers to replace some characters in your username.",
      "content": "Add certain letters and numbers to replace some characters in your username. These can add style to your username and if used properly, it won't make much of a difference. The letter \"x\" is commonly used to replace certain letters, mostly vowels to make the person easily read the username. For example, if Legitamite is taken, you could replace the first \"e\" with \"x\", like Lxgitamite. The letter \"v\" is mostly only used to replace \"u\", like Pvmpkins instead of Pumpkins. It is rarely used to replace other letters. Numbers can replace letters as well. Since \"3\" looks like a backward \"E\", it is used to replace \"E/e\"."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try finding a five-letter username.",
      "content": "Try finding a five-letter username. If you want your username to be rare, five-letter usernames are useful, since now ROBLOX requires a minimum of 3 characters. Adding another two letters decreases its rarity but having a five-letter username is still considered very rare."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use capital and lowercase letters wisely.",
      "content": "Use capital and lowercase letters wisely. If your username consists of 2 or more words, capital usernames are useful. For instance, if you're thinking of the username, \"MostlyAnna\", capitalizing the first letters of each word organizes it rather than having a username with all lowercase letters, such as \"mostly anna\". If you want a one-word name, capitalizing the first letter wouldn't matter, as people won't have trouble reading it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your username unique.",
      "content": "Make your username unique. Don't copy someone else's username. For instance, if someone has the username, \"Simplex\", don't just add a letter and remove one and say it's your own, especially if you're copying someone well-known. It's okay to make new words. For example, if one wants a username that's cute, they could make it \"Floofally\", because it sounds like the word fluff."
