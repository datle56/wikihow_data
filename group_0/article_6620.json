If you need to change your location to a specific country, such as when you want to watch a YouTube video that's only available in Germany, make sure the service you choose has servers there. The most secure and reliable VPNs aren't free but are generally low-cost. Some popular options are SurfShark, Mullvad, CyberGhost, and ExpressVPN. If you don't want to pay for a VPN, you can opt for Proton VPN, which lets you change your location to the Netherlands, United States, and Japan.
