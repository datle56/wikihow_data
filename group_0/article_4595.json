      "title": "Address the recipient by name.",
      "content": "Address the recipient by name. Write the recipient’s first name or title at the beginning of the note. Depending on your relationship, opt for just their first name or their last name with a title (e.g., Dorothy vs. Mrs. Gale). If you’re writing a thank you message to a whole family (i.e., the Joneses), address the card to the whole family. “On the envelope,” instructs Claytor, “Make sure it says ‘family’ so that whoever opens the mail realizes the message is for everyone.” Choose a blank card or stationery for your thank you notes. Look for decorative stationery paper or elegant thank you cards with no inside messages. Pre-written messages may feel impersonal to your recipients."

      "content": "Thank the recipient for taking the time to celebrate with you. Claytor confirms that you should always start with a thank you: “The first rule of thumb is always say thank you first. Whatever the gesture is, be very specific and say thank you for X, Y, and Z.” Express how thankful you are that your friend, family member, or acquaintance took the time to attend your wedding shower. For example: “Thank you so much for attending our bridal shower. We were overjoyed to see you and get to spend some quality time with you.” Here are a few additional ways to say “thank you” on a gratitude card: I really appreciate… I’m so grateful for… You really blessed me by… It really warmed my heart that you… I’ll always cherish…"

      "title": "Thank the recipient for the gift they gave you, if applicable.",
      "content": "Thank the recipient for the gift they gave you, if applicable. Share your gratitude for the gift and “explain to the person…how it will be used,” says Claytor, and why you loved the gift. Claytor gives the example, “‘Aunt Barbara, thank you for the cappuccino maker. Every time I drink coffee, I'll think of you.’” Even if you don’t truly love the gift, focus on the thought behind it and your appreciation for that kindness. If you’re struggling to think of what to say to thank someone for their bridal shower gift, use these questions to brainstorm: How did you feel when you opened the gift? What plans do you have for the gift? Why is this gift a good present for you (or for you and your partner)? How will this gift improve your married life?"

Find a way to show your appreciation for the person, like “‘I enjoyed speaking with you’ or ‘visiting with you,’” and add a “compliment…like ‘You’re a lovely person’ or ‘You’re easy to talk to,’” advises Claytor. You could also write something like “Your friendship means the world to us” or “Thank you again for your support and love as we start this new chapter together.” Consider “taking a picture of yourself using the gift or wearing the gift,” continues Claytor. Snap a quick pic with a Polaroid or instant print camera ."

Before signing off your thank you note, share how much you’re looking forward to the recipient being a guest at your wedding. Comment on how you’re excited to dance the night away with them or to continue hearing about their upcoming travels . [1] X Research source If the recipient isn’t attending the wedding, write that you’re looking forward to seeing them at another point in the future. For example: “We’re sorry you won’t be able to make it to the wedding, but we’re so looking forward to seeing you at the family reunion next spring.”"

To get your thank you card ready to be signed, sealed, and delivered, finish with a final “thank you” or “best wishes.” Claytor advises using “‘Regards,’ Best regards,’ or ‘Warm regards’” for more formal, business-like acquaintances. For close friends and family, however, go with something more casual like “Love” or “Cheers.” Then, finish with you and your fiancé’s names: Warmest thanks, David and Patrick Lots of love, Elizabeth and Darcy Sincerely, Sandy and Danny Yours, Gomez and Morticia Love always, Jim and Pam All the best, Stef and Lena Gratefully, Allie and Noah Blessings, Lily and Ola Best, Nick and Charlie Fondly, Jack and Rose"
