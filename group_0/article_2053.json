      "title": "If you're around more, she might be more attracted to you.",
      "content": "If you're around more, she might be more attracted to you. If you find natural opportunities to be near your crush, take them! For instance, if she always meets her friends outside of the gym before school, you might ask your best friend to meet you there, too. If you know she works at a local coffee shop, you might drop by once in a while for a latte. [1] X Research source This is known as the familiarity effect—spending time around someone can often make you feel more positive around them. Just don't go overboard. It will seem creepy if you're always showing up wherever she goes. A good rule of thumb is to only hang out in places where you'd go even if she wasn't there, so it will seem like you're crossing paths naturally."

      "title": "Giving her a chance to help you might make her like you.",
      "content": "Giving her a chance to help you might make her like you. When you like a girl, it can be tempting to want to do everything for her, like carrying her books or fixing her flat tire. It's totally fine to be there if she asks you for something, but she's actually more likely to be into you if you let her help you with something, instead. Benjamin Franklin famously used this trick to win people over—if it worked for him, it might just work for you! [2] X Research source If you're in class together, ask her if you can borrow a pencil. If you're out at a bar, ask her if she can watch your drink while you make a phone call."

      "title": "Having a great sense of humor is always attractive.",
      "content": "Having a great sense of humor is always attractive. Try sending her a meme that made you laugh, or tell her a story about something funny that happened earlier in the day. Don't be afraid to get a little goofy—if you can get her laughing, she might just start to see you as crush material. [3] X Research source Be willing to laugh at yourself, too! For instance, instead of getting upset because you spilled mustard on your shirt, you could say something like, \"Well, I always did think this shirt needed a splash of yellow.\" [4] X Research source"

      "title": "She'll like you more if you're similar.",
      "content": "She'll like you more if you're similar. People love to say \"opposites attract,\" but actually, we're more likely to fall for someone we have a lot in common with. When you're hanging out with your crush, let her know when she says something you agree with, and chime in when she mentions a band or a movie you like. Just be authentic about it—if you pretend to like things just because she does, she'll probably be put off when the truth eventually comes out. [5] X Research source For instance, if she mentions that she loves baseball, you might say, \"Oh, I grew up watching the Mets with my dad! Who's your favorite team?\" Talk about values you share, too—if she says something about protecting the environment or reducing her carbon footprint, you might say, \"I think taking care of our planet is really important.\""

      "title": "Get to know each other without any pressure to date.",
      "content": "Get to know each other without any pressure to date. There's no guarantee that this will lead to a relationship—in fact, if she thinks you're just being her friend because you want to date her, it will probably push her away. However, if you really like this girl, try to genuinely enjoy building a friendship with her. She may become more attracted to you as you become closer, but even if that never happens, you can never go wrong with having more friends in life. [6] X Research source It's okay if you can't be best friends with your crush. You can't help how you feel about someone, and if it's painful to get too close without dating, it might be better to keep some distance."

      "title": "Be playful, but make sure it isn't mean-spirited.",
      "content": "Be playful, but make sure it isn't mean-spirited. Teasing a girl can show her that you like her, but that you're confident enough to play around a little. But you have to be careful with this—if you tease her about something that she's sensitive about, you could really hurt her feelings and push her away. [7] X Research source To keep things lighthearted, try teasing her about one of her strengths, but make it sound like an insult. If she's really great at math, for instance, you might say, \"Hey Taylor, are you ready to fail this math test today?\""

      "title": "Play it cool when she's around.",
      "content": "Play it cool when she's around. Try to act totally natural, like you're not interested in her at all. Spend time talking to your friends, reading a book, or whatever you'd do if she wasn't there. This can seem counterintuitive—you might feel like the best thing you can do is to let her know how you feel! However, if you're too eager, it can push her away. [8] X Research source Acting indifferent can make her feel more curious about you, which could make her like you more! To up your game even more, try to alternate ignoring her and showing interest in her. When you keep her guessing, she'll spend more time thinking about you, because she'll be trying to figure out how you feel! [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Just don't go overboard with liking her photos. While it's fine to interact with your crush on social media, don't go through her feed and leave a like on every single post. A couple of reactions or a single comment is plenty. Also, try not to focus only on her selfies—it's better to engage with posts that show who she really is, like a snap of her soccer trophy or a photo of her snoozing pup. [10] X Research source If you leave a comment, try asking a question about what's going on—that will show her you're interested in learning more about her. For instance, if she posts a picture of a home-cooked meal, you might comment, \"This looks awesome, did you make it yourself?\" Don't follow every single account she has, since that might seem a little overeager. Instead, follow her on the one or two platforms you use the most. If you have a pet, show them off on your feed! Some studies show that having a furry friend could make you more attractive to women—and besides, everybody loves seeing cute animals while they're scrolling. [11] X Research source"

And if her friends think the two of you would be a cute pair, they might even help sway her to give things a shot! [12] X Research source If you see her out with her friends, for instance, speak to each of them—not just the girl you like. Remember things about them, and go out of your way to be friendly. Just don't flirt with them, or your crush might get the wrong idea."
