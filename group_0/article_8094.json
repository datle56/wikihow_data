Use a nail brush and scrub the toothpaste all over your nails, making sure to get underneath them as well. Rinse your nails off with water after you’re done scrubbing. If you scrub your nails with the whitening toothpaste and want them to be whiter, you can either repeat the process over again or let a coat of whitening toothpaste sit on your nails for 5-10 minutes."

      "content": "Combine baking soda with lemon juice to create a whitening paste. Squeeze at least half of a lemon’s juice into a bowl or container. Mix baking soda into the lemon juice slowly until you form a paste — how much baking soda you'll need to form a paste will depend on the amount of lemon juice used. Use a nail brush to scrub the paste into your bare nails, and rinse it off once you’ve applied it evenly. Repeat the process for whiter nails, if necessary. [5] X Research source Lemon juice can be painful on open wounds, so if you have any cuts or scrapes on your fingers, this might not be the best method. You can also use these two ingredients separately. Soaking your fingers in a bowl of lemon juice will help whiten your nails, as will creating a paste by mixing baking soda with water. By using these two ingredients together, it creates a more powerful whitener."
