Fill the basin with hot water and add 1 to 2 drops of dish soap. Swirl your hands in the water to dissolve the soap.

      "content": "Put the nipples into the basin of soapy water and scrub them with a brush. You can also add other parts of the baby bottle that you want to wash. Then, take a cleaning brush that came with the bottles or a small wire brush with bristles at the end and scrub inside the nipple. Clean around the holes to break up any clogs. [3] X Research source If milk dried in the nipples, you might want to soak them for a few minutes. To tell if you've thoroughly cleaned the nipple, try to squeeze water through the nipple holes. If water doesn't flow through, you need to scrub more dried milk out of them."

Leave the nipples and baby bottle parts to dry completely. [5] X Research source Don't wipe or rub the clean nipples with a kitchen towel even if you're in a hurry for them to dry. Drying them with a towel will introduce germs. You can buy a small drying rack designed for little baby bottle parts. Since these allow the air to circulate, it can speed up drying time."

      "content": "Clean the basin and brush before storing them. Dump out the soapy water and rinse it with clean water. You should also rinse the bottle brush and let them both air dry before you store them. To thoroughly clean them, run the basin and brush through the dishwasher every 2 or 3 days.
