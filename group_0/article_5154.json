Start a blog about your Buy Nothing project, or take notes in a journal. Note how much money you save just by cutting out leisure expenses and activities. Now, multiply this amount by 12 to determine how much you could save in one year without these expenses. Consider this amount your buy nothing goal. There is a theory that it take 30 days to change a habit or adopt a new habit. After a month of lower to no spending on certain items or activities, you should start to notice you perceive items in a store or socialize at a restaurant or bar differently. You may start asking yourself, “Do I really need this?” before you buy something. More often than not, the answer will be “No”."

      "content": "Learn to live rent-free . One of the most difficult things to eliminate from your budget is likely rent, or the cost of your living space. There are several possible ways to live without paying for rent or for a home, including: Moving into an unoccupied home. Some cities or areas have vacant dwellings that need some attention and care. A landlord may be willing to allow you to live rent free in a vacant home in exchange for fixing and upkeeping the home. You should inspect the home to determine how extensive the damage is to the foundation and structure. Look for a home you can maintain with a few basic tools and some hard work. Once it’s in living order, you can now occupy it, rent free. [7] X Research source House sitting. When homeowners go away for extended periods of time, they look for trusted individuals to occupy and maintain their homes. In addition to house duties, and sometimes pet duties, you will be paid an hourly wage to take care of the property, ranging from $15/hr to a fixed monthly rate for longer jobs. Look for house sitting opportunities online [8] X Research source , and always sign a contract before taking on a house sitting job. [9] X Research source Apartment management. You could also become a landlord yourself, where you get free rent in exchange for maintaining the building and responding to the needs of the building’s tenants. However, this could be a big responsibility in terms of time and energy. [10] X Research source Moving in with your parents. Though you may not want to end up staying with your parents past high school, many graduates and young adults move back in with their parents to save money on rent and food. A zero rent, home cooked meal situation may not be so bad, and will bring you one step closer to buying nothing. [11] X Research source"

Focus on creating a meal plan every week where you use pantry items you already own and vegetables from a local garden or your own backyard garden. [14] X Research source Many people who commit to a buy nothing lifestyle invest in an aquaponics system, where fish help to fertilize a garden that can grow enough produce for one person. Aquaponic systems are self-sufficient and require minimal upkeep. They can also produce a variety of produce, from herbs to tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, and other greens. Over time, this system will provide you with a free food source.

      "content": "Look for free meal opportunities. Soup kitchens and food banks provide free meals to people daily. There are also other practices, like dumpster diving, or food bartering, that require no money and can lead to some free food. Dumpster diving is when you look in dumpsters and trash bins for items that may be edible, useful, or recyclable. Dumpster diving can also be profitable, as you can sell any valuable items you find in the garbage. However, you must always wear full body protection when dumpster diving and have a strong stomach for potentially gross discoveries, such as dead animals, hazardous weapons, and biohazardous items like used needles. Food bartering is when you trade one food item for another food item. For example, you may have a surplus of tomatoes in your garden, or too many loaves of homemade bread in your kitchen. You would then network with other people in your area to barter for other food. There are several food bartering groups on Facebook and online. Search for food bartering networks in your area."
