Moths are generally nocturnal, which means they mostly fly at night.

[2] X Trustworthy Source Library of Congress Official library of the U.S. and main research institution for Congress and the American public Go to source Moths prefer warm, humid and overcast nights to cooler, clear nights. [3] X Research source There are thousands of species of moths and butterflies. Some eat plants, while others may eat wool and items of clothing. Contact your local county extension to help identify any moths you may have in or around your home. [4] X Research source"

By gathering the following materials before you start, you may be able to catch one—or many—moths: An outdoor light bulb bright enough to attract moths at night. Moth “food” to attract insects. A butterfly/ moth net. A homemade net or other container, such as a jar or box, with holes so the moth can breathe."

      "title": "Bait moths you want to catch.",
      "content": "Bait moths you want to catch. “Baiting”, which is also called “sugaring” is a technique you can use to attract moths you want to catch. Baiting involves making “moth food” and putting in places to attract moths. [5] X Research source Make bait by mixing one can of beer or apple cider, 1.5 cups sugar, ¼- ½ cup molasses, four over-ripe bananas or other fruit such as apples or peaches in a blender. You can also add a spoonful of cornmeal and some brewer’s yeast if you like, too. [6] X Research source Place fermenting fruits like spoiled watermelon as another form of bait. [7] X Research source Remember that moths are also attracted to any kind of light, so you can seek them near outdoor or indoor lights if you wish. Apply an approximately 20-30cm patch of bait to tree trunks with a brush just before sunset. [8] X Research source Find trees with smooth bark or plates of smooth bark such as pine, hickory, cherry, or birch. [9] X Research source Fill a small bowl or your container with bait if you want to catch the moth in your home. Be aware that bait can attract more than moths. Bears, mice, skunks, and foxes may like your bait in addition to the moths you want to catch. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Check the bait. In order to effectively catch your moth or moths, you need to check the bait or light sources.

      "title": "Approach the moth slowly.",
      "content": "Approach the moth slowly. Wait until the moth or moths are at rest or not moving before you catch them. Once you’ve observed them, approach them slowly so that you don’t startle them away. Avoid sudden movements, which may startle moths into flight. Approach the moth from behind if you can."

      "content": "Catch the moth. Take out your net or container and sweep it forward quickly. This can help you effectively capture the moth in your container without releasing it. Make secure to quickly secure the container over the moth so that it can’t escape. Ensure that the moth is at the deep or far end of your container to minimize the risk of it escaping."

      "title": "Seal the container.",
      "content": "Seal the container. Once you’ve captured the moth, seal your net or container. This can help you transport the moth so that you can release it or observe it. If you’re using a net, collapse the end of it with your fingers. Leave enough space at the end of the net to minimize the risk of damage to the moth. If you’re using a jar, box, or another container, slowly thread a piece of paper or a lid under it. Make sure to not lift the container up too high so that the moth doesn’t escape."

      "title": "Release the moth.",
      "content": "Release the moth. After you’ve caught the moth and observed it if you want, release it into the outdoors or someplace outside your home where it won’t bother you any longer. This is a more humane way to deal with a moth than killing it."

      "content": "Inspect and clean your spaces regularly. Set up regular inspections and clean sessions of spaces that attract moths. This can help you nip problems in the bud before they become infestations and kill larvae. Check closets, human and pet bedding, behind furniture, in curtains, behind radiators or heaters, in air ducts and vents, and along baseboards. Wipe down and vacuum areas attractive to moths at least once a week. Clean your clothes regularly as well. Moths are attracted to garments soiled by food, drinks, sweat, and urine."

      "content": "Scatter mothballs. Distribute mothballs in places that currently have a moth infestation or where you’d like to deter them. You may want to consider this as a last resort before professional extermination because mothballs come with an unpleasant smell and can have health side effects. Inhaling the vapors from mothballs over a longer period of time can have health consequences. These include: anemia, liver damage, neurological damage, and cataracts. Ensure that spaces where you place mothballs are airtight to help prevent you from inhaling the vapors."
