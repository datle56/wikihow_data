      "content": "Apply serum (optional). To dry your hair like a professional and make it shiny and smooth, rub hair serum into your hair ends. [1] X Research source You only need to use a coin-sized amount for your full head of hair. Rub this between your hands first to ensure you apply it evenly. [2] X Research source Some people apply one or two drops of oil to their hair instead. This may cause damage during a hot blow dry session, so use this with low-temperature blow-drying only. Try a light oil such as jojoba oil or coconut oil. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Comb in heat protectant. [4] X Expert Source Gina Almona Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 12 December 2019. Spray heat protectant lightly onto your hair from at least 20cm (8 inches) away. Gently comb your hair with a wide-toothed comb to distribute the protection throughout your hair. Do not use a narrow-toothed comb, and don't try to comb out tangles. These approaches may tear out wet hair."

      "title": "Adjust air flow with a narrow nozzle (optional).",
      "content": "Adjust air flow with a narrow nozzle (optional). If your blow dryer comes with multiple nozzle attachments, compare the width of each one. If the nozzle is too wide (side to side), you may waste air flow directing it at short hair. However, the more narrow the nozzle opening is, the more likely it is to cause damage. Consider sticking to a wide nozzle if your hair is fragile or thin. [5] X Research source Reduce the air flow setting to low or medium as well."

    {
      "title": "Select the right temperature.",
      "content": "Select the right temperature. If your hair is easily damaged, reduce the temperature setting on your blow dryer to medium or low, until the flow of air feels comfortable on the back of your hand. If your hair is strong, or short enough to dry in a few minutes, blow dry on high heat. See the guides below for specific styles."

      "title": "Comb while blow drying.",
      "content": "Comb while blow drying. For a quick and easy dry, point the blow dryer downward. This reduces frizz and fly away strands. As you blow dry, drag a comb or your fingers through your hair to ensure even drying. [6] X Research source To keep straight hair smooth and well-shaped, pull the ends of your hair as you blow dry. You can do this with your fingers, but for best results, use a brush adapted to the length of hair. Pull very short sections with a small brush, and use a brush with longer, thicker bristles to wrap around the ends of medium-length sections."

Clip three of the sections, leaving the last one free. It's generally easiest to start with the back section free and move forward. Part thick hair into more than four sections."

      "title": "Blow dry from all sides.",
      "content": "Blow dry from all sides. Pull the hair gently with the brush to expose a straight length of hair. Hold the blow dryer about ½–1 in (1.25–2.5 cm) away from the hair, gliding along this length without touching your scalp or the brush. Repeat several times from below, above, and both sides. Gradually roll the brush to reveal more hair as you blow dry. Direct the air away from your head, not toward it. For everyday blow drying, it's best to keep the nozzle 8 inches (20 cm) away from your hair. This will reduce damage to your hair, but will make it much more difficult to style."

      "title": "Twist the hair and let cool.",
      "content": "Twist the hair and let cool. Rotate the brush to form a half or full twist, to encourage more volume. Leave your hair in this position until it cools. To prevent your hair flipping up, twist this toward your head, not away."

      "title": "Blow dry again while pulling forward.",
      "content": "Blow dry again while pulling forward. Bring the brush as far forward on your head as you can to maximize volume. Pull the brush forward so your hair is tense; this will make your hair more shiny. Blow dry from all sides until dry, adjusting the section to expose wet areas."

      "title": "Blow dry the remaining sections away from your face.",
      "content": "Blow dry the remaining sections away from your face. Move on to the front section, blow drying it while pulling it to one side of your face. Pull the sections on the left or right away from your head, to increase bounce and volume. If the ends of your hair tend to flip up and disarrange your hairdo, blow dry them from above, with the dryer pointed straight downward. You'll still add volume as long as you keep your hair pulled tightly away from your head."

      "title": "Add a diffuser.",
      "content": "Add a diffuser. A diffuser attaches over the nozzle of your blow dryer. These lower the air flow, keeping your curls intact instead of creating a mountain of frizz. If your blow dryer didn't come with a diffuser, buy a \"universal\" model, or a diffuser specifically meant for your blow dryer."
