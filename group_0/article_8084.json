      "content": "Make a homemade cleaner out of baby soap and rubbing alcohol. Take your empty spray bottle and rinse it to clean out any dust or residue from anything previously used in it, then add 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of rubbing alcohol to the spray bottle along with a few drops of your baby soap. Now you can fill up your spray bottle with distilled water, screw on the cap, and swirl the contents to ensure a thorough mix. [1] X Research source The alcohol in your cleaner, besides safely disinfecting the surface of your tint, will also help your cleaner to evaporate quickly and streak free. Alcohol also helps to dissolve grease and oils, like the kind that causes fingerprints, from the window."

      "content": "Avoid ammonia-based cleaners. If you’re going to buy a window cleaner from the store, stay away from ones with ammonia in them, as they can make your tint peel off and fade. Instead, go for an ammonia-free window cleaner, like Sprayway, Ammonia-Free Windex, or ZEP. [3] X Research source You can find most of these cleaners at hardware or automotive stores."

      "title": "Test the cleaner on a small area of your windows first.",
      "content": "Test the cleaner on a small area of your windows first. Before you start spraying your windows down, pick a small section on one of the rear windows that isn’t too noticeable. Spray a little bit of your homemade cleaner onto the window, then use a microfiber cloth to wipe it off. If you notice any discoloration or streaking, don’t use your homemade spray on the rest of your windows. [4] X Research source It’s better to test it out on a small portion of your car than to mess up all of your windows at once. If your homemade cleaner doesn’t work out, you can pick up an ammonia-free glass cleaner from most hardware and automotive stores."

      "content": "Clean the rest of your car before moving to your windows. Windows are one of the most visible parts on your car, and accidentally spraying, splattering, or spreading dirtiness while cleaning other parts of your vehicle could lead to your window, and your tinting, becoming unnecessarily dirty again. You’ll want to clean the exterior and interior of your car thoroughly before you tackle cleaning your windows and the tinting on your windows. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray the cleaner on a towel, then wipe down the windows. [7] X Expert Source Angel Ricardo Auto Technician Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. Grab a microfiber cloth and spray your cleaner once or twice on the towel. Use the cloth to wipe down the inside and the outside of your tinted windows, trying not to leave any streaks as you go. [8] X Research source If you come across a particularly difficult stain, like bug spatter, you can loosen it by soaking it in your cleaner for a few minutes. Try not to saturate the edges of the tinting with your cleaner. If cleaner gets underneath your tinting, it could result in it losing stickiness and peeling away from the window. Using a microfiber cloth will ensure that you don’t accidentally scratch or scrape your windows. If you don’t have a microfiber cloth, use a clean cotton rag instead."

      "content": "Wipe the cleaner away with a microfiber cloth. Immediately after you spray down your window, take your cloth and wipe it either up and down or left to right. Don’t let the cleaner dry on its own, or it could leave streaks on the surface of your window. [9] X Research source You may want to wipe the tinting with strokes that are opposite to what you used on the outside of the window. For example, if you’ve wiped the outside of the window clean in a vertical fashion, you should wipe the inside in a horizontal fashion. This will make it easier for you to see where missed spots are located."

      "content": "Dry the window with a clean microfiber cloth. Take a second microfiber cloth and wipe away any cleaner still left on your window. Save this cloth specifically for drying off your window, not wiping away any dirt or grime. This will keep your window cleaner and avoid scratching the surface as you go. [10] X Research source Never use a paper towel to dry your windows. The rough surface of the paper could scratch your windows or your car."

Push the bubble out toward the edge of the tint to get the air out and smooth the surface of your window again. [11] X Research source You can also use a window squeegee to push bubbles and creases out of your tint if you need to.
