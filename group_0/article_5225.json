      "content": "Riften can be reached by foot or by horse. Riften is one of the major cities in the world of Skyrim that the Dragonborn (main character) needs to travel to. It is located in the southeastern region of the map."

      "title": "Talk to Wujeeta.",
      "content": "Talk to Wujeeta. Enter the city and go to the fishery, where you’ll find Wujeeta, an Argonian (reptile) woman. She will tell you that she's sick because of Skooma use. Simply give her some health potion and force out some information from her about who's selling the Skooma, either by Persuasion, Intimidation, or Bribery. For reference purposes, Skooma is referred to as an illegal drug in Skyrim. The Skooma quest is part of the game's storyline, tracing back from the very start of the game."

      "title": "Head to the keep inside the city.",
      "content": "Head to the keep inside the city. After getting some information from Wujeeta, talk to the Jarl (Laila Law-Giver) about the Skooma incident. The Jarl will then tell you to kill the Skooma dealers (another quest). If you have completed the Civil War questline for the Imperials, the Jarl will instead be Maven Black-Briar."

      "content": "Find the Skooma dealers in a warehouse outside Riften. The Jarl will give you a key to the warehouse, which is located outside Riften at the port. Enter the warehouse and eliminate the Skooma dealers. They’re rather weak and can be easily defeated."

    {
      "title": "Talk to the Jarl to complete the quest.",
      "content": "Talk to the Jarl to complete the quest. She’ll then ask you to help a couple more Riften citizens. Go back out into the city and look for people to help. You need to help at least 3-5 citizens with random quests that are rather trivial and very easy to complete. Easier quests include that of Sniff and Edda, who just want a small donation of money. Other quests include gathering ingredients or items, so talk to passersby for quest details."

      "title": "She will make you a Thane.",
      "content": "She will make you a Thane. The Jarl will make you a local hero for assisting the people of Riften, but before she can do that, she’ll tell you that a Thane should be a resident of Riften. She’ll then tell you of a property that you can purchase (the Honeyside Manor)."

      "title": "Purchase the house for 8,000 gold.",
      "content": "Purchase the house for 8,000 gold. Then, go back to the Jarl once more. She’ll now make you a Thane and give you a Housecarl (Iona), a non-playable character that’s in charge of safekeeping a house."
