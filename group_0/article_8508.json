      "content": "Heat vinegar and salt in a saucepan. Use equal parts salt and white vinegar. Set the burner to medium-high. Let the solution heat until bubbles start slowly rising, before the mixture comes to a boil. Crack a window if the smell of vinegar bothers you. Keep your iron turned off and unplugged."

      "title": "Scrub the soleplate with the solution.",
      "content": "Scrub the soleplate with the solution. Wear gloves to protect your hands. Wet a clean cloth or non-metal scouring pad in the solution by dipping the end into the pot. Use the rag or pad to clean the soleplate in a scrubbing motion: try circular, up and down, and side to side scrubbing until the soleplate is clean. Don’t submerge your hand in the hot vinegar. A metal pad can scratch the soleplate of your iron."

      "title": "Scrub the soleplate with a damp cloth.",
      "content": "Scrub the soleplate with a damp cloth. Once you’re finished cleaning the iron with the vinegar-saturated cloth, wet a fresh cloth with distilled water. Wipe down the iron to rinse it. Allow the iron to air dry, or wipe it dry."

      "title": "Rub your iron with a rag dampened with water first, if desired.",
      "content": "Rub your iron with a rag dampened with water first, if desired. If the stickiness on your iron is minimal, opt for this gentle method first. Heat your iron slightly on a low setting. Wet a rag with water so that it’s damp, not dripping. Unplug the iron before scrubbing it with the rag. Bunch up the damp rag a bit and make sure not to touch the iron directly with your hand."

      "title": "Mix a soap and water solution.",
      "content": "Mix a soap and water solution. If plain water doesn’t do the trick, allow your unplugged iron to cool until it’s at room temperature. Put a squirt of liquid dish soap in the bottom of a bowl. Fill the bowl with warm water."

    {
      "title": "Rub off the buildup.",
      "content": "Rub off the buildup. Dip a sponge or rag into the soap solution. Squeeze out any excess water so that the sponge or rag is damp, not dripping. Scrub the soleplate of the cool, dry iron. Use a dry rag to wipe away the moisture. For stubborn gunk, try using a nylon mesh pad."

      "content": "Run the iron over paper. Lay down a sheet of newspaper or paper towels. Slide the hot iron across the paper until it’s free of residue. This works particularly well for waxy substances stuck to your iron."

      "title": "Add salt, if needed.",
      "content": "Add salt, if needed. If your iron still has sticky buildup, pour a tablespoon of salt onto the paper. Run the iron over the salted paper to remove the residue. Alternately, you can sprinkle the salt on a dry cotton towel. This option will remove stickiness if you need to iron a garment in a hurry. However, it won’t remove all staining from your iron.
