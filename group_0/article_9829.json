Use a colander if you would like, but just make sure there isn’t any debris anywhere on the carrots before placing them in the pot you’re boiling them in. [1] X Research source Use a clean scrubbing tool to remove anything stuck on a carrot that won’t rinse off, or peel it away with a knife or vegetable peeler. Around 8-12 baby carrots will be a single serving. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Add the carrots to the pot and cook for 5-10 minutes. Keep them in the water until they’re fully cooked through, while retaining an al dente firmness. Boil thinner carrots for closer to 5 minutes, and thicker ones for 10 minutes or longer. [4] X Research source Test one of the carrots by sticking a fork into it. From there, you can gauge how much longer you need to boil until you get your desired tenderness."

Strain your carrots from the water they were boiled in, and place them on a dish where you can add other ingredients such as salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, olive oil, freshly squeezed lime, or whatever else you prefer. You can also leave them completely plain! [5] X Research source This is a nice method to prepare lots of pre-cooked carrots to use later in other dishes. Cool leftovers down to room temperature before placing them in an airtight container with a lid. Keep the container in the fridge, and eat the leftovers within a few days of cooking them.

      "content": "Parboil 1 pound (0.45 kg) of carrots for 5 minutes. Parboiling is partially cooking a food by boiling it first to prepare it to be cooked another way. In this case, you’ll be parboiling the carrots to make them firmer, and thus easier to sear in the pan when you go to sauté them. After the water has reached a rolling boil, toss in the carrots, and boil them as you normally would. As they cook, make sure their texture remains even crisper than an al dente bite. When they’re done, strain the carrots from the water, but leave them in the pot until they’re ready to be added to the pan for sautéing. [8] X Research source Make sure the carrots are completely submerged in the water when you’re boiling them. Don’t start the timer until bubbles are rolling at the surface of the water. 1 pound (0.45 kg) of carrots will serve 2-3 people."

While you’re letting the carrots parboil, on a cutting board, cut up either 1 bunch (6-8 stems) of long green onions, or 2 shallots to cook with the carrots. Cut them into small enough pieces so they will quickly sauté and caramelize in the pan. [9] X Research source Some other vegetables you could add are chopped broccoli or cauliflower, green beans, or bell pepper. They do not have to be parboiled beforehand. Use enough in proportion to the onions or shallots."

Continue to keep moving the vegetables around to make sure it gets on them all to have them be caramelized. Be careful to not cook longer than a minute, or you could risk burning the brown sugar, ruining the carrots. Turn the heat on your stove off after the 1 minute passes, and move the pan to a different part of the stove, or off it, to keep the vegetables from continuing to cook in the still hot pan."

To prepare the vegetables, first rinse everything off as you did the carrots. Slice the onions and potatoes into thick wedge pieces, and halve or quarter the brussels sprouts to your liking."
