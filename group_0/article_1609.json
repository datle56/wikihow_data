It’s recommended that you wait at least a year after you’ve started working in Singapore before submitting your PR application. Note that you’ll need to be working a job that pays a minimum annual salary of S$3300 and that your professional skills and education, as evidenced by the industry you work in, the pedigree of your employer, and the reputation of the academic institution you’ve graduated from, will also factor into your application for PR status."
