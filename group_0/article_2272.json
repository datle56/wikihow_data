      "content": "Avoid splatters and spots in your paint from dust and lint. Use a vacuum or a piece of painter’s tape to clean your roller off before you use it. Even if the roller is new, it still might have a little bit of dust or dirt on it, so give it a quick wipedown before you start. [1] X Research source If you’re using an old roller, make sure it doesn’t have any dried paint on it that could cause lumps or bumps in your paint job."

      "title": "Too much paint can splatter and cause harsh lines.",
      "content": "Too much paint can splatter and cause harsh lines. Pour your paint into a paint tray and dip your roller into the paint. Roll the roller back onto the grooves of the paint tray to squeeze out any excess before you put it on the wall. [2] X Research source On the flip side, too little paint can leave your paint job streaky and thin. Try to strike the balance between too much and too little."

      "title": "Coat large areas of the wall easily without a ton of streaks.",
      "content": "Coat large areas of the wall easily without a ton of streaks. Move your roller up and down at a diagonal to go across your entire wall. Be sure to follow up with new paint before your last coat dries to prevent streaking. [3] X Research source Professional painters can paint up and down in straight lines, but it’s a little bit tougher to do. If you’re a beginner, try a W or N pattern to start."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pressing super hard can push the paint into the wall.",
      "content": "Pressing super hard can push the paint into the wall. Instead, press the roller against the wall with moderate pressure; if the paint starts to streak or create lines, you’re probably pushing too hard. [4] X Research source This is a little bit objective, and it might take some practice before you find the right pressure point for your paint job."
    },
    {
      "title": "Every time you roll paint on the wall, overlap it on the wet paint.",
      "content": "Every time you roll paint on the wall, overlap it on the wet paint. This will help ensure that your edges don’t look so defined. It doesn’t have to be a huge overlap—about 1 in (2.5 cm) will do just fine. [5] X Research source This is the easiest and best way to make sure you don’t get any streaks in your dried paint."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid harsh paint lines on the top and bottom of your wall.",
      "content": "Avoid harsh paint lines on the top and bottom of your wall. Try to drag your roller as close to the ceiling and floor as you possibly can without spreading paint everywhere. It will help blend the lines in between your 2 paint jobs and make your walls look seamless. [6] X Research source You can paint around the floor and ceiling first to make your paint job easier, or you can save it until the end."

      "title": "Cheap roller covers can lead to streaking and paint marks.",
      "content": "Cheap roller covers can lead to streaking and paint marks. When you’re picking out your supplies, go for a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) synthetic, short-napped roller cover for your walls and ceiling. This roller cover doesn’t have any obvious seams, so it will apply your paint smoothly on every surface. [7] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Longer-nap roller covers are better for textured walls."

      "title": "Don’t be tempted to pause in the middle and let the paint dry.",
      "content": "Don’t be tempted to pause in the middle and let the paint dry. Once you’ve started on a wall, it’s important to go over the entire thing to avoid roller marks. Stopping and starting in the middle of a paint job can lead to uneven drying which creates streaking. [8] X Research source Doing an entire wall at once ensures that you’ll keep a wet edge the whole time."

      "title": "You can fix roller marks if you spot them early.",
      "content": "You can fix roller marks if you spot them early. Put more paint on your roller and press against the wall lightly on top of the roller marks. Go straight up and down the wall from floor to ceiling to fix the roller marks and spread the paint out. [9] X Research source This is also called “back rolling,” and it’s a super important part of smoothing out your paint lines."

      "title": "Noticing roller marks after the fact can be a bummer.",
      "content": "Noticing roller marks after the fact can be a bummer. If your paint dries and you find streaks or marks in your paint, grab a sheet of 180 or 220-grit sandpaper and use it to sand the paint streaks off the wall. [10] X Research source Wipe the walls down to get rid of the dust, then cover the entire wall in a new coat of primer and paint. [11] X Research source You can also sand in between coats to erase streak marks as they happen. Sanding also works well on paint drips or bubbles."
