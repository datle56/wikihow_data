If they are not the same, you will need to find the lowest common denominator. The denominator tells you how many pieces make one whole. [1] X Research source If the two fractions do not use the same denominator, then you are not adding same-sized pieces, and your answer will be incorrect. For example, if you are adding the fractions 6 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {6}{4}}} and 5 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{3}}} , you would compare the 4 and the 3. They are different, and so you cannot add these fractions as is, because you cannot add fourths and thirds together."

      "content": "Find the lowest common denominator (LCD) of the two fractions. If the denominators are the same, you can skip this step. If the denominators are not the same, you must find the LCD. To find the LCD, you are looking for the lowest common multiple of the two denominators. A multiple is a number that results from multiplying a number by another number. [2] X Research source One way to find the LCD is to make a list of multiples of the two denominators until you find one that matches. To learn other ways to find the LCD, read Find the Least Common Denominator . For example, if your denominators are 4 and 3, first list multiples of 4 (4, 8, 12, 16, 20...) and then list multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, 12, 15…). The lowest multiple the two numbers have in common is 12, so 12 is the least common denominator."

      "content": "Find the new numerator of the first fraction. The numerator is the number above the fraction bar. To find the new numerator, compare the original denominator to the LCD. Determine what factor you have to multiply the original denominator by to get to the LCD. Then, multiply the numerator by this same factor. The numerator tells you how many pieces you have. [3] X Research source Just remember when preparing fractions for adding that whatever you do to the denominator, you must also do to the numerator. For example, if the original denominator was 4, and the LCD is 12, you would have to multiply the original denominator by the factor 3, since 4 × 3 = 12 {\\displaystyle 4\\times 3=12} . As such, you would then multiply the numerator by the factor 3. If the original numerator was 6, then the new numerator would be 18, since 6 × 3 = 18 {\\displaystyle 6\\times 3=18} . So, your new fraction becomes 18 12 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {18}{12}}} ."

As such, you would then multiply the numerator by the factor 4. If the original numerator was 5, then the new numerator would be 20, since 5 × 4 = 20 {\\displaystyle 5\\times 4=20} . So, your new fraction becomes 20 12 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {20}{12}}} ."

      "content": "Add the numerators of the two fractions, and place the sum over the LCD. Now that you have found the lowest common denominator, you are adding individual pieces that are the same size, so you can proceed with adding the numerators. You do NOT add the denominators, because the size of the pieces you are adding does not change, only how many of the pieces you have. For example, if you are adding 18 12 + 20 12 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {18}{12}}+{\\frac {20}{12}}} , you will add the numerators 18 and 20. 18 + 20 = 38 {\\displaystyle 18+20=38} . Then, you will place 38 over the LCD, which is 12. So the sum is 38 12 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {38}{12}}} ."

[5] X Expert Source Grace Imson, MA Math Instructor, City College of San Francisco Expert Interview. 1 November 2019. The product is the answer to a multiplication problem. Unlike when adding fractions, multiplying fractions does not require having a least common denominator. This is because when taking a part of a fraction, you are changing the number of pieces in the whole. For example, if you are multiplying 5 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{2}}} and 3 12 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{12}}} , the numerator of your answer (product) will be 15, since 5 × 3 = 15 {\\displaystyle 5\\times 3=15} ."
