Do a few simple exercises, talk to coworkers, or just take a stroll around the office during this time. [3] X Research source"

[6] X Research source Take a shorthand course to learn the characters and improve your speed. If you don’t often take notes by hand or you don’t want to learn shorthand, do a typing test.

Stick to the device with the highest word count when you need to take quick notes."

If you work well with pen and paper, keep a small planner or calendar that can fit in your pocket or purse so you always have it with you. Keep a pen attached if possible so you never have to fish around for one. Have a designated note pad for to-do lists at your desk, and cross things off as you go. If you work better with digital organization, use your phone’s calendar and reminder system to make appointments and receive notifications about them. Try apps like Wunderlist or Todoist to manage your tasks. [8] X Research source"
