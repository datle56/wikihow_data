      "content": "Unopened soy sauce can last up to 3 years. A sealed bottle of soy sauce can retain its flavor and quality for 1-3 years as long as it’s kept in a cool, dark, dry place. Soy sauce is full of salt, which functions as a natural preservative that limits the amount of bacterial growth. However, when soy sauce is exposed to oxygen and warm, humid conditions, the process of oxidation begins, which can alter the taste, smell, viscosity, and color of the soy sauce."

      "content": "Opened soy sauce can last at least 3-6 months in the fridge. An opened bottle of soy sauce should be refrigerated and used within 3-6 months for the best flavor. Storing it in the fridge can help extend its shelf life since refrigeration slows down oxidation, so you can still use the soy sauce for up to 3 years after opening as long as it's been stored properly (just keep in mind that the flavor starts to deteriorate after 6 months).

      "content": "The shelf life depends on the kind of soy sauce it is. Chinese soy sauce comes in a variety of shades and concentrations, ranging from light to dark. Light soy sauce is saltier and looser, while darker soy sauces are sweeter and more viscous due to added caramel or molasses. Tamari is gluten-free Japanese-style soy sauce, less salty and more luscious on the palate. Here’s how they compare: [2] X Research source Light soy sauce: This variation can last 18 months-3 years, although flavor is optimal during year 1. Dark soy sauce: Made by adding sugars to the recipe, this type of soy sauce can also officially last up to 3 years. The addition of sugars, like caramel and molasses, potentially add to its shelf life and its ability to maintain a strong flavor longer than its lighter counterparts. Tamari soy sauce: This option made without wheat can last 2-3 years, and perhaps a few more past its “best by” stamp if refrigerated properly."

      "content": "Significant change in color and/or viscosity Soy sauce will naturally darken over time, but if you notice a significant change in color, then that’s a sign that it is past its prime. If your soy sauce looks ink-black in appearance, or if there are any visible signs of mold, like green or fuzzy clusters, it’s time to toss it in the trash. Similarly, if the soy sauce has thinned out, it’s likely started to degrade in flavor and quality. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "A bitter, sour, or foul smell A strongly bitter, sour, or otherwise foul smell is a clear indicator that something has gone awry. If you open an older bottle of soy sauce and immediately detect a rancid odor, the best course of action is to throw the soy sauce away out of an abundance of caution."

      "content": "Store unopened soy sauce in a cool, dry place. Since soy sauce is so salt-rich, it will keep just fine in a cupboard or pantry as long as conditions remain cool and dry. An opened bottle of the savory stuff can last up to 3 years at room temperature, as long as it’s tightly sealed and kept out of direct sunlight. Remember: the perfect storm of heat and humidity is how bacteria and mold thrive. [5] X Research source The more protected the bottle is, the less it will be exposed to the air and heat, which is what causes it to oxidize."

You don't necessarily have to toss it out after 6 months, but the flavor will start to deteriorate after that point. As long as you keep it properly stored, you can use the soy sauce for up to 1-3 years after opening."

Although soy sauce doesn’t technically need to be refrigerated due to its abundance of salt, storing it in the fridge assures that it stays fresh and tasty for longer. Whether its opened or sealed, a bottle of soy sauce can last up to 3 years. Storing your soy sauce in the fridge is a great idea if you don’t use it very often but still want the option should you ever need that punch of umami.

If your soy sauce expired a few months ago and you’ve thoroughly inspected it to make sure there are no signs of mold or spoilage, it should be okay to use. The sauce’s flavor and quality may be degraded but it’s not likely to cause food poisoning. The flavor probably won’t be as salty and robust as it once was, but it could still add a delicious, pungent kick to many a dish, such as: Soy marinated eggs Chicken adobo Lomo saltado Cantonese chow mein"

If opened, it’s best to use it within six months as the flavor may begin to degrade after that. If the soy sauce has a rancid smell, is significantly darker in color, or has visible mold, it’s no longer safe to use. However, if your soy sauce is a few months past its prime but you see no signs of spoilage, it’s likely still safe to use. Even if stored in the fridge, soy sauce should be replaced every 3 years."
