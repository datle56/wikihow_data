      "title": "Determine if you have a natural talent.",
      "content": "Determine if you have a natural talent. Do you find yourself doodling in your notebook at school? Would you rather draw a picture of an idea than write a paragraph describing it? Have your teachers, friends, and family members praised your artistic abilities? Have they asked you to make posters, flyers, or other artistic works? If so, this might be a sign you are a natural fit to become a cartoonist. Most cartoonist positions do not require formal education. A rich portfolio of work can be just as important -- if not more so -- than a degree. But a college education can help you connect to other cartoonists in your field, give you valuable professional experience through internships, and an opportunity to learn the latest technologies used by cartoonists.

      "title": "Prepare a portfolio.",
      "content": "Prepare a portfolio. Most art schools have their own requirements for compiling and submitting a portfolio, but they generally have to include 10-20 pieces of your best work (they can be unpublished). While you might be most interested in showing your cartoons, you should also include a broad range of work with multiple mediums, like paint, pastels,and photography. Keep your work in a binder with plastic sleeves protecting the work. The portfolio should be clean and easy to view."

      "content": "Prepare to attend art school in high school. In high school, don't just keep your art locked up in your journals or notebooks. Instead, take as many art electives as you can and start building up a portfolio that you can use to apply to college. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source Draw for your high school newspaper or magazine to get a sense of whether you like working for a publication. You will get into the practice of meeting deadlines and collaborating with an editor to create your cartoons. Contact your local city's newspaper to see if they need any freelance cartoon or illustration work. Maintain good grades and test scores. While you might think that an excellent academic record is not necessary to become an artist, it can be a major asset in furthering your career goals. The best art colleges and programs are very competitive; good grades will show your committee that you have the dedication and work ethic required to complete a large-scale art project. It is also worth it to study for your SAT/ACT. While some art schools only require these scores on an optional basis, they can help you earn scholarships and fellowships to fund your education. You can find study resources through the College Board's web site, including practice tests and sample questions. Do not study for the test overnight -- give yourself months to prepare. You can practice using a study guidebook (often available in your local public library), by attending a prep course offered by companies like Kaplan or Pearson or working with a private tutor."

      "content": "Apply to college. You might consider going to a university with an acclaimed school or art major within it, or you could also consider an art college to study. Prestigious programs include the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Yale University, the University of California -- Los Angeles, and the California Institute of the Arts. Write an artist's statement. Many art colleges require an artist's statement in your application. This is similar to a personal statement, except you use it to clearly express your perspective on your art and creative process. Why do you create the art that you do? What are your objectives as an artist? Keep in mind that the artist's statement shouldn't explain to the reader how to interpret your work. Rather, use the statement to give your perspective on your art, why you believe it is important and valuable work, and how you go about creating your pieces. Prepare for an interview. Many art schools and programs admit students after interviewing them. Think of this as an opportunity to stand out to your committee and to give yourself a competitive edge over other candidates. Bring your artist's statement and your portfolio with you to the interview. You will most likely be asked questions about your philosophy as an artist and what you hope to accomplish by studying in the program. Memorize responses to these questions so you can answer them very honestly and naturally in your interview."
