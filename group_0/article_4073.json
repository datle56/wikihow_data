      "title": "Get your car inspected if the pedal is spongy.",
      "content": "Get your car inspected if the pedal is spongy. A spongy brake pedal could mean that your brake pad has worn thin, leading to a low level of brake fluid. When the brake fluid gets low, it introduces air into the line that can make your brake pedal feel springy. If you’re not a car expert, take your car to a mechanic to get inspected before you attempt to bleed the brake lines. [1] X Research source In general, brake lines need to be bled every 2 to 3 years. A spongy or sinking brake pedal can also be caused by a hydraulic problem, like a failing master cylinder, a leaking rear wheel cylinder, a bad caliper or bad ABS. It’s important to rule out these dangerous possibilities via professional inspection before proceeding."

      "title": "Consult your owner’s manual before starting.",
      "content": "Consult your owner’s manual before starting. Your specific vehicle may have a different process for bleeding the brake lines. Before you start, always consult your owner’s manual to see if there are any instructions you need to follow. [2] X Research source Always consult the owner’s manual before buying brake fluid, since different vehicles need different types. You cannot bleed the brakes yourself on newer vehicles that have an anti-lock brake system (ABS). If your vehicle has ABS, you need a scan tool to electronically bleed the brakes, so take your vehicle to a reputable mechanic."

      "content": "Wear gloves and safety goggles when handling brake fluid. Brake fluid is corrosive, and it can cause skin and eye irritation. Since you’ll be handling a lot of brake fluid throughout this process, be sure you wear gloves and safety goggles the entire time.

It's a fist size (or larger) transparent container that is bolted to the firewall on the driver’s side of the car. You can find it by looking for the threaded cap on the very top. [7] X Research source The master cylinder is usually easy to access—in most vehicles, it’s near the top of the engine."

Take the cap off the master cylinder and grab a turkey baster . Siphon most of the brake fluid out of the cylinder, leaving only about 1 in (2.5 cm) of fluid to cover the bottom. [8] X Research source Brake fluid is corrosive and can eat through the paint on your car. If any spills, clean it up with a rag right away."

[25] X Research source If your brakes still feel soft and spongy or if you notice any problems after bleeding them, have your car towed to a mechanic shop. There’s a chance they might need to be bled again, or your vehicle has a different brake problem that needs to be fixed."
