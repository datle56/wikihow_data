      "content": "Turn off streaming services while downloading large files. Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, smart TV apps, and even YouTube can be a serious drain on your download speed. If downloading a file quickly is your goal, make sure that you're not streaming anything while you download. If anyone else sharing your internet connection is streaming while you download, this will also impact your speeds. Ask your family members to stop streaming for a moment while you download the rest of your file."

Even if your apps don't appear to be accessing the internet, they might be doing so in the background. For example, if you're downloading a game with BitTorrent , you may be able to speed up your downloads by closing your web browser."

It increases the overall download speed when compared to regular downloads. The browser which is made by Chromium has a parallel downloading function. For example, Google Chrome , Microsoft Edge, Opera, Firefox, and so on. Launch the latest version of Google Chrome, type the following command chrome://flags in the address bar, and press Enter . Type the keyword parallel in the search box, this can help you quickly locate the parallel download option. The current status of parallel downloading is Default , which means it is not enabled. Click the drop-down menu and then select Enabled . After selecting Enabled , relaunch Google Chrome to take effect the changes."

      "content": "Check your download speed . The easiest way to do this is to type internet speed into Google and then click the RUN SPEED TEST button. This will give you an estimate of your current download speed. If your download speed is significantly faster than what you're seeing when downloading files, your internet connection is fine. The problem is likely on your computer or your local network. Or, if you're noticing slowness with just one file, the issue could be with that file or its server. If the speed test reports that your connection is slow, your ISP could be having trouble with their network. There could also be a problem with your modem, router, or even the wiring in your home or neighborhood."

If your computer is in a different room (or on a different floor) than your Wi-Fi access point, try getting as close to the router as possible for the duration of your download.

      "content": "It may be beneficial to switch Wi-Fi frequencies depending on your home or office layout. 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi travels a farther distance at lower speeds, while 5 GHz provide faster speeds at shorter ranges. [5] X Research source If your router supports both frequencies, switching to the other might benefit you. While you'll get better wireless coverage using 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi in your home or office at further distances, your data transfer speeds will be lower than with 5 GHz. So, if your computer can be in the same room as your Wi-Fi access point, switching to 5 GHz will improve speeds. 2.4 GHz is more vulnerable to interference than 5 GHz, such as from microwaves, baby monitors, garage door openers, and security cameras. And, if you live in an apartment or condo, your neighbors' Wi-Fi connections can overcrowd 2.4 GHz bands. Physical obstructions , including walls, tall furniture, and glass from mirrors and windows can also interfere with your connection to the Wi-Fi router, especially if you're using 5 GHz. If there's no way to minimize obstructions, switching to 2.4 GHz can improve your download speeds."
