      "content": "Take advantage of chilly weather with this cute move. Rub your hands together and mention how cold they are. Then, give your girlfriend a smile and ask her to help you warm them up. Hold both hands out to her as you do this. Chances are, she'll put her hands onto yours to warm them up. When she does, it will be easy to shift to a hand holding position. [1] X Research source This probably won't work quite as well if it's hot out, but you could save it for when you head inside where there’s air conditioning!"

      "title": "Try to relax",
      "content": "Try to relax and settle your nerves before you make your move. It’s completely normal to feel a little nervous and anxious before you try to hold your girlfriend’s hand, especially if it’s for the first time. Try to think positively by imagining how great it’ll be to hold her hand. You can also try to take some deep breaths to calm your mind. Do whatever you can to relax yourself before you ask her.

      "title": "Look for signs that she’s interested in getting closer to you.",
      "content": "Look for signs that she’s interested in getting closer to you. Positive body language, such as your girlfriend leaning in towards you or if she has relaxed, open arms is a good sign! If she’s leaning away or has her arms crossed, it could be a sign that she’s not interested in holding hands and you may want to back off. [3] X Research source Additionally, if her hands are closed into a fist and she keeps turning away from you, it may not be the best time to try to hold her hand."

    {
      "title": "Brush knuckles with her or keep your hand next to hers.",
      "content": "Brush knuckles with her or keep your hand next to hers. If you’re walking together, try allowing your hand to get close enough to hers to gently touch it. If you’re sitting together somewhere, try placing your arm and hand as close as you can so it’s super easy for you to hold her hand when the time is right. [4] X Research source For instance, if you’re at the movies with your girlfriend, try placing your arm next to hers on the armrest so your hands are close together."

      "title": "It’s never a bad idea to make sure she’s okay with holding hands first.",
      "content": "It’s never a bad idea to make sure she’s okay with holding hands first. If you really don’t know how your girlfriend is feeling or if your relationship is still pretty new, try asking her if it’s okay if you hold her hand. The worst thing that could happen is she’ll say no. But she’ll be grateful that you were kind enough to ask first. Here are a few different ways you can ask her: [5] X Research source \"Can I hold your hand?” \"Do you want to hold my hand?\" \"May I get the honor of holding your hand?\" \"I want to hold your hand right now—is that alright?\" \"My hand is lonely—can you hold it to keep it company?\""

    {
      "title": "Go for it!",
      "content": "Go for it! If the timing just seems right you can tell that she’s super into you, reach out and casually hold her hand. If she’s okay with it, she’ll keep holding your hand. If not, she’ll pull away. [6] X Research source If she does pull away, don’t force the issue. She may not be ready or feel comfortable just yet."
    },
    {
      "title": "If she’s interested, she’ll keep holding your hand.",
      "content": "If she’s interested, she’ll keep holding your hand. If you’re feeling too nervous to ask her, try a more playful approach. If she doesn’t pull away, just keep holding her hand! [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Make it a cute chivalrous gesture.",
      "content": "Make it a cute chivalrous gesture. If you're walking with your girlfriend, confidently hold your arm out to her with your elbow bent. This will signal to her that she should put her hand on your arm. You can then place your opposite hand over hers, or just keep walking the way you are. [8] X Research source This sweet, romantic move might not be quite the same as hand-holding, but it will help the two of you break the touch barrier, so holding hands might feel easier later on. If she gives you a confused look, it's fine to say something like, \"I thought it would be cute if you put your hand on my arm, like in the movies!\""

      "title": "Pretend you're a palm reader or give her a small gift.",
      "content": "Pretend you're a palm reader or give her a small gift. Any excuse will work. Confidently cup your hands in front of you and say, \"Can I see your hands?\" Gently hold her hands in yours and stare at her palms, examine her nail polish, or place something into her hand. [9] X Research source You could also ask her to hold her hand up to yours to compare the sizes. [10] X Research source After a moment, if you're feeling brave, slide your hand into hers and go back to talking normally."

      "title": "Suspense is the perfect excuse for hand holding.",
      "content": "Suspense is the perfect excuse for hand holding. Queue up something spooky on Netflix or head to the theater for the latest horror flick. Either way, when things start to get really tense, it's the perfect time to reach over and give her hand a quick squeeze. [11] X Research source Not only do you get to hold your girlfriend's hand, but you'll seem super reassuring—bonus!"

      "content": "Pull her with you to something you're excited to see. Okay, so maybe you're just using that new school bulletin board as an excuse to grab her hand. That's fine! Just slip your hand into hers and say something like \"Let's go!\" or \"Come with me!\" [12] X Research source When you get there, keep holding her hand unless she pulls it away."

      "title": "Don't let go at the end.",
      "content": "Don't let go at the end. Show off your amazing masseuse skills—it's okay if you're totally faking it—by giving her a gentle hand rub. Press lightly on the heel of her hand (the area under her thumb), then draw your thumbs across her palm from the base of her fingers toward her wrist or in circles. Eventually, slip your fingers into hers, and voila, you're holding hands!"

      "content": "Change things up from time to time. There’s nothing wrong with the classic technique of clasping your palms together, but you can try switching it up to something like interlocking fingers, using both hands to hold her hand, or even just holding onto 1 finger. Keep it casual and natural and just go with what feels good. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "It’s a great way to establish an emotional and physical connection. While it may seem just like an innocent and cute way to tell someone you like them, some women actually prefer to express their feelings by holding hands instead of kissing. Whether you’re still getting to know your girlfriend, or you’ve been together for a long time, holding hands is a simple and effective way to build and strengthen your bond with her. [14] X Research source Even if you and your girlfriend aren’t feeling as emotionally connected as you once were, holding her hand can be a great way to try to rekindle your feelings for each other."

      "content": "Accept her decision and respect her feelings. If your girlfriend pulls her hand away or says no when you ask her to hold her hand, don’t get upset or angry. Definitely don’t try to hold her hand anyway. Calmly accept her decision. [15] X Research source Who knows—she just may not be in the mood. She also may want to wait a little longer before she holds your hand. Whatever the case, don’t react negatively."
