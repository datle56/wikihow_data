      "content": "Call the restaurant to book as far ahead of time as possible. In some cases, you will be able to make a dinner reservation early on the same day. However, if you are planning the dinner ahead of time, call early. Most restaurants will accept reservations a few days in advance, and exclusive fine dining venues will often accept (or even require) reservations weeks or months in advance."

      "content": "Be polite when booking a reservation. Remaining polite on the phone is just as important as having good table manners at a restaurant. If you are attempting to book a tough reservation, remember that your attitude on the phone will go a long way. Be confident but polite; avoid giving the impression that you feel entitled to a reservation. However, remember that even Michelin-starred restaurants are not in the business of turning away customers. If the host replies that the restaurant has no availability, explain your situation and ask politely if there is any way you can be accommodated in the future. When calling, say \"Hi, I'd like to place a reservation for this coming Saturday at 5.\" The host will then likely ask how many people are in your party and tell you if that date and time are available. If not available, try asking \"Is there a table available for an earlier/later time?\" If the answer is still no, ask if they can give you their earliest availability and go from there."

      "content": "Call back to confirm your reservation. If you book your table a week or more in advance, it's sometimes good to call the day of your reservation just to double-check that you still have it. You should do this as early in the day as you can in case there is an issue. This will allow you to make other plans if needed or give you time to work out any issues with the restaurant."

      "content": "Call ahead or cancel your reservation if you’re running late. Once you've secured your reservation, call ahead and apologize if it looks like you'll be up to 20 minutes late. If you are running much later than that, consider canceling and rescheduling your dinner. Remember that reservations are made for a reason—to make sure as many guests as possible are served each night. If you are late it can also affect other guests' reservations."

      "content": "Book a table via the restaurant's website. Many restaurants allow you to book a reservation directly on their website. When doing this, you may also be able to see a list of all available dates and times for either the upcoming week or month. The restaurant is likely to require you to create a login or provide an email address or phone number so they can confirm your reservations. However, they should not text or email you anything else outside of updates on your reservation. Not every restaurant is willing to take reservations, even if they are consistently busy. For example, some smaller or newer restaurants may not have enough clientele yet to set up a system for reservations. So it's important to know a restaurant's policy before you try to book a table. Some restaurants will require a credit card number upon booking your reservation and will charge you a \"no show\" fee if you do not arrive or cancel in advance."

If you are unable to book a reservation directly on the restaurant's website, you can try an online booking site like OpenTable, Resy, or Google. These sites (and apps when available) allow you to search restaurants based on your preferred time, date, cuisine, and price range. Using a restaurant reservation app on your phone is great for making last minute reservations on the go."

Some of these sites or restaurants may require you to click a link or a button to confirm your reservation. You may also be sent a link to cancel or change your reservation if you need to. Many of these online booking sites also offer coupons or have membership rewards programs through which you can accumulate perks. If you can't cancel online, you may have to call the restaurant directly."

      "content": "Choose a restaurant depending on your preferences. Before you make reservations it's best to decide on what kind of restaurant you'd like to go to. First, do your research to find one with the type of menu you need, including one that accommodates any dietary restrictions for those in your party ( food or gluten allergies or lactose intolerance ). Consider atmosphere (adults only vs. kid-friendly ), space, pricing, parking if applicable, and ambience. Knowing what you’re looking for in a dining experience before you make a restaurant reservation can prevent you showing up and being dissatisfied. Note that many busy casual restaurants don't accept reservations as a rule; this is why many popular spots can be seen with a long line of customers snaking out the door. Be prepared to wait if you want to dine at a restaurant like this."

      "content": "Count how many people are in your party. Once you've chosen a restaurant, figure out how many people are going to go to dinner with you. Depending on the size of your party, your wait time may vary. For example, if there are only two of you, you are more likely to have an easier time getting a table. On the other hand, if you are trying to book a table for a party of 10, it's going to be much more difficult. The number of people in your party may also affect how far ahead you need to book your reservation. [1] X Research source If you are unsure whether or not a person will be able to make it, book a table including them anyway. It's easier to have an empty seat rather than trying to add a chair to a table in a crowded restaurant."

      "content": "Set a date and time for your reservation. Depending on the day of the week, there may be more openings than others. For example, reserving a table on a weekday is easier than trying to book a table over the weekend. Similarly, setting a reservation for “off-hours” rather than the regular “prime time” hours for breakfast, lunch, or dinner will make getting a reservation easier. You should always have a backup date and time in case there is no availability at the original time you chose."

      "content": "Mark your calendar and make any necessary preparations. When the day comes, try to arrive at the restaurant 10-15 minutes before your reservation time. This way you can let the hostess know you've arrived and ensure that your table won't be given to someone else. Many restaurants will have a bar or waiting area that you use while ordering drinks. However, remember to re-approach the hostess when the time for your reservation comes up so you aren't passed over. Restaurant Industry professional Nicholas Di Paolo agrees that you should call ahead if you’re running late for your reservation, especially if the restaurant is busy. “Most restaurants will give you a 15-minute grace period, but if they're a busy restaurant that often has a line out the door and people are anxious to sit down, they're going to sit those people down.” Credit card companies often include restaurant discounts in their rewards programs as a means to attract customers, and some high-profile cards even offer exclusive access to heavily booked restaurants."
