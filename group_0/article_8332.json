      "title": "Exercise caution in your use of water and cleaning liquids.",
      "content": "Exercise caution in your use of water and cleaning liquids. Foam mattresses should not be exposed to excessive water, so you need to take a cautious approach when spot cleaning stains. It is easy to get too aggressive when removing stains from a foam mattress, which can have the unintended effect of either pushing stains deeper into the mattress or getting the mattress too wet. If the mattress gets wet, it could easily get mildew. Never saturate the mattress with water or a cleaning agent. Instead of using a steam cleaner or a wet rag, you should use a spray bottle. You are less likely to get the mattress excessively wet if you mist the mattress with a small amount of water using a spray bottle."

      "title": "Choose a cleaning agent.",
      "content": "Choose a cleaning agent. To get stains out of a foam mattress, you will need vinegar, baking soda or an enzymatic commercial cleaner. Another option is to create your own cleaning agent by mixing a few drops of dish soap into 3 tablespoons (24 g) of baking soda and 10 fluid ounces (300 mL) of hydrogen peroxide. Enzymatic cleaners work very well, but vinegar is a trusted option that is also inexpensive. [8] X Research source You can use a mix of half white vinegar and half water in a spray bottle. You can sprinkle baking soda directly on the stain. Follow the directions on the bottle of enzymatic cleaner."
