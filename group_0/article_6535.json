      "content": "Wear clothes that are easy to take off and put on. On the days that you have gym class, make sure you wear stuff that’s easy to get in and out of. Stick to shoes that are easy to lace or slip on, and pants and a top that are easy to take off on gym days. You'll be able to get out of these clothes – and into your gym clothes – quickly. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, skirts with elastic bands, comfortable jeans, pullover shirts, and slip-on flats are great options for gym days. Try to stay away from button-down shirts, multi-layer tops, and tight jeans on gym days."

      "content": "Make sure everything is easily accessible. To get changed into your gym clothes as quickly as possible, you should make sure everything you need is within easy reach. Lay out your gym clothes in your locker in the order you’ll put them on as you take your street clothes off. [2] X Research source For example, lay your gym socks, then your pants, then your shirt down, so your shirt is on top. Take your regular shirt off and put the gym one on. Then take off your regular pants and put on your gym ones."

      "content": "Keep track of your time. If you're changing at school, you probably don't have much time to get changed after gym. You can keep track of your time by using your cell phone or a wristwatch to set a timer."

      "content": "Stick to a minimalist shower. Keep the water temperature a little lower than you usually use at home. Then only wash your body with soap and water, and skip washing your hair. You should also skip shaving, exfoliating, and similar stuff until you get home. [3] X Research source If your hair really feels gross after gym, or if you've been in the pool, try spraying your hair with dry shampoo. It should soak up extra moisture in your hair. You can also dry it with a quick-dry towel."

      "title": "Use wet wipes instead of taking a shower.",
      "content": "Use wet wipes instead of taking a shower. Taking a shower after gym class can take up a bunch of time. If you're short on time, skip the shower! Instead, bring wet wipes with you and wipe yourself down after class. Focus on areas that might get a little stinky when you sweat, like your armpits. This way you get clean, but you save yourself some time and embarrassment. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source You can use regular wet wipes for this option."

      "content": "Save conversations for after you're done changing. If you're in class with a bunch of your friends, you might be tempted to hang out and chat instead of getting changed. You can still chat a bit while you change, but your focus should be on getting out of your gym clothes and into your regular clothes. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep to yourself if you feel shy. Some people in your locker room might not mind talking to each other while they change. If that makes you uncomfortable, it’s okay to keep to yourself while you change. You don’t need to chat with anyone else, and you don’t need to pause while you’re changing to answer anyone’s questions. It saves you time and some privacy. [6] X Research source If someone starts talking to you while you're changing, you can politely say something like \"Hey! Let me get changed really quick and then we can talk.\""

      "content": "Look for a private area to change. Some locker rooms have bathroom stalls that you can access while you’re in the locker room. If you’re really uncomfortable changing in front of others, you can slip into a bathroom stall and change your clothes quickly. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Locker rooms that are attached to pools usually have more showers than regular locker rooms, so you might be able to change there. Keep in mind that sometimes the bathroom stalls might be full of people already. You might not have the time to wait for a stall. If that’s the case, find a quiet corner in the locker room to change. If you're changing at school, ask if students are allowed to change in the restrooms. Some teachers have rules that everyone must change at their locker."

      "content": "Wear your gym clothes under your regular clothes. If there aren’t many options for privacy in your locker room, try wearing your gym clothes under your street clothes. That way, you only have to take off your top layer of clothes before class, and then put them back on when it’s over. [8] X Research source If you're wearing your gym clothes under your regular clothes, make sure you wash them regularly – at least once or twice a week. This might get a little warm during the warmer months, so be prepared for that. If you’re wearing your gym clothes under your regular clothes, bring extra deodorant or body spray. That way you won’t bring the smell of gym class with you into other classes."

      "content": "Ask your school for privacy curtains. A lot of people are uncomfortable changing in front of others, and if you can get a few people to ask with you, it might convince the administration. Ask your principal if it’s possible to get privacy curtains put up in your locker room. If the principal can’t make that decision, you might have to speak to the school board. Write down the reasons you’d prefer that type of privacy and present your case clearly and calmly. [9] X Research source If you're a trans student and need privacy, you should let your school board know. If you have religious reasons for needing privacy, you should bring those up as well."

But everyone’s body looks different and almost no one can live up to the ideals you see on TV. Your body is your body, and it’s fine no matter how it looks! [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Remember that your body is just one among others. You’re not the only one changing in the locker room, although it’s easy to feel that way. But everyone else around you is changing, and they’re probably nervous, too. Just remember that everyone is probably so worried about their own bodies, they’re not paying any attention to yours!

      "content": "Improve your body image . One way to be more confident in the locker room is to improve your body image. Think about the amazing things your body can do – maybe you're really strong, or maybe you can run fast. Also keep in mind that some things about your body you just can't change. If there are things you can change, set yourself some goals for improving them. For example, you can't change how your knees look, or how wide your hips are. You can change how muscular your legs are or how flat your stomach is. Make goals for yourself related to the things you can change."

But try to slow down your changing pace each week. As you feel more comfortable, say hi to people as you change. It might feel uncomfortable at first, but you’ll get used to it eventually. [13] X Research source If you do slow down, make sure you're still keeping track of the time you have to change."
