      "title": "Dimes or other coins",
      "content": "Dimes or other coins After a loved one has died, you may start to notice yourself finding coins here and there, especially dimes or pennies. Many believe this is a sign that your deceased loved one is trying to tell you something, often that you’re following the right path with your life. [1] X Research source Dimes are especially prevalent when your ancestors or more distant relatives want to tell you that they’re watching over you. Coins have been used throughout history in funeral rituals or as symbols of parting, which might explain why they're connected to ADCs."

      "title": "Cardinals",
      "content": "Cardinals Cardinals are said to represent a recently deceased person returning to offer you comfort. Others say that seeing a cardinal means that your loved one has safely reached heaven. Whichever it is, take heart in knowing that they’re safe and sound. Cardinals also commonly serve as a memento mori, or a reminder not to be afraid of death, and also not to be too attached to life."

      "title": "Feathers",
      "content": "Feathers When you find feathers—especially white feathers—in unlikely places (like indoors, where you don’t usually find birds) or where it feels you were meant to see them (like appearing suddenly in your path), it could be a message from beyond. Some say that white feathers belong to angels sent to give comfort to those grieving. [2] X Research source Feathers also symbolize protection and faith—reminders that you’re loved, and to keep your deceased loved ones in mind."

      "title": "Butterflies",
      "content": "Butterflies Butterflies are known for their magnificent transformations from humble caterpillars to ethereal, winged creatures. Seeing a butterfly after someone has passed is often viewed as a sign that that person has transformed, too, from their physical body into a new, spiritual body. [3] X Research source Butterflies also represent strength, or the souls of ancestors . Similarly, dragonflies often symbolize the deceased’s wisdom, and are a reminder to find joy in their passing."

    {
      "title": "Songs on the radio",
      "content": "Songs on the radio Many who are in mourning report hearing songs that their loved one enjoyed on the radio. This sign is especially meaningful when you hear their song soon after thinking about them, or when the song is fairly uncommon. Often, the person is trying to comfort you, or bring you joy in their absence. In a similar vein, you may hear other people use obscure words or phrases that your loved one always used, reminding you that they live on in other people."
    },
    {
      "title": "Photos",
      "content": "Photos Of course, you have plenty of photos of your friends and family members who’ve moved on from this life. But when those photos begin to turn up in unlikely places or shift in their frames on the wall, it may be a sign that that person is trying to contact you. [4] X Research source That person is reminding you to think of them, and to remember the joyful memories you shared."
    },
    {
      "title": "Electricity",
      "content": "Electricity Many people theorize that spirits are made of electromagnetic energy. So when the lights in the room start to flicker or your electric devices go on the fritz, it might be that you’ve been visited by someone from the afterlife. [5] X Research source Let the device act up for a couple minutes—it may lead to a clearer message, like a radio changing stations to a familiar song."
    },
    {
      "title": "Identical faces",
      "content": "Identical faces Sometimes, you might see the face of your loved one superimposed onto someone else’s face. A passing cyclist might glance at you, and you swear you see your late grandmother. [6] X Research source Or your own face in the mirror might briefly flicker into that of a deceased relative’s. It can be alarming at first, but it typically means that person has come back to see you, even if only for a short moment."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sensing a presence",
      "content": "Sensing a presence One of the most common types of communication from the afterlife comes in the form of your intuition. You get a distinct and sure feeling that your loved one is close to you—not just a passing memory. It’s as if they’re there in the room, even if you can’t see or hear them. Some report feeling a weight at the foot of their beds, or choosing a different chair because they have the sense the first is occupied."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hearing voices",
      "content": "Hearing voices Another common type is hearing voices that sound like your lost loved one. Often, it's their voice close to your ear. Other times, their voice may seem far away. [7] X Research source Some believe this is a form of telepathy and that the person is linking with your mind from the afterlife."
    },
    {
      "title": "Feeling a touch",
      "content": "Feeling a touch You might have the sensation of someone touching your skin, especially if you were very close with the person who passed. This might come in the form of a hand slipped into yours, an arm around your shoulder, or a warm hug. Each of these signifies the deceased person offering affection. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Smells",
      "content": "Smells Smells that recall memories of your passed loved ones come in many forms: perfumes they wore often, the smells of their favorite foods, or the smell of their favorite flower. [9] X Research source Smells provide strong links to your memories, and you may feel slightly disoriented when you experience a fragrance you associate with your loved one. Experiencing 2 of these smells back-to-back suggests something more than a coincidence—a strong sign of ADC."

    {
      "title": "Visions",
      "content": "Visions Many recent mourners report experiencing unexplainable visual phenomena—strange lights inside their homes, or seeing their late loved ones manifest in front of them. [10] X Research source Visions are perhaps the most striking ADC type, and are some of the hardest to dismiss. They’re also one of the most common and well-documented."
    },
    {
      "title": "Twilight experiences",
      "content": "Twilight experiences Twilight experiences, or “Alpha state” experiences, come in that slippery state of consciousness between waking and sleeping, such as when you’re meditating, praying, or just getting to sleep or waking up. [11] X Research source This in-between state opens you up to many types of ADC: visions, auditory signs, or even waking dreams of your loved ones."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dreams",
      "content": "Dreams You might see a departed friend or family member in your dreams. But when those dreams are much more vivid and intense than usual, it may actually be an ADC. This form of ADC is unique in that it often allows you to interact freely with your loved one, meeting them in a place not limited by your waking life. [12] X Research source While your typical dreams may be cluttered or confusing, ADC dreams are clear and coherent, and often take place in familiar locations. This type also includes out-of-body ADCs, or the sensation that you’ve left your body to visit the person in a spiritual space."
    },
    {
      "title": "Phone calls",
      "content": "Phone calls There are many stories about people receiving phone calls from the beyond. The phone rings, and when you answer it, a recently deceased friend or family member leaves you a short message. Or, you don’t hear anything, but get the striking sensation that your loved one is on the other end. The call ends, but without a click or a dial tone. Your loved one may also leave a message on your voicemail, or call your phone and hang up before you can answer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Symbols and signs",
      "content": "Symbols and signs This is a much more general type of ADC that varies from person to person. Mostly, it refers to small symbols you see throughout your day that are relevant to your late loved one. This includes photos of them, their favorite number, trinkets that belonged to them, or other objects you associate with their memory."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take note of ADCs, but don’t seek them out.",
      "content": "Take note of ADCs, but don’t seek them out. ADCs are often comforting and even healing to experience. But looking for them everywhere may lead to obsessive behavior, or distract you from your natural, healthy grieving process. Accept ADCs when they come, and thank your loved one for the message, but don’t expect these messages all the time. [13] X Research source ADCs may occur years after a loved one’s death. They might also occur frequently, or only once. Remember that they work on their own schedule. Not everyone experiences ADCs, but that doesn’t mean your loved one is neglecting or ignoring you. Nobody can say for sure why or how ADCs occur—it’s different for each person."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk about your ADC experiences with trusted friends or family.",
      "content": "Talk about your ADC experiences with trusted friends or family. It can be tough to bring up supernatural phenomena to others, but talking with someone about your experiences can help you decode and make sense of them. [14] X Research source Present the experience as something you’d like help with, rather than something you want to convince your confidant of. Say something like, “I’ve recently had an experience I can’t explain and I want help wrapping my mind around it. Can I tell you about it?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Write letters to your deceased loved one to clear your mind.",
      "content": "Write letters to your deceased loved one to clear your mind. One of the hardest parts of losing a loved one is not being able to talk freely with them anymore. But that doesn’t mean you can’t talk to them at all. To help you cope with their passing, write them a letter any time you find you have something you’d like to say to them. [15] X Research source This is a much more reliable and consistent way to externalize your emotions than waiting for an ADC. Keep the letters in a box in your closet, where you don’t have to think about them unless you want to. It may help to keep them with a small collection of your loved one’s belongings. In addition, put together a memorial book full of photos, letters, or other scraps that remind you of your loved one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Share stories of your loved one with your family and friends.",
      "content": "Share stories of your loved one with your family and friends. The best way to keep someone’s memory alive is by talking about them with other people who knew them. By doing this, you remember and acknowledge how much that person meant to you, and how inseparable your lives are, even if their physical life has ended. Organize a memorial service or invite family and friends to contribute written stories to compile into a memorial book."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seek help from a therapist if you become overwhelmed.",
      "content": "Seek help from a therapist if you become overwhelmed. Grieving is a turbulent process that very rarely happens on a neat timeline. When you’re mourning, having what may be an ADC can be more distressing than comforting. If you find that your experiences add to your confusion, or even if you’d just like to talk them through with a professional, visit a therapist or see a grief counselor to discuss your situation. A counselor will help you sort through your loved one’s memory and process their passing. Finding comfort in their absence is what your loved one would want, and is often the very purpose of an ADC."
