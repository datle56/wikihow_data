      "content": "Use a screwdriver to loosen the lower track brackets. If you want to adjust your lower tracks, use a screwdriver or wrench to loosen the screws or nuts holding the lower track brackets in place. Make sure to do this on both the left and right track."

      "title": "Move each track until there is a .25 in (0.64 cm) gap between the door and stop molding.",
      "content": "Move each track until there is a .25 in (0.64 cm) gap between the door and stop molding. With the lower track brackets loosened, you can gently shift the tracks to the left or right, causing the garage door to move. Do this with both tracks until there is a .25 in (0.64 cm) gap between the bottom of the door and the top of the crown molding, indicating that the tracks may be properly aligned. If you have trouble moving the tracks, place a thick piece of wood against the track and tap it with a hammer or mallet. The force should cause the track to shift."

      "title": "Check your tracks with a vertical level.",
      "content": "Check your tracks with a vertical level. In order for your garage door to function as intended, your tracks need to be perfectly level. If they aren't, the door will not open and close properly, potentially leading to unwanted gaps, panel buckling, or door binding."

      "title": "Retighten the track brackets.",
      "content": "Retighten the track brackets. Use your fingers to retighten the screws or bolts holding the lower track brackets in place. Once you've reached finger tightness, meaning you can no longer turn the fasteners by hand, use your screw or wrench to add a few more turns. This will ensure that the fasteners are properly tightened without stripping them. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure your door still opens.",
      "content": "Make sure your door still opens. To be sure that the tracks are properly aligned, open and close your garage door multiple times. If you have an automatic garage door, stand far away while it opens and closes. If you have a manual garage door, be extra cautious in case something was compromised during the adjustment process."

      "title": "Use a screwdriver to loosen the fasteners holding the tracks in place.",
      "content": "Use a screwdriver to loosen the fasteners holding the tracks in place. Using a screwdriver or wrench, loosen up the screws or nuts securing the overhead garage tracks. Depending on which part of the tracks you need to adjust, this may mean the fasteners closest to the door, furthest from the door, or both. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Move the tracks to the position you want them.",
      "content": "Move the tracks to the position you want them. If you're trying to fix misaligned tracks, shift the tracks left or right until they are perpendicular with the vertical tracks. If you're trying to slow down the speed at which your garage door opens, simply raise the tracks up. When you're finished adjusting the tracks, the distance between them and the garage door should be .5 inches (1.3 cm), otherwise the door may stick."

      "title": "Retighten the track fasteners.",
      "content": "Retighten the track fasteners. Using your fingers, tighten the nuts or screws holding the overhead tracks in place. When you can't tighten the fasteners by hand anymore, grab your screwdriver or wrench and turn the fasteners 2 or 3 more times. This will help you prevent unwanted stripping while tightening the fasteners to a safe and secure degree. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Test the door to make sure it works.",
      "content": "Test the door to make sure it works. Open and close the garage door multiple times to make sure it works as expected. In particular, check that the horizontal tracks can support the door while it is in the overhead position. While testing, do not stand underneath the door in case it malfunctions."

      "title": "Put on protective clothing.",
      "content": "Put on protective clothing. While working on your garage door, make sure to wear a long-sleeved shirt, thick pants or jeans, and heavy duty gloves. These will help keep your skin safe from cuts and other injuries."

      "title": "Close the garage door before you start.",
      "content": "Close the garage door before you start. To avoid injuries caused by falling objects, your garage door should be in its vertical position while you are working on the rails. If your door is misaligned and will not shut properly, close it as much as you can. If you have an automatic door that refuses to close, turn off the garage door opener and pull the door shut yourself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn off the garage door opener if necessary.",
      "content": "Turn off the garage door opener if necessary. If you're adjusting the tracks on an automatic garage door, disable the garage door opener before you start working. For most doors, you can do this by simply pulling the emergency release handle located near the front of back of the overhead track. For model specific information, consult your garage door's user manual."
