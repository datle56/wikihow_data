      "content": "Give yourself enough time to take a 15 to 20-minute bath. Baths are not like showers, which are often rushed. Instead, they are meant to take longer, so that the body and mind can relax. To get the most benefit from your bath, plan on spending 15 to 20 minutes in the water. Take a salt bath in the evening if you want to treat insomnia. Many people find that they rest better after a warm salt bath. [1] X Research source Taking a bath in the morning will help purge your body from toxins. Your body releases a lot of toxins while you sleep, pushing them towards the surface of the skin. A morning bath will get rid of these toxins the fastest. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Start filling your bathtub. Choose a temperature that is most comfortable for you. If you are using the salt bath to heal a skin condition, consider making the water no more than two degrees warmer than your body temperature. This will make it easier for your body to absorb the minerals from the salt bath."

      "content": "Add the sea salt while the tap is still running. Holding the salt under the running water will help it dissolve better. If your sea salt came scented, you might even notice a slight fragrance. If the bath salt is colored, you'll notice a slight color change in the water. If you are using the bath for relaxation or for a treat, you'll need about two handfuls, or one-quarter cup (70 grams). If you are using the bath for healing purposes, such as psoriasis, consider using up to 2 pounds (840 grams)."

      "content": "Turn off the tap when the tub is as full as you like it, and agitate the water with your hand. Some salts will dissolve easier than others. In general, the larger the grain size, the longer it will take for it to dissolve. Don't worry if the salt does not dissolve all the way. This could help scrub away dead skin cells."

      "content": "Get into your tub and enjoy the water for 10 to 20 minutes. Lean your head back and close your eyes. If you want, you can even turn on some relaxing music or light a few candles. You can use soap or shower gel to cleanse your body, but sea salt is very cleansing in itself.

      "content": "Drain the tub when you are done, and rinse the saltwater off with fresh water. The easiest way to do this is to simply step into the shower and let the water rinse the salt residue off your skin. Sea salt can leave behind residue on the sides of your tub. After you get out, but before you drain the water, wipe the sides of your tub down using a scrubby sponge."

In a large bowl, combine 2½ cups (700 grams) sea salt with 1 teaspoon of a soap fragrance oil (such as orange blossom) and ½ teaspoon of essential oil (such as lavender). Add 9 tablespoons of dried flowers, such as rose petals, lavender, or calendula. You can use all one type of flower, or a combination.

      "content": "Make a salt scrub. In a jar, combine 1 cup (280 grams) of sea salt, ½ cup (120 milliliters) of almond oil or jojoba oil, and 10 drops of essential oil. Seal the jar tightly until you are ready to use the scrub. This makes enough scrub for 3 uses. [6] X Research source To use the scrub: get into the bath or shower first, then massage a handful of the scrub onto your damp skin. Rinse the scrub off when you are done. Salt scrubs help buff away dead skin cells. They leave your skin feeling soft and nourished. Do not use a sea salt scrub on your face, as it might be too harsh to the sensitive skin of the area. You can use any essential oil you like, but lavender, eucalyptus, or mint will go best with salt."
