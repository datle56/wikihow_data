      "content": "Select your bricks. There are many varieties of brick, but they all fall into three main categories: Severe weathering (SW) bricks can withstand direct contact with the ground and moisture. Use these for foundations, patios, garden walls, and so on. Medium weathering (MW) bricks can withstand freezing temperatures and above ground exterior work (not direct ground contact). No weathering (NW) bricks are for interior work only."

      "title": "Purchase the right amount of bricks.",
      "content": "Purchase the right amount of bricks. Bricks come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but the most important thing to remember is that you must adjust the size bricks you buy to account for the mortar. The most common brick, a modular brick, has \"specified\" dimensions 3⅝\" wide, 2¼\" tall, and 7⅝\" long (even if they are sold under nominal whole number measurements). They are typically used with mortar joints ½\" thick. Taking the mortar into account, each brick will take up 4⅛\" x 2¾\" x 8¼\" of space. You must add the mortar measurements when planning your wall. The combination measurement of brick and mortar is called the brick's \"nominal\" size. [1] X Research source Three rows of bricks stacked on top of each other will be 8\" tall. For example, to make a wall 2 ft tall x 6 ft long, calculate (24\" / 2¾\") for height and (72\" / 8¼\") for length, rounding up. In this case, you'll need 81 bricks, 9 rows tall x 9 bricks long. Purchase at least five extra bricks to cut in half to begin new rows, plus an additional one brick per row in case of damaged bricks. If the ground is uneven or sloped, plan to install an additional one or two rows of bricks below the finished grade level to create a level base."

      "title": "Dig out a trench for your foundation.",
      "content": "Dig out a trench for your foundation. You need to dig out a trench to seat the wall in, which you then make solid with a layer of concrete. This is often called a footer, or concrete foundation. Dig out a rectangular trench the length and width of your planned wall, roughly 1 foot deep. If your wall is more than 2 feet tall, you may need a deeper or wider trench. If the \"footer\" you install (as described below) is not strong enough to support the wall, the wall can sag or collapse. You can look up recommended dimensions online based on your soil's load bearing capacity and the size of your project. [2] X Research source Make sure the footer will have good water drainage away from the wall. Water pooling around the footer can cause wall failure."

      "title": "Drive level wooden stakes into your trench.",
      "content": "Drive level wooden stakes into your trench. Take several wooden stakes and drive them into the soil so that the tops of them are all level. Find the nominal height of your bricks (the height of the bricks plus 1/2\" for mortar), then drive the posts so that they are all this height below the top of the trench. Use a level to ensure that the tops of the stakes are completely level. [3] X Research source For this example, with 2-2/3\" bricks, you would want 2-2/3\" of space between the top of your guide posts and the lip of the trench. This is so the first row of bricks is completely seated in your foundation. Space these posts 2-4 feet apart, depending on the length of your wall."

The concrete needs 2-3 days to dry and set, so use this time to start gathering supplies and preparing your measurements. [4] X Research source Use a finishing trowel to make sure the top of the concrete is smooth and level before it starts drying. You can notch a \"keyway joint\" or \"V\" into the middle of the footer to help interlock it into the mortar bed."

      "content": "Make your guideposts. Also called gauging rods, these will ensure that your wall is level. Take 2 long wooden boards or posts and measure out each row of the brick wall, also known as a course. Mark the boards where each brick should be, including the mortar lines. Make sure you can drive the posts into the ground so that they can be freestanding. They should be as tall as your wall will be. For the 2x6ft wall, make a mark 2-1/4\" up from the bottom -- this is the height of the first brick. Make another mark 1/2\" above that, then continue this pattern up to the top of the wall, here 2 feet high. You want two of these, one for each side of the wall. These rods will be the rulers for your wall, and need to be identically lined up. Use a level and your tape measure to make sure the wall is immaculately planned."

This must be kept \"true\" for a solid, level wall without major structural issues.

Press it into place against to the first brick and use your tape measure to make sure they are 1/2\" apart and joined by mortar. This is a very important step that ensures a strong bond between bricks. If you skip this and try to fill the mortar in between laid bricks, the joint will eventually fail.

Instead of alternating half bricks with full ones you simply need to alternate turning each brick on the ends, since 1 brick is as long as the width of two bricks. Every other row would begin with a brick that faces perpendicular to the direction of the wall, helping you keep the joints staggered. To help you remember where to place the bricks, think of how the wall looks when you're facing it.
