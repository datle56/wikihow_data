It’s really easy to do, and it’s a fun option if you want a fresh start or to just switch things up. For example, maybe you just changed schools and you want a cool nickname when you make brand new friends. Just remove one of the last syllables in your first name.

      "content": "Add an “-ie,” “i,” or a “y” to the shortened version of your first name. It’s pretty common to have this type of nickname given to you in childhood, but lots of teens and even adults use this little trick. If your first name only has 1 syllable, then this method makes it sound catchier. You may need to add an extra consonant to get the right “look” when you spell out your nickname. Charles→Charlie; Jennifer→Jenni; Lucía→Lucy Daniel→Danny; Aaliyah→Ally; Mathias→Matty"

      "title": "Sneak in a silent “e” at the end of your first name.",
      "content": "Sneak in a silent “e” at the end of your first name. This tactic makes your nickname sound a little more mature, but it also keeps everything friendly. Use the first syllable of your first name, then add an “e” to the end of it. Since the \"e\" is silent, you won't hear it, so you'll emphasize the last consonant instead. You might also swap out one consonant for another one to get a more classic nickname. [2] X Research source Michael→Mike Kathleen→Kate"

      "title": "Make a nickname out of a middle or final syllable in your first name.",
      "content": "Make a nickname out of a middle or final syllable in your first name. It just depends on what calls out to you—does one of the middle syllables of your first name have a nice ring to it, or does the final syllable seem a lot more fun? After you make your choice, see if you prefer to throw out any consonants you don’t want or add vowels like “-ie,” “i,” or “y.” [3] X Research source Frederick→Rick/Ricky; Elizabeth→Beth Patrick→Trick Anthony→Tony"

      "content": "Draw from your family's traditions to form your nickname. If you like history or want to honor your culture, use one of the “diminutives”—shortened versions—of your first name that have been passed down over time. Ask people in your family about any conventions they’re aware of, or look through a name book to read about the meaning and origin of your first name. [4] X Research source One Middle English fad was to add and swap letters to make a nickname. [5] X Research source Henry→Hank; Edward→Ted Many Spanish “diminutives” end in “-ita” (for girls) or “-ito” (for boys). [6] X Research source Guadalupe→Lupita; Juan→Juanito In India, many people use the first syllable of their name and add a \"u.\" Namrata→Namu; Ashwini→Ashu"

Give your name an edge with some inspo from Terminator —just take the first syllable of your first name, then add the suffix \"-inator\" to it. Or, if you want a cuter vibe, use the first syllable of your first name, replace a vowel if you want to, and include the suffix \"-boo.\" [7] X Research source Sadira→Sadi-boo Tao-Yi→Tao-inator Pull from affectionate suffixes from your culture, too: for example, in Japan, if your SO or best friend adds the suffix \"-chan\" to your first name, it means they really like you.

If your parents were extra creative and gave you more than one middle name, decide if you want to use both or just one of them. Sometimes, you might just want to go by a middle name if you want to be “low profile” in a new place, like a house party in another city.

Sometimes, this kind of nickname is just one you roll with. Someone else in your class or your social circle might have your first name, but your last name helps set you apart. In some cases, your last name is just really short and simple, so you find it super convenient as a nickname. [11] X Research source Benjamin Lee→Lee Catherine Albright→Albright Rosa Beck→Beck"

Or, choose any combination of initials that you think really roll off the tongue. Most of the time, people use their initials if their nickname ends with an “ay” sound (like “MK”) or an “ee” sound (like “LD”), but there’s no hard and fast rule. Some people even go by just their first initial. [12] X Research source Thomas James→TJ Mary Katherine→MK Lawrence Adam Desai→LD Bellatrix Lestrange→B"

Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series, when Tom Marvolo Riddle creates the anagram “I am Lord Voldemort” out of his original name. It definitely takes some time and creativity to create an anagram, but it’s a fun activity that ends in a unique nickname. [13] X Research source Diana→Nadia Cleo→Cole Kaleb→Blake Corey→Royce"

For example, turn “Axel” into “Ax-Wielder,” “Sal” into “Salamander,” or “Ryan” into “Rhinoceros.” There are all kinds of ways you can play around with your name to make your friends laugh. [14] X Research source Use “alliteration” by making a nickname with the first letter of your name. Hermione→Humble Hermione; Ronald→Radical Ronald Pick a word that rhymes with one of your names. Zoe→Cozy Zoe; Jackson→Relaxin’ Jackson Draw from the original meaning of your name or a word related to it. Sai is Burmese for “lord,” so go for a nickname like Duke.

To avoid being insensitive, even if it’s an accident, keep these manners in mind: [24] X Research source If you're unsure about whether a nickname is ok, try it out in a one-on-one setting. This makes sure that the other person feels safe and has a chance to say if they don’t like the nickname. If you are having trouble figuring out your friend's reaction, ask, \"Did I make you uncomfortable when I called you Tina just now?\" If their answer is “yes,” then thank them for their honesty and don’t use the nickname in the future.
