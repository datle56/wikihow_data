Check out the levels of each gym leader below to see where you should be—you want most of your party of 6 Pokémon to be at or above the level of the gym leaders to be assured of victory."

      "content": "Be diverse with your party. Build your party with dual-type Pokémon. A dual-type is a Pokémon with two primary types like Magneton, who is Electric and Steel Type, rather than just one type like Pikachu, who is only electric type. When you use dual-type Pokémon, they have the ability to learn two or more different types of moves. The more dual type Pokémon you have, the more move types you have under your belt. You want to cover your weaknesses. If you are wondering what Pokémon are strong/weak against other types, check out this comprehensive chart."

      "content": "Understand STAB bonuses. Make sure that the Pokémon you use is the same type as the move you want to use. This makes your move 25% more effective. For example, a water type move done with a water type Pokémon is more effective against rock than a grass type Pokémon using that same water type move, if it can even be learned.

      "content": "Keep an eye on items. Throughout the game, you should be collecting items, whether as part of scripted events or by scavenging stray Poké Balls. Certain items can be given to Pokémon to increase certain attributes or to help in battle. Try and have all of your Pokémon holding a helpful item. You'll need to purchase several potions and revives at the Poké Mart. It's best to be smart about whether to use regular, super, hyper, or max potions depending on how much money you have and what each of your Pokémons' max hp's are. These helpful items can give you that extra edge during battle. [2] X Research source"

If you started with a fire-type Pokémon, you may need to train your other Pokémon extra hard. Rock types are weak to Grass, Water, Ground, Steel and Fighting. Rock types are strong to Flying, Bug, Fire and Ice, so avoid using these Pokémon when possible. [3] X Research source"

Electric types are weak to Ground (Ground is immune to Electric) They are strong against Water and Flying."

Fire Pokémon have a variety of weaknesses that are easily covered by common Pokémon, but a water Pokémon is usually your best bet. Your Pokémon should be able to fight against level 26-28 Pokémon.
