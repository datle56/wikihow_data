With your limited free account, you can upload and annotate as many PDFs as you need. This is the easiest free solution that everyone can use, whether you have a Mac, Chromebook, or Windows computer. It's only text-based, so if you want to circle, highlight, or draw on PDFs, use another method. This is the best Chromebook option since you don't need to download anything and can simply use your browser. This method also works for Android, iPhone, and iPad. While an account is free with limited functionality, a subscription allows you to do more with Adobe Acrobat , like installing the desktop app. You can get a free trial if you want to use the program for more than annotating PDFs."
