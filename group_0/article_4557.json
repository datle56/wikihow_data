You can use any resource (e.g., dirt or sand) to do this, but the wall must be two blocks tall in order to prevent the horses from running away. If you have enough fencing material in your inventory, you can use that to enclose the horses instead of using blocks. You might want to leave some extra room in the enclosure since you'll be adding a third horse to the mix shortly."

If you don't yet have a Crafting Table, make one before proceeding."

This process will vary slightly depending on your platform: PC — Open your Crafting Table, click the stack of gold bars, right-click twice each box in the Crafting Table except for the center one, place both apples in the center box, and move the two gold apples into your inventory. Mobile — Open your Crafting Table, tap the magnifying glass icon on the left side of the screen, and tap twice the gold apple icon.
