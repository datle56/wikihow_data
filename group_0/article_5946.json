      "content": "Place a nest box in the mother’s enclosure. The nest box should be made of metal or wood with a removable floor. Choose a box that’s slightly larger than the mother—if it’s too big, the kits may not stay warm enough. Put a clean towel in the bottom of the box, and on top of that, fill the box about 2/3 of the way with fertilizer- and pesticide-free grass, straw, or hay as bedding. [1] X Research source Make sure the towel you use doesn’t have any stray threads or holes—these could trap the kits. If you don’t want to buy a nest box, you can make one out of a cardboard box—choose one that’s just a little larger than the mother rabbit and cut an opening that’s just big enough for her to get in and out of. Leave a 1 in (2.5 cm) at the bottom of the box to keep the kits inside the box."

      "content": "Check to make sure the kits are alive after the doe gives birth. Your doe won’t need any help with the birthing process, which usually happens at night or in the very early hours of the morning. As soon as you suspect your doe has given birth—or kindled—check to see if any of the kits did not survive the birth. You may have to draw the mother away with a treat to get access to the nest box to remove any dead kits. [2] X Research source The doe will typically consume the placenta, so you don’t need to do anything with that. Briefly inspecting the kits will usually not cause the mother to abandon them, especially if she’s accustomed to your scent. If the mother gave birth to any of the kits outside of the nest box, gently lift them and place them back with the rest of the litter so they can get warm again. If a kit is very cold or stiff, place a hot water bottle filled with warm water under the towel and bedding in the nest box."

      "content": "Check the kits for full bellies to see if they’re nursing. Don’t be alarmed if you don’t actually see the doe nursing the kits. Nursing typically only happens once or twice a day for about 5 minutes at a time. Instead, look for signs that she’s nursed—the babies will be warm and have round tummies from feeding. They’ll also be quiet instead of making mewling noises like a kitten if they’re well fed. [3] X Research source Because rabbits are prey animals, the doe’s natural instinct is to stay away from the nest most of the time. In the wild, this helps draw predators away from the nest."

      "title": "Provide the mother with constant access to food and water.",
      "content": "Provide the mother with constant access to food and water. The doe will need constant access to food and water to eat at will while she’s nursing the kits. This is to ensure she produces enough milk to adequately feed the litter. Put out plenty of fresh food daily and check her water often, as she’ll drink more than normal as well. [4] X Research source Ensuring that she receives proper nutrition will also help reduce the possibility of the mother cannibalizing the kits."

      "content": "Monitor the bunnies’ development, but limit handling for the first 4 weeks. For the first few weeks, the doe should provide the kits with all the care they need. As long as they’re healthy, only handle the kits when you have to move them to clean the nest box. Here’s what to expect after they’re born: Week 1: The kits will be hairless, blind, and deaf when they’re born. After about 5 days, they’ll be able to hear. Week 2: The bunnies should start opening their eyes around day 10, and by the end of the second week, they’ll start developing fuzz. Weeks 3–4: At this point, it’s okay to briefly pick up the kits to get them used to being handled—but don’t hold them for too long, as it could cause them to be stressed. Weeks 5–7: The baby bunnies will be more independent at this point. Handle them regularly so they’ll be acclimated to human interaction."

      "title": "Clean the nest box every day.",
      "content": "Clean the nest box every day. The babies will toilet in the box until they are strong enough to eventually climb out of it on their own, so you’ll need to clean the box daily, providing a new, dry bottom towel and clean bedding. [5] X Research source Most nest boxes have a removable bottom for easy cleaning. Carefully lift the kits out of the box, placing them in a cozy spot of the mother’s hutch while you clean out the nesting box. When you’re finished, put the babies back in the box. Care for the doe like you normally would, including cleaning her pen daily."

      "content": "Turn the nest box on its side after 2 weeks so the kits can explore. Once you see the babies starting to climb in and out of the nest box, turn it on its side to make it easier for them to move around. They’ll start exploring their enclosure, and the doe can get on top of the nesting box if she needs a break from the litter. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Introduce food after 2 weeks and allow the kits to wean naturally.",
      "content": "Introduce food after 2 weeks and allow the kits to wean naturally. Once the kits start exploring, they’ll likely start tasting their mother’s pellet food. Over the next few weeks, the babies will slowly decrease nursing and increase their consumption of pellets. However, it’s important that they continue to nurse as well as the mother’s milk provides antibodies against pathogens. If they are weaned too soon, their immune systems might not yet be strong enough without these antibodies. Call your vet right away if the rabbits develop diarrhea—baby bunnies are prone to bacterial infections in the digestive tract, and these can quickly become fatal. [7] X Research source During this time, the babies may consume some of the doe’s night droppings, called cecotropes. This is a natural process that helps introduce healthy bacteria into the kits’ digestive systems. And according to Rassin, it helps provide the rabbits with essential vitamins and minerals. Don’t give the baby rabbits greens until they’re fully grown due to the potential for digestive complications. You can try tiny bits of one item at a time starting around two months, but remove it from the rabbit’s diet immediately if it causes intestinal problems such as diarrhea."

      "title": "Remove the kits from their mother by the time they’re 8 weeks old.",
      "content": "Remove the kits from their mother by the time they’re 8 weeks old. Rabbits can be weaned as early as 5 weeks, but it’s best to let them stay with their mother until they’re about 8 weeks old. By the time they’re 8 weeks old, though, male kits are mature enough to potentially mate, so they should be separated from their mother and female kits at this point. To tell the sex of a rabbit , carefully hold it with one hand under its chest and one hand under its bottom, with its back firmly against your chest. Carefully part the fur above its genitals and press gently—if you see an opening near the anus, the rabbit is a female, and if it’s a male, the sex organ will emerge just above the anus.

      "title": "Contact your vet immediately if the mother isn’t nursing.",
      "content": "Contact your vet immediately if the mother isn’t nursing. If the babies are weak (barely respond to being handled), have sunken tummies or wrinkly skin, or seem cold and bluish, then the mother isn’t properly nursing them. Reach out to your vet—they may be able to help stimulate the mother to produce milk and can give you instructions on how to bottle-feed the babies if necessary. [9] X Research source Also contact your vet if the litter has more than eight kits, as this may be too large a number for the mother to support all of them. Hand-feeding baby rabbits should only be done in an emergency situation when you’re absolutely sure the doe isn’t feeding the kits—like if they’re obviously struggling or the mother has died."

      "content": "Make replacement milk from goat milk and kitten milk. Mix 1 ⁄ 2 cup (0.12 l) of fresh goat milk, 1 ⁄ 2 cup (0.12 l) of kitten milk replacer (KMR), 1/2 tsp (1 ml) of heavy cream, and 1 tbsp (10 emptied capsules) of freeze-dried colostrum . Gently heat the mixture up to about 105 °F (41 °C) so the kits will be more likely to accept the formula. [10] X Research source You may be able to find powdered colostrum locally at a health food store. This is an essential addition for newborn bunnies that have never fed from their mother."

      "content": "Pour the replacement milk into a sterilized syringe. To sterilize the equipment you’ll use to feed the baby kits, place the syringe and nipple into a steam sterilization bag . Follow the instructions on the bag—usually, you’ll place it into the microwave or over a pot of boiling water for a certain amount of time to kill any bacteria that could harm the kits. [11] X Research source Use a nursing nipple designed for rabbits or squirrels. The nipples meant for feeding kittens are too big for baby rabbits. If your local pet store only sells the kind for kittens, use that and order baby rabbit syringes and nipples right away so they’ll arrive as quickly as possible. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold a kit on your lap and slowly drip milk onto its mouth.",
      "content": "Hold a kit on your lap and slowly drip milk onto its mouth. Wrap the bottle in a soft washcloth to mimic the mother’s body, then hold the bottle in one hand and the kit in the other hand. The kit may suckle from the nipple, but more often, you’ll need to just drip a single drop of milk onto the kit’s mouth so it can lick away the formula. This can be a slow process, so be patient. Never try to force formula into the kit’s mouth—it can aspirate the liquid. Over time, the babies should get stronger and accept the formula more eagerly. For the first week, give each kit around 2 cc (2 ml) of formula twice a day. Over the next week, increase that to 5–7 cc/ml per feeding. When the kits are 2 weeks old, give them 7–13 cc/ml per feeding, and increase that to 13–15 per feeding when they’re 3–6 weeks old."

      "content": "Find a donor for cecotropes when the kits are 3 weeks old. It’s not a pleasant part of rabbit rearing, but if you’re hand-feeding kits, you’ll need to obtain cecotropes, or night droppings, from a donor rabbit. These nighttime droppings are rich in nutrients and beneficial bacteria that are essential for the baby rabbits’ healthy development. Once you get the cecotropes, mix them into a small amount of formula. [13] X Research source You may need to offer cecotropes several times over the next few weeks. Ask your vet if they know of anyone who would be willing to donate cecotropes."

If the kits aren’t being cared for by their mother, dip a cotton ball in warm water and rub it across the kits’ bottoms to encourage them to go to the bathroom.

Offer pellet foods starting when the kits are about 2–3 weeks old, but don’t expect them to be fully weaned until they’re about 8 weeks old. Some kits will transition to solid food without much help, but if they still look for formula at that point, dilute the formula with about 25% for a few days, gradually adding more water until the kits stop showing interest.

      "content": "Feed the mother a quality pellet that’s 15–17% protein. A normal adult rabbit needs a feed that’s about 12% protein, but if your doe is expecting, give her a pellet that contains about 15% protein instead. If you don’t want to buy multiple feeds, opt for one that contains 16–17% protein , since that’s what she’ll need when she’s nursing. [16] X Research source Ideally, the feed should also contain about 18–22% fiber and 3% or less of fat. [17] X Research source Feed your doe about 4–6 oz (110–170 g) of pellets a day while she’s pregnant, 12–16 oz (340–450 g) a day for the first 3–5 days after she gives birth, and free access to food while she’s nursing. The doe should also have constant access to clean water, which you should change two to three times per day. You can supplement her diet while she is gestating and weaning the kits (babies) by giving her alfalfa hay or cubes to provide more protein. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Separate the doe from the male rabbit. It is uncommon for the male rabbit to harm the baby rabbits, or kits. However, the male can impregnate the female again as soon as she gives birth, resulting in another pregnancy before she finishes weaning the first litter. To avoid this, you should separate the two rabbits as birthing draws closer. [19] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the nest box in the enclosure 28 days after breeding, if possible.",
      "content": "Put the nest box in the enclosure 28 days after breeding, if possible. If you know about when your rabbit was bred, plan ahead. Rabbit pregnancies usually last about 31–33 days, but it’s a good idea to put the box in a few days early in case the doe gives birth early. Don’t put it in earlier than that, though, or the box could become contaminated. [20] X Research source The female might rearrange the bedding in the box or even pull out some of her fur to add to the bedding. This is fine and is usually a sign that the birth is close. Place the cage in a quiet, darkened space. Too much activity around the mother and her new kits will cause her undue stress."
