      "content": "Try using a VPN or proxy service. There are several paid and free options for VPNs and proxies, so feel free to use one that fits your budget and that you trust. The important thing is that VPNs and proxies spoof your IP address, which might help you get past ChatGPT's rate limit error. If you already use a VPN or proxy, try changing your IP location or disconnecting from it altogether to see if that fixes the issue."

Then, shut down your computer, unplug your modem and router (or combination device) from the wall, and wait for five minutes. After five minutes have passed, plug your modem and router back in and restart your PC. Check your IP address via Google to see if it has changed. If your IP didn't change after 5 minutes, you may need to leave your modem and router unplugged for longer for your ISP to assign a new IP address."
