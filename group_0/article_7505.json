You should not invert the second author’s name.

Next, add a comma and the “&” symbol, and then type the next author’s last name and initials. Write out the year of publication in parentheses. After this, type the italicized book title, capitalizing only the first words of the title and subtitle. End with the location, a colon, and the publisher.

If there are just 2, separate them with “&.” If there are between 3 and 5, separate all of the last names with commas and add “&” before the final author’s last name.

For sources with more than 1 author, include the first listed author’s name (first name first, last name second) and a comma. Next, add the second and third authors’ names and the italicized book title. (Don’t italicize article titles; these appear in quotation marks.) Finally, type out the publication location, publisher, and date of publication in parentheses. [11] X Research source For example: “Robert J. Cottrol, Raymond T. Diamond, and Leland B. Ware, Brown v. Board of Education: Caste, Culture, and the Constitution (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2003).” If you’re citing particular page numbers, these will go at the end of the citation. Add a comma after the parentheses, type out the page numbers, and then close the citation with a period. For Chicago style, you’ll use footnotes instead of in-text citations. These are full bibliographic citations that appear at the bottom of the page where you’ve referenced a text. [12] X Research source"

Type the authors’ names with their last name first and the first letter of their first and middle names second. Next, provide the book title in italics. Finally, write out the location and name of publisher, along with the date of publication. [16] X Research source For example: “Cottrol, RJ, Diamond, RT, and Ware, LB. Brown v. Board of Education: Caste, Culture, and the Constitution . Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas; 2003.” The author and title should both be followed by periods. The publication location needs to include the city and state (or city and country if it’s outside the U.S.), and it should be followed by a colon. Use a semicolon to separate the publisher’s name and the date of publication. Article titles aren’t italicized, and they don’t appear within quotation marks.
