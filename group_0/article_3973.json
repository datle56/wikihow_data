      "content": "Avoid binding with tape or elastic bandages. A common sight in the media is the transgender boy who has tape or an ACE bandage wrapped around his chest, trying to bind his chest down. Never use these at any cost. Tape is very bad for the skin, and bandages are designed to compress, so every time you take a breath, you'll be constricting your lungs and ribcage. Using either of these materials to bind can result in chest pain, torn skin, broken ribs, severe lung problems, or even a fatal punctured lung. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source If you damage your ribs during binding, you may be unable to get top surgery later. If you have absolutely no other choice than to use a bandage, do not wear it for more than an hour. Never use tape under any circumstances. Tape can rip your nipples off. Even if you put tape over an old shirt instead of on your skin, it's not safe. [3] X Research source Some people may suggest binding with saran wrap (plastic wrap). Avoid doing this. Saran wrap isn't breathable, and will leave you swimming in your own sweat, as well as still having the same dangers that come with using a bandage."

      "title": "Use the camisole technique.",
      "content": "Use the camisole technique. In a pinch, this technique can be good because it's cheap, easy, and does not constrict your chest very much. Get hold of a snug camisole with a built-in no-cup bra. There should be a band of elastic that rests right below your breasts. Put the camisole on backwards, shorten the straps, and position the elastic across the largest part of your breasts (most likely right across the nipples). Fold the bottom of the camisole up twice, and make sure the back and front are even. You can also put a second camisole on the same way for added flatness. This method may not work if your chest is larger than a B-cup."

      "content": "Use sports bras. A safe way that discreetly makes your chest appear flatter is wearing sports bras. [4] X Expert Source Shahpar Mirza Community Transgender Expert Expert Interview. 3 March 2020. Buy a bra or two. Try them on; make sure they're properly sized and that they are comfortable. You can also wear two, with the second one inside out. It sounds odd, but it works for some. Unlike binders, sports bras can be used for as long as you want, as they don't provide much compression around your ribs. If you plan on going somewhere for a long time, consider wearing a sports bra rather than a binder. Wearing two sports bras at the same time works for some people. (However, it's not safe to do a binder and a sports bra, or to double-bind with anything but a sports bra. [5] X Research source ) A too-tight sports bra can compress your ribs much more than a binder can. [6] X Research source Worn too tight or all day, a sports bra can cause permanent damage, so remember that the safety rules still apply to you."

They are safe and can be bought from the internet; they come in different sizes and can make you look and feel much better. The average cost of a chest binder varies between websites, but well-known companies such as Underworks and gc2b will range from thirty to sixty US dollars. If you can't afford one, try searching for sites that will donate new or used binders and apply to receive one, or check out clothing swap sites for trans people. Do careful research on the binder you want to buy. Some binders are no better than bandages. There are plenty of reviews on websites and social media (Tumblr is a good source for this due to its large community of transgender and nonbinary members). If in doubt, stick to a more well-known company, even if it costs more."

However, double-binding can have the same effect of wearing a binder that's too small, or a bandage; it can result in minor injury, rib breakage, or so forth. If your binder doesn't do a good job on its own, you may want to just try a different brand or type of binder."

Sports bras can easily go through the normal wash cycle, but binders are a little more complicated; they often need to be washed in cold water, then hung out to air-dry. Check the website of where you purchased the binder to find out if there are any specific washing instructions. You may be able to wash your binder in the sink, using soap, detergent, or shampoo. If you only have one binder, you may not want to wash it every day, which is fine. Just make sure that your binder doesn't smell. Use deodorant, spray the binder with a scent remover like Febreeze, and consider wearing a thin and breathable shirt under your binder to reduce sweat and odor."

It's most often used by transgender men or nonbinary people, who may have to bind their breasts down, but it's also sometimes used by cisgender (non-transgender) men who have gynecomastia , or enlarged breasts due to excess fat and breast tissue. [20] X Expert Source Shahpar Mirza Community Transgender Expert Expert Interview. 3 March 2020. Binding for extended periods of time will break down the breast tissue, creating \"floppy\" breasts, so it's not a good idea for cisgender women who just want their breasts to appear smaller .

Try starting with a half tank binder, instead of a full tank one. These are easier to take on and off, and are a good choice for beginners. [23] X Research source It's possible to get stuck in your binder if you're new to binding. Practice taking it on and off first, with a loved one nearby to help if you get trapped.

People might just think that you have really big pectoral muscles from working out a lot. A \"masculine chest\" does not auto-equal a flat chest. Never judge your chest size by looking down. You don't have good perspective from above your chest. Instead, look in the mirror."
