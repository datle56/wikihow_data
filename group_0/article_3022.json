      "content": "Keep yourself clean. It is always important to keep yourself nice and fresh and have good hygiene. Take a shower every day while using a sweet-smelling body wash. After exiting the shower, top yourself off with some lotion so that your skin can stay soft."

      "title": "Get fantastic hair.",
      "content": "Get fantastic hair. Hair is one thing that everyone looks at; wear it naturally, however you wish to, but make sure it looks as if you walked out of the salon. Wash your hair everyday or every other day. If you have African/curly hair, wash once a week or whatever works for you. Find out what works best for your hair. If you need to, use products that add shine, volume, and most of all can stay. Always comb and brush your hair. Work with your natural hair texture. For example, if you have waves or curls, invest in a curl-defining mousse or cream to keep them pretty and to prevent frizz. Or if your hair is naturally straight, use a straightener in the morning and a shine spray to keep it from becoming limp and lifeless."

      "title": "Dress in flattering and gorgeous clothes.",
      "content": "Dress in flattering and gorgeous clothes. You should always wear clothes that fit you. Not too big, not too small, not too long, and not too short. If you have a slim figure, wear jeans or even if you have a curvy figure wear long skirts. And always make sure that your clothes are clean."

      "content": "Try going for silver or gold jewelry. Try rings, necklaces, bracelets, (etc.) to bring the best out in you. But don't try to put on too much or it will look tacky."

    {
      "title": "Shine your skin.",
      "content": "Shine your skin. The first thing people look at is your face, which means you should have great skin. Buy a body lotion for your arms and hands. Wash your face with a mild wash, tone it, and moisturize it. If you have acne try seeing a doctor if the results do not show within 3 months. Don't forget to drink at least 8 glasses of water (64oz.) a day to help your skin glow and to get rid of toxins. Exfoliate at least twice a week."

      "title": "Keep your nails pretty.",
      "content": "Keep your nails pretty. Make sure that they are healthy. If not, people will be turned off easily. If you want to hide it then get them done at a salon. A nice French manicure or whatever helps you find your inner diva."

    {
      "title": "Stay healthy.",
      "content": "Stay healthy. Last but not least, you want to keep your insides as well as your outsides clean. Eat lots of fruits and veggies. Drink water very often too. And work out 3-5 times a week for 30–90 minutes. This is very important and the golden rule to looking great."

    {
      "title": "Use makeup if you're allowed to wear some.",
      "content": "Use makeup if you're allowed to wear some. Don't be afraid to get bold with it! Go to the store and buy makeup items (such as mascara, foundation, lip liner, eyeliner, blush, etc.) that you are willing to wear. Each day, wear your makeup differently. For example, one day go for a natural look with lip gloss, and the next day some sparkly eyeshadow. Whatever you decide to do, keep it looking gorgeous."

    {
      "title": "Get a good night's worth of sleep.",
      "content": "Get a good night's worth of sleep. 7–10 hours is best. Lack of sleep will cause dark circles, laziness, weight gain and an ugly look for you."

    {
      "title": "Wear lip gloss.",
      "content": "Wear lip gloss. A true Diva always looks her best and this can be accomplished with a single item. Lip gloss instantly makes your whole face look wide awake and makes you look good without needing a lot of makeup. Carry lip gloss and apply it frequently during the day to maintain your great Diva style."

    {
      "title": "Become a sassy version of yourself.",
      "content": "Become a sassy version of yourself. You have to take some pride and show your personality. But remember to be polite to others. Don't talk back to your teacher or parents. If you have sass, when you walk down the hall at school or someplace public, everyone should be looking at you."

    {
      "title": "Be proud of your type!",
      "content": "Be proud of your type! Look up Angelina Jolie, Mariah Carey, Beyoncé, Denise Richards, Jennifer Lopez, Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, and Ariana Grande. These divas are all talented, confident, gorgeous and beautiful, but they all look totally different from one another. They don't have the same faces, bodies, skin, hair, or style. But they have no problem with it! So, do what you can to make yourself happier about yourself and your hidden talents. In the end, people will notice you for the gifts you bring to the world."
