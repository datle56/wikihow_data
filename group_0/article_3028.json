      "content": "Stay up on the trends in the industry. Watch what celebs and designers are wearing, and try to recreate those looks into your daily outfits as a fashionista. Try not to copy the looks exactly, but try to put your spin on things. Knowing what’s coming can help you buy trendy clothes before stores realize they can charge you twice as much as those clothes are worth. Look for things you've never seen before and wouldn't necessarily buy at first–they might be the next big thing."

Fashion magazines are one of the classic touchstones of being a fashionable person. Particularly look out for magazines like Vogue or Marie Claire where the photography of the adverts can be as informative as the articles themselves. Magazines can give you some basic information about the fashion world. Carefully examine the details on photos. What is in now and what is not? Pay attention to the way people style the clothing to inspire your own styling choices. Can't afford to subscribe to that many fashion magazines? Read them at the bookstore, or head to the library and check out their subscription."

By the time you figure out what's trendy and start dressing like other people, it'll be old hat. You don't have to look like the trend-setters out there, and you shouldn't want to. Aim to have your own style."

      "content": "Get some solid essentials. Don’t just go out and buy a bunch of really cool pieces that match with one thing in your closet. You will soon feel that you are running out of clothes when truthfully you just bought a ton of statement pieces like a cool floral skirt with no plain tops to match it with. Get things like camisoles, plain sweaters and cardigans, a plain skirt, and a few neutral-colored dresses, so you'll have as many options as possible to match. If you aren't quite ready for wild colors, just go with black and neutrals to make sure you'll have choices."

Even a simple pair of form-fitting jeans with a cute top can look suddenly spiced up with a surprising pair of pumps. Shoes should be cute and comfortable, and you should have a variety of them to spice up your different looks. Boots elongate the leg and make you look super toned. Boots also work almost all year long. They're classic and won’t go out of style. A cute but casual pair of flats is important for any wardrobe. That does not mean running sneakers. Invest in a great pair of heels that will last a long time. Then you can get other ones you just like for some special occasions."

      "content": "Shop smart. Fashion's a great hobby, as long as you can afford it. If you're on a budget, it's important to set a particular amount out of your funds that you're allowed to spend on money per month and stay strictly in that limit. You don't have to sacrifice style for cash, though, and you can learn to find quality items for cheap. Price items at different stores and always go back and compare. Don't go just to one fashion store and settle for what you find. Try to stay within your budget. You can splurge once in a while on a real statement piece, but there's a difference between fashionista and shopaholic."

      "content": "Purge your wardrobe regularly. Every couple of months, it's important to get rid of clothes you won't wear anymore. Give old clothes to charity, or have \"Naked Lady\" parties, in which you get together with a bunch of your fashionable friends and trade items you don't want anymore. You can save interesting T-shirts or old out-of-style jeans if you think you can combine them to get a unique look. Still, it's usually easier to clean out your closet and focus on working with what you really like."

      "content": "Learn to mix and match the clothes you already have. A lot of people assume you need the latest trends to be fashionable, but this doesn't necessarily have to be true. If you mix a plain white t-shirt with denim jeans one day and a black pencil skirt another, you've got two outfits right there made with a minimum of items. Practice organizing your clothes into different looks when you've got free-time."

It's important to figure out not only what's stylish and what's \"in,\" but what's going to look good on you.

The number one rule in fashion is to wear what you want to wear, so always wear what you want and choose items that will help you feel comfortable and radiant. Hold your head up high and improve your posture to get noticed. Don't wear something just because it's \"fashionable,\" or because someone recommended it. Fashion changes. If you used to love wearing blazers a year ago, but now you want to try leather jackets, go for it. Life is short and a fashionista should always wears what she wants."

      "content": "Don't over-do it. Although runway fashion can be very over-the-top and glamorous, sometimes less is more. You don't need to wear a fancy dress to school to be a fashionista. Just be yourself and find clothing that you feel represent you, and make you feel beautiful and confident. Separate runway fashion from everyday fashion. The designers of those elaborate garments are mostly wearing normal everyday clothes, just like you!"

Learn to be you and love you, and soon your inner fashionista will shine."
