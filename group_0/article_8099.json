      "content": "Wipe away dust and debris with a soft brush or cloth. A clean microfiber cloth is great for removing surface dirt that is not ingrained very deeply, while a soft-bristle brush is good for brushing away small pieces of debris trapped inside the groove and ridges of the unfinished wood. Run the cloth along the surface to pick up dust, then use the brush to gently wipe away anything in the crevices and then vacuum it up. [1] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source Some recommend sweeping or brushing unfinished wood every day, especially if it’s a surface you use frequently. Usually, dusting once a week is enough, however. For best results, use a gentle flicking motion with the bristles of the brush on the surface of the wood. Alternatively, use a microfiber mop or broom. Note that this section contains different ways to clean unfinished wood. Depending on how dirty the surface is, you may need to use one, two, or more of these methods."

      "content": "Use vinegar to naturally remove dirt and stains from the surface. Untreated wood is porous and absorbent, so it isn’t recommended to use harsh, store-bought cleaners. Instead, mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Lightly spray it on the affected surface and immediately wipe it with a microfiber cloth. Don’t let the solution sit for more than a few minutes, as it will seep into the wood and potentially damage it. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Gently pull up dirt with an erasing compound. Erasing compounds are elements used to remove dirt from bare wood surfaces. Apply a small amount of the erasing compound on the surface of the unfinished wood and use some cotton balls to work the cleaning material into the grain. Gently swirl the cotton balls in circular motions for best results. Once finished, vacuum the wood to pick up any remnants of the erasing compound. [3] X Research source Be sure to avoid rubbing the wood too harshly, as this could cause damage. Once the erasing compound turns gray, it is no longer effective and needs to be reapplied."

      "content": "Remove stubborn grime with a vacuum and stiff brush. Using a stiffer brush on the surface of your unfinished wood may be more useful for wood that has dirt and other debris more deeply ingrained in the grain of the wood. Wipe the unfinished wood and vacuum up any fragments that become loose. Be careful not to rub the stiff bristles on the wood too harshly, as this may damage the wood. [4] X Research source This method is most effective on unfinished wood that is already in good condition. Use caution when brushing the surface or using the vacuum on the wood. Being too rough can cause visible and lasting imperfections."

      "content": "Remove tougher grime and build-up with a mineral spirit. Mineral spirits are a kind of solvent that painters often use when cleaning their used painting brushes. Dampen a towel with the solution and gently wipe the surface of your unfinished wood. Be sure to wear gloves while you are handling the mineral spirits and avoid directly inhaling the fumes. [5] X Research source Because this is a type of liquid treatment, be very careful and apply the mineral spirits sparingly to avoid damaging the wood."

      "content": "Deep clean stains with a mild wood cleaner or dish soap. Sometimes, dirt or stains may be so deeply ingrained that dusting and dry scrubbing won’t remove it all. If wiping and vacuuming the surface isn’t enough, lightly dampen a cloth with a mild wood cleaner or a mixture of dish soap and water. Wring the cloth out, making sure it isn’t too wet, then wipe the surface. Alternatively, apply the cleaner with a soft-bristle brush, working in the direction of the grain. [6] X Research source Do not use excessively wet cleaning methods, as water can be extremely damaging to unfinished wood and make it harder to finish later. Use as little water as possible and dry the wood thoroughly. Do not use any cleaners with harsh chemicals, as these can damage the wood’s porous surface. Always test your cleaning method in a small, conspicuous area first to see if it will damage the wood. Cleaning expert Susan Stocker recommends “using simply deionized water [to clean wood]. It’s chemical-free, won’t damage any finish, and dries super fast (wood does not like water!).” [7] X Expert Source Susan Stocker House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. Cleaning expert Ashley Matuska agrees that using water and a damp microfiber cloth is “your best bet” for cleaning unfinished wood. She warns against “overly saturating it.” [8] X Expert Source Ashley Matuska Professional Cleaner Expert Interview. 15 April 2019."

      "content": "Clean hard-to-reach areas and crevices with an adhesive rubber. Adhesive rubber is very sticky and pliable so that it can be forced into the small crevices on the surface of wood. Apply the rubber to the surface and gently knead it to work it into the grain. As it becomes darker with dirt, tear off the top layer to work with a fresh one. [9] X Research source This works especially well for cleaning window tracks, door jambs, and cabinet corners."

      "content": "Apply a finish to protect against scratches and damage. Consider applying a finish to your unfinished wood furniture, floors, or other surfaces to help protect them from dirt, scratches, and other damage. Some common finishes include polyurethane , lacquer , and shellac , but be sure to research which type of finish would be best for your specific piece. Once you’ve chosen an appropriate finish, follow its manufacturer instructions to apply it properly. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a natural oil or wax as a barrier against moisture. Wood waxes and natural oils help protect uncoated wood because they penetrate the wood, enhancing its natural beauty and providing a barrier against moisture and stains. Apply the oil or wax per the manufacturer’s guidelines and allow it to absorb fully before gently buffing the surface with a cloth. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Use coasters on frequently used wood furniture. If your unfinished surface is used frequently, like a table, it’s more likely to get dirty and/or damaged. Use protective accessories like coasters, placemats, and tablecloths to reduce the risk of stains, water rings, or heat marks. If you have unfinished wood flooring, try to cover the surface with an area rug and avoid wearing shoes."

      "content": "Dust and wipe the surface regularly. Use a microfiber cloth or feather duster to remove surface dust and prevent it from settling into the wood grain. Try to dust at least once a week. For routine cleaning (a couple of times a month), lightly dampen a cloth with water or a mild wood cleaner and wipe down the uncoated surface. [12] X Research source Be sure the cloth isn’t too wet, as this could damage the untreated wood."

      "content": "Keep untreated wood out of direct sunlight. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight may cause unfinished wood to crack or fade. Keep your wooden furniture away from windows or use curtains, blinds, or UV-protective film to help decrease exposure to the light. If your unfinished wood is outdoors, try to keep it in an area with a lot of shade. [13] X Research source If you have outdoor wooden furniture, consider applying an outdoor sealant or protective finish. Protect your wood from sun exposure and rain by bringing it inside when not in use."

      "content": "Maintain a consistent temperature and humidity level. Wood is sensitive to changes in temperature or humidity, and it can warp, crack, or swell if those factors fluctuate frequently. [14] X Research source Keep your unfinished wood in a temperature-stable environment, and use a humidifier or dehumidifier as necessary to control humidity levels—especially during particularly dry or humid seasons. Your maintenance will likely vary depending on the season. For example, use humidifiers during dry winter months, and use dehumidifiers if you experience hot, muggy summers."

Blot up liquids with an absorbent cloth; avoid rubbing, as this may spread the liquid or damage the wood. If the stain is stubborn, create a paste out of baking soda and water and rub it onto the area with a soft cloth. [16] X Research source If all else fails, sand and refinish the stained area."
