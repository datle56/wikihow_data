      "content": "Be prepared to spend a considerable amount of money. Tuition and certification fees often differ by institution. That being said, collecting the various professional credentials needed to lock down high-paying positions will typically cost a few thousand dollars minimum. A state-funded technical school, such as Santa Barbara City College or South Central Louisiana Technical College, may be the least expensive option for many people.

Most employers will expect to see at least a high school diploma, but you can also get your GED if you're returning to school after an absence. Having a college degree is not necessary to work as an underwater welder, but it could help you stand out from other professionals once it comes time to start looking for a job. After taking care of your education requirements, securing employment will largely be a matter of racking up the relevant credentials and experience. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Gain a few years of experience working as a topside welder. While it's technically possible to get a job as an underwater welder right out of the gate, having 2 or more years of direct experience will greatly improve your chances. This will prove to employers that you're proficient in welding techniques and safety procedures on dry land, and are ready to apply them in an aquatic setting. [4] X Research source The more surface welding experience you have under your belt, the more likely you are to be considered for underwater jobs in the future."

      "content": "Take and pass a preliminary dive physical. In most cases, you can sign up for a physical with the same institution offering the commercial diver certification you're seeking. Along with a head-to-toe examination, you'll also be tested on your swimming abilities and cardiovascular conditioning. [5] X Research source Having drugs, alcohol, or an infectious illness in your system can be enough to temporarily disqualify you from receiving a commercial diver certification. In this case, you'll need to retake the physical once you're clear of the offending substance. If you exhibit symptoms of asthma, claustrophobia, severe motion sickness, collapsed lung, cardiac arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure, you may be denied certification permanently. [6] X Research source It's recommended that you submit to a dive physical before going any further, even if the dive school you plan on attending doesn't require one. You may discover that you have some type of limitation that won't allow you to pursue a career as an underwater welder."

The course content and length of underwater welding programs can vary greatly, but most consist of both traditional study and hands-on training in wet welding skills, and may range from 6 months to 2 years. In addition to classroom curriculum, most programs will require you to clock a certain number of dive hours (usually 20-50) in order to be approved for certification. Underwater welding schools tend to be located in cities bordering major bodies of water that have thriving fishing, transportation, and drilling industries. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply for a dive tender position to continue your training on the job. Most underwater welders don't start off in high-profile positions. Instead, they begin as “dive tenders,” apprentices that provide assistance to experienced professionals during dives. Submit your resume, complete with your new credentials, to the company of your choice to add your name to the fold of potential hires. [8] X Research source Coastal construction companies, engineering firms, shipbuilders, and underwater salvage teams are just a few of the contractors that work with underwater welders. [9] X Research source Research the policies and procedures unique to the underwater welding firm you want to work for and train to these specifications. This will enable you to perform at your peak level as a dive tender."

The tools you'll need to excel as an underwater welder will depend on the company employing you, the nature of the work they do, and the specific industry regulations in place in your area. Some of the most important skills to possess include cutting, rigging, and fitting metal components, drafting design plans and standards, and testing and inspecting finished projects. Some wet-welders also train extensively in underwater videography and still photography to document the progress of important projects. Qualifications for underwater welders can vary not only from company to company, but from one project to the next. [10] X Research source"
