      "content": "Blackjack The odds of winning any Blackjack game is around 42%. This simple card game isn’t hard to master, and you’re only playing against the dealer, not multiple people. The rules to play blackjack are simple: the dealer and the players compete to see who can get closest to 21 without going over. If you get closer to 21 than the dealer does, you win. [1] X Research source Blackjack is mostly about luck, and in general, the house edge (or the advantage that the house has over you over time), is only about 2%."

      "content": "Craps You have an almost 50% chance that you’ll win Craps. To play Craps , one person is the shooter (who rolls the dice), and the other players place bets on the results of the roll. The shooter can win if they roll a 7 or 11, but if not, the number they roll is now the “point.” The shooter has to match that point before rolling a 7 to win. If you aren’t the shooter, you can place a bet on whether or not the shooter will win. [2] X Research source In general, making a “pass line” bet on whether or not the shooter will win gives you 50/50 odds. There are a couple of other bets you can place as well, including whether or not the shooter will hit a different number before the 7. These other bets lower your chances of winning, but can net you more earnings in the end."
