If you're covering dark eye circles, port wine birthmarks, or other colorful areas, apply the color-correcting concealer of the opposite color on the color wheel. Blend this in, but don't expect it to disappear; the foundation and the skin tone concealer will hide it. When applying to the eye, tap the concealer on, working from the outside of the eye inward to the nose. You only need to apply it to the darkest area, then dab upward in a sweeping motion to thinly cover the rest. This is the most difficult type of concealer to use. Practice with different amounts and shades until it works out. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Sweep the foundation across your face. Use a makeup sponge, your fingertips, or (for liquid foundation only) a foundation brush. Brush across your entire face and blend until the foundation is evenly applied, taking care not to wipe away too much of the color-correcting concealer. A stippling brush works well for blending. If using liquid foundation, warm the container in your hand before applying. Although many makeup users apply concealer first, this wastes time and product when the foundation sweeps away some of the concealer. The exception is powder foundation, which should be applied over the concealer."

Some makeup companies even mix tones for an even closer match to your skin, so you might also notice letter combinations like “NC” or “NW.” Picking the wrong foundation could leave you with an ashy or coppery appearance. This is especially important for people with dark skin color, but everyone can benefit from this test: [9] X Research source Examine your skin without makeup on, under daylight or neutral white light. Hold a piece of yellow fabric or gold jewelry under your chin. If this gives your face a healthy glow, you have warm undertones. [10] X Research source Hold a piece of red fabric or silver jewelry under your chin. If this complements your face well, you have cool undertones (which can range from red to blue). [11] X Research source If it's hard to tell, you likely have a neutral tone, or you may need different foundation for different areas of your face. Or for a quick but unreliable test, check the veins on your inner wrist. Blue means cool undertones, green means warm, and bluish-green means neutral. [12] X Research source"

This is easiest with department store samples, but you can get a rough idea at the drugstore by holding the bottle up against your face and looking in a mirror to see how well it matches. Makeup fans argue quite a bit over where to test the foundation, but each side makes good points. However, don’t test the foundation on your arm because the skin here is usually darker than the skin on your face. If you want to be extra secure, test them both: Your jawline will be at the edge of the foundation. If the color matches here, you'll have an easier time blending it in. Your chest (if regularly exposed to sun) is usually close in color to your face. Testing it here also ensures that your face won't end up a completely different tone than your body."

Head outside with a mirror while you have the samples on your skin. The sample that blends in to your skin tone almost invisibly is the perfect choice of foundation. Give the foundation a few minutes to dry and oxidize before you judge it. After it has dried, check to see how it looks. If you plan to apply bronzer and blush, your face will end up a bit darker than the foundation. In this case, it's sometimes preferable to go one-half to one shade lighter with your foundation. If nothing is quite right, mix two foundations together on your skin."

Some things you may want to keep in mind when deciding which type o foundation is right for you include: Liquid foundation provides more control during blending. However, poor blending or an imperfect tone match can leave obvious lines where the foundation ends. If your skin is oily, choose an oil-free or non-comedogenic example. Powder foundation (especially mineral powder) absorbs oil and sweat, but can settle into a caked-on appearance, even adding definition to wrinkles and scaly skin. Use a light touch to minimize this effect. You can wear both at the same time. Applying a liquid foundation first and then applying a light layer of powder foundation can also help to set your makeup and make it last longer."

The form of concealer you choose depends on your skin type and where you plan to use it: [14] X Research source Liquid concealer is the default option, great for covering acne and wrinkles. Stick concealer and cream concealer are much thicker, which spells danger for oily skin. Bust one of these out for big jobs, such as dark eye circles and angry red patches. Cream-to-powder concealer rubs on as a cream, then sets fast. This is handy for on-the-go corrections, but tends to get cakey after a few hours."
