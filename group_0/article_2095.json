[2] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 13 January 2022. Ask him how he thinks we should spend our time while we’re alive, or about the books and movies that have made an impression on him recently, and you’re likely to get a thoughtful and eager message in response. Aquarians are proud of being original thinkers, and happy to have an opportunity to express this aspect of themselves. [3] X Research source If there’s one thing Aquarians can’t stand, it’s clichés. So be careful when wording your message! A more original question, like “Do you ever feel like we’re wasting our lives by following the expectations of other people?” would work better than “What’s the meaning of life?”, even though an Aquarius man would likely have a lot to say about either topic!"

      "content": "Aquarians care about politics, and aren’t afraid to show it. There’s a lot of good advice about staying away from talking about politics when meeting a new person, but this might not be possible for too long with an Aquarius man. It’s instinctive for them, since Uranus is the planet associated with revolutions, and Aquarius is the most progressive of all the zodiac signs. Think about the political issues you care about, and ask your Aquarius man what he thinks. Don’t worry too much about offending him over a disagreement—so long as things remain civil, Aquarians are known for not being too judgmental, and they can enjoy differences in opinion. [4] X Research source It’s not unusual to find plenty of Aquarians at protests, signing petitions, or otherwise trying to create what they see as a better future. If your Aquarius man isn’t an activist himself, it’s likely that he respects the work that activists do. [5] X Research source Talking about major news events or global issues is a great way of catching an Aquarius man’s attention, and he’ll more than likely give you an interesting perspective to consider in return! If there are any political scandals in the news right now, send him a “Did you see this?” message—chances are, he already has, and is itching to talk about it! Sending a politics meme is another great option if you’re struggling to come up with another topic."

      "content": "Tell your Aquarius man about an important experience you’ve had. What’s strongly impacted you? It could be about your relationship with your family, or a moment when you decided to change your direction in life. You’ll find that he’s probably a very good listener, and he’ll be happy to discuss a topic that is meaningful to you. Open up a conversation with a message like this: “Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something important to me.” It’ll capture his interest very fast! Aquarians are at their best when given the opportunity to help others. Natural humanitarians, they care deeply about suffering, and actively look for ways to ease it. Aquarians don’t see any topic as off-limits, and will be grateful for the trust you demonstrate if you open up about some of your deeper desires, dreams, and fears. [6] X Research source But be careful! It’s important to not overburden an Aquarius man when you’re trying to get to know him better. People born with this sign can feel easily suffocated when given too much responsibility to take care of others’ emotions. It’s best to demonstrate self-reliance, which is one of the qualities that Aquarians prize most. [7] X Research source"

[8] X Research source Don’t be alarmed if it takes a while for an Aquarius to text you back. They are notoriously slow responders, and it’s nothing personal--more often than not, their attention is simply on something else. This doesn’t mean that they don’t value you!

      "content": "Don’t be afraid of seeming weird! This might mean talking about something embarrassing or confessing that you have an odd habit. But it could also mean sharing any unconventional tastes you might have in movies or music. There’s nothing an Aquarius would hate more than to be seen as someone totally ordinary, and they appreciate eccentricity in other people as well. Now is not the time to hide all the things about you that make you unique! If you show what makes you special, an Aquarius will be attracted to this part of you, because being special is what he values most about himself. [9] X Research source Opening a message by saying, “It’s a little weird, but I…”, is a great way of getting an Aquarius’ attention!"

      "content": "Bond over things you’re interested in. Ask yourself what topics both you and your Aquarius enjoy thinking about, reading about, and talking about. Aquarians open up when they’re talking about their interests, and this is a crucial part of getting to know this intellectual sign more. Send him articles or videos you find about the topics you’re both interested in, and ask him what he thinks. Let him know that he should do the same for you, and share your thoughts about whatever he sends over—finding an intellectual companion and a romantic one go hand-in-hand for an Aquarius! [10] X Research source You can just send over an article or video without an attached message, but it would be even better to personalize it. Say something like, “This made me think of what you were saying about…”. It’ll flatter an Aquarius to think that someone else is paying attention to his ideas."

      "content": "Flirting over text with an Aquarius is easier than with most other signs. After all, Aquarians like mental stimulation more than anything, and physical presence isn’t necessary to keep their attention. Try impressing them with a flirty joke, or throw in a winky-face after a clever response to one of their texts. Let them know that you find them attractive, and try to do it in a spontaneous and surprising way—the straightforward approach works for some Aquarians, since they do value honesty, but all of them will enjoy bantering over text. [11] X Research source Make flirty references to earlier conversations—an Aquarius will be thrilled to develop a pool of inside jokes with you!"

Aquarians aren’t likely to send good morning texts, and may not respond to them either—these conventions are silly to many of them. They’d much rather have a conversation when someone has something that they want to discuss. If an Aquarius takes their time responding to you, it’s OK for you to do the same—that way, you won’t make them feel as though you’ve been waiting all day for a response from them. [13] X Research source Keep in mind that if an Aquarius doesn’t respond for a few days, this might just be typical for him. But if he waits more than a week to respond to your messages, your time might simply be better spent elsewhere. [14] X Research source If an Aquarius apologizes for a late response, send him a forgiving reply, such as “Don’t worry about it, I’m happy that I can talk to you now :)” He’ll be grateful for your patience, and that you respect his need to be left alone."

      "content": "Aquarians are thoughtful and sensitive creatures, but they can also be slow ones. Cool and collected, Aquarians expect the same from their potential partners. It’s important not to push yourself onto an Aquarian man too strongly, as they tend to be easily scared off when they are forced into commitments too soon, or when they see someone ask acting from a place of desperation. So, take your time with him, have some great conversations, and develop a good dynamic—he’ll let you know when he’s ready to take things to the next level. [15] X Research source"

People with this sign love those who are independent and self-reliant, and by demonstrating these qualities, you can attract an Aquarius man. In other words, what is characteristic of Aquarians is that by showing them that you don’t need them, you attract them! Send over updates on occasion where you talk about the things you’ve been doing and people you’ve been spending time with—an Aquarius will be happy for you, and tempted to join in. [17] X Research source If you’re visiting a new place, send him a photo, and tell him that you were thinking of him.
