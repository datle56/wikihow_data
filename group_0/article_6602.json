The preferred method is to use CSS to define the style of your elements. Go ahead and open or create a new HTML document . This method will also work with separate CSS files that are linked to your HTML document. The examples used in this article are for an HTML file using an internal stylesheet."

In the following example, we change the color of the body text to red, the header text to green, and the paragraph text to blue: [6] X Research source <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < style > body { color : red ; } h1 { color : #00FF00 ; } p { color : rgb ( 0 , 0 , 255 ) } </ style > </ head > < body > < h1 > This header will be green. </ h1 > < p > This paragraph will be blue. </ p > This body text will be red. </ body > </ html >"

In the following example, we define a new class called \".redtext\", which changes the color of the text to red. Then we apply it to the header at the top of the HTML document.
