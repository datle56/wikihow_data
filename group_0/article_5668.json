      "content": "We don't know if cats can see ghosts, spirits, or supernatural beings. It's up for debate whether ghosts and spirits are real since science has been unable to prove or disprove their existence. That means it's also impossible to know if your cat perceives something supernatural when they fixate on sights, sounds, or smells you can't sense. Of course, since no one can prove that cats can see ghosts, they also can't prove that they don't see them!"

      "content": "Cats see more at night and in the corners of their eyes than humans. Felines have better peripheral vision and night vision than humans, although they have a hard time detecting red and pink (much like a person who's color blind). If you notice your cat staring at something on the floor, wall, or ceiling, but you can't see anything, it may be because it's too dark or small for you to notice without shining a light on it. [1] X Research source They could also be seeing a ghost. There really is no telling! Did you know? Cats don't have true night vision, meaning if it's pitch black, they can't see any better than humans can. However, unlike humans, they only need a tiny amount of light to navigate. Their whiskers also help them detect and pass by objects (such as furniture) without running into them."

      "content": "Cats hear sounds from farther away and at a wider frequency. In the right conditions, cats can hear noises from up to 2,300 feet distant, while humans can only hear them up to 500 feet away. [2] X Research source They can also detect sound wavelengths at frequencies ranging from 48 Hz to 85 kHz — that's one of the widest ranges among all mammals on Earth! [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Compare that to humans' hearing range, which is only 20 Hz to 20 kHz. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source So when your cat's ears suddenly twitch forward or start moving rapidly in different directions, it's possible they're listening to real (or supernatural) noises that are too far away or high-pitched for you to hear."

      "content": "Cats' sense of smell is 14 times more sensitive than humans'. All mammals have cells in their noses that help them detect smells. While humans have around 5 million scent receptors, cats have over 200 million! [5] X Research source Who's to say that when they're sniffing the air and you can't smell anything, what they're actually detecting is a ghost? Unfortunately, this also means they can definitely smell all those \"silent bombs\" you drop when you think no one is paying attention."

      "title": "Cats' whiskers can detect shifts in air current, temperature, and more.",
      "content": "Cats' whiskers can detect shifts in air current, temperature, and more. The whiskers protruding out of a cat's face and forehead are like a built-in radar system combined with a barometer and a windsock. These delicate extensions of their nervous system can sense when there's a change in air currents, temperature, air pressure, and the direction air flows. So, while they may not see or even hear anything, they may sense presences close by simply by following the signals their whiskers are sending them. [6] X Research source Their whiskers, along with their enhanced night vision, makes them excellent night prowlers."

      "title": "Cats are believed to see and connect with spirits.",
      "content": "Cats are believed to see and connect with spirits . According to Cartagenova, spirits can choose cats — who are \"intuitive creatures\" — as the messenger or vessel through which they communicate with their loved ones who are still living. The spirit doesn't \"possess\" the cat, she says, rather they \"come through\" them to connect with you, perhaps by randomly waking you up in the middle of the night. If your cat wakes you up randomly in the middle of the night, Cartagenova advises you to pay attention to the time as well as the cat's needs. Your cat may just be waking you up to be annoying or because they're hungry. But if their needs are met, and it's unusual for them to rouse you, they may have done so at a specific time to send you a spiritual message based on numerology. Numerology is the belief that numbers have significance and influence over our lives. For example, if your cat wakes you up at 3 AM, Cartagenova says, the number 3 is associated with the Holy Trinity and Mother Mary from Christianity. Being woken up at 3 AM could be a sign \"that you are being protected and… watched over, and the cat in that case would be a conduit… to get that message across to you.\""

      "content": "Cats are historically associated with magic and witchcraft. Cartagenova believes that \"cats are very spiritual and are all connected with mediumship, witchcraft, and spells.\" Black cats , in particular, always rise to the top of people's minds when they think about felines and magic (think Salem from Sabrina the Teenage Witch or Binx from Hocus Pocus ). Sadly, many people still believe (as they have since the Dark Ages) that black cats are bad luck and representatives of Satan. As a result, they have the lowest adoption rate and the highest euthanasia rate of all cats — even today! [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Cats were closely linked to a protection and fertility goddess in ancient Egypt. A common myth is that the ancient Egyptians worshipped domestic cats as gods. But while they certainly admired cats and their many qualities (including grace and swiftness), they didn't worship them. Instead, they revered deities like Bastet, a feline goddess associated with protecting the home and fertility. The Egyptians also mummified cats and buried them with humans as pleasing sacrifices.

      "content": "Black cats are said to serve Hecate, the Greek goddess of sorcery. In the ancient Greek pantheon, Hecate rules over all things magic, including sorcery and witchcraft. According to one legend, one of Hecate's priestesses was a servant woman whom the Queen of the Gods, Hera, turned into a black cat and banished to the Underworld for crossing her. This may also explain why cats have so often been associated with witches throughout history. [9] X Research source"

In Norse mythology, Thor (whom you may know from the Marvel Cinematic Universe as the god of thunder) gave 2 male kittens named Bygul and Trjegul to Freya, the goddess of love and war. When they became adults, Bygul and Trjegul pulled Freya's chariot as she traveled through the air. They became popular symbols of loyalty and protection to the Viking peoples. [10] X Research source Did you know? It was a tradition among Vikings to give a couple who had just gotten married at least one kitten as a wedding gift."

      "content": "If your cat starts bumping into walls and furniture. Given cats' heightened sense of smell and their super-sensitive whiskers, you should definitely take notice if yours start bumping into things as if they don't see them. This could be a sign that their sight is going away, and you may want to take them to a vet to get their eyes checked. If your cat presses their head repeatedly against the wall, take them to the vet as soon as possible. This is called head pressing and can be a symptom of a brain tumor, liver disease, poisoning, a virus, or another serious health problem. [11] X Research source"

Cats are notorious for ignoring humans when they call, but you might find it suspicious if you notice your cat doesn't seem to notice or respond to any sounds, period. If they don't even twitch when you run the vacuum or another loud appliance, or they're always startled when you touch them without them seeing you first, they may have a hearing problem. Make a vet appointment as soon as possible to check their hearing. [12] X Research source Did you know? 80% of white cats with blue eyes are born deaf or become deaf a few days after they leave their mother's womb."

But the effect is usually temporary. If your cat's eyes appear dilated all the time, and they're also crying, lethargic, or bumping into things, something deeper may be happening. Permanently dilated eyes can be a sign of blindness, hypertension, or that the cat is in a lot of pain . As always, take your cat to the vet if you notice any unusual or disturbing behavior.

While your cat could absolutely be sensing the presence of a spirit in your home, they might also just be fascinated by a piece of lint or a bug that you just haven't observed yet. Instead of worrying if you're being haunted , enjoy watching your cat play and monitor them for warning signs in case they're going through a medical episode."
