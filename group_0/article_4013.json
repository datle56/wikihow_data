      "title": "Make eye contact.",
      "content": "Make eye contact. To let someone know you're interested in him, start by making eye contact. Move your eyes to his, hold briefly, then look away. Repeat this a few times,so that he knows you're intentionally looking at him. [1] X Research source Don't stare at him. Staring is when you maintain fixed eye contact with someone for longer than a few seconds. Staring can seem aggressive or angry. Pair your eye contact with a slight smile. Make sure to watch his response. If he doesn't return your gaze, this is a sign he's not interested. If he looks back, smiles at you, or otherwise responds positively, that's a sign he's okay with your flirting."

      "title": "Start a lip pout and bite soon after you make eye contact.",
      "content": "Start a lip pout and bite soon after you make eye contact. Lower your bottom lip slightly so your teeth are barely showing. You don’t need to purse your lips, just open your mouth to entice the viewer. The pout is the first stage of the seductive lip bite. Studies show that women initiate flirting 90% of the time. Men flirt largely in response to feeling that flirtation has been initiated by women. A Manchester University study found that men spend the first 7 to 10 seconds of contact looking at women’s lips before moving onto other areas. Once you've confirmed that he's interested, initiate the lip pout. Remember that not all cultures share the same body flirtation signals. Maintain eye contact while you pout your lips."

      "title": "Lower your eyelashes seductively.",
      "content": "Lower your eyelashes seductively. After establishing eye contact, lowering your eyelids, or glancing at the object of your flirtation through your eyelashes, is a nonverbal indication of desire. You may want to lower your chin and look up at the person to strike a seductive pose. Some people find themselves naturally blinking their eyes more rapidly. This is also called \"batting\" the eyes. If this comes naturally to you, it can be another way to add your eyes to the flirtation. If it doesn't come naturally, it might seem like you have something stuck in your eye, and is best avoided. The downward tilt of the chin is said to make women look more \"feminine\" and flirtatious. Men, on the other hand, are said to look more \"masculine\" when they tilt their chin up and gaze slightly down their nose."

      "title": "Do a triangle gaze.",
      "content": "Do a triangle gaze. Look at one eye, and then move to the other eye and down to the lips. This will draw his attention to your lips. The reason your eye gaze will draw his attention to your lips is through the tendency of one person to mirror, or imitate, another when engaged in flirtation. Directing your eye gaze to a man's lips is an overtly flirtatious gesture. It's a nonverbal way of indicating sexual interest."

      "title": "Bring your lower lip in very slightly.",
      "content": "Bring your lower lip in very slightly. Bite tenderly on 1 side of the inner lip for 2 to 5 seconds, before slowly releasing. Maintain eye contact throughout. With eye contact, there's less chance that your lip bite could be misunderstood. [2] X Research source Make sure your teeth don't bite your outer lip, as this may appear insecure or nervous. A seductive bite should be gentle, never hurtful. It should not leave a mark."

      "title": "Lick your lower lips.",
      "content": "Lick your lower lips. Following your lip bite, you may want to add a slight lick of your lower lip with your tongue. Your tongue is a sexual body part, and using your tongue now will make your flirtatious overture more seductive. Don't overdo it with lip-licking. This can result in chapped lips, which is the opposite effect you are trying to achieve. Continue to make seductive eye contact throughout your encounter. The seductive lip bite is one gesture in the choreography of your flirtation, working together with others."

      "title": "Brush your teeth.",
      "content": "Brush your teeth. Do this before you put on lipstick or lip gloss. If you need to floss to make sure that you don't have anything stuck between your teeth, do it. The quickest way to ruin a seductive lip bite is to have a piece of food stuck between your teeth. If you don’t have time to brush, use some mouthwash or chew a stick of gum for a few minutes. Your breath should be fresh and clean."

      "content": "Mix a homemade lip scrub to slough off any dead skin cells. Stir together 1 tbsp. of sugar, 1 tbsp. of honey, 1/2 tsp. of petroleum jelly and 1/2 tsp. of olive oil. Spread a dime-sized amount of the scrub around your lips in a circular motion. [3] X Research source Scrub until some of the sugar has dissolved. Rinse with warm water. Apply twice a week for best results. The scrub will store in an airtight container for a week."

      "title": "Apply a layer of lip balm.",
      "content": "Apply a layer of lip balm. Every time you wash your face, replenish your lips' moisture with some lip balm. Use a moisturizing product beneath your lipstick, but be careful to avoid lip balms that have drying chemicals in them. The best lip balms are made without a lot of chemicals. Look for lip balms that include ingredients like beeswax, shea butter, olive oil and cocoa butter. Find a lip balm that works best for your lips. Avoid using flavored lip balm when flirting, in case the scent of bubble gum or cherry isn't appealing to him."

      "title": "Use a plumping or long lasting lipstick, if you want color.",
      "content": "Use a plumping or long lasting lipstick, if you want color. Red lipstick makes your teeth look whiter and your lips more noticeable. Wearing red lipstick may result in more male attention to your lips than pink lipstick. It doesn't have to be bright or thick lipstick, but research suggests that men are more likely to hold their gaze for longer on red lips than on pink ones. Make sure the lipstick or lip balm you choose does not come off of the lips easily. If it is too wet or sticky, it may come off onto your teeth when you bite your lip. If you are male or don’t wear lipstick, use a moisturizing lip balm before you go out for the day."
