Some newer monitors use USB-C to connect to compatible USB-C ports. Some newer MacBook Airs do not have an HDMI port or Mini DisplayPort. If this is the case, you will need to purchase a USB-C-to-HDMI adapter to connect your MacBook Air to a monitor. Or, you can use a USB-C display. An HDMI cable is about 3/4 of an inch wide with the bottom slightly smaller than the top. A Mini DisplayPort is square-shaped with the bottom corners cut. It's the exact same shape as a Thunderbolt 1 or 2 port. A Thunderbolt 1 or 2 port and Mini DisplayPort have the same shaped port, but they are not the same. Check the labels on the port. A Mini DisplayPort has an icon that resembles a screen. A Thunderbolt port has an icon that resembles a lightning bolt. [3] X Research source"

Once you have determined what type of video out your MacBook uses, you'll need to purchase either an HDMI cable or Mini DisplayPort cable, depending on the port on your MacBook. You may need to buy a USB-C display cable if your monitor didn't come with one. Make sure you get a cable that is long enough to connect your MacBook and your monitor. If need be, measure the distance between the devices. Mini DisplayPort cables have a Mini DisplayPort plug on one end, and an HDMI port on the other end of the cable. You can also purchase a Mini DisplayPort adapter to connect an HDMI cable directly to a Mini DisplayPort. If the monitor you are using does not have an HDMI or Mini DisplayPort, you can purchase an adapter from Apple or another electronics retailer. These include a MiniDisplay-to-DVI, and MiniDisplay-to-VGA adapters, as well as HDMI-to-DVI adapters.
