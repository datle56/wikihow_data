      "content": "Choose a curtain rod with a diameter of at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). Thin curtain rods tend to look cheap and can bow under the weight of your drapes if they are heavy. When choosing a curtain rod, look for a rod that is at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick for good aesthetics and curtain support. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) beyond the window frame for rod length. Extending your curtain rod 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) beyond the frame of your window makes your window seem larger and allows additional light to stream in. This way, when your curtains are open, they will rest against the wall rather than blocking the light from the window. [2] X Research source Note that some curtain rods are a fixed length, while others are spring-loaded and adjustable. If there isn't enough room on either side of the window for a rod that extends on either side, use 1 curtain panel instead of 2 and push it all the way to 1 side when you open it to keep the window from looking too small."

      "content": "Select a rod with support brackets at least every 50 inches (130 cm). Select a rod with curtain brackets a maximum of 50 inches (130 cm) apart for proper curtain-rod support. A rod that is longer than this without support brackets at this interval will have difficulty supporting the weight of your curtains. [3] X Research source Make sure you install the brackets in a location where they won't interfere with hanging, opening, or closing the curtains."

      "content": "Use dark tones in your furniture for inspiration. If you're going for a designer look with your curtain rods, select a rod that picks up tones of the darkest furniture in your room. While this may not be your first instinct, it pulls the space together and creates pleasing contrast, a bit like eyeliner for your room. [4] X Research source Note that if you choose wood curtain rods these require periodic turning so they don't bow out of shape with the weight of your curtains. You're better off going for a metal rod with a bronze finish if you're looking for a brown-tone rod. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Embrace a matchy-matchy look by selecting a rod the color of your drapes. If you have highly patterned drapes that are a focal point of your room, you can use your curtain rod to draw attention to them. Choose a color for your curtain rod that's featured in the pattern of your drapes to highlight their hue."

      "content": "Select a finial that matches the formality of the room. Consider if the room where you'll be hanging your curtain rod is casual or formal when you select a finial. For example, a crystal finial would likely be out of place on a sun porch. Similarly, a wicker finial would likely not be in keeping with the décor of a formal dining room. [6] X Research source Take a picture of the room where you'll be hanging the curtain rod, and bring it with you when you look at finials. This will help you visualize if the style of finial is complementary to the room or not. If you're decorating a fun space like a child's room or game room, consider going with themed finials, like baseballs, sparkly globes, or animals."

      "title": "Pick a finial material that's featured in your room.",
      "content": "Pick a finial material that's featured in your room. Finials come in many different materials: resin, glass, metal, and wood, to name a few. You can choose a finial that will fit best with your décor by selecting a material that is already present in your room. [7] X Research source For example, if you have a grand glass dining table, try selecting a glass finial for the curtain rods in that room to highlight your décor. You can choose one that matches another finish, or choose a contrasting finish to make it stand out, as long as the finish looks cohesive in the space."

      "title": "Select a finial motif already present in your design.",
      "content": "Select a finial motif already present in your design. Finials come in many different shapes, such as scrolls, leaves, and even novelty shapes like birds. Use your finial to highlight a pattern or motif already present in your room, perhaps a part of the upholstery or wallpaper, for a greater design impact. For example, if you have floral wallpaper, you could choose a fleur-de-lis finial to enhance the flower motif. If you redecorate the room, you can easily swap out the finial to match the new look while keeping the curtain rod in place."
