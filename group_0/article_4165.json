      "title": "Understand how proxies work.",
      "content": "Understand how proxies work. Proxy websites take your IP address and hide it behind a different address—often one from a different country—in order to fool websites and ISPs into thinking that your computer's IP address isn't being used. This is handy if you want to try watching a movie that is blocked in your region, for example, or if you want to check your bank statements while using public Wi-Fi. It's important to block your IP address whenever using free, public Wi-Fi (e.g., a coffee shop network). Since proxies often redirect your address through a server in a different country, your browsing will be noticeably slower than usual."
