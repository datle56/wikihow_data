Insulin is a chemical compound used to break down sugar (glucose) in the bloodstream. Those with type 1 diabetes must work with their doctor to find their correct dosage of insulin, because different individuals have different reactions to various types of insulin, and because some individuals with this type of diabetes may still be producing insulin at mild levels. Without insulin, the symptoms of Type 1 diabetes will rapidly worsen and eventually cause death. To be clear: Individuals with Type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day or they will die. [4] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Your precise daily insulin dosages will vary based on your size, diet, activity level, and genetics, which is why it is so important to see a doctor to get a thorough evaluation before beginning your diabetes treatment plan. Insulin is generally available in several different varieties, each of which is formulated for specific purposes. These are: Rapid-acting: \"Mealtime\" (bolus) insulin. Usually taken right before a meal to prevent elevated blood glucose levels after eating. Short-acting: Basal insulin. Usually taken between meals once or twice a day to control \"resting\" blood glucose levels. Long-acting: A combination of bolus and basal insulin. Can be taken before breakfast and dinner in order to keep blood glucose levels low after meals as well as throughout the day. Intermediate-acting: Combined with rapid-acting insulin.

Your blood glucose level is entered into the device at meal times and in accordance with your normal testing schedule, and your bolus is calculated for you. In addition a carbohydrate ratio can be set and be added to the bolus calculation as well. There is the new tubeless (no tubing) insulin pump that is an \"all-in-one\" unit that typically come loaded with a three-day supply of insulin with the battery and pump built-in, it is the Omnipod, that is wirelessly controlled by a Personal Diabetes Manager (PDM). It takes ideally about ten pumps per month that come in a box holding a 30-day supply. [5] X Research source The old, standard injection set consisted of a plastic cap attached to a catheter that injects the insulin (subcutaneous delivery of insulin). It was inserted into your chosen injection site brought from the pump by tubing called the cannula. The pump set might be attached to a belt or near the delivery site with an adhesive pad. On the other end, the tubing connects to a cartridge that you fill with insulin and insert into the pump unit. Some pumps have a compatible glucose monitor that measures glucose levels just below the dermis. While not as effective as a glucose meter, this device will allow early detection and compensation for sugar spikes and drops. Pump users typically monitor their blood sugars more frequently to evaluate the effectiveness of insulin delivery by the pump, to be aware if the pump malfunctions. Some malfunctions of the insulin pump include: Pump battery is discharged Insulin is inactivated by heat exposure Insulin reservoir runs empty Tubing loosens and insulin leaks rather than being injected The cannula becomes bent or kinked, preventing delivery of insulin."

[6] X Trustworthy Source American Diabetes Association Health-based nonprofit focused on preventing and researching diabetes Go to source Because the most harmful effects of diabetes are caused by elevated glucose levels (blood sugar \"spikes\"), exercise after eating is a valuable tool that uses sugar naturally and allows people with diabetes to keep glucose at manageable levels. In addition, exercise also provides the same benefits to those with diabetes that it does to those without it - namely, greater overall fitness, weight loss (but rapid weight loss is a bad symptom indicating food and sugar is not used properly by your system). You can gain higher strength and endurance, higher energy levels, elevated mood, and more benefits of exercise as well. Diabetes resources generally recommend exercising at least several times per week. Most resources recommend a healthy mix of cardio, strength training, and balance/flexibility exercises. See How to Exercise for more information. Though low, manageable glucose levels are generally a good thing for moderate activity for people who have diabetes. Exercising vigorously while you have low blood sugar levels can lead to a condition called hypoglycemia, in which the body doesn't have enough blood sugar to fuel its vital processes and the exercising muscles. Hypoglycemia can lead to dizziness, weakness, and fainting. To counter hypoglycemia, carry a sugary, quick-acting carbohydrate with you while you exercise, such as a sweet, ripe orange, or a soda, a sports drink or such as recommended by your health team.

If you have the common cold, try drinking plenty of fluids, taking over-the-counter cold medications (but avoid sugary cough syrups), and getting plenty of rest. Since having the cold can ruin your appetite, you'll want to be sure to eat roughly 15 grams of carbohydrates every hour or so.

Usually, this is done through careful diet and exercise, which means minimizing the amount of sugary foods consumed, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly. Some people with mild cases of Type 2 diabetes can potentially live basically \"normal\" lives if they are very careful about what they eat and how much they exercise.

As a result, cases of Type 2 diabetes that once required relatively minor treatment options can eventually require more drastic treatments, including insulin therapy, after several years. This is often not due to any fault on the patient's behalf.

In Type 2 diabetes cases where patients have high body mass indexes (usually greater than 35), doctors will sometimes recommend weight-reduction surgeries to bring the patient's weight under control quickly. Two types of surgery are usually used for this purpose: [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Gastric bypass surgery - the stomach is shrunk to the size of a thumb and the small intestine is shortened so that fewer calories are absorbed from food.

People with diabetes should generally have special test called A1C (also known as Hemoglobin A1C or HbA1C) tests at regular intervals - your doctor may direct you to have such tests every month or every two to three months. These tests monitor the average blood sugar level over the last few months rather than giving an instantaneous \"snapshot\" and thus can provide valuable information about whether or not a treatment plan is working well. A1C tests work by analyzing a molecule in your blood called hemoglobin. When glucose enters your blood, some of it binds to these hemoglobin molecules.

People with Type 1 and people with Type 2 diabetes are both at risk for these complications. However, because Type 2 diabetes can progress gradually without being noticed, it's extra-important to schedule regular foot and eye exams to prevent either condition from developing. Comprehensive dilated eye exams check for diabetic retinopathy (vision loss from diabetes) and should normally be scheduled about once a year. During pregnancy or illness, more-frequent is likely to be necessary. Foot tests check for pulse, feeling, and the presence of any sores or ulcers on the feet and should be scheduled about once per year.

The information in this section is purely informative and should not be used to pick medications or formulate dosages. Additionally, you won't necessarily want to stop taking any medications you are currently on if you discover you are have diabetes. A doctor must evaluate all of the variables at play - including your current medication usage - to develop a plan to treat your diabetes. The effects of using too much or too little diabetes medication can be serious. For instance, an overdose of insulin can result in hypoglycemia, leading to dizziness, fatigue, confusion, and even coma in severe cases."

      "content": "Use insulin to control your blood sugar. Insulin is perhaps the most well-known diabetes medication. The insulin that doctors prescribe to people who have diabetes is a synthetic form of a chemical naturally produced by the pancreas to process sugar in the blood. In healthy individuals, after a meal, when blood sugar levels are high, the body releases insulin to break down the sugar, removing it from the bloodstream and rendering it into a usable form of energy. Administering insulin (via injection) allows the body to process blood sugar properly. Since medicinal insulin comes in several strengths and varieties, it's important to receive a doctor's advice before starting to use insulin. Note that people with Type 1 Diabetes must take insulin . Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the body being completely unable to make insulin, so it must be added by the patient. People with Type 2 Diabetes may or may not take insulin depending upon the severity of their disease."

      "content": "Use oral diabetes medications to control your blood sugar. There are a variety of options when it comes to orally-administered diabetes medications (pills). Often, for people with moderate cases of Type 2 diabetes, doctors will recommend trying these types of medications before using insulin as the latter represents a more drastic, life-affecting treatment option. Because there are such a wide variety of oral diabetes medications with different mechanisms of action, it's important to talk to a doctor before starting to take any sort of diabetes pills to ensure that the medication is safe for your own personal use. See below for the different types of oral diabetes medications and a brief description of the mechanism of action for each: [33] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Sulfonylureas - stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin. Biguanides - lower the amount of glucose produced in the liver and makes muscle tissue more sensitive to insulin. Meglitinides - stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin. Thiazolidinediones - reduce glucose production in liver and increase insulin sensitivity in muscle and fat tissue. DPP-4 inhibitors - prevent the breakdown of normally short-lived chemical mechanisms which regulate the level of blood glucose. SGLT2 Inhibitors - absorbs blood glucose in the kidneys. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors - lower glucose levels by preventing the breakdown of starches in the intestine. Also slow the breakdown of some sugars. Bile Acid Sequestrants - reduces cholesterol and simultaneously lowers glucose levels. The method for the latter is still not well understood."

      "content": "Consider supplementing your treatment plan with other medications. The medications specifically designed to fight diabetes above are not the only medications prescribed for diabetes. Doctors prescribe a range of medications, from aspirin to flu shots, to help manage diabetes. However, even though these medications are usually not as \"serious\" or drastic as the diabetes medications described above, it's usually a good idea to consult with your doctor before supplementing your treatment plan with one of these medicines just in case. Just a few supplementary medicines are listed below: Aspirin - sometimes prescribed to reduce the risk of heart attacks for people with diabetes. [34] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Mechanism of action is not well-understood but is thought to relate to aspirin's ability to prevent red blood cells from sticking together. Flu shots - since the flu, like many illnesses, can cause blood glucose levels to fluctuate and make diabetes harder to manage, doctors often recommend that patients receive yearly flu shots to reduce their chance of contracting this disease. Herbal supplements - though most \"homeopathic\" supplements have not definitively been proven effective in a scientific setting, some diabetes patients offer anecdotal testimonies to their effectiveness."
