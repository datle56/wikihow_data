Sit on a couch or the floor, take off your shoes and socks, and outstretch your legs. Relax your legs and feet. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you’re doing the test on someone else, have them stretch out and relax their feet. You could also test yourself for the reflex by resting your foot on your knee, but you won’t be able to relax your foot as well. It’s much easier to either test someone else or have another person test you."

      "content": "Press a blunt object above the heel near the outside of the foot. Any smooth, blunt objects can work for this. Doctors usually use a reflex hammer or tongue depressor, but you can use a pen or anything else you have handy. Firmly press the object into the foot along the outside edge of the foot, just above the heel. [4] X Research source It’s okay if this is a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t hurt. You might be pressing too hard if it’s painful. Make sure whatever you use isn’t sharp or jagged in any way. If the object hurts at all, then stop right away. Get something else that feels better."

This indicates that you have the Babinski reflex. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Pay close attention to how the big toe curls specifically—don't confuse the movement of the foot with the toe's movement. Someone moving their foot back can make it seem like their big toe is curling upward, but that larger movement is distracting from what the toe itself is doing.

Not having the reflex isn’t usually considered a problem, but if you can’t find the Babinski sign on a baby younger than 12 months, talk to your pediatrician just to check if that’s okay."

Remember—a positive Babinski result at home by itself without any other neurologic symptoms such as weakness, numbness/tingling, or loss of sensation does not necessarily mean that there's a worse underlying diagnosis. It's always best to be assessed by a medical professional, as it's easy to jump to conclusions with an at-home test.
