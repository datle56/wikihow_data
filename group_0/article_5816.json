    {
      "title": "Wait until your Pokémon starts to evolve.",
      "content": "Wait until your Pokémon starts to evolve. The majority of Pokémon evolve when they reach a certain level. A Pokémon \"levels up\" (gains a level) by gaining experience points from fights. The level that triggers an evolution varies from Pokémon to Pokémon. If you're unsure when or how a Pokémon will evolve, this information is easy to find online. You can check the Pokémon's page on a Pokémon resource site like Bulbapedia , for instance. [1] X Research source Note that select Pokémon will only evolve by using special items or by meeting special conditions. For example, Most Eevee evolutions require an evolutionary stone to evolve (Flareon, Vaporeon, Leafeon, Jolteon) while Espeon requires a certain level of friendship to be reached between 6 am-6 pm, and Umbreon requires friendship to be reached from 6 pm-6 am. Sylveon requires a soothe bell to be held while it reaches the correct level of friendship, and you must be in the appropriate location for Eevee to evolve into Glaceon."

      "title": "Watch for the evolution animation.",
      "content": "Watch for the evolution animation. When you get your Pokémon to a high enough level (or use an evolution stone, etc.), you will see an evolution dialogue screen with \"What? (name of Pokémon) is evolving!\" or a similar message. Wait for the evolution \"animation\" to appear. The screen may flash and the Pokémon may \"blink\" between its current form and its next evolution. More modern Pokémon games generally have fancier evolution screens than older games, but the general idea is the same for all games in the series."
    },
    {
      "title": "Press B repeatedly.",
      "content": "Press B repeatedly. As soon as you see the animation begin, press the B button rapidly. Don't wait too long or the evolution will finish. Eventually, you will see \"Huh? (name of Pokémon) stopped evolving!\" or a similar message. At this point, the evolution is canceled. If your Pokémon gained a level, it will keep its level but will stay in the same form. Warning: The Pokémon Gimmighoul is the only Pokémon you can't stop from evolving by pressing B."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat as needed.",
      "content": "Repeat as needed. Cancelling an evolution once will not cancel it in the future. If your Pokémon starts to evolve again, you will need to repeat the process above to cancel it. If you don't, it will evolve. For Pokémon that evolve normally from leveling up, you'll need to cancel every time the Pokémon gains a level."

    {
      "title": "Obtain an Everstone.",
      "content": "Obtain an Everstone. This is a special item that gives you a more efficient way to prevent a Pokémon from evolving. While the Pokémon \"holds\" the Everstone, it will not evolve, even if all of the normal conditions for evolution are met. Everstones are only in games from Generation II onward. [2] X Research source In other words, they do not appear in the original Pokémon Red/Blue/Yellow games."

      "content": "Have the Pokémon hold the item. Open the Items menu and assign the Everstone to be held by the Pokémon you want to evolve. The Pokémon can hold the item the same way it would hold a berry or similar item. While it is holding the Everstone, it will not evolve from leveling up."
