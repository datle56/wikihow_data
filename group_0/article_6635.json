Some web users claim that YouTube resets their language settings whenever they close and reopen the site. If you are experiencing this issue, try changing your language settings on Google Chrome. Because Google owns YouTube, these settings should transfer across the two platforms. To change the language of a video's subtitles, turn on closed captioning by tapping the CC icon in the YouTube player, then clicking on the gear icon. Select \"Subtitles/CC\" and then find your desired language or click \"Auto-translate\" to find YouTube's full list of languages. YouTube can auto-translate its English subtitles into any language, but the translations may not be perfect, as the text has not been written in your chosen language. If you see a dedicated option for your desired language, click that one instead. These subtitles will likely be an improvement over YouTube's auto-translations."
