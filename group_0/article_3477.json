      "content": "Familiarize yourself with Buddhist teachings. Begin your path to becoming a monk by understanding the basics about Buddhism. Check out books from the library, do research on line, and if possible, take classes from an instructor who has been ordained as a monk. The Buddha doesn't force anyone to believe, but asks disciples to prove the tenants true based on their own investigation of the religion. Here are the fundamentals you should know: Study the Eightfold Path, which is the way to the end of all suffering. The path consists of the right understanding, right speech, right intention, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right action and right livelihood. Learn the four noble truths, which contain the essence of Buddhism. A simple version of the four noble truths is that suffering exists, it arises from attachment to wants, the condition stops when the attachment to desire stops and freedom from suffering is possible through the Eightfold Path.

Practicing Buddhism as a layperson will give you valuable insight into what it's like to be part of a Buddhist community, which is central to becoming a monk. You'll want to become a regular part of the community for months, or even years, before you take the next step to become a monk. Check your phone book or look online for a Buddhist center near you. Be an active participant of the temple. Some sanghas offer introductory courses where you can learn more about Buddhism. Others schedule retreats to help you grow in your faith. Not all Buddhist communities are alike. Like other types of religious institutions, some are more traditional, while others have changed with modern times. Find a community that fits with your views and is appealing to you. It may also be helpful to visit Buddhist temples in other cities or even other countries to get a well-rounded view of the Buddhist community."

      "content": "Spend time meditating. Becoming a Buddhist monk requires daily meditation and a conscious effort to change how the mind works.

      "content": "Prepare to give up your worldly possessions. Monks live as mendicants, meaning they possess only what is required for a very simple quality of life, nothing more. You'll be provided with clothing, sundries, and other items you need to stay comfortable from day to day. However, electronic devices, expensive clothes or shoes, and anything that could be considered a luxury item is not allowed. Monks are not allowed to possess items that could inspire emotions like greed, envy or possessiveness. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Realize that your Buddhist community will become your new family.",
      "content": "Realize that your Buddhist community will become your new family. Once you join a monastery, your life will be devoted to your Buddhist community. Your days will be spent in service of others, and your focus will be on those who need your help. You will have little contact with your family, and will be encouraged to think of your Buddhist community as your new family. Before pursuing ordination, you may want to discuss this with your family and let them know what is to come. Some monasteries don't accept candidates who are married or have other strong relationship ties. Single people are more able to devote themselves to the teachings of Buddhism, since they don't have outside forces pulling their attention away."

      "title": "Be ready to take a vow of chastity.",
      "content": "Be ready to take a vow of chastity. Monks do not engage in sexual behavior of any kind. In some cases male and female monks (or nuns) are not allowed to communicate with one another about matters that aren't related to everyday business. It is wise to practice chastity before becoming ordained so that you can find out whether you're suited to a chaste life. The idea is that the energy you'd normally put into sex is directed to matters greater than the self."

      "title": "Decide what kind of commitment you want to make.",
      "content": "Decide what kind of commitment you want to make. In some traditions, ordination is meant to be a lifelong commitment. However, there are other traditions in which it's perfectly fine to pursue ordination for a limited number of months or years. In Tibet, for example, many men complete two or three-month ordinations to develop their spiritual identities before eventually getting married or pursuing careers. Make sure the monastery you're interested in joining offers the level of commitment you want. If you're not sure, it's possible to do a two or three-month ordination, then pursue a longer-term ordination later."
