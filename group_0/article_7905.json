      "content": "Remove hard water stains with a vinegar solution. If you see calcium deposits (also known as limescale) on your faucets, you have hard water. To tackle this problem, mix equal parts water and white vinegar. Dip a cloth in the solution. Lay the cloth on the stains or deposits and let it sit there for five minutes. Wipe the area when the five minutes are up. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Polish the nickel.",
      "content": "Polish the nickel. Apply a small amount of nickel polish to a clean cloth. Aim for a dollop, about the diameter of a nickel or ten-pence coin. Buff the surface in gentle circular strokes. This will give the nickel an added shine and reduce the risk of staining in the near future. Do this about once per week. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the manufacturer's instructions.",
      "content": "Check the manufacturer's instructions. Consult your user's manual if you have one. If you don't have a hard copy or file of a user's manual, check the manufacturer's website. Some manufacturers specify certain cleaning substances, cloths, or sponges to use in the cleaning process. No matter what you read or hear elsewhere, always defer to the manufacturer's advice."

      "content": "Use dish soap for everyday cleaning. Water can stain brushed steel, but regular cleanings can prevent them from becoming an eyesore. Squeeze a few drops of soap onto a damp cloth.

      "title": "Combat limescale with a vinegar solution.",
      "content": "Combat limescale with a vinegar solution. Mix equal parts water and white vinegar. Soak a cloth in the solution. Wipe down the surface using gentle circular strokes. Don't lay the cloth on the surface. Even diluted vinegar can ruin a brushed nickel surface from too much exposure. Use a clean dry cloth to dry the surface, moving in gentle circular strokes. Continue until the metal is completely dry. If the vinegar doesn't work by itself, add a tablespoon (15 g) of cornstarch to the solution and repeat the process."
