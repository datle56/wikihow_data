      "content": "Practice what you’ll say, and pick a good time to say it. Knowing what you’ll say beforehand helps you to stay on track and deliver your pitch and reasoning without a hiccup. Write down a script and say it aloud in the mirror. Then, choose a time when your parents are in a good mood, which will make them more receptive. [1] X Research source Avoid asking when they’re tired or stressed, like when they just get home from work."

      "title": "Ask kindly, patiently, and directly.",
      "content": "Ask kindly, patiently, and directly. Parents put up their guards when you dance around the subject or try to butter them up, so come right out with it! Simply ask your parents for what you want, and explain why it’s important to you. Let them know whatever is involved, like a parent signature. Listen to their questions, and respond calmly with all the information you have. You can say: “Mom, Dad, I want to get another ear piercing. It’s my favorite way to express myself, and I’d really like your permission to get it done.” Or, say, “Hey Mom. I’ve been thinking that I want another piercing, but I wanted to make sure it’s okay with you first.”"

      "title": "Tell them exactly what kind of piercing you want.",
      "content": "Tell them exactly what kind of piercing you want. There are a lot of different types of ear piercings, like a tragus, or a rook and helix. [2] X Research source Show your parents you’ve researched and thought a lot about the placement and jewelry you can wear for it. Use every opportunity to show them that you’ve put thought into it. For example, say: “I would really like a helix piercing, which is at the top cartilage part of the ear.” Also show them a diagram of ear piercing placement to help them visualize what the piercing would be like on your ear. If you know of any online stores with the jewelry you want for the piercing, show them to your parents."

      "title": "Remind them that they have allowed piercings before.",
      "content": "Remind them that they have allowed piercings before. When persuading your folks , point out that they’ve given their permission for your previous ear piercings, and this one will be no different. That said, avoid challenging their judgment or saying things like, “What changed?” or “How is this different?” which may backfire. If you’ve gotten your earlobes pierced once, for example, explain that a second lobe piercing is essentially the same thing, with the same method for piercing and same healing time. For example, you might say, “I thought it wouldn’t be a big deal, since I already have one, but I wanted to be sure.”"

Pro piercer Roger Rodriguez says to remind them of anything that’ll give you “extra points toward them saying yes,” especially things like good grades. Other things like extracurriculars, volunteer work, or helping around the house also helps persuade them that you’ve earned it. If you have a birthday or other gift-giving holiday coming up, you can say that the ear piercing you want is at the top of your wish list for gifts."

      "content": "Explain that ear piercings aren’t permanent. Let your parents know that you plan to keep this piercing forever, to convince them of how much you want it. But also say that, if they’re concerned about the permanent nature of piercings, piercing holes naturally close over time if you really decide you don’t want them anymore. [3] X Research source Note gauges do require minor surgery to close stretched ear piercings."

      "content": "Offer to wait for an answer, or for another opportunity. Be patient to prove to your parents that this is a piercing you will want to keep forever. If they say no the first time you ask, try to agree on a later time you can reopen the issue with them. Or, wait a couple weeks or months to come back with them with a new argument. You might say: “You don’t have to give me an answer right now. Can I ask you for your answer tomorrow, after you’ve thought about it?” Or, if they say no, ask them with a new strategy or angle. If they denied a piercing in return for good grades, wait until you’ve accomplished something else, then use that as leverage."

      "content": "Find a quality piercer with good reviews. Professional piercer Roger Rodriguez says to find “a studio that has a reputable business and name” and “to see what their policy is in piercing a minor.” Search online for piercing places that are certified and licensed by the state. Let your parents know that you’ve done your research and that you are going to a reputable piercer. Also, call or visit the location to verify the cleanliness and safety of the building, equipment, and staff. Have your parents accompany you or talk to the staff of a piercing place themselves, if they want to. A piercer who requires a guardian’s permission to pierce minors is generally more trustworthy and favorable to parents. Make sure to check Google, Yelp, or other sites with ratings and reviews from real people to see what they have to say about their experience at the piercing place."

Or, agree to participate in volunteer or extracurricular activities if that’s something your parents want you to do more of. Give your parents something specific, both to show that you’re willing to work for what you want and that you can make specific goals.
