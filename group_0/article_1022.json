      "title": "Locate and release the crown.",
      "content": "Locate and release the crown. On the right side of a Rolex there is a small, circular dial called the “crown” that allows you to control the mechanism of the watch. Unscrew the crown and pull it out from the watch base. Once the crown is extended, it puts the watch in position to be wound to change the time. The crown dial is found in the same position on all Rolex models."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the crown all the way out.",
      "content": "Pull the crown all the way out. After unscrewing and releasing the crown, make sure it is pulled out all the way. Pulling the crown out to its first position allows you to wind the watch to make sure it’s keeping accurate time, while the second position determines the day and display date and extending it fully to the third position lets you manipulate the hour and minute hands. If your Rolex replica has the wrong day displayed, make this change first, then proceed to adjust the time. [1] X Research source Both hands of the watch will stop completely when the crown is pulled all the way out. On certain models, the display date can be changed from the third position. Otherwise, this position will only be used for adjusting the watch's exact time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rotate the crown to change the time.",
      "content": "Rotate the crown to change the time. Now that the crown is in the proper position, rotate it clockwise to wind the gears inside the watch and change the position of the hour and minute hands. Twist the crown slowly so that you don’t overshoot the correct time. If you do wind it too far, you can rotate it counterclockwise until both hands are where they need to be. [2] X Research source Rotating the crown counterclockwise also allows you to change the display date on some Rolex models. You may have to do a little testing to find out which position the crown on your particular model needs to be in to manipulate the date."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure the crown.",
      "content": "Secure the crown. If you’re satisfied that you have the correct time, return the crown to it’s original position by pushing it back into the base of the watch. Screw the crown into place to secure it. That’s it! Rolex watches are prized for their simple, intuitive design and ease of use, which is another reason they are so often imitated. [3] X Research source Screw the crown back into its resting position to make sure it is completely secured. If not, the crown may accidentally enter another position and throw off the time or date of your display. Securing the crown on an authentic Rolex also forms a seal that keeps the watch waterproof. This may or may not be the case for a replica Rolex."

      "title": "Wind it regularly.",
      "content": "Wind it regularly. Mechanical watches need to be wound by hand periodically to ensure that the mechanical parts are being given enough kinetic energy to stay in motion and keep time accurately. Rolex technicians recommend winding their watches about 20 rotations once a month or so; if you’re using a knock-off, the watch will probably lose time faster and you might need to wind it more frequently. [4] X Research source To wind a Rolex-style watch, unscrew and release the crown until it is in the first position. Don’t pull it out any further. The crown will then be ready to rotated, winding the watch’s mechanical innards. Wind the crown stem until you start to feel resistance, then push the crown back into place and screw to secure it. [5] X Research source Wind your watch every few days to keep it from losing time."

    {
      "title": "Wear it more often.",
      "content": "Wear it more often. As a rule, the more you wear your watch, the better time it keeps. The kinetic energy generated by wearing the watch on your wrist as it moves is transferred to the watch to keep the gears running. Make sure your watch is getting plenty of wear, or you may find that it is becoming less accurate. [6] X Research source If you’re not in the habit of wearing a watch, or are for some reason unable to, consider purchasing a watch-winder. Watch-winders are small devices that rotate your unworn watch continuously, mimicking natural motion. Leaving your watch on a watch-winder when you’re not wearing it can prevent it from losing time as quickly. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Get it serviced as needed.",
      "content": "Get it serviced as needed. Watches, like cars and other mechanical appliances, require regular service. Take your Rolex replica to a watch specialist once or twice a year to have it inspected for mechanical flaws. A watch specialist can alter and replace springs, repair broken gears and keep the watch running like new. Watchmakers and specialists can usually identify tough to explain mechanical problems that might cause your watch to run poorly or stop altogether. Certain mechanical parts may wear out faster on replica models. It might be a good idea to get these parts replaced every so often."

      "title": "Avoid exposing it to harsh conditions.",
      "content": "Avoid exposing it to harsh conditions. Replica Rolexes, while fine watches in their own right, are not made to quite the same specifications as the real thing, and as a result are more easily upset or damaged. Try not to expose your watch to excess moisture, and be careful about dropping it or allowing it to absorb impact. Even if these things don’t break your watch outright, they may hinder the internal mechanics enough to render it unusable. [8] X Research source Mechanical watches are also susceptible to changes in gravity, polar positioning and magnetism. They require greater care and upkeep than digital and satellite watches. [9] X Research source If you’re planning any sort of dirty or physical activity, it may be best to leave your Rolex replica behind. These watches were designed more for casual wear, and while they may be more capable of withstanding a moderate amount of punishment, it’s better not to take chances."
