      "content": "Write the names of your guest or guests on the first line of the envelope. How you address the envelopes will vary based on their marital and/ or professional status. Address women according to their marital status or their professional titles. Married women often use \"Mrs.\" In some cases, the person might prefer \"Ms.\" For divorced women or women over the age of 18, \"Ms.\" is an excellent option. For younger women, you may also use \"Miss.\" For example: \"Mrs. Charlotte Smith,\" \"Ms. Lily Smith.\" Address all men by their names preceded by \"Mr.\" For example: \"Mr. John Smith.\" If you are addressing an envelope to a man with the same name as his father, or his son, include \"Jr.\" or \"Sr.\" at the end of each name, respectively. For example: \"Mr. Christopher Smith, Jr.\" or \"Mr. Christopher Smith junior\". If a man has the same name as his father and grandfather and is considered \"the third\" or beyond, use Roman numerals to address him. For example, \"Mr. Christopher Smith IV.\" Address couples based on their marital status. Addressing unmarried couples is different from how you address married couples. Address married couples as \"Mr.\" and \"Mrs.\" followed by the man's name. [1] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 16 February 2022. For example, \"Mr. and Mrs. Christopher Smith.\" Address unmarried couples who live together by their names preceded by their appropriate titles. For example, \"Ms. Jane Doe\" and \"Mr. John Smith.\" Address men and women with their professional titles when applicable. [2] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 16 February 2022. Address the envelope with their title, which does not require that \"Mr.,\" \"Mrs.,\" \"Miss,\" or \"Ms.\" precede it. Different titles people may use include \"Dr.\" \"Reverend\" or \"Judge.\" If you are not sure of a person's formal title and cannot locate this information, a good rule of thumb to use is to \"elevate\" the position you think they have. For example, if you're not sure someone is a Captain or General in the military, write their title as \"General.\" This way, you won't offend anyone. The following is a list of titles you may encounter in addressing your formal envelope: [3] X Research source Include the names of children on envelopes at your discretion. If children are not invited to the event, do not include them on the envelope. If you are inviting children, write only their first names on the second line underneath their parents."

      "content": "Verify all of the appropriate information. Check names, titles, and addresses. Use high quality, plain white or ivory paper and envelopes that either come as a set or match. This is a visual cue to their professional nature. Use address and return labels or envelopes that are typed or printed if possible. Printed or typed labels and envelopes are considered more professional. Use envelopes printed for your business if you have them. Formal business envelopes feature the name, address, and logo of a particular business. Use typed or printed envelopes with your business address if you do not have formal, pre-printed business envelopes with a logo. Neatly handwrite in block letters the name and address information in black or blue ink if you cannot type or print your business envelope."

Use \"Attention:\" to indicate the recipient followed by their title. For example: \"Attention: Mr. John Smith,\" \"Attention: Dr. Charlotte Parker.\" Use the same rules for titles for business as you do for formal events. Some exceptions are for accountants and lawyers. For example: \"Attention: Mr. John Smith, CPA,\" or Attention: Attorney Charlotte Parker.\" With lawyers, you can also write \"Charlotte Parker, Esquire\" without \"Ms.\" With women, the default title in business is \"Ms.\" unless you know the person prefers \"Mrs.\" If they have another title such as \"Dr.\" or \"Rabbi,\" use that title instead. Use the position title only if you do not know the recipient's full name. For example, if you are sending a letter to the president of a particular company, address the envelope with a phrase such as: \"To the President.\" [6] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 16 February 2022."
