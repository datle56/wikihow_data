Don’t worry if you don’t see anything on the screen immediately; in a few minutes, you should see the Roku logo animation on the screen. Lost your remote? Luckily, newer remotes have a special \"remote finder\" button that you can use to find it ! On the Let’s get started screen, your Roku remote should start to pair automatically when it turns on. If it doesn’t pair, press and hold the pairing button for about 3 - 5 seconds until the green pairing light on the back of the Roku remote starts flashing."
