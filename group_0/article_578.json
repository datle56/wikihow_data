      "content": "Understand embedding. An embedded game looks like part of your web page, but is still hosted on the original website, not using your bandwidth. If the original website takes down the game, it will disappear from your website as well. Embedding is fairly safe, but malicious content may alter your website appearance, open pop-up windows, or run plugins. Embed content from trustworthy sites only, or learn how to alter the HTML to limit its access. [1] X Research source"

Copy the snippet labeled \"Embed this game,\" underneath the game description. Kongregate sponsored games : Visit the \"games for your site\" page. Copy the \"Embed\" code next to the game you want to host. Warning — this should be HTML code inside an <iframe>, <embed>, or <object> tag.

Some games are made in HTML or, rarely, in other formats, but make sure you recognize the file extension before uploading it. If you are using a free web hosting service such as WordPress, you may need to install a plugin first in order to host the game. Look for a Flash player plugin to host a Flash game. Some web hosts do not allow .swf files or other game files. In this case, upload the file to a free content hosting website, then link to it using an <embed> tag as described below."

If you would rather place the game inside an ordinary HTML page next to other content, you can use an <embed>, <iframe>, or <object> tag: For a very basic embedding of a Flash game, write <embed src=\"InsertGameURL\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed>. There are many ways to modify this tag. Follow the embed method above to find examples to learn from. Some downloaded game files will come with a text document that includes embedding code to copy-paste to your site. Make sure you understand what the code does before uploading. Change the link to the file you uploaded instead of the original website."
