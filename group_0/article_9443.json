    {
      "title": "Strike the correct tone.",
      "content": "Strike the correct tone. Keep in mind that you’re writing an email to someone in a position to do great things for you professionally. Your email should sound professional , and you should come across as polite and respectful. Don’t be overly familiar. It might seem like a good idea to write to him in a friendly way to get his attention, but it could backfire. Avoid saying things like “Hey Mark!” or “What’s up?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Structure the email correctly.",
      "content": "Structure the email correctly . You should begin your email with “Dear Mr. Cuban,” not anything like \"Hey,\" or with no salutation at all. Make sure you use proper grammar and use complete sentences–stay away from internet abbreviations. You should also have multiple paragraphs–one to introduce yourself, one to introduce your business or idea, and one to ask for Cuban's input."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include the basic relevant information.",
      "content": "Include the basic relevant information. People who have been successful in cold emailing Mark Cuban have answered three basic questions up front. They've told Cuban what they’re doing, why they’re doing it, and what their traction is (how much interest there is in their business or product). [4] X Research source Introduce yourself by sharing your name, any educational background you have, and how much business experience you have. You can also add something to catch his interest. For example, maybe you've been starting businesses since elementary school. Keep your answers to these questions short – two or three sentences each. They should each have their own paragraph, as well. If you already have a product, have started promotions or hired staff, include that in your paragraph on your business or product’s traction. Be direct when you ask for his help/input. You can say something as simple as \"I think you can see how devoted I am to this business and how much potential for success it has. Would you be willing to develop it with me?\" [5] X Research source If you already have investors, include a list of their names and affiliations."

    {
      "title": "Keep it brief.",
      "content": "Keep it brief. Cuban is a busy individual who receives a large quantity of emails per day. If you send him a long email right from the start, he might skip over it. Giving him a short email packed with only vital information is a far better option. The email should only be 3 to 4 paragraphs. [6] X Research source If he likes your idea, he will reply asking for additional detail. Provide that detail after he asks for it, not before."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give it a day or two.",
      "content": "Give it a day or two. People who have successfully heard back from Cuban typically say that the investor replies within 24 hours. Once you email him, give it a day or two before you contact him again. [7] X Research source If you decide to contact him again, make it short and sweet.
