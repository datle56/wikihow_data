      "content": "Balance budget against power. Graphics cards can easily become the most expensive component in your computer, but they don't have to be. According to Ham, many budget and mid-range cards can still provide great performance, depending on your needs. [1] X Expert Source Matt Ham Computer Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. If you are a gaming enthusiast who has to play the newest games at the highest possible settings, you'll want to look for the more powerful and expensive cards. If you only game occasionally, aren't worried about the newest releases, or don't mind sacrificing a few graphics settings, you can get much more bang for your buck by looking at mid-range cards. If you just want to watch HD video or play a few 2D games, most budget cards should do the trick. Do your research before putting your money down. Check out sites like https://www.tomshardware.com , https://www.pcworld.com , and https://gpu.userbenchmark.com for GPU comparisons and reviews. These test results can help you quickly see how all of the available options stack up against each other. Take VRAM into consideration. In most modern graphics cards, this is called GDDR or GDDR SDRAM. As of February 2025, the newest generation of GDDR SDRAM is GDDR7. While the newest generation of GDDR will always be faster and more efficient than the last, they will also be more expensive. The amount of VRAM on a GPU is also important if you're a gamer who likes to play with the highest graphics settings. Most modern games need at least 8GB of VRAM, but check out some of your favorite games to see what their recommended specs are to see what works best for you. If you have a mid-range CPU, you're likely not going to get the most out of a high-end graphics card. The graphics card is an important factor for performance, but games rely on all of the components in your computer in differing capacities, including the CPU, the system RAM, and even the hard drive read and write speed."

      "content": "Open your computer case. Before buying your new graphics card, you'll want to check a few things inside your case or in your computer's documentation. Remove the side panel from your computer by loosening the thumbscrews or regular Phillips screws along the back. Typically, you'll remove the panel opposite to the motherboard's Input/Output panel on the back of the computer. Except in rare circumstances, it is not possible to upgrade the graphics card on a laptop. Refer to your laptop's documentation to determine how to upgrade its graphics card if possible. When opening your case and working inside your computer, make sure that you are properly grounded. This will help prevent electrostatic discharge that can damage your computer components. Ground yourself using an anti-static wrist strap, wear clothes that don't generate a lot of static electricity, and don't work in an area with carpets or rugs."

      "content": "Examine your power supply. Graphics cards are one of the biggest draws on your power supply, so you'll want to ensure that your power supply can handle the power requirements of the new card. Different cards draw different amounts of power, so check the specs on the card you want to buy and the specs on your computer's power supply. There are a variety of power supply calculators online that you can use to enter in all of your components and see the minimum recommended wattage. You'll want a little more than the minimum to future-proof your computer. Another general rule you can follow is that you typically will want a power supply that supplies double the wattage that your graphics card requires. There is no way to determine a power supply's wattage without physically looking at it. There is no software that can report the wattage. Nearly all power supplies have a sticker that is clearly visible on the side, which will tell you the power supply's specifications. You can usually just remove the side panel from your computer and visually inspect the sticker. Many of the more powerful graphics cards require one or two 6-pin connectors (PCIe) from the power supply. Most newer power supplies should have these cables, but older power supplies will not. You can get adapters to connect to one of the other cables, but you may be better off replacing the power supply anyway if it's that old."

[2] X Expert Source Yaffet Meshesha Computer Specialist Expert Interview. 10 February 2021. Graphics cards have gotten quite large, and if you have a small case with tight spaces, it may be difficult or even impossible to insert the card you want. Use a tape measure to measure the space where your graphics card will be inserted. Check this space against the specifications of the graphics cards you are looking at. Pay attention to the width as well, as many of the more powerful cards can be quite wide. A graphics card may take up the width of two PCIe bays, but it will only need to plug into one slot. Alternatively, you can look up your motherboard and case to see their specifications on their manufacturer's websites. These specs should include information about the maximum GPU size."

      "title": "Check your motherboard's compatibility.",
      "content": "Check your motherboard's compatibility. All modern graphics cards run on the PCIe interface, which replaced the outdated AGP method. If your computer was purchased or built in the last fifteen years, chances are it uses PCIe. If you're trying to upgrade the graphics card on a really old computer, you may be stuck with AGP unless you upgrade the motherboard as well. PCIe and AGP slots are colored differently on the motherboard. AGP is typically a darker color, such as brown, while PCIe is usually white, yellow, or blue. There is no standard, however, so refer to your motherboard's documentation or look for labels next to the slots. PCIe slots are typically located closest to the CPU on the motherboard."

      "content": "Check the ports on the GPU compared to your monitor(s). Modern GPUs will likely have a combination of HDMI and DisplayPort ports to plug in your monitor(s). Compare this to the ports on your monitor(s). If you have just one monitor with at least an HDMI or DisplayPort port, it's unlikely that you'll have any issues connecting the monitor to your GPU. If you have multiple monitors with only HDMI ports, you may not have enough HDMI ports on the GPU. If this is the case, you will need to purchase an HDMI to DisplayPort cable or an adapter. If your monitor has a VGA or DVI port, you'll need to use an adapter. VGA/DVI to HDMI/DisplayPort cables do exist, but the adapters may be easier to find."

      "content": "Remove your previous graphics card (if necessary). If you are upgrading, you'll need to remove your old graphics card before installing your new one. If you were using your motherboard's onboard graphics card, you may not have a card to remove. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver to remove the screw(s) that is securing the old card to the case. Unplug any cables connected to the old graphics card. Undo the latch underneath the back end of the old graphics card (PCIe). This latch helps secure the graphics card, so make sure to unlatch it before pulling the old card out. Note: not every motherboard has a latch to secure this PCIe slot, so you may be able to skip this step. Gently pull the old card directly out of the slot. Pull the old card straight out of the slot. You may have to be firm, but don't force it out. If you can't pull the card out, make sure that the latch has been released and the Phillips screw has been removed from the card's bracket."

Find your graphics drivers in the list of installed programs. For NVIDIA, this will usually be \"NVIDIA Graphics Driver XXX.XX\". If you are removing AMD/ATI drivers, look for \"AMD Catalyst Install Manager\". Follow the prompts to uninstall the drivers. For NVIDIA, highlight the driver, click Uninstall , and then follow the prompts.
