      "content": "Check the doctor’s order sheet and the IV sheet for the patient. Counter check the IV label, the bottle number, the type of solution, the amount of solution, the additives(if necessary), the duration of infusion and the IV flow rate. Confirming all of these details will ensure the patient receives the right amount and type of IV solution. Always counter check the data in the patient’s chart because the doctor’s orders vary from person to person, For example, patient 1 and 2 may have the same type of IV fluid but they will each have a different regulation per minute.

      "content": "Determine what type of fluid is in the new IV bag. The type of fluid will affect how often you need to change the patient’s IV. The normal lifespan of an IV solution without an additive is 72 hours, so after 72 hours, it will need to be changed. [4] X Research source www.healthline.com/health/intravenous-fluid-regulation IV bags with additives need to be changed every 24 hours. As well, most IV bags with medications have a lifespan of 24 hours. IV solutions with additives have a shorter life span since the effectiveness of the additive or medication needs to be accounted for. IV bags with food substitutes like Lipid or TPN need to be changed every 24 hours, as just like solid food, these substitutes can go bad or spoil. If there are any TPNs and lipids left in the bag when you change it, they should be discarded. Keep in mind that regardless of what type of solution is in the IV bags, IV lines need to be changed every 24 hours. This prevents the tubing from clogging due to the different additives or TPN attached to the tubing."

If the flow rate is too fast, move the roller of the roller clamp downwards. If the flow rate is too slow, move the roller of the roller clamp upwards.
