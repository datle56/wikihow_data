Instead, they use a variety of mobile phone prefixes that used to denote which carrier the number was with, but since people now move their phone numbers with them if they switch cellular carriers, this isn't a reliable way to determine the correct mobile code. You will need to ask the person you wish to call for the mobile code. There is no other way of knowing it with certainty unless you find out directly. All mobile area codes start with the number 7 and are followed by three more digits. An example of a mobile number is 011-44-7xxx-xxxxxx"
