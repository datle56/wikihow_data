While it's true some people shouldn't be trusted, it doesn't mean that everyone is not trustworthy. Think about what it costs you when you doubt someone; their time, their presence, their love, and perhaps even their friendship. For example, if someone calls and says they will be late, then it simply means they are running late and nothing more. Even if there is a pattern of lateness, it doesn't mean they're up to something else based solely on this one trait, however much you dislike it. If you're having a hard time believing someone, say to yourself, “I am choosing to believe they are telling me the truth.”"

However, being proven right about someone's untrustworthy behavior doesn't actually help you experience trust or safety. Instead of keeping your attention on all the ways people can and might hurt you, shift your focus to behaviors that prove people can be counted on, trusted, and relied upon. For example, if someone says they will meet you for lunch and they show up, prove to yourself that they said they'd do something and they did it."
