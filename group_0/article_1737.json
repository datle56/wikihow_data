      "content": "Cancer is more in touch with his emotions than Libra is. As an Air sign, Libra might have a hard time understanding her emotionally-driven Cancer man. For the intuitive Water sign, how he feels about something is more important than the cold, hard facts. Everything is fine as long as they agree, but they can run into problems if she thinks his feelings don't reflect reality. Cancer, a Libra woman tends to set aside her emotions to evaluate issues objectively. This can cause you to think she's cold-hearted at times, but because she values harmony and justice, you can count on her to make the right choice. Libra, your Cancer man has a sixth sense about things that isn't always rational or logical. Trust him to do what's right, even if it doesn't make sense to you in the moment. Keep an eye out for Cancer's changing moods. More importantly, be willing to give him space when he needs it, and trust that he will come back around in a couple of days as a new man."

      "content": "Libra tends to be more objective than her Cancerian mate. When it comes to emotions, a Cancer guy gets a double shot—he's not only a Water sign but also ruled by the Moon, the astral body that represents emotions. It's not that reasoning and logic are lost on him, but his subjective feelings are far more important to him than objective reason. This means you tend to approach issues differently, even if you often come to the same conclusion. Cancer, recognize that your feelings can destroy your objectivity. Lean on your Libra lady to show you a different perspective so you can appreciate all sides of an issue. Libra, open yourself to Cancer's strong intuition. He can teach you more about the emotional side of the issues you analyze."

This can seem like a waste of time to a Cancer guy, who often relies on his intuition and gut feelings to make a decision. Cancer, you'll come closer to persuading your Libra lady of something if you can list a few facts that back up your point of view.

If you ask how he feels about something and take that into consideration, he'll feel like he's being heard and respected."

He can be prone to jealousy and possessiveness, which Libra might like in small doses, but not if it threatens her independence. Cancer, remind yourself that your Libra lady is thoroughly devoted to justice and equality. She would never do anything to upset the harmonious balance of your relationship. Libra, show your loyalty through your actions so your Cancer guy knows that he never has any reason to doubt you. Empathize with him and offer reassurance to counter his insecurity rather than lashing out or telling him he's not being reasonable."
