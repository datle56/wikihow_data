Check the tags on the clothes to make sure that you can bleach them– otherwise, you could damage or discolor the material. On the tag, there should also be information about how to care for and launder the clothing item. Make sure to keep this information in mind the bleaching process. [1] X Research source If you can't find washing instructions on a tag, you can find them online, at least for certain brands of clothing."

      "content": "Test the clothes to make sure they are safe to bleach. If there is no tag, or you are unsure if the clothes are safe for bleach, you can test them by placing a small amount of bleach on a hidden location like the inside of a collar, cuff, or pant leg. Add a small dab of bleach and wait to see if it discolors or damages the spot. If not, then the clothes are safe to bleach.

[4] X Research source Agitate the clothes by sloshing them around in the bleach water. Allow them to soak for at least ten minutes. If the clothes have not gotten whiter after 10 minutes , or if you still see stains on them, you can let them soak for an additional 5 minutes."
