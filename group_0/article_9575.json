Try to act confidently natural when you're around your crush. Make eye contact, smile, and listen to what they're saying. Also, try not to fidget too much, since that can make you look more nervous.

      "content": "Coach yourself through difficult moments. There are going to be times when you feel especially self-conscious, whether because of circumstance or personal factors, and when this happens use your internal voice to guide yourself through the situation. Remind yourself that this is only a feeling, one that you'll likely have again if you haven't already, and tell yourself in encouraging words how you will proceed. An example you might consider: \"Alright. I'm really nervous, but that's OK. I've been nervous around guys I like before. I know I can get this work done, all I have to do is focus. So I'm going to turn my attention to this for a while, and I can think about him later.\""

      "content": "Breathe. When strong feelings threaten to overwhelm you, it is natural to respond unconsciously by taking shallow breathes. To improve your breathing, for a few breathes try to pay attention only to your inhale and exhale. This will restore your conscious attention to your body and its need for full, relaxed breathing.

Try not to think about your future together or what might come; focus your thoughts only on that person and their characteristics for the entirety of the time."

      "content": "Condition opposite responses to negative thoughts. Too often, people talk themselves into a negative loop that makes feelings more overwhelming with every passing instant. If you suffer with this condition, find out any automatic negative thoughts you have and interrupt those with an opposing positive thought. For example: \"If he doesn't like me I'll be so embarrassed and then people will think I'm a loser. Wait a minute. I had friends before I started liking him, so I know I'll have friends afterwards, too. I guess it's silly to put so much self-worth on this.\""

      "content": "Exaggerate your greatest fear. Tell the entire dramatic story playing in your head to yourself several times. Make sure you complete the story by taking it to its natural extreme. By the third or fourth time, you should be better able to recognize the absurdity of these extreme, yet natural, thoughts. \"If I ask him out on a date and he rejects me, everyone will talk about it forever. I'll never stop hearing, for the rest of my life, about the one time I asked this guy out. It will haunt me through college and my professional life, because everyone will already know.\" NOTE: this technique is intended to reveal warped perspective to the person using it. If you find yourself truly believing these things and unable to see how your perspective is off kilter, talk to an adult or a mental health professional."
