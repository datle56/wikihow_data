      "title": "Choose a carbonated beverage.",
      "content": "Choose a carbonated beverage. A freshly opened canned beverage will provide the most carbonation. To burp loudly you will want to drink the beverage as fast as possible. Choose something that you like, so you’ll want to drink fast. Be careful that it’s not too sweet, or it may upset your stomach. Pick a drink that is cold but not so cold that it hurts to drink quickly. Avoid drinks that have gone flat and have been open for a long time."

      "title": "Drink the beverage as fast as you can.",
      "content": "Drink the beverage as fast as you can. The more carbonation you are able to take in, the larger the burp you can release will be. Take large back to back gulps of the drink, and try to finish it in one attempt. You don’t need to take large mouthfuls, smaller sips will introduce more air as you swallow. Resist the urge to let out small burps as you drink."

      "title": "Release the burp.",
      "content": "Release the burp. Let the accumulated gas go all at once. The sound of your burp will reflect the amount of air you are releasing from your stomach. Open your mouth. Squeeze your stomach muscles similar to the feeling of vomiting. Let the air escape your stomach."

      "content": "Imagine you have a large bite of food in your mouth. To swallow air, you need to go through the motions of swallowing without food. Think of the feeling of having a mouthful of food."

      "title": "Open your mouth to release the burp.",
      "content": "Open your mouth to release the burp. Give the air a way to escape your stomach by opening your mouth. An open mouth allows the air to resonate and creates a louder sound."

      "title": "Force the burp out of your stomach.",
      "content": "Force the burp out of your stomach. Wretch your stomach and diaphragm muscles to squeeze the air out of your stomach and force the burp to emerge. Keep your throat and mouth open to allow as much air to escape as possible. A longer burp will generate louder sounds. Contract your diaphragm muscles towards the end of your burp to squeeze any remaining air out. Keep your mouth open during the burp so the sound is not muffled."
