      "content": "Think about things she likes, things you like about her, and things you have in common. You can pull a lot of ideas from the connection you’ve built and what you know about your girlfriend. Use these lists as inspiration for gift ideas. For instance, if you know she loves cooking, you could get her an apron printed with some of your favorite pictures together."

      "content": "She’ll appreciate something that she can use every day. Many people appreciate practical gifts. Be careful with this option, though; you don’t want to give something too boring or mundane. A good question to ask yourself is, “Is this something she will eventually wind up buying for herself if I don’t?” If the answer is yes, don’t buy it. A good gift should be something she loves and/or can use, but she would not buy for herself. [1] X Research source For instance, maybe she keeps eyeing a fancy kitchen gadget, but she never has the extra cash to shell out for it, which would make it the perfect gift."

      "content": "It's possible she's intentionally dropped a hint about something she may want. Alternatively, maybe you two have talked about something she's really into lately, which can help guide your gift. Using what she says as a source of gift-giving inspiration will ensure you get her something she genuinely likes, and show her that you listen to what she says. For instance, maybe she's said, \"Taylor Swift's music always makes me happy. I really want to get her new CD.\""

      "content": "Ask her for a list of things or types of things she's had her eye on. Use good judgment here; some girls will appreciate your consideration in asking, while others may find it strange. If you do ask her for help, avoid just asking, “What do you want?” This way she won't know exactly what she's getting."

To make a bath bomb, simply mix 2 cups of cornstarch with 1 cup of citric acid, and 1 3/4 a cup of baking soda by shaking it through a sieve. [4] X Research source Fill up small spray bottles with water. If you want to color your bath fizzies, add 6 drops of food coloring. [5] X Research source Measure out 1 cup of powered mixture. Use the spray bottles to add small amounts of water to the powder. Mix it up after each spray. The mixture is ready when it holds together when squeezed. [6] X Research source Add in the essential oil. For an essential oil with a heavy fragrance (such as peppermint), add 5 drops; use 6 if it's lighter (such as lemon). Stir the fragrance in. Put the mixture in small baking molds, preferably ones that hold about 1/4 cup, enough for one bath. If smaller, use two bath bombs per bath. Repeat for the rest of the dry mixture.

While some girls may appreciate feeling like they are in a romantic comedy, most will prefer a gift that shows you really know them, and don’t think of them as a two-dimensional stereotype. If you are out of time and ideas, at least consider buying a stuffed version of her favorite animal instead of a generic teddy bear, a bouquet of her favorite flowers instead of roses, or a necklace that somehow reminds you of her instead of just a typical heart pendant.
