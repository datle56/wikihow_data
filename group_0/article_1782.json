      "content": "Trim the ends of the roses at a 45-degree angle with sharp gardening shears. Always cut at a downward angle so the roses are able to soak up the water in the vase. Make sure all the stems are the same height. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the roses so they're twice as tall as the vase you want to use. This will give the roses a nice, long-stemmed appearance. To maintain as much of the long stems as possible, look for a vase that's around 12 inches (30 cm) tall. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove any leaves from the parts of the stems that will be under water.",
      "content": "Remove any leaves from the parts of the stems that will be under water. Anything in the bottom two-thirds of the vase will be below the waterline. It's important that you take off the leaves so they don't sit in the water and develop mold. To take the leaves off, just gently pull on them with your fingers. [3] X Research source Be careful of any thorns on the stems, as you do not want to prick yourself. Wear gardening gloves when you remove the leaves to be safe."

      "title": "Fill the vase 2/3 of the way with water.",
      "content": "Fill the vase 2/3 of the way with water. Use filtered water in the vase to ensure it is free of impurities. [4] X Research source To make the roses last longer , you can pour 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of powdered flower food in the water and stir it in."

      "title": "Create rows of tape in 1 direction over the mouth of the vase.",
      "content": "Create rows of tape in 1 direction over the mouth of the vase. Attach the tape to 1 end of the opening on the vase and extend it in a straight line to the other end. Continue lining up at least 4-5 pieces tape next to each other so they all face the same direction. Leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of space between each piece of tape. [5] X Research source Make sure the tape is flush to the edge of the vase so the excess tape isn't visible when you put the roses in. Use clear cellophane tape so it's not as noticeable."

      "title": "Run more rows of tape across the vase perpendicular to the first rows.",
      "content": "Run more rows of tape across the vase perpendicular to the first rows. Place a piece of tape in the other direction on the opening of the vase. Layer 4-5 pieces of tape in the other direction over the first row of tape, creating a grid. [6] X Research source Attach the same number of pieces of tape going in both directions so the grid is even."

      "title": "Place a rose in each square on the grid.",
      "content": "Place a rose in each square on the grid. The grid should prevent the roses from leaning to one side. If you run out of squares on the grid, start doubling up by putting 2 roses in each square. [7] X Research source Make sure you angle the roses so the stems fall in the same direction in each row, as this will allow them to sit more evenly in the grid."

      "content": "Adjust any roses that appear too tall or high in the vase. If you notice any of the stems are sitting a bit higher than the others, take it out of the water and use gardening shears to trim it down to size. You want all of the stems to sit at the same height in the vase so they look uniform and even. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Put greenery around the roses for added texture. Use greenery like myrtle, ivy, or leather fern to give the roses more texture and color. Place the greenery around the edges of the vase so they do not overpower the roses. Slide them into the squares on the grid next to the roses so they sit upright. [9] X Research source Make sure you trim the greenery as needed before you put it in the vase so it is the same height, or just a bit taller, than the roses. Always trim the greenery at an angle with sharp gardening shears."

      "content": "Fill the vase with glass beads for a unique look. Before you make the tape grid and add your flowers, fill three-quarters of the vase with the beads. When you add the flowers to the vase, gently press the stems down through the beads until they reach the bottom. Then, water the roses like you normally would. [10] X Research source Make sure the glass beads are clean and free of dirt or dust, as you do not want it to get into the water in the vase."

      "content": "Wrap a ribbon around the vase for added flare. Another option is to put a decorative ribbon or piece of fabric around the vase. You may opt for a seasonal ribbon in holiday colors for a festive look or a brightly colored ribbon to contrast the muted color of the roses. [11] X Research source"
