      "content": "Nurse on the smaller breast first. Your baby's suckling is what triggers your body to produce milk. Also, babies tend to suckle harder when they first start feeding; therefore, if your baby suckles on the smaller breast first when you feed them, it can help trigger milk flow in that breast, helping to balance out the size of your breasts. This solution only works if one breast is producing normally while the other is under producing. If one is overproducing, you may need to drain the milk off to prevent engorgement. Hand-express the overproducing breast for no more than 20 to 30 seconds. Another option is to nurse more often on the smaller side than the larger side."

Your breasts will become larger after you give birth; however, sometimes you may develop engorgement, where your breasts become hard and swollen because milk is getting blocked up inside. Symptoms can include your breast being tender and warm or a throbbing sensation. You might also notice your nipple flattening out or that you are running a light fever (under 100.4째F or 38째C).

When one breast is underperforming and the other one is normal, it's fine to use the smaller one more often to stimulate milk; however, when one is engorged, you need to focus more on it to help release some of the build of up milk, which is causing the problem.

If the baby is not latching, they may not be getting enough milk. [12] X Trustworthy Source US Office on Women's Health U.S. government agency providing resources for women's health Go to source One way to help your baby latch properly is to bring their head up underneath your breast, letting their chin be closest to your breast. Try to get them to touch your breast with their bottom lip on the far bottom side of your areola. That way, they can pull in enough of your breast, situating your nipple towards the back of their mouth. [13] X Research source"
