      "content": "Understand how to add an external hard drive to your computer. While some external hard drives will be usable immediately after plugging them into an available USB port on your computer, most external hard drives need to be formatted to fit your computer's specific file system before you can use them. Formatting is a quick process that you can perform from within your computer's built-in settings."

      "content": "Check your computer's connections. Most computers have USB 3.0 ports—which resemble rectangular holes in the side or front of your computer's housing—but modern Macs and some Microsoft-produced Windows computers use USB-C connections instead: USB 3.0 — A rectangular port found on most computers produced before 2017. Most external hard drives use USB 3.0 connectors. A USB 3.0 Power will usually have the USB logo next to it with the letters \"SS\" for super speed. USB-C — An oval port found on MacBooks and some Microsoft laptops. If you have a USB-C port, you'll either need to buy a USB 3.0 to USB-C adapter or find an external hard drive that includes a USB-C cable. Thunderbolt: Thunderbolt cables are primarily used on Macs and Apple products. The thunderbolt port looks exactly like a USB-C port, except a Thunderbolt port will have an icon that resembles a lightning bolt next to it. While thunderbolt and USB-C ports may look the same, they are not the same thing. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider your space requirements. External hard drives usually come in flavors of anything from 512 gigabytes to several terabytes in size. Make sure that you buy a hard drive that has more space than you need. Generally speaking, it isn't much more expensive to buy a terabyte (1024 gigabytes) hard drive than it is to buy a 512-gigabyte (GB) hard drive. Storage also tends to get cheaper the more of it you buy (e.g., a two-terabyte hard drive will cost significantly less than two one-terabyte hard drives)."

      "content": "Consider your data storage needs. If you need a hard drive to back up and archive your data, you purchase a larger hard drive that sits next to your computer and stays continually connected. On the other hand, if you need something portable that you can take with you and connect to different devices, you will need something smaller and more lightweight."

      "content": "Choose between a traditional hard drive and a solid-state drive. Solid-state drives (SSDs) are significantly faster than traditional external hard drives, but they're also much more expensive. If you're planning on running an operating system or editing software from the external drive, though, an SSD will be better for responsiveness than a traditional hard drive. SSDs are also smaller and more portable, have less moving parts, and are less likely to break."
