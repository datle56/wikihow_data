      "title": "The number 4 symbolizes creation, completion, and order.",
      "content": "The number 4 symbolizes creation, completion, and order. The number 4 occurs frequently through the Bible, and it’s considered an important symbol in Biblical numerology. God created the physical earth on the 4th day, and much of creation revolves around the number 4. There are also 4 consonants in God’s Holy Name YWHW, 4 gospels that provide a complete view of Jesus’ ministry, and 4 mothers of the 12 tribes of Israel. The number 4 also frequently appears in Godly visions and the instructions God gave in constructing His tabernacles and temples."

      "title": "God finished creating the physical world on the 4th day.",
      "content": "God finished creating the physical world on the 4th day. According to Genesis, on the 4th day God created the heaven, earth, sun and moon. He also divided the sky from the sea and caused plants to grow. Because the material world was created on the fourth day, it’s often associated with the number 4. Although Eve is an important part of the Creation story, she’s only mentioned 4 times."

      "content": "The number 4 is heavily represented in nature. God designated the 4 seasons when He created the world, dividing the year into 4 roughly equal parts. And 4 appears in a number of other natural divisions, including: 4 parts of the day: Morning, mid-day, evening, and night 4 cardinal directions: North, South, East, and West 4 lunar phases: New moon, waxing, full moon, and waning 4 rivers in Eden: According to Genesis 2:10–14, the great river in Eden divided itself into 4 major rivers: Pishon, Gihon, Tigris, and Euphrates 4 divisions of mankind: lands, tongues, nations, and kin (families)"

      "content": "The 12 sons of Jacob came from 4 mothers. God designated the sons of Jacob as the fathers of Israel—they were to be a nation of God’s chosen people. Jacob had 12 sons from 4 women (his two wives and two of their servants, a common practice at the time). The mothers of the 12 tribes of Israel are: [1] X Research source Leah: Jacob’s first wife and mother to Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. Rachel: Jacob’s beloved second wife and mother to Joseph and Benjamin. Bilhah: Rachel’s handmaiden and mother to Dan and Naphtali. Zilpah: Leah’s handmaiden and mother to Gad and Asher."

      "content": "There are 4 consonants in God’s Divine Name (YHWH). In Exodus, God revealed to Moses that His name is YHWH. This 4-consonant name is known as the Tetragrammaton, which is Greek for “four letters.” In Exodus 3:14, God says, “I AM WHO I AM,” symbolizing that He is a complete and perfect being, which is represented in His name."

      "title": "Completion is reflected in the 3 and 1 structure common in Proverbs.",
      "content": "Completion is reflected in the 3 and 1 structure common in Proverbs. A series of passages starting in Proverbs 30:15 uses a literary technique that starts by describing a group of three things, but actually names four. This symbolizes that the fourth item completes the metaphor, creating a whole picture. A few of these verses include: Proverbs 30:15–16: “There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, ‘Enough!’: the grave, the barren womb, land, which is never satisfied with water, and fire, which never says, ‘Enough!’” Proverbs 30:18–19: “There are three things that are too amazing for me, four that I do not understand: the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on the rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a young woman.” Proverbs 30:29–31: “There are three things that are stately in their stride, four that move with stately bearing: a lion, mighty among beasts, who retreats before nothing; a strutting rooster, a he-goat, and a king secure against revolt.”"

      "content": "The Bible uses 4 gospels to tell Jesus’ story. The 4 gospels give us a complete view of Jesus’ life. Each has its own perspective, emphasizing a different aspect of Jesus’ life and ministry: [2] X Research source Matthew’s gospel is intended to show Hebrews that Jesus was the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament. Mark’s gospel is for non-Hebrews and shows that Jesus’ message and sacrifice was meant for all people. Luke’s gospel is meant as a historical record and to show the humanity of Jesus. John’s gospel intended to show that Jesus was both God and man."

      "title": "Jesus brought Lazarus back to life on the 4th day.",
      "content": "Jesus brought Lazarus back to life on the 4th day. Many scholars believe that Jesus waited 4 full days to resurrect Lazarus so people would know that Lazarus was really and truly dead. This miracle showcased Jesus’ complete victory over death. [3] X Research source This is supported by the fact that Jesus waited 2 days after learning that Lazarus was sick before he left to Bethany, where Lazarus lived. There was a Jewish tradition around the time of Jesus that a person’s soul didn’t leave their body until the fourth day after they died, which may also have influenced Jesus’ decision to wait the extra two days.

It symbolizes the completion of a week’s work and honors the day of rest that God observed after creating the world. In this way, the 4th commandment represents both creation and completion."

The third rider, who rides a black horse, brings famine and inflation. The fourth rider, on a pale or green horse, unleashes disease."
