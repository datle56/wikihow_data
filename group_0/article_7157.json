      "content": "Approach your cat when he's calm. If your cat is normally friendly and affectionate with you, he should be fairly cooperative during a monthly dental check. However, make sure you catch your cat at the right moment. If you bother your cat when he's distressed, he may learn to associate his dental check with pain. Watch your cat's body language. A happy cat will have his ears forward and his tail held upward. His back may be arched or he may be lying on his side purring. [1] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Pet your cat for a few moments before starting the dental check. Make sure he feels calm and happy going into the exam. Consider giving him a treat after you're finished. This can create a positive association with the exam. This may encourage him to better cooperate for its duration."

      "content": "Brush your cat's teeth regularly. Like people, cats need to have their teeth cleaned regularly. You can buy a toothbrush and toothpaste specifically designed for your cat at your vet's office. Brush your cat's teeth once a month to keep his mouth healthy. Cradle your cat from behind. Cup his chin and slowly lift up his lip. Use your kitty toothbrush to gently brush his teeth. If you don't have a kitty toothbrush, you can cover your fingertip with gauze and add a dab of cat-friendly toothpaste to the tip. Many people find simply using their fingers provides them with more control. [9] X Research source It might take awhile for your cat to get used to a teeth cleaning routine. Provide positive reinforcement in the form of praise and petting throughout the process. Consider giving your cat a small treat when you finish cleaning his teeth."

      "content": "Provide the right foods. For dental health, feed your cat a variety of wet and dry food. You should also provide him with deboned raw meat on occasion. This encourages chewing, which keeps his teeth bones strong. Fish, beef, and rabbit are good choices for your cat's dental health. [10] X Research source You can also give your cat bones as a treat. Bones help clear tartar off your cat's teeth. However, avoid fish, pork, or chicken bones. These could splinter when ingested, leading to internal injuries. [11] X Research source"
