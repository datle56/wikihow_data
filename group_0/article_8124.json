[1] X Trustworthy Source US Occupational Safety and Health Administration U.S. government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards Go to source If you don’t have a dustpan or spatula on hand, use old cardboard as a scoop or turn a plastic bag inside out and use that as a makeshift glove. Pick up the vomit, turn the bag right side out, and tie the handles. [2] X Research source If the vomit is dried, dampen the area with a spray bottle and water before you try to remove it so you don’t damage the carpeting. Disinfect the spoon, spatula, or dustpan by soaking it in a mixture of 5 tablespoons (74 mL) of bleach in 1 gallon (3.8 L) water for 10 to 20 minutes. Rinse it thoroughly with clean water. You can also pick up the vomit with a towel or paper towel. Throw towels directly into the washer or throw the paper towels directly into the trash.

When you’re ready to clean, toss the towel in the washer and vacuum the baking soda. Another way to absorb the moisture left behind is to sprinkle the area with kitty litter. Allow the litter to clump with the vomit, then use a scraper to scoop the litter into a plastic trash bag. If there’s litter left over, run a vacuum or carpet sweeper over the area. Pick up any remaining wet litter with a paper towel and dry litter with a piece of packing tape. [7] X Research source"
