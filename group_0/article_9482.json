      "title": "Call 1-866-788-2482.",
      "content": "Call 1-866-788-2482. StubHub’s customer service line is available from 5:00 AM to 9:00 PM Pacific Time. While StubHub used to have a reputation for having really long hold times and for making it kind of tough to get a hold of someone, that has mostly changed these days. Want to bypass the robo menu? Press: 1 if you bought tickets and you have a problem with them. 2 if you have questions about buying tickets. 3 if you sold tickets already and have an issue. 4 if you have questions about listing tickets. Pro tip: Each number appears to go to a different department. If you’re in a rush to talk to someone, press 4—it’s usually the fastest way to get someone on the line."

      "content": "Message StubHub on their Facebook page . The comments on StubHub's posts tend to be filled with other customers who are also annoyed, so StubHub won’t respond publicly if you comment on something. They often reply to DMs, though! Send them a message and someone will reply to you in a few hours at the most. StubHub gets a lot activity from users on Facebook than it does on Twitter. This could mean nothing, although it may be a sign that Facebook will be faster than Twitter for social media."

This is a reasonably frustrating feature of StubHub, but no, StubHub will not give you your money back if you cancel an order you’ve already placed. StubHub’s reasoning is that it connects buyers and sellers, so giving you your money back would theoretically be unfair to the other party—not that this makes it any less frustrating.
