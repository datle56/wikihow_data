Removable parts are usually dishwasher-safe. Alternately, you can hand wash them."

      "content": "Wash the inner pot. Soak the pot first, if needed. Unless the instructions state otherwise, you can usually wash inner pots in the dishwasher like other dishes. Alternately, scrub the pot with soap, hot water, and a sponge or brush. Use the sponge to wipe off any pieces of food. [3] X Research source If any stubborn food particles are stuck, gently use a plastic spoon or spatula to remove them. [4] X Research source"

If the lid is detachable, you can wash it alone with soap, hot water, and a sponge or brush, or in the dishwasher with other dishes (unless the instructions state otherwise). If it isn’t detachable, soak a sponge in hot, soapy water. Wipe the lid with the sponge. Rinse the lid carefully with a cloth, so that water doesn’t leak into the cooker. [7] X Research source"

If there is residue on the hot plate that’s difficult to remove, you can use sandpaper or fine mesh steel wool on the residue only. Be extremely careful not to scratch your rice cooker. Once the residue is loosened, you can wipe it off with a moist rag. Allow the cooker to dry completely before putting the inner pot back. [8] X Research source Don’t use abrasive cleaners. Cleaning the heating element of your cooker helps to prevent your cooker from boiling over. [9] X Research source"

If you decide to use a cleaning solution, spray it onto a rag, not directly onto the cooker. Don’t allow any cleaning solution to get inside the cooker. [10] X Research source If necessary, you can wipe the unplugged cord very gently with a moist cloth. If any cleaning solution gets inside the cooker, wipe it up right away."

      "content": "Use your rice cooker on a flat and stable surface. This will help prevent food from cooking unevenly and potentially burning, which can cause it to stick to the bottom of your inner pot. For example, use your rice cooker on a counter or sturdy tabletop. Ensure that the cord doesn’t drape over the edge or touch any hot surfaces."

Avoid using your rice cooker outdoors, and avoid using metal utensils in your cooker. [13] X Research source Keep your rice cooker plugged in, on warm mode, if there is cooked rice in it, since the cooker should maintain a proper environment for moist, cooked food.
