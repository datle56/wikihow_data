While most bikes have the same basic components, different manufacturers will ship their bikes in different stages of assembly. Depending on how much pre-assembly has been done, your parts may include the: Bike frame Saddle (the seat) and seat post Handlebars and grips Front fork (the Y-shaped part that attaches to the front wheels and handlebars) Front brakes, rear brakes, and cables Reflectors Front and rear wheel assemblies and tires Chain Peddles Additional box or bag of small parts and hardware"

      "content": "Install the crown race onto the fork. The crown race is a circular piece that sits on the bottom of the steering tube (the single tube attached to the fork) where the tube and fork meet. It forms the base of the headset (the component that allows the handlebars to rotate on the fork). Note that some bikes already have the race built in. Hold the fork upright so that the bottom of the forks are facing the ground. It's a common mistake to damage forks during installation, so if you place the forks on the ground, rest them in old shoes or on a mat to protect them. Place the crown race over the steering tube and set it firmly at the base of the steering tube. Crown race installation method A: Since you don't want to damage the crown race during installation, there are two ways you can put it on without damaging it. The first is to place an old headset cup (the cup-shaped component that makes up part of the headset) over the crown race. Hammer evenly around the headset cup to secure the crown race beneath in place without damaging it. [1] X Research source Crown race installation method B: Slide a PVC pipe of the proper diameter over top of the steering tube and rest it on top of the crown race. Make sure the pipe is longer than the steering tube. Now, hammer the top of the pipe until the crown race is secure in place. [2] X Research source"

Then, slide a bottom bearing on top of the crown race and apply pressure to set it in place. For integrated headsets, bearings are universal, so you don’t need to worry about which one goes on top or on the bottom. [3] X Research source"

If you’re using them, slide on the spacers next, followed by the gyro (also called the detangler that allows the handlebars to rotate 360 degrees without tangling the brake cables) and the top gyro plate. The gyro will slide over the spacers (if you’re using them), the bearing, and the cup, and sit on the head tube where it meets the frame. The gyro top plate will sit on top of the spacers if you’re using them; otherwise, it will sit on top of the headset cup."

Slide the stem on to the top of the steering tube. Center a spacer over the hole. After that: Grease the compression bolt (the threaded bolt that screws in and keeps the stem attached to the steering tube), and insert it into the hole in the stem. Twist it into place or tighten it on with the appropriate Allen wrench.

First, loosen the clamping bolts on the stem and remove the front face plate. Then: Place the body of the stem on the ground groove up. Rest the handlebars into the groove. Replace the face plate so that it wedges the handlebar in between the two stem pieces, and use the bolts to fasten the face plate back to the body of the stem.

Center the handlebars, and then attach the face plate to the body of the stem with clamping bolts. Snug them up evenly in an X pattern, but don't worry about tightening them all the way. You will be properly adjusting the handlebars later, once the bike is more complete. Align the handlebars so they are parallel with the fork. If you installed the stem on the handlebars separately, now attach the assembly to the rest of the bike. Position the handlebars and stem onto the steering tube. Grease the compression bolt and insert it. Twist it into place or fasten it with an Allen wrench. [6] X Research source Install your gyro at this time if you are using one."

Adjust the seat to the appropriate height. Align the seat so the nose runs parallel with the frame and tighten the bolts on the seat clamp. Your seat doesn't have to be in the perfect position right now, and you can always adjust it later on. But do make sure the maximum height line is below the seat tube, otherwise you risk damaging the stem."

It's mainly composed of two crank arms (each one attaches to a peddle), a spindle (a rod that both crank arms attach to), and a sprocket (a wheel with cogs that attaches to the chain). Insert the spindle into the right-side crank arm by matching up the splines (grooves) and pushing the spindle in. Screw in the bolt until it won’t twist any more. Slide the sprocket down the spindle, position it on the crank arm, and attach it with the sprocket bolt. Depending on the type of crank you’re using, you may have to put the sprocket on first, and then slide the spindle through and fasten it. [7] X Research source"

Use either the appropriate Allen wrench or peddle wrench (depending on your peddles) to attach one peddle to each crank arm. Use an open-end wrench if you don’t have a peddle wrench. Look for an \"L\" and \"R\" on your peddles for guidance about which one's for the left and right side. The peddle on the right will tighten if you turn the wrench clockwise, but the peddle on the left will tighten counter-clockwise, which is the opposite of a regular bolt. [8] X Research source"

Slide the safety washers over the axle and set them into place by pressing the tab on the washer into the tab hole on the dropouts. Thread the axle nuts on by hand, and then finish tightening them with either a wrench or ratchet and socket. To avoid a crooked wheel, tighten each nut a little at a time, as this will help keep the wheel centered. If you’re installing pegs, make sure you do this before putting on the axle nuts. Pegs are short metal tubes that extend out from the wheel and act as foot holds for when you're doing tricks. It's best to start with the front wheel installation because this will help keep the bike balanced as you work. [9] X Research source"

Then: Straighten out the wheel and tighten the axle nut or peg on the drive side. [11] X Research source Then, snug up each side evenly until the pegs or axle nuts are on properly."

You have flexibility with the lever positioning, so take your time and move them around into different positions until you find the most comfortable one before tightening them up. Try sliding the levers closer or farther apart to separate your hands more or bring them closer together. You can also rotate the levers on the handles to see how you like them oriented."
