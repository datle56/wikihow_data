      "content": "Pour coarse salt and 91% isopropyl alcohol into the dab rig. Grab some coarse salt like rock salt, sea salt, Himalayan salt, or Epsom salt, and pour enough into the rig to cover the bottom. Then, add 91% isopropyl alcohol into the rig until the base is about full. [2] X Research source The isopropyl alcohol dissolves reclaim dab and other residue while sanitizing the rig. The salt acts as an abrasive to help scrub off debris. It’s important to use isopropyl alcohol with a concentration of at least 91%. Isopropyl alcohols with lower percentages are diluted with too much water to dissolve residue and sanitize the rig. Tip : Heat up the isopropyl alcohol to help dissolve residue faster. Just carefully heat the alcohol in the microwave in 15-second increments so it’s hot, but not boiling If you want to collect and use the reclaim , do not use isopropyl alcohol, as it isn’t safe to consume.

If the nail is still covered in residue, soak a cotton swab with the isopropyl alcohol and wipe it down. Make sure to swab the inside and outside of the nail to get all of the debris. [5] X Research source Check for any residue around the stem and mouthpiece, too. Simply use a cotton swab soaked with alcohol to clean off any stuck-on debris."

Then, set the rig on a clean towel and let it air dry completely before you use it again. This allows any leftover isopropyl alcohol to evaporate. [6] X Research source It can take several hours for a rig to dry. To help speed up the process, place the rig next to a fan or hit it with a hair dryer on the lowest heat setting. If you still see residue inside the rig, repeat the cleaning process with more isopropyl alcohol and salt until it’s clean."

Then, pour it into the rig and let it soak for 10 to 15 minutes. Once the water has cooled down, add 1 to 2 spoonfuls of rock, sea, or Epsom salt into the rig. [8] X Research source If the salt immediately dissolves, let the water cool down even more. Warning : If your rig is made of glass, avoid pouring extremely hot or extremely cold water inside it.

Reclaim is the waxy, sticky residue left behind in the rig after you smoke cannabis concentrate. Collecting and using it is a great way to extend your dabs and prevent waste.
