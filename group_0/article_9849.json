      "content": "Choose bright green broccolini. Fresh broccolini will also have fresh bases, firm stems, and tightly furled heads. [1] X Research source If the florets are beginning to turn yellow, the broccolini is no longer good. The same applies if the bases appear dried out, if the stems have soft spots, or if there are signs of flowering on the heads. Broccolini should be stored in a tightly sealed plastic bag or container inside the refrigerator until ready to use."

      "content": "Trim the ends. Use a sharp kitchen knife to chop off any leaves and any thick ends, cutting off enough to separate the thinner upper stalks into separate pieces. If the thin stalks are connected by a single thick stalk, this thick portion of the stalk holding the bundle together should be cut off. If any of the stalks you use are still a little too thick, you can trim them in half lengthwise for more manageable pieces."

By adding the salt after the water reaches a boil, you cut down on the total amount of time it takes the water to reach a boil. Salt water boils more slowly than regular water."

Drain immediately by pouring the contents of the stockpot through a colander. If you allow the broccolini to stay in the hot water longer, it will continue to cook and may get mushy. Cook for 2.5 minutes if you want the broccolini to be tender-crisp. If you want it to be a little softer without a crisp bite, cook for a full 5 minutes."

As a general rule, blanched vegetables should be left in ice water for as long as they were left in boiling water in order to put a full stop to the cooking process."

The violent sizzle results when water clinging to the vegetable touches the hot oil. If you want to minimize this reaction, quickly drain the wet broccolini on paper towels before placing it in the skillet."

Make sure that you have a steamer basket that fits into the stockpot you use. The steamer basket should not come into direct contact with the water, even after the water reaches a boil.

After adding the broccolini, cover the stockpot and steamer basket and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes, or until the broccolini becomes tender. The stockpot needs to be covered for the duration of the cooking process. The steam produced by the boiling water is responsible for cooking the broccolini in this method, and as such, you need to let as much of it build up as possible."
