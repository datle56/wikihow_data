      "content": "Dig out dirt around the buttons with a toothpick. Dirt and dust build up in the small spaces around the buttons over time. Start by manually removing as much as you can with a toothpick. Insert the tip and scrape upward to pull out and dirt. [2] X Research source You can do this around the joysticks too. This could improve playability. If you don't have a toothpick, other thin items like a pin or paperclip could also work. As long as they're small enough to fit into the space around the buttons then they'll work. Don’t bend the toothpick while you’re cleaning or you could break it off in the space."

      "content": "Scrub around the buttons with a dry, soft toothbrush. This helps pull up any remaining dirt that you couldn’t get with the toothpick.

      "content": "Wipe up any remaining dust on the controller with a microfiber cloth. Pulling the dust out of the buttons will probably leave some on the controller body.

Don’t use paper towels or tissues, because these could leave paper remnants behind."

      "content": "Dip a cotton swab into rubbing alcohol. This trick works for unsticking buttons, and also simple disinfection of your controller. Pour a bit of rubbing alcohol into a small cup. Dip the head of a cotton swab in and shake it a bit so it isn’t dripping. [5] X Research source Be advised that Nintendo doesn’t recommend using cleaners on Joy-Cons because the plastic can fade. However, there’s no warning that the controller won’t work anymore, so if you don’t mind the color fading a bit, then this method is fine. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Rub the alcohol around each button.",
      "content": "Rub the alcohol around each button. Take the cotton swab and press it against the end of a button. Make a circle around the button to clean it. This helps remove dirt buildup that could make the button stick. [7] X Research source The cotton swab won't fit into the space around the buttons, so don't try to insert it. Just rub the controller surface and button border. If you’re having trouble with one button that’s sticking, you could focus on that one. For a general clean, wipe around all the buttons. You can also rub around the joysticks."
