To celebrate the creativity of children, have each student create a work of art based on what makes them unique. Give each student a sheet of construction paper and some crayons, and let them create something that represents who they are. At the end, allow students to volunteer to share what they drew. [1] X Research source Create a Children’s Day bulletin board and highlight the work that the students produced. Give it a fun border and some cool letters to make it stand out in your room. Since preschool students often draw in class, throw on some fun music and let students work wherever they want to make it feel special and unique."

      "content": "Teach a lesson based on the theme of this year’s Children’s Day. In most countries, Children’s Day has a theme like playing outside, eating healthy, or being kind. To preface Children’s Day celebrations, teach a simple lesson about the importance of this year’s theme. This way, students will understand the meaning of the holiday while learning something new. Be sure to cover preliminary concepts for students that may not fully understand some of the foundational elements of the theme. For example, if this year’s theme is getting exercise, start by presenting information on what happens if you eat poorly, don’t exercise, or fail to take care of yourself."

      "content": "Have students create and decorate crowns or tiaras. To reinforce the idea that Children’s Day is designed to celebrate children, announce that each student is a king or queen. Have them create their own crowns or tiaras by taking pre-cut sheets of construction paper and folding it into a crown. Each student can draw or write on their crown with markers, and students will be able to add glitter or fake jewels. [3] X Research source Since your students are on the younger side, you’ll need to cut the shapes out ahead of time. Cut sheets of construction paper lengthwise and cut triangles into the tops of each strip to form the points for the crowns and tiaras. This is a great activity for sensory play and arts time."

[5] X Research source To keep this tame, allow teachers to have the students decorate only one wall or one section of their classroom.
