      "content": "Check your state's release schedule if your benefits haven't started yet. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a monthly issuance schedule for all 50 states. The same information is also available on your state's SNAP page or by calling your state's customer service number. The release schedule lets you know when you can expect to get benefits each month. Since benefits are automatically loaded onto your EBT card, there's no delay—on the date listed on the schedule, your money will be there."

      "content": "Set up an account or log in. If you've never used your state's online service before, you typically need to create a username and password. To set up an account, enter the information required—typically your Social Security number, EBT card number, or case number.

      "content": "View your account balance. Look for a link that leads to your account balance. Some sites might display it directly on your home page, so you don't have to do anything to see it. You can also check your account activity if you want details about your most recent transactions. [3] X Research source Make sure you log out when you're done, especially if you're on a public computer, such as in the library. You don't want other people to access your information."

As of 2023, this app is used for EBT programs in Arkansas, Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Virginia. Additional state programs might be added in the future, so if your state or territory isn't on that list, you might want to check back periodically. [4] X Research source Some states, such as Texas, have their own app for mobile benefits. If you live in a state that doesn't use ConnectEBT, check with your local benefits office to find out if there's another app you can use. [5] X Research source"

If you haven't used the web portal before, you can set up an account on the app instead and it'll work in both places.

Simply call the number and follow the prompts. These numbers often have other options you can use, such as listening to the record of the most recent transactions on your card.

You don't lose your benefits just because you lose your card! When you get your new card, any benefits you had left in your account will still be there."
