Make sure you build a good relationship with the club, players and club staff, as having their off-field support will contribute to good on-field performances. [4] X Research source"

In football, no one ever cheated their way to becoming one of the less than 0.001% of the 240 million players worldwide, that ‘made it’. It takes time and patience. Sometimes you have to wait for the right opportunity. Sometimes it takes just a bit of luck to swing your direction, but being persistent and having the ability to never give up will determine whether you’re successful or not."
