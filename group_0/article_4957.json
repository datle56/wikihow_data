      "title": "Choose a size for your ecosystem.",
      "content": "Choose a size for your ecosystem. If you are new to building ecosystems, you may want to start small. However, the smaller your container, the harder it is to maintain a self-sustaining environment. Larger containers allow for the inclusion of multiple diverse species and give everything room to grow. All containers must be clear to let in light. A small glass bowl is fast to set up and doesn’t take up much space. While smaller bowls can be more difficult to sustain, they are still manageable for beginners. Medium aquariums (10–30 gallons (38–114 l)) have more space for growth, but are more expensive and still limited in the size for growth. Large aquarium (60–200 gallons (230–760 l)) have ample space for growth and diversity and are most likely to be successful; however, they are very expensive and hard to make room for."

      "content": "Expose the tank to fluorescent lighting. Fluorescent lighting is important for the growth of the plants in your ecosystem. It is recommended to provide 2 to 5 watts per 1 gallon (3.8 l) of water for a freshwater aquarium. [1] X Research source Incandescent lighting will not help your plants grow."

      "title": "Establish the substrate for the ecosystem.",
      "content": "Establish the substrate for the ecosystem. The substrate is the soil of the aquarium that allows the plants to anchor and grow. It must be properly established before doing anything else to foster an environment of growth and recycling of nutrients. If using a small bowl, start with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of sand and then add about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of pea gravel on top. For medium to larger aquariums, start with 2 inches (5.1 cm) of sand and about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of pea gravel on top. Sand and pea gravel can be purchased from a pet store or obtained from a nearby pond."

      "title": "Fill the container with water.",
      "content": "Fill the container with water. The water is important because it will establish the first source of food for the fish and other organisms: algae and microorganisms. You can start with distilled/bottled water, dechlorinated tap water, or water from a previous fish tank or aquarium. If you use distilled/bottled water or dechlorinated tap water, mix some fish flakes in with the water to encourage growth. Adding some water from an already established tank will also help growth because it will already have the essential nutrients."

      "title": "Purchase a variety of plants.",
      "content": "Purchase a variety of plants. When choosing plants you want to consider: how fast they grow (how often you’ll have to trim them), the size of the plant, whether they’re edible for fish and snails, and where in the aquarium they will grow (from the bottom, from the surface, from branches). To cultivate a diverse environment, include some of the following: Bottom growth: hair grass, corkscrew grass, or green rotala Surface Growth: duckweed, lotus Branches: crystalwort, java moss, Christmas moss, phoenix moss You want to make sure the plants are well-established (let them grow and become rooted) before adding fish or snails to the ecosystem."

      "title": "Cultivate micro-critters.",
      "content": "Cultivate micro-critters. The next step in the food chain of your ecosystem is to add micro-critters such as small pond snails, daphnia, and micro-planarians. These will serve as food for all of the fish that don’t eat plants or algae. Aged aquarium media is a good way to seed your tank. This can be purchased at the fish or pet store. [2] X Research source Most of these organisms can’t be seen by the naked eye, but you should wait at least 2 weeks for them to get fully established before adding fish."

    {
      "title": "Add fish or shrimp to the system.",
      "content": "Add fish or shrimp to the system. Once the plants and microorganisms have been established you can start to introduce larger fish into the tank. You want to start with smaller organisms like a guppy, Endler’s livebearer, or cherry shrimp and only add 1 or 2 at a time. These fish also reproduce quickly and serve as a great diet for larger fish. If you have a larger aquarium, you can add more and varied fish. Balancing your fish is tricky and takes time. Make sure each species has time to adjust before adding more into the mix."

      "title": "Change the water.",
      "content": "Change the water. Aquariums take a bit of maintenance to make sure all of your critters stay alive and well. About every 2 weeks, 10-15% of the water in the tank should be replaced with fresh water. If you are using tap water, let the water sit in an aerated bucket for about 24 hours to allow the chlorine to air out. [3] X Research source Check your local water source to determine if there are heavy metals in your water. Use filtered water if you are concerned about the quality of your tap water."

      "title": "Control algae growth.",
      "content": "Control algae growth. A gravel vacuum is a handy tool to have to help control the algae in your aquarium. When you change out the water, vacuum the gravel at the same time to remove algae growth and any uneaten food that may have accumulated. [4] X Research source Clean the aquarium walls with filter floss or a magnetic tank scrubber to keep algae from accumulating on the glass. Add plants, snails, or daphnia to help control the growth."

      "title": "Remove dead fish promptly.",
      "content": "Remove dead fish promptly. Count your fish at least once a week to determine if any have died. Smaller fish can decompose quickly and cause spikes in nitrite, ammonia, and nitrate levels. These can be harmful to the other fish in your tank. If you see a dead fish, remove it as soon as possible. [5] X Research source Use a test kit to check the levels of ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH. Replace the water if the levels are too high. The ideal levels vary depending on the type of fish you have, but in general, the ammonia should be between 0.0 to 0.25 mg/L, the nitrite should be less than 0.5 mg/L, the nitrate level should be less than 40 mg/L, and the pH should stay around 6."

You want to make sure that the container can be properly sealed. [6] X Research source Options include: a candy jar with a heavy lid, a pasta jar, or a mason jar."

      "content": "Fill the bottom with pebbles. The layer of pebbles at the bottom of the jar is to allow water to collect at the bottom and protect the plants from flooding. Add pebbles to a depth of about 1 ⁄ 2 –2 inches (1.3–5.1 cm). [7] X Research source It doesn’t matter what type of rock or pebbles you use. You can even use colorful pebbles from the pet store to make it more exciting."

The plants will be able to root in this soil and get the water and nutrients they need from the combination of all of the layers below the potting soil. [10] X Research source Add enough soil for the plants to take root and have room for growth. A depth slightly higher than the pot the plant came in should be good. Most types of potting soil will be sufficient for this. Succulents and cacti require a special type of soil."

      "content": "Add small plants. Any plant you’d like to add will work in your terrarium, but small plants are recommended. Prepare your plants by removing them from their pots and breaking up the hard soil around their roots. Trim particularly long roots before planting. Dig a small well in the soil with a spoon and place the roots of the plant into the hole. Add a bit of soil on top and pack it down around the plant. [11] X Research source Repeat this process with the rest of your chosen plants taking care to keep the plants away from the edges of the container. Try to avoid having the leaves touching the sides of the container as much as possible. Some great plants to start with include moon valley friendship, the nerve plant, variegata, aquamarine, minimus aureus, strawberry begonias, ferns, and mosses. [12] X Research source"

The terrarium will do well in an area with bright but indirect sunlight. The terrarium will dry out if you place it in an area with lots of direct light, but the plants won’t thrive if the terrarium is always shaded. Opt for an area near a window. [13] X Research source"
