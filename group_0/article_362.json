      "content": "Dress in flattering clothes that make you feel comfortable . You should always wear what you feel comfortable in, don't just wear something to impress you crush or fit in. Wear clean clothes that make you look your best if you know you're going to be around your crush. Just dress naturally. Some people might get intimidated if you try getting really dressed up around your crush. You want to act naturally and be yourself, not like you're something you're not. Focus more on clothes that help you feel confident. If you want to impress your crush, you'll do it with your personality, not with your shirt. Make sure your clothes fit well, are clean, and make you feel good."

      "title": "Check your breath.",
      "content": "Check your breath. If you're going to be around your crush, bad breath could be a turnoff. Make sure that you brush regularly, especially after meals, and keep some mints, gum, or other little fresheners around in case you need them. Breath strips act quickly and are easy to carry around in your pocket, so you don't have to be chewing gum constantly while you're trying to flirt. Check in the mirror after meals to make sure you don't have anything stuck in your teeth. That could be embarrassing after the fact."

      "title": "Groom yourself regularly.",
      "content": "Groom yourself regularly. Again, you don't need to be a movie star to attract your crush or to act naturally around them, but it's a whole lot easier to be relaxed and confident around someone if you're not worried about the smell you're putting off. Shower regularly and take care of basic body stuff so you can feel confident. If you have acne problems , talk to your parents and your doctor about prescription solutions. There are lots of stronger medicated facial soaps out there to try. Don't suffer in silence. Put some thought into your hair and basic grooming. You don't need to be glammed up all the time, but don't look like you just rolled out of bed."

      "title": "Try to learn as much as you can about your crush.",
      "content": "Try to learn as much as you can about your crush. Hanging around someone you're attracted to can be hard if you don't know much about them. You might want to impress them, or come off like an attractive and interesting person, but what do they think is attractive? What do they think is interesting? The more you know the answers to these questions, the more comfortable you can be. Get to know them on social networking first. Reach out on Facebook or Twitter and become friends, or start following them on Instagram to get some sense of their sense of humor and style. Talk to mutual friends to find out things like whether or not your crush has a partner already, or whether or not your crush might be interested. It's a lot easier to chat up someone who you think might like you."

      "title": "Hang out in a group at first.",
      "content": "Hang out in a group at first. One-on-one hangouts can be challenging. If you're trying to hang out with someone, do it in a group, so your crush can see how you act naturally around your friends, instead of trying to do it all at once. Invite your crush to hang out with your friends, or just to sit with your friends at lunch. There doesn't need to be a reason. Alternatively, you might feel more comfortable hanging out one-on-one. If you do, try to find reasons to hang out with your crush solo, even in a non-date type of situation. Just try sitting together on the bus, or working on homework together, or sitting together at lunch."

      "content": "Talk less to keep some mystery about yourself. Lots of people make the mistake of thinking that you need to talk a lot and make a big show if you want to attract someone's attention. Not necessarily the case. Hang back a little and make your contributions magnetic and more meaningful when you do talk. [1] X Research source Talk more quietly, so everyone else needs to quiet down when you speak. Turn to your crush and lean in when you have something to say. Make it meaningful. It'll be mysterious and personal. Your crush might be attracted to more flamboyant, loud, or chatty people, and that's ok. That doesn't mean you need to change who you are to attract them, or get to know them better."

      "title": "Start slowly by saying hello regularly.",
      "content": "Start slowly by saying hello regularly. It's important to let your crush know that you exist, and that you like talking to them. When you see your crush walking down the hallway at school, or passing them in public, smile brightly, wave your hand, and say hi. Use their name out loud. This little gesture goes a long way in making someone feel valued and wanted. This isn't a sign that you're crushing on someone, it's just a sign that you're nice. If you see someone you like, say hello."

      "title": "Make eye contact.",
      "content": "Make eye contact. When you like someone, making eye contact can do more than a couple thousand words and a bunch of love letters. When you're hanging out, or having a conversation, make eye contact and use gentle body language to seem more approachable. Use open body language around your crush, keeping your shoulders back and your arms uncrossed. Don't stare at someone you like. Catching someone's eye and smiling is one thing, but gawking at someone you think is attractive during class will just come across as creepy."

      "title": "Keep your conversations short, at first.",
      "content": "Keep your conversations short, at first. When you're first getting to know your crush a little better, try to keep your interactions brief to avoid any awkwardness or difficulty in talking. Just chat up someone about the class you just had, or have a brief talk about your weekend plans, then say, \"Well, nice talking. See you later.\" Don't worry too much about having really deep or interesting conversations. It'll happen as you get to know someone better, which takes time. Nobody has great conversations at first. Give them a chance."

      "content": "Find something you have in common. Don't know what to talk about? Try to figure out something that you have in common and can share together. Talk about a class you've got together, or an assignment, or talk about an upcoming sports event at your school. Find something you can shoot the breeze about. Don't think too hard. If you live in the same town or go to the same school, you've automatically got a little in common. Talk about your neighborhood. Gossip about common friends. Complain about teachers. Online is a great way to find out simple things like this. If you know your crush watches a certain show that you like, talk about the last episode, or your favorite characters, or what you think is going to happen next.

      "title": "Ask for help with something.",
      "content": "Ask for help with something. One good short-cut to starting a conversation is to ask your crush if they'll help you do something. Ask for a hand with some homework assignment you're working on, or ask for some help setting something up in gym class. Even if you're fine on your own, it'll be a chance to have some time to talk. Go with a little white lie if you need to: \"Have you seen my math book over here? I just had it, and I can't find it. Will you help me look?\" Then chat while you try to find it. When you never can, say, \"That's ok, you're so sweet for helping. I like talking to you!\""

      "content": "Let your sense of humor shine through. If you want to get to know someone better, and maybe even get them to like you, it's a good idea to let your sense of humor out as much as possible. Laughter is infectious, and people like being around people who are funny. Even if you're not a class clown, you can still have funny conversations with your crush. Don't say, \"Hey, how's it going?\" That's a boring conversation to start. Instead, say, \"I'm thinking of busting out of this prison. So far all I've got is a calculator and half a Snickers. What do you think? Can I count on you? You're not going to tell the cops, right?\" If your crush says something like, \"You're weird,\" then you know they're a boring or stuck-up person. Don't waste your time getting to know people who don't share your sense of humor."

[2] X Research source People don't want to be put on pedestals and complimented all the time. This is boring. This is also while lots of \"nice\" people are rejected by crushes who are looking for something more interesting. That doesn't mean you should be a jerk, just that you should learn to let your sense of humor out in gentle ways. If you see your crush put up a bunch of selfies on Facebook, tease them about them. \"Ok, there are a lot of these, so I'm going to help you rate them one by one, in terms of what it looks like you're thinking. This one says, \"Oh, wow, my room smells like corn-dogs.\""

If you want to put your crush at ease and get them talking, asking creative, engaging, or even silly questions is the way to go. Treat it like a fun conversation game. \"Say this is your last day on earth. Where do you go to first? What do you eat? What do you do? Who do you hang out with? What's on the iPod?\" It's important to avoid prying or coming off like you're insensitive. Don't ask questions that are none of your business, like, \"Your dad doesn't look like he makes a lot of money, how is your family doing?\""

If your crush mentioned a book, show, or movie last time that you were unfamiliar with, check it out and talk about it the next time you see each other. Be honest and offer your opinions."
