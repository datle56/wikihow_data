    {
      "title": "Select a coconut with the least number of brown patches on the husk.",
      "content": "Select a coconut with the least number of brown patches on the husk. Pick up the coconut and turn it in your hands to inspect the husk. Try to find one that has a consistent green color without any damage or discoloration. If you can’t find one without brown spots, choose the one with the least discoloration since it will usually be fresher. [1] X Research source Avoid coconuts if they have a thick brown husk since they are the most mature and won’t contain as much water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for a coconut that’s round rather than oblong.",
      "content": "Look for a coconut that’s round rather than oblong. Coconuts start off small and round when they begin growing and get more oblong as they mature. Compare the shapes of the coconuts visually and avoid any that have an elongated shape. While you usually won’t find one that’s perfectly round, choose the next closest one. [2] X Research source Round coconuts tend to carry more water than oblong ones."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid coconuts that make a sound when you shake them.",
      "content": "Avoid coconuts that make a sound when you shake them. Hold the coconut up to your ear and shake it vigorously. If you have a young green coconut, it shouldn’t make any noise since it’s filled with water. If you hear liquid sloshing around, then the coconut may be too mature or it could be cracked and leaking. [3] X Research source The coconut will feel heavy for its size due to the water. If you pick up the coconut and it’s very light, the water may have leaked out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the top and bottom of the coconut for mold.",
      "content": "Check the top and bottom of the coconut for mold. Find the stem or the flat part on top of the coconut and press on it to feel for any soft spots or mold. Then flip the coconut over and look for any black spots on the bottom. Hold the coconut up to your nose and avoid buying it if it has a musty, moldy odor. [4] X Research source Even if there’s mold on the husk, the bacteria can absorb into the coconut and contaminate the water and meat."
    },
    {
      "title": "See if there are pre-husked coconuts so they’re easier to open.",
      "content": "See if there are pre-husked coconuts so they’re easier to open. Many grocery stores carry green coconuts with the husk already removed so you don’t have to cut it off later. Look for white coconuts with pointed tops and flat bottoms individually wrapped in plastic. Avoid any pre-husked coconuts that have any discoloration or mold growing on them. [5] X Research source You will usually find the pre-husked coconuts near the mature coconuts in the produce aisle."

    {
      "title": "Poke a coconut opener through the top if you only want to drink the water.",
      "content": "Poke a coconut opener through the top if you only want to drink the water. A coconut opener has a round hole that punches straight through the coconut husk so you can drain the water. Place the coconut upright so the stem faces up. Set the coconut opener in the middle of the stem and forcefully press down to push it into the coconut. Twist and pull the opener back out so you can drink the water out from the hole. [6] X Research source You can buy a coconut opener online or from a kitchen specialty store. Coconut water may spray and spill out when you punch through the coconut, so don’t be surprised if it splashes on you."

    {
      "title": "Lay the coconut horizontal so the stem points to your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Lay the coconut horizontal so the stem points to your dominant hand. Set the coconut on your cutting board so it’s on its side and hold it in place with your non-dominant hand. Make sure you position the stem on the same side as your dominant hand so it’s easier to cut without hurting yourself. [7] X Research source Avoid cutting from the bottom of the husk since it’s usually thicker and more difficult to work your knife through."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut wedge-shaped slices off the coconut husk until you reach the inner shell.",
      "content": "Cut wedge-shaped slices off the coconut husk until you reach the inner shell. Hold a cleaver in your dominant hand. Position the blade at a 45-degree angle just below the stem so you’re cutting away from your body. Cut through the husk to remove a wedge-shaped from the stem. Move your knife over by about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) and cut off another piece, angling the blade toward the stem. Continue working through your coconut until you see a darker brown or green inner shell, which is the part of the coconut with water and meat. [8] X Research source Don’t let the coconut roll around freely on your cutting board since your knife will be more likely to slip."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the coconut so the cut side faces up.",
      "content": "Turn the coconut so the cut side faces up. As soon as you expose the inner shell, stop cutting the husk since the water will spill out. Reposition the coconut so it’s upright before moving on. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Strike the edge of the inner shell with the heel of your knife to break it open.",
      "content": "Strike the edge of the inner shell with the heel of your knife to break it open. Position the heel, or the bottom corner of the blade, so it’s at a 45-degree angle to the top of the coconut. Hold the opposite side of the coconut with your other hand so it doesn’t move around. Hit the coconut at an angle with enough force for the blade’s heel to pierce through the shell. Rock the blade back and forth to peel the top part of the shell off of the coconut. [10] X Research source Your coconut may be filled to the top with water so do your best not to spill. Be extremely careful when striking your coconut. You don’t need to use a lot of force to break through the shell."

    {
      "title": "Pour the water out from the coconut.",
      "content": "Pour the water out from the coconut. Keep a glass or bowl nearby so you can pour out the water. Quickly turn the coconut over and let all of the water drain out so you can get to the meat. Enjoy the coconut water while it’s fresh for a sweet, healthy drink. [11] X Research source You can also drink the water directly from the coconut if you don’t want to get a dish dirty."

    {
      "title": "Scoop the coconut meat out with a spoon.",
      "content": "Scoop the coconut meat out with a spoon. While you usually need to grate mature coconut meat, you can eat directly from a green coconut with a spoon. Stick a spoon inside your coconut and scrape around the edges to remove the meat. Enjoy the meat on its own for a sweet and nutritious snack, or mix it into smoothies for an added boost of flavor. [12] X Research source Green coconuts don’t have as much meat as a mature coconut."
