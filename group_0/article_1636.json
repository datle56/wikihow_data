      "content": "Attend career fairs. Colleges and high schools often hold career fairs that will include a number of internship opportunities. These are a great option for finding internships because you can make a personal impression on the recruiter and ask questions about the position. If you are a student, ask someone in your school’s administrative office or career services office when these take place. Ask the recruiter questions like what kind of work you’ll be doing during the internship, what kind of opportunities it could lead to, and what the company culture is like. Most career fairs that aren’t held at schools will be for full-time jobs. If you do plan to attend one of these fairs, ask the event organizer if any internships will be available. Think of your conversations with recruiters as interviews. Bring a resume , dress nicely , and exude confidence at the fairs so you make a good impression."

Include information about volunteer work and extracurricular school activities or teams you participated in.

Be descriptive in including your job functions, not just the names and dates of your employment. [4] X Expert Source Jonathan Soormaghen Career Coach Expert Interview. 7 October 2020. Instead of just saying that you served as an office assistant, describe duties like sending company-wide emails, drafting press releases, reordering office supplies, receiving and redirecting phone calls, and handling mail intake.
