      "title": "A Taurean guy appreciates subtle, classic beauty.",
      "content": "A Taurean guy appreciates subtle, classic beauty. Taurus is ruled by Venus, the planet of beauty, but this fella isn't really attracted to over-the-top or flamboyant styles. As a Cancer woman, this should suit you just fine, since you're probably not really one to glam it up. [1] X Research source Focus on classic, quality clothing over trends. A Taurus guy definitely understands an \"investment piece,\" and he'll appreciate the workmanship of a high-end brand over a cheap knock-off."

      "title": "A Taurus is usually attracted to romantic, earthy scents.",
      "content": "A Taurus is usually attracted to romantic, earthy scents. If you're fond of a little perfume, think simple and down-to-earth when it comes to appealing to the Taurean nose. Soft floral scents hit the right feminine notes a Taurus guy appreciates in a woman. [2] X Research source If you're not into flowers, try something a little earthier or natural that's still light and warm. Look for a perfume grounded with notes of cedar and sandalwood."

      "title": "A Taurus guy typically isn't one to make the first move.",
      "content": "A Taurus guy typically isn't one to make the first move. [3] X Research source This can be hard for you, Cancer, because you're not exactly a social butterfly either! [4] X Research source But if you're willing to take the chance on the first move, he'll reciprocate and take the lead if he's interested. You can't go wrong starting a conversation about something the two of you have in common, such as a class you both have. Taurus tends to be pretty practical, so don't use a probing philosophical question as your opener. Talking about food is also always a good choice. For example, you might ask him what his favorite comfort food was when he was a kid. Get him talking about food and you'll have him eating out of your hand in no time. You could also chat about a TV show that you both like. [5] X Expert Source Julia McCurley Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. 30 September 2021."

      "title": "Let him know you love to nurture and care for others.",
      "content": "Let him know you love to nurture and care for others. A guy born under the fixed sign of Taurus is typically going to be pretty grounded and stable. He's looking for a woman who's loving and nurturing—something you shouldn't have a hard time showing off as a family-oriented Crab. [6] X Research source For example, if you have pets or help take care of your nieces or nephews, that's definitely something to bring up when you're chatting with him! Talk about how much you enjoy watching them grow and showering them with love and affection."

      "title": "A Taurus guy tends to prefer to kick back in the great outdoors.",
      "content": "A Taurus guy tends to prefer to kick back in the great outdoors. Taurus is an earth sign, so a guy born under this sign usually enjoys communing with nature. As a bonus, you also have plenty of time alone together to talk and get to know each other. [7] X Research source You don't have to be big into the outdoors to make this work—just choose a short, easy trail that ends up in a peaceful, picture-perfect spot, like a waterfall. Reader Poll: We asked 338 wikiHow readers, and only 8% of them agreed that the outdoor adventure that sounds the most fun for a date is going boating or fishing . [Take Poll] Instead, opt for a hike or even a camping trip."

      "title": "Seduce him with a treat for all 5 senses.",
      "content": "Seduce him with a treat for all 5 senses. Your favorite Bull enjoys being enveloped in sight and sound, so tickets to a concert or film festival can be a great first date. Just be ready for plenty of discussion afterward—he likes to talk about everything he's seen and heard. [8] X Research source Talk to your guy ahead of time to find out what kind of music he's into or who his favorite film directors are. Then you'll know just the tickets to get to sweep him off his feet. If he's a film guy, look for a small showing that includes a Q&A with the filmmakers afterward. He'll really eat that up."

      "title": "A typical Taurean isn't going to rush into anything.",
      "content": "A typical Taurean isn't going to rush into anything. Cancer's shy, cautious nature works well here, because Taurus doesn't like to be hurried or pushed into a relationship. Love is important to him and well worth taking his time to make sure he does it right. It can help if you're willing to start as friends—it gives him a chance to feel you out and trust you before he opens up to you completely."

      "title": "Help him feel secure by demonstrating your loyalty.",
      "content": "Help him feel secure by demonstrating your loyalty. A Taurus guy doesn't do anything by half-measures, and he needs to feel secure to really take the plunge. Reassure him that you're fully committed to a relationship with him and he will do the same. [9] X Research source One way you can do this is by being dependable, which is a trait Taurus admires. If you say you're going to meet him for lunch at noon, be there a few minutes early—cool, calm, and collected. He'll see that you take punctuality seriously and that he's a priority for you. You're not usually one to play games, Cancer, but if you were ever tempted, the Taurus guy is not the one to start with. He can have a bit of a possessive streak, but trying to make him jealous will likely backfire. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Challenge yourself to say what you feel rather than sulking.",
      "content": "Challenge yourself to say what you feel rather than sulking. This might be hard for you, Cancer, if you're prone to withdrawing into your shell when you're hurt or upset. But if you withdraw from Taurus, he'll think something is wrong—or worse, that you don't like him anymore. [11] X Research source A Taurus guy is going to want you to be clear, even analytical, about things. He approaches relationships with a logic that might sometimes seem cold to you, but don't forget that he believes love is very important. To him, though, it's so important that it can't be left up to something as fickle and fleeting as emotions. Luckily, as you get closer, you'll find it easier to open up to Taurus, since he tends to be pretty open about himself as well. He's not one to bottle things up—just try to follow his lead."

      "title": "The Taurus man will happily indulge your homebody nature.",
      "content": "The Taurus man will happily indulge your homebody nature. If the idea of hitting the clubs or going to a party sounds exhausting, you're in good company with a Taurus man. He'd rather spend quiet time cuddling with you (think \"Netflix and chill\") than painting the town red. [12] X Research source For example, you might order in from his favorite restaurant and watch a movie together. If you're both in school, Taurus makes the perfect study partner. Invite him over to hit the books, then celebrate the end of a rigorous study session with homemade cookies or ice cream sundaes. If you'd rather be more active, you might plan a nature hike with a romantic picnic next to a waterfall."

      "title": "Taurus is a simple man who appreciates a home-cooked meal.",
      "content": "Taurus is a simple man who appreciates a home-cooked meal. As a Cancer woman, you probably know your way around the kitchen. But don't worry if you're not a gourmet chef—a Taurus man prefers hearty, comfort food to fine dining. [13] X Research source For example, you might invite him over for spaghetti with meatballs or your mom's favorite casserole. If you grew up in a different culture than he did, maybe you could make your favorite cultural dish to share with him. The fact that you took the time to cook for him speaks volumes to the Taurus man, and he will return your effort tenfold in affection and appreciation."

      "title": "A Taurus can be set in his ways, so it's up to you to introduce some variety.",
      "content": "A Taurus can be set in his ways, so it's up to you to introduce some variety. As much as you both love your comfy home life, you and your Taurus guy are likely to get bored if you don't try new things every once in a while. He'll be more likely to take you up on your suggestion if it's not too far off the beaten path. [14] X Research source For example, if the two of you enjoy cooking together, you might sign up for a couple's cooking class. It gets you out of the house and will help you learn new skills you can use in the kitchen."

      "title": "Demonstrate your continued interest by doing things for him.",
      "content": "Demonstrate your continued interest by doing things for him. For the down-to-earth Taurus man, actions speak louder than words. Helping him out with tasks shows him that you really care about him. [15] X Research source He may be a handyman or a DIY-er, someone who always has a project going on. Just ask him what he's got going on and what you can do to help. If nothing else, maybe he'd like some company as he works. Getting involved in something he enjoys is another way to show him how you feel. For example, if he plays on a community soccer team, you might go to his games and cheer him on. Show your affection physically as well. The typical Taurean loves physical affection, even if it's something as subtle as resting your hand on his arm as you talk or leaning into him as you read a menu at a restaurant."

      "title": "Find little ways to fit into his life without making him change.",
      "content": "Find little ways to fit into his life without making him change. A Taurus guy is typically a little set in his ways, but this doesn't have to be a bad thing. He'll be most interested in you if you're able to slot right into his normal routine and don't ask him to do things a different way or at a different time to accommodate you. For example, if he normally eats lunch during the week at a sandwich shop across the street from his office, you might go meet him there rather than asking him to drive somewhere else. Find out as much as you can about his regular habits so you can plan on dates around them. For example, if he calls his parents every Sunday afternoon, you might meet up with him for brunch so he'll be free to talk to them then."
