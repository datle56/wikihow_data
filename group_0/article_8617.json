      "title": "Position your Xbox so you can remove the side panel vent.",
      "content": "Position your Xbox so you can remove the side panel vent. Orient your Xbox on a flat, sturdy surface so the front, where the power button is located, is pointing to your right. The Xbox should stand on its narrow end with the vent facing up. [1] X Research source This cleaning process can be somewhat long and tedious, especially the first time. Smear some war paint under your eyes and get ready to wage war on the dirt and dust clogging your Xbox."

      "title": "Remove the vent from the Xbox.",
      "content": "Remove the vent from the Xbox. Gently slide the screwdriver into the farthest right vent slot on the vent. Pry the vent with firm, moderate pressure until it partially pops free. Use your fingers to continue prying the vent up with moderate pressure until it releases. [2] X Research source When prying with your screwdriver, use your free hand to assist the screwdriver by pressing upwards on the end of the vent."

      "title": "Gain access to the side panel release tabs.",
      "content": "Gain access to the side panel release tabs. Use your fingernail to lift the lip of the silver or black panel border at the right back corner of the Xbox. In the space on the inside of the border, there will be three release tabs that look like small slots: one on the right, one at the middle, and one on the left. [3] X Research source When lifting the border part of the Xbox, you'll likely need to continue exerting pressure on it with your hand to keep the release tabs accessible. There are six total release tabs for each side panel, three along each long side. These tabs are positioned similarly for both side panels. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Disengage the side panel release tabs.",
      "content": "Disengage the side panel release tabs. Insert your screwdriver into the slot at the right, back corner. Press forward slightly while prying up on the panel with your free hand. When the tab disengages, that corner of the side panel should pull up and out. [5] X Research source Disengage the release tabs in sequence. Start with one end, then disengage the middle tab, then finish with the opposite end. Repeat this for the remaining three opposite side release tabs. As more tabs are disengaged, more of the panel should slide free. When all tabs are released, the side panel will pull free of the Xbox. To keep parts from getting lost or accidentally damaged, refasten the vent to the side panel by pressing the vent back into place on it. You should feel it click when it is secured."

      "title": "Remove the wireless card.",
      "content": "Remove the wireless card. In the area under the side panel, you will see a small square shaped part on the left side held into a USB port by a screw. This is the wireless card. Use a Phillips screwdriver to unfasten the screw, then pull the card out of the USB slot. [6] X Research source"

The release tabs for this panel are similar to the first side panel you removed, but the tab above the access door will be a little larger and the one below it a little smaller. In the same fashion as the previous side panel, remove this one as well. [8] X Research source The small release tab below the access door may be difficult to disengage with a normal screwdriver. Use a smaller screwdriver to make disengaging this tab easier. [9] X Research source After the second side panel has been removed, much like with the first panel, keep it and its parts together by pressing the vent back into place and reinserting the access door."

With your screwdriver still inserted in the tab, position your fingers on the metal part of the inner panel and push outward on the case with moderate pressure. You should now be able to release the tab. Push in on the small hole you revealed next to the UL listing to release the second tab. [13] X Research source When the second tab is released, the case should separate slightly. Do not try to force the case apart at this point. You still need to disengage the second set of inner release tabs."

      "title": "Remove the case.",
      "content": "Remove the case. Lift the case with your fingers so it hinges open from the back. When the back is separated, slide the case toward the back of the system and then lift it upwards. Turn the removed case upside down and place the removed outer side panels and wireless card inside it to keep all your parts together. [16] X Research source That was an awful lot of work just to get the case off. It's a good thing the vent snap fasteners and release tabs, after being disengaged the first time, will be less stiff the next time you clean your Xbox."

The faceplate will be connected to the system with cords and should not be pulled too far away. When the case is removed, the faceplate will be loose. Lay it face down in front of the side it's connected to. [19] X Research source You're almost finished taking apart the Xbox. Soon you'll be able to give it a thorough cleaning. Don't worry, it reassembles easier than it comes apart."

Reach under the cabling with your index finger and pinch down on the cable with your thumb. Wiggle the cable back and forth until it comes free of the drive. Do this for both connecting cables. [20] X Research source Once your drive is disconnected, set it off to the side in a safe place. Never blow air inside your drive, as this can damage it. Your drive should have a black rubber band around it. You may need to slide this off during removal. Pay attention to the band orientation. The hole in the band is always positioned at the top of the drive. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Loosen dust with a soft bristle brush. Dust has a tendency to collect on the fan and its surrounding heat shielding. Scrub these areas very lightly with a soft bristle brush, like a toothbrush. Do the same for any other areas on the inside of the Xbox that have buildup. [23] X Research source Unlike your teeth, which should be brushed daily, for your Xbox to run best it should be cleaned with a brush and canned air about three to four times a year."

      "content": "Remove dust from the Xbox with pressurized air. Use canned air or an air compressor to blow the loosened dust out of the inside of the Xbox. When spraying the fan with air, first insert your finger in between the blades so the fan remains stationary. Spinning the fan will generate electricity. If this happens while your Xbox is disassembled, it could cause damage to motherboard components. [24] X Research source"

      "title": "Reinstall internal components.",
      "content": "Reinstall internal components. Slide the removed part of the black drive back into place. Replace the black rubber band on the drive, if necessary, so the holes in the band are along the top of the drive. Plug both cords back into the silver drive. Set it gently back in place, then lightly push it forward as far as possible. Double check your cable connections to your silver drive before setting it in place and after replacing the drive. If either of these cords come loose, the drive will not run. Failing to replace the black rubber band of the drive will cause the drive to be loose and slide around inside your Xbox. Over time, the rubber of the drive band may degrade and break or not stay in tightly in place. In this situation, fold a business card several times and tuck it in the front left corner of the drive seating. [25] X Research source"

These should fall into place without resistance, with about a half inch (1.3 cm) of the screw remaining above the surface of the metal casing. When all screws are in their holes, use your screwdriver to fasten them snugly, but not overly tight. If the black metal casing screws are tight or don't fall into place easily, it's likely the case isn't seated properly. Remove the casing and reattach it, then try to refasten the screws again.
