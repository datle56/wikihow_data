However, you can mark a video as \"Not Interested.\" This won't guarantee that you will never hear the sound again, but it will make it less likely that the TikTok algorithm will show you videos with that sound. Each time you hear a video with the sound, you can repeat the process, so that you are less and less likely to hear that sound in the future. [1] X Research source"

Tap this icon to indicate you are not interested in the video. This won't block the sound completely, but it will make it less likely you will see similar videos in the future. Each time you hear the sound you don't like, repeat these steps to make it even less likely you will hear the sound in the future."
