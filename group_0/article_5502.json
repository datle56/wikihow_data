If you are given a problem to calculate volume, you will probably be given the radius. Otherwise, the radius can be difficult to measure because you cannot accurately reach the center of a solid object. [2] X Research source Suppose you are told that a sphere exists with a radius of 10 cm.

You need to have a beaker large enough to hold the sphere, with accurate volume measurement markings. [6] X Research source Pour enough water into the beaker to cover the sphere. Make note of the measurement. Place the sphere into the water. Notice that the water level rises. Make note of the new measurement. Subtract the first measurement from the second. The result is the volume of the sphere. For example, suppose your water level rises from 100 ml to 625 ml when you submerge the sphere. The volume is therefore 525 ml. Note that 1 ml=1 cm 3 ."

Consider a sphere made of styrofoam, for example, and compare its weight to a sphere the same size made of iron. Iron has a much greater density and will therefore have a greater mass. You can find densities of many solid materials by looking up density tables online, in textbooks or in other industry catalogs. For example, here are the recorded densities of some solid materials: [7] X Research source Aluminum = 2700 kg/m 3 Butter = 870 kg/m 3 Lead = 11,350 kg/m 3 Pressed wood = 190 kg/m 3"

All of the examples in the previous section resulted in volumes measured in cubic centimeters. However, the cited density table provides densities based on cubic meters. Because there are 100 centimeters in a meter, there are 10 6 cubic centimeters in a cubic meter. Divide the given densities by 10 6 to represent the density in units of kg/cm 3 . (You can do this most easily by just moving the decimal point 6 spaces to the left.) For the four sample materials, the converted densities are as follows: Aluminum = 2700 kg/m 3 = 0.0027 kg/cm 3 Butter = 870 kg/m 3 = 0.00087 kg/cm 3 Lead = 11,350 kg/m 3 = 0.01135 kg/cm 3 Pressed wood = 190 kg/m 3 = 0.00019 kg/cm 3"

You will need to look up the density of brass from a density table online. From the website, EngineeringToolbox.com, you can find that the density of brass is 8480 kg/m 3 . Because the diameter of the sphere was given in meters, its volume will be calculated in cubic meters, so you do not need to convert the density."
