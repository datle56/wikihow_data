      "content": "Be aware that feeling sleepy after lunch is related to digestion. The main reason why you get sleepy after lunch is because food that you eat for lunch diverts your blood away from your brain to help with the digestion process. Your body also releases a bit of melatonin after lunch related to a drop in core temperature that occurs around 2 to 3pm. Melatonin is a hormone that helps you fall asleep at night.

      "content": "Ask yourself if your eating habits may be contributing to your afternoon drowsiness. While a post-lunch slump is normal, inadequate or poor nutrition may make your afternoon drowsiness worse. To determine how to avoid feeling sleepy after lunch, consider the following questions: Do I eat breakfast every day? Have I been eating a lot of processed and high sugar foods? Have I been eating poorly the night before? Have I been consuming too much caffeine and alcohol? Is my breakfast providing me with nutritional energy? (more than just coffee) Have I been physically active consistently? Do I have a right life-work balance? Have I been eating healthy lunches? If your answer to any of these questions is no, then you should evaluate your lifestyle habits to help make your post-lunch slump less severe. [2] X Research source"

Choose a bright green salad with lean protein for lunch to avoid severe energy drop in the afternoon. Drink a cup of green tea with a piece of dark chocolate. If you must get your lunch from a fast food place, choose items that are baked or broiled instead of fried and skip the French fries. [5] X Research source"

Although caffeine is renowned for its ability to improve our alertness, it can become a case of diminishing returns if you need to keep increasing the dosage because its effect has lessened over time. Needing to up the caffeine is unhealthy because you can easily end up having too much caffeine, crashing quickly after it wears off each time, and ultimately you risk developing a caffeine addiction . Switch to decaffeinated or non-caffeinated drinks to get you through the afternoon. Water is an excellent choice, as it is also important to keep well hydrated throughout the day. As an added bonus, it provides you with an excuse to stroll to the water-cooler now and then."
