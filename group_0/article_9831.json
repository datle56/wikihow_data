      "title": "Rinse and dry the spinach.",
      "content": "Rinse and dry the spinach. Fill a bowl or clean sink with your fresh baby spinach and enough cool, clean water to cover it. Swish the spinach around to clean it, then remove it to dry with a towel. [2] X Research source After moving the spinach around in the water, avoid further agitation so that any dirt removed from the leaves can settle to the bottom. Remove the spinach by hand or with tongs after washing so that you can dispose of the dirty water. Repeat if necessary. You can dry the spinach in a salad spinner if you have one, but patting it dry on a clean towel or paper towel should be all that is necessary to remove most excess water."

      "title": "Cut the spinach if you wish.",
      "content": "Cut the spinach if you wish. Remove the stems of the leaves if you prefer not to eat them, and cut the leaves into pieces if you wish or if your recipe calls for it. The stems are perfectly edible, but can be slightly tougher or stringier than the leaves when eating. If you cook down your spinach to a soft texture, you will likely not even notice this difference. In addition to any cutting, the baby spinach will reduce its size on its own when cooking."

      "title": "Saute the spinach in a skillet.",
      "content": "Saute the spinach in a skillet. Place your rinsed and dried baby spinach into a skillet or other pan and stir or turn until it is cooked evenly. You may cover the pan with a lid for faster cooking. Saute the spinach over medium heat. You may add oil or butter first, but the water content of the spinach will quickly be released and prevent it from sticking to the pan on its own. Continue to stir or turn the spinach with a spatula or tongs until all leaves are heated evenly, appear wilted, and turn a bright green. [3] X Research source Fresh baby spinach reduces in size considerably as it cooks. You can add more spinach to the pan as it cooks down and makes more space, if desired."

    {
      "title": "Try boiling your spinach.",
      "content": "Try boiling your spinach. Place your rinsed and dried baby spinach into a pot and cover it with water. Bring the water to a boil and cook for one minute before removing. You can boil the spinach for longer than a minute, but it will quickly get tender and turn a bright green after very little time. After boiling, pour the contents of the pot into a colander to drain."

    {
      "title": "Steam the spinach.",
      "content": "Steam the spinach. Try steaming your spinach by placing your rinsed baby spinach into a steaming basket and putting it into a pot with a small amount of water to boil for three to five minutes. [4] X Research source This method cooks the spinach lightly and skips the draining step necessary for boiling. If you are pressed for time, you can also steam fresh spinach in the microwave by placing it in a microwave-safe bowl with a small amount of water, covering the bowl with a lid, and microwaving for 30 seconds to two minutes depending on your microwave and desired cooking level.

      "title": "Remove spinach from the freezer to thaw.",
      "content": "Remove spinach from the freezer to thaw. Let your frozen baby spinach thaw out in the refrigerator or out in the kitchen in room temperature in advance of cooking it. Place the frozen spinach into your refrigerator a day or two in advance, or into a room temperature environment if you can only thaw a couple hours in advance. Keep frozen spinach in its original packaging or in a sealed bag or container to prevent mess from excess liquid during thawing. Use a microwave to defrost the spinach last-minute if you could not thaw it in advance. Don't microwave it long enough to cook the spinach, only to defrost it."

      "title": "Drain excess liquid if needed.",
      "content": "Drain excess liquid if needed. Remove the excess moisture created from thawing the frozen baby spinach, if desired, by squeezing or pressing the spinach lightly. You only need to remove extra liquid if you are intending to later add the spinach to a bread, souffl√©, dip, or another similar recipe for which excess liquid could create a problem or different outcome. Try placing thawed spinach into a cloth towel or a few paper towels and squeezing or patting it dry. Or, try using a potato ricer tool to press the liquid from the spinach. You may decide not to drain spinach for recipes that won't be harmed by extra liquid, or could even benefit from it by adding extra moisture while cooking."

If you use garlic or onion when sauteing spinach, chop and add them to the pan with a little butter or oil first to cook for a few minutes before adding in the spinach. A pinch of sea salt, black pepper, chili flakes, or any other seasonings you like can be added to cooked spinach as well. If you are boiling or steaming your baby spinach, add any additional ingredients or flavorings after you have removed it from heat and drained the water out."
