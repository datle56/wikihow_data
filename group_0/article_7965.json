If the pet urine is fresh and still wet, press a few paper towels down onto the wet spot and hold it there for a few seconds to soak up as much of the urine as possible. Then, with fresh paper towels, continue dabbing the wet spot until the paper towels come up dry. [1] X Research source You can also use an old rag instead of paper towels. Make sure that you dab the urine spot instead of rubbing, which can cause the urine smell to spread across the fabric. [2] X Research source"

This will allow you to apply to the vinegar to the urine stain without having to saturate a larger area of the suitcase. If the smell of straight vinegar is too strong for you, you can dilute it with water by adding 3 parts water to every 1 part of distilled white vinegar in the spray bottle. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray the urine stained spot with the vinegar. With the vinegar-filled spray bottle, spray the urine spot until it’s completely saturated. Then, if the pet urine is on soft luggage, turn the luggage over and spray the opposite side of the fabric where the urine spot is located as well. This will help you remove any urine stains and odors that may have seeped into the luggage fabric. [4] X Research source If the pet urine spot is on hard luggage, you can just spray the spot on one side."

      "content": "Set the luggage outside to dry completely. Once the urine spot is completely saturated with white vinegar, leave it to dry completely for several hours or overnight. If possible, place the luggage outside so that the fresh air will help remove the urine odor even more.

Once your luggage is completely dry, pour a light layer of baking soda over the entire urine spot area. This will help neutralize any remaining odors even more. [7] X Research source If the urine spot was small or didn’t have a strong smell, you can skip the next steps and leave the baking soda alone to absorb any lingering odors overnight. [8] X Expert Source Melanie Garcia Professional House Cleaner Expert Interview. 10 October 2019. If the odor is strong, however, you’ll likely need to add the hydrogen peroxide and dish soap solution on top of the baking soda."

      "content": "Add hydrogen peroxide and dish detergent if the odor is strong. In a small bowl, mix 3 ⁄ 4 cup (180 mL) of hydrogen peroxide with 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of dishwashing detergent. Then, slowly pour the solution over the baking soda-covered urine stain. Use a scrub brush or old toothbrush to mix the baking soda with the solution and work it into the luggage fabric. [9] X Research source While using baking soda alone can neutralize some pet urine odors from luggage, adding the hydrogen peroxide and dish soap solution will help neutralize the urine smell if it was still strong after soaking in white vinegar. The solution will likely start to bubble as you pour it over the baking soda."

If you’ve cleaned your luggage thoroughly but there’s still a lingering odor, you can try to get rid of it by making an odor-eliminating pouch and leaving it in your luggage when you’re not using it. For example, try making your own pet urine odor-eliminating pouch by placing a scoop of new kitty litter and a dryer sheet in a small sachet. Tie the sachet up so nothing spills out, then leave it in your suitcase to deodorize over time. You can also pour about 3 drops of your favorite essential oils onto a few cotton balls and place them inside the luggage. [15] X Research source You can leave the scented cotton balls loose or put them in a sachet to keep them together. You can also purchase pre-filled odor-eliminating pouches."
