Steel Wing, however, is promising stat-wise as it does 13.8 DPS and returns 7.5 energy, but it is best used situationally (it's weak against Steel-Type Pokémon). Attacks that are the same type as Dragonite (Dragon and Flying) get a bonus to damage, so that includes Dragon Tail, Dragon Breath, Hurricane, Outrage, Dragon Pulse, Dragon Claw, and Draco Meteor. All Possible Quick Moves: (all the best moves are in italics) Dragon Tail Dragon Breath Steel Wing All Possible Main Moves: (all the best moves are in italics) Dragon Claw Draco Meteor Outrage Hyper Beam Hurricane Dragon Pulse Superpower Frustration (Shadow) Return (Purified) Dragonite evolves from Dratini to Dragonair (with 25 candies ) to Dragonite (with 100 candies)!"
