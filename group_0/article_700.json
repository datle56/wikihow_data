A ball that swings from the leg side toward the off side is an inswing, and a ball that swings from the off side toward the leg side is an outswing.

[3] X Research source [4] X Research source The last point of contact with the ball should be your middle finger. [5] X Research source To bowl an outswing, release the ball with the seam pointed at about a 20 degree angle towards the slip fielders. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source The last point of contact with the ball should be your index finger. [8] X Research source A conventional swing will work best between 30 and 70 mph."

      "content": "Use a ball 40 or more overs old. A new ball will swing naturally in a conventional direction, but at about this age, wear on ball changes its aerodynamics. It begins to swing in opposite direction of seam, towards the shine. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep the ball in good shape.",
      "content": "Keep the ball in good shape. Reverse swinging works best when the smooth side of the ball is very smooth, the rough side is very rough, and the seam is prominent. [10] X Research source Continually polish the smooth side of the ball during play. Keep in mind, however, that scratching the rough side constitutes tampering, and is illegal."

      "content": "Bowl as you would a conventional swing, but with the sides of the ball reversed. This means the shiny side will now be facing away from the batsman. The difference between a conventional swing and a reverse swing is that in the former, the ball swings in the direction of the seam, while in the latter it swings in the opposite direction. [12] X Research source To bowl an inswing, release the ball with the seam pointed at about a 20 degree angle towards the slip fielders. [13] X Research source [14] X Research source The last point of contact with the ball should be your middle finger. [15] X Research source To bowl an outswing, release the ball with the seam pointed at about a 20 degree angle towards fine leg. [16] X Research source [17] X Research source The last point of contact with the ball should be your index finger. [18] X Research source Bowl hard. The faster you are able to bowl, the more effectively you will be able to achieve a reverse swing. The speed necessary also depends on the state of the ball; the rougher the rough side of the ball is, the less speed you will need."

At a low speed (under 70mph), the ball will swing toward the rough side. [20] X Research source At a high speed (over 70mph), the ball will swing toward the smooth side. [21] X Research source Note that the exact speed that determines the direction of the swing will vary based on the amount of wear on the ball. [22] X Research source"
