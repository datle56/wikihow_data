If the magnet doesn't magnetically cling to the object, it's brass. If the magnet does magnetically cling to the object, it's likely that the “brass” piece is really a piece of iron or steel, covered with a brass coating. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine if the piece you want to clean should be cleaned. Some brass objects are not meant to be bright, and therefore, any efforts to clean the piece might actually diminish its worth. If you are unsure of what your next steps should be in cleaning a brass piece, talk to a brass expert and discuss your cleaning options. [2] X Research source Sometimes patina (the turquoise coloring that forms on brass and copper) can add a unique look to a piece of brass, and should be left alone. Patina is used to evaluate many aspects of a piece of brass. For example, patina can be used to determine the age of a piece of brass, its current condition, and its potential value. Any removal or alteration of patina on a brass piece can significantly affect its worth. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Determine if the brass piece is lacquered.",
      "content": "Determine if the brass piece is lacquered. On modern brass pieces, an outer coating of lacquer serves as a layer of protection against oxidation. But, older, antique pieces of brass typically don't have a lacquered coating. [4] X Research source You can assess if a brass piece is lacquered by looking at its surface: it will have a clear finish covering the entire piece. Brass covered with lacquer will usually only tarnish if there is a crack in the lacquer coating. [5] X Research source Lacquered brass is fairly easy to clean; all you really need is some soapy water. However, you might want to consider removing the lacquering if tarnish has formed underneath the lacquer finish. If you are still having trouble figuring out if your brass piece has a lacquered finish, remember that lacquered brass usually has more of a yellow shading. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean your lacquered brass piece. The first line of defense for keeping your brass pieces clean is to regularly dust them using a soft rag. [7] X Research source After dusting your lacquered brass, dip a soft cotton cloth into a mixture of mild dish detergent and lukewarm water. Wring out the cloth so it's only slightly damp, and gently wipe the brass surface clean. Once you have cleaned the surface, use a wrung out cloth dipped in clean water to remove any remaining soap, and then dry the brass piece thoroughly. If you are trying to remove tarnish that has accumulated underneath lacquered brass, you need to remove the layer of lacquer first."

      "content": "Remove the lacquer with hot water. Hot water softens the lacquer layering covering brass. Place the brass piece in a sink basin, and pour hot water over the brass. [8] X Research source The hot water will heat up the brass, making it expand. The lacquer will expand with the brass. However, when the brass starts to cool down, it will slightly shrink, but the lacquer won't shrink with it. Once the brass is cool, the lacquer should be slightly separated from the brass surface, and can easily be peeled away. [9] X Research source You could also try boiling your brass in water to remove the lacquer, depending on the size of the piece. All you need to do is immerse the brass piece in a non-aluminum pot with boiling water, and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, carefully take the brass piece out of the water, let it cool, and peel off the lacquer. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the lacquer with varnish remover.",
      "content": "Remove the lacquer with varnish remover. Place the brass piece on a table that is heavily layered with newspapers. The newspaper will help protect the workspace by absorbing any varnish remover drippings. Consider using a paintbrush to thoroughly and evenly coat the brass piece with the varnish remover. Once you have applied the remover, let it sit for a minute or two, and then wipe away the varnish remover with a soft cloth. Be sure to consult the instructions found on the container of varnish remover. Be cautious and follow the manufacturer's cleaning guidelines, because varnish remover is made from strong chemicals that could be dangerous. Protect your skin and wear rubber gloves when handling varnish remover. Because of the hazardous fumes from varnish remover, work outside or in an area that's well ventilated. Also stay away from open flames when working with varnish remover since it's highly flammable."

      "title": "Polish the brass.",
      "content": "Polish the brass. Make sure the brass is clean of all surface dust and dirt before you begin polishing. There are many kinds of commercial brass polishes, but you can make your own brass polish at home with lemon. Cut a lemon in half and squeeze all the juice from the half lemon into a small bowl. Add in either table salt or baking soda – it doesn't matter which, the salt/baking soda is only acting as an abrasive – until you form a paste. [11] X Research source This might require about a teaspoon or more of salt or baking soda. Apply the paste to the brass piece using a soft cloth. Make sure you apply the paste going with the grain of the metal. If not, you could make tiny little scratches in the brass surface. Don't rub the paste too harshly into the brass piece. The abrasive salt/baking soda will gently remove the tarnish. Consider using a soft-bristled toothbrush to clean the nooks and hard to reach areas of your brass piece. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider polishing your brass with commercial cleaners. There are many eco-friendly brass cleaners that remove tarnish and restore shine to brass pieces without scratching and damaging the surface. Sometimes, brass cleansers have an abrasive element in their formula, so be mindful to not damage fragile etchings on your brass piece. Stay way from muriatic acid. It does not properly clean brass, and can leave behind permanent stains. Undiluted white vinegar or ammonia can be highly effective in cleaning antique brass. Allow the brass piece to soak for an hour in either vinegar or ammonia. Both products are natural cleaning agents, and can give brass a lasting, shiny finish. [13] X Research source"

Although you can make your own brass cleaner at home or use commercial brass cleaners bought from the store, consider using some of these other natural ingredients to clean your brass pieces: Ketchup . Use a soft cloth to slather your brass piece with ketchup. Let the ketchup sit on the brass surface for approximately 10 minutes, and then wipe the ketchup off with a clean, damp cloth. Dry the brass piece thoroughly. [14] X Research source Yogurt . Cover your brass piece with plain yogurt. The lactic acid in the yogurt is what works to break down and dissolve the tarnishing on the brass. Allow the yogurt to dry on the brass, and then rinse it off with water, and dry the brass piece with a clean cloth. [15] X Research source White vinegar and salt . Cover the brass piece with white vinegar (either by pouring or spraying the vinegar over the brass surface), and then sprinkle salt over the vinegar. [16] X Research source Wet a cloth with a little bit of vinegar, and gently wipe down the brass. Dry with a clean cloth."

      "content": "Protect your brass from future tarnish. After you're finished cleaning your brass piece, protect it from future tarnishing by applying a lacquered finish. You can apply the lacquer using either a paintbrush or a cotton ball. Consult the instructions on the lacquer container to see the manufacturer's suggestions. However you decide to apply the lacquer, be sure to only put on a thin layer. Watch for any dripping lacquer, because the drippings can dry, leaving your brass piece covered in drip streaks. Allow the brass piece to dry thoroughly before touching. After the lacquer is dry, wipe the brass with a clean cloth to give it some shine."

Hold a magnet near the brass piece and see if it's magnetically attracted to the brass. If the magnet does not stick, you are most likely handling brass. If the magnet does stick, it's likely that your “brass” piece is actually a brass-plated piece of iron or steel. [17] X Research source An alternative way to check if your piece is brass or brass-plated, is to use a sharp kitchen knife and scratch an inconspicuous part of the item. If the item is brass, the color in the scratch should be bright yellow. [18] X Research source If the scratch mark is another color, like silver, then it is definitely another metal, and you still need to stick with non-abrasive cleaners so you don't remove the brass plating."

Dip a cloth into the soapy water, wring out the cloth so it's only slightly damp, and gently rub the surface of the brass piece. Never try to polish lacquered brass. The polish tends to turn the surface of the brass piece cloudy.
