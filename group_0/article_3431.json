When you're reciting your mantra, the part of your brain that makes self-judgmental thoughts turns off. You can use a mantra that you create for yourself, or you can choose a positive quote. Recite your mantra every morning or several times throughout the day. You can also post your mantra in your home, such as on your refrigerator, near your bathroom mirror, or on your wall. [2] X Research source Here are some examples of great mantras: “If I believe it, I can achieve it.” “Every day is a new beginning.” “I deserve love and happiness.” Reader Poll: We asked 984 wikiHow readers about which positive mantra works best for them, and only 9% said, “My body is strong in every way” .
