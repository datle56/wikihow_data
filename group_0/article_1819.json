      "content": "Add her to a private story or joke with her directly. If you add her as the only viewer to a private story you can use sliders to ask for her responses. Don’t take the responses too literally. She might be teasing you! [1] X Research source “Who’s cuter? Be honest.” Post this question with a poll. Put a photo of you next to a cute animal or something totally random and funny, like food. “How cute do you think I am?” Pair this question with a slider so you can gauge her interest. “Scale of 1-10, how likely are you to date me?” Try this question for a flirty way to get the conversation about dating going."

      "content": "Pair a very literal photo with a silly caption. You can create your pun masterpiece with a regular snap, or use a video to let your comedic timing and dramatic delivery shine. If you go for a longer pun, use a video so you don’t have to worry about character limits on captions. [2] X Research source Send a photo of grapes and say, “I think you and me would have a grape time if we went out.” Turn on your stove and say, “Is it hot in here, or is it just you? Come hangout so we can check.” Send a historically-themed photo or photo of a newspaper and say, “Learning about important dates in history. Do you want to go on one?” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a line that mentions a date or asks a question. Normal pick-up lines are good conversation starters, but try these when you want to move from flirting to asking to go out. Since Snapchat limits characters for captions, you can spread out your joke over a few snaps or write it down on a piece of paper and snap a photo. [4] X Research source “I’ve heard staring at screens is bad for your eyes. How about we have this conversation over dinner tomorrow?” “Knock-knock.” (Who's there?) “When where.” (When where who?) “Tomorrow night, my house, you?” “My friends bet me I couldn’t Snapchat the most beautiful girl in the world. Where do you want to go spend their money?”"

      "content": "Take advantage of Snapchat’s visual element. Instead of typing, “Do you want to go out with me?” you can spell out a simpler question with random items for a clever, original approach. [5] X Research source Arrange pens, markers, or colored pencils to spell out the words “You + me?” Spell out all or part of “Grab food with me?” in actual food. You can trace the letters in flour, write them with alphabet soup or alphabet crackers, and arrange candy or pasta. Go for a classically romantic vibe by spelling out “Date me?” in rocks or beach sand."

If you can only draw stick figures, no worries, it’ll still be funny and great! Label the drawing with her name or just “you.” [6] X Research source “What’s missing from this pic?” “Wish you were here! Want to hangout?” “Doesn’t this pic look better with you in it?”"

Reply to her story by combining your date question with a comment on what you see in the photos. [7] X Research source If she posts a photo of food, you could say, “Please teach me how to cook!” Then send, “How about tomorrow night?” If she’s out somewhere, try saying, “That restaurant/place looks great. Want to go again with me?” If you see her doing fun activities, ask if you can do them together. Try something like, “Blown away by those tricks. Hit the skatepark with me?” Reader Poll: We asked 241 wikiHow readers, and 59% agreed that the most effective way to initiate a conversation with your crush on Snapchat (and eventually ask them on a date!) is to reply to their Story to start a conversation .
