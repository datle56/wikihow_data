[1] X Research source This will help you become a more competitive job candidate later in life, and will help you gain confidence. For example: Practice calling games as much as you can. Sit in the stands during any sporting events you can find, and record yourself using a tape recorder or your phone.

      "title": "Stay involved in sports.",
      "content": "Stay involved in sports. Although journalism classes and sportscasting practice are important, you should also continue playing sports of your choice, and should stay involved in the athletic community. If you’re going to work as a sportscaster, you should be passionate about sports—remaining athletically active is the best way to maintain that passion and will give you an understanding of how the games work—which is what you will announce and analyze as a professional sportscaster. Playing one or more sports will also allow you to form contacts and network within an athletic community."

      "title": "Watch as many games as you can and pay special attention to the sportscasting.",
      "content": "Watch as many games as you can and pay special attention to the sportscasting. The best way to develop your own sportscasting abilities is to watch and listen to professional sportscasters.

      "title": "Research the schools you’re interested in attending.",
      "content": "Research the schools you’re interested in attending. Pay attention especially to their journalism and sports broadcasting programs. You can choose a school with a strong journalism program or, for example, sports journalism or broadcast journalism programs.

      "title": "Start a student-run broadcasting program.",
      "content": "Start a student-run broadcasting program. While many broadcasting programs exist, it may be hard for college students or recent graduates to break into these markets. Start talking to the Media or Radio departments at your university, and see if they allow students to start their own shows. [4] X Research source If that is not an option, try starting your own broadcasting platform, such as a YouTube channel or a podcast."

      "title": "Look for a sports broadcast internship opportunity.",
      "content": "Look for a sports broadcast internship opportunity. This is even more important in college than it was in high school, as an internship will allow you to gain practical experience outside of an academic setting and give you time to study the craft of sportscasting. An internship is typically required to gain practical experience. You can obtain an internship on your own or with the help of your academic advisor. Generally, internships are for one quarter or semester (depending on your university) or for a summer. Although internships may pay, they are typically only for college credit."

      "title": "Hone and perfect your broadcasting skills.",
      "content": "Hone and perfect your broadcasting skills. Broadcasting is a challenging responsibility; it calls for specialized skills that cannot be developed in other fields or lines of work. A job as a sportscaster requires an individual with charisma, who can think on their feet and is capable of both announcing specific plays, while also synthesizing information about players and teams with the overall narrative of a sports game. Build a demo tape with the help of your adviser or a sports broadcast professional. The demo tape should be audio or video clips of work done during your internship or college television broadcasts. Join college and professional journalism and sports broadcast journalism organizations or groups. Joining such an organization will allow you to network with other sports journalists. Some colleges (and even high schools) also record student sportscasting, and then upload the videos to stream from the college’s athletics page online. If your college doesn’t record and upload student broadcasting, check with someone in Athletics to see if they’ll consider recording student sportscasting. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Develop your networking skills and acquire connections with sportscasting professionals.

Make sure that your references and contacts know you personally; cultivate personal relationships, not just face recognition. Don’t hesitate to ask for letters of reference or other forms of personal recommendation for internship programs or jobs."

Even if you must start out with a low-level job, or one that does not allow you airtime initially, the job will still be valuable as long as it is in the field of sports broadcasting. Closely observe other sportscasters. You can gather a wealth of information from professional sportscasters: interview them, learn from their mannerisms and speech in front of the camera, and learn from them as mentors. Work up from a sports reporter to a sportscaster. Many sportscasters start out providing on-the-field game coverage as sports reporters, and occasionally pick up opportunities for sportscasting work at their TV or radio station. This is a common way to work your way up in the field."
