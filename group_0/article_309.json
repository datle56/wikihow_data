      "content": "Try these formulas to come up with your own unique Instagram handle. Although you do have the option of using a traditional username generator, it might be fun to try to come up with an original one yourself. [1] X Research source Insert your name + descriptor pertaining to a hobby/quirk/personal preference. Additional points if you use alliteration or rhyming. Adding a “the” ahead of your username could also give it that X-factor. Examples: @FarrahForever @TheRagingCajun Insert your name + a pop culture reference. This should be something timeless that you wouldn't mind being associated with you… forever! Examples: @OopsBriDidItAgin @OgreLikeOnions Insert one adjective that describes you + another. This is a good opportunity to show people what you care about and who you are! Examples: @SassyNClassy @TreeHuggerHipppie Insert a concept(s) you find interesting + make it punny. Examples: @TheVeryHungryMrMiller @TheMattInTheHat These are just a few ideas to get you going, so don’t be afraid to play around with the formulas and arrive at your own, totally unique IG handle!"

      "content": "Remember to consider your audience when choosing a username. Do you want your profile to be geared toward family, friends, and real-life acquaintances? Or do you hope to use this platform as a jumping-off point for, say, your blossoming cupcake baking career or to promote your artisanal press-on nail business? Identifying your audience will help you decide on how personal or professional you want your username to lean. For example, @CraftedByCasey would definitely convey your message better than @AccordingToCasey. One of the main pillars of a memorable IG handle is creativity. Since so many usernames are already taken– two billion!— creativity is key when selecting yours. [2] X Research source As a general rule of thumb, try not to use too many numbers or underscores, as they make your username harder to read. And on Instagram, to be read is to be seen!"
