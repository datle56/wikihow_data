      "title": "Talk about getting a new phone.",
      "content": "Talk about getting a new phone. Sometimes, starting the conversation can lead you to a solution. Be polite when you tell your parents that you are interested in getting a new phone, and listen to what they have to say. If you can respond to your parent's reasons and excuses for not convincingly getting you a new phone, they'll be more likely to shell out for your brand-new mobile device. You might ask: \"What can I do to earn a new phone?\" \"Are there any other chores I can help with to prove I'm ready for a new phone?\""

      "title": "Work to find solutions.",
      "content": "Work to find solutions. Stay calm throughout your talk with your parents about your phone situation and keep your cool if you hear a \"no\" in response. This is an opportunity for you to show your maturity and to earn points with your parents. Instead of getting upset or frustrated, ask your parents: \"What can I do to change your mind?\" \"What can I do to prove to you that I need a new phone?\""

      "title": "Offer to put your own money toward your new phone.",
      "content": "Offer to put your own money toward your new phone. This can be tricky, especially if you're too young to work. If you have birthday money saved up, you can offer to put that toward getting a new phone, or you can offer to do more housework in exchange for an allowance. [1] X Research source Offer your services as a babysitter to friends and family who have children who are younger than you and need supervision. You might be able to earn money around your neighborhood doing seasonal chores, like mowing lawns in summer or shoveling snow in winter."

      "content": "Be persistent without being rude. When you want something badly, sometimes it's all you can think about. However, asking again and again can irritate your parents, making them less willing to get you a phone. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Instead of asking the same question repeatedly, ask in a roundabout way that highlights your recent effort. You might say, for example: \"How does the kitchen look? I've been trying to help out by doing dishes. I thought that maybe if I helped out around the house more, we could talk again about getting me a new phone.\" \"I know you've been busy with work lately, so I vacuumed the house for you. Is there anything else I can help with? I was thinking that if I contributed more, I might be able to get a new phone.\""

      "content": "Build a convincing argument. Your parents will be more likely to buy you a new phone if they agree with your reasoning. Your reasoning will be influenced by your situation, so you'll have to decide which arguments will work best for you. Some you might want to consider include: [3] X Research source A cell phone can be used to call them or emergency services if you are in trouble. [4] X Research source A cell phone can help with logistics if you need to be picked up from somewhere.

      "title": "Choose your moment wisely.",
      "content": "Choose your moment wisely. Times, when your parents are busy, flustered, or angry, are likely to result in a \"no\" to your phone request. Choose a good time to talk to them. Make sure they are relaxed rather than busy or stressed out. [5] X Research source Encourage a good mood in your parents before you ask, by being extra polite and doing any chores you might have before they ask. To improve your chances of a yes before you ask for your new phone, you also might: [6] X Research source Turn on your parents' favorite music Talk about an experience where you both had fun Do an activity your parents find enjoyable"

      "title": "Wait for a holiday or birthday.",
      "content": "Wait for a holiday or birthday. While your parents might normally be unwilling to pay the cost of a new phone, a special day, like a gift-giving holiday, can be the ideal excuse to splurge on a present. During this time, be clear with your parents. Let them know that you'd rather have a phone than toys or gifts you might not use. [7] X Research source Don't make up a holiday or use a holiday that you don't celebrate. For example, if your family doesn't celebrate Hanukkah, then don't ask for a Hanukkah gift. Give your parents time to purchase the gift. Don't ask the day just before your birthday. Give your parents a month or so."

      "title": "Summarize what your parents say.",
      "content": "Summarize what your parents say. Listen to what your parents have to say carefully, and then when it's your turn to speak, put what they said in your own words. By showing that you hear and respect what they are saying, you will improve your chances of getting your new phone. [8] X Research source For example, you might say: \"So if I'm hearing you right, Mom, you don't think a new phone is worth the cost and you're worried that I'll drop it like my last phone. I hear what you're saying, but I have some ideas...\""

      "title": "Ask in good weather and after meals.",
      "content": "Ask in good weather and after meals. Generally speaking, people are more agreeable after they eat, and this might put your parents in a more favorable mood when you ask for your new phone. [9] X Research source Weather can also make your parents more or less agreeable. Sunny days with clear skies will improve your odds of getting the phone you desire. [10] X Research source Keep in mind that this won't always be the case. Your mom or dad could still have a bad day even if it's sunny out and you just had lunch."

      "content": "Get your foot in the door with a small request. Your parents will be more likely to agree to your request for a new phone if you get them to first agree to a few small, related requests. [11] X Research source For example, ask your parents to eat out, or another small request that they will probably say yes to, before asking them for a new phone."

      "title": "Make a deal with your parents.",
      "content": "Make a deal with your parents. If your parents are open to you doing extra work around the house or some other task to earn your phone, stay on top of your extra chores without being asked. This will show your parents that you are taking your agreement seriously, which will result in your parents taking it seriously as well. [12] X Research source It may take a while before you get your phone. Don't expect you to get your phone after just a week of doing chores; it may take longer than that. Don't worry if you slip up once or twice. As long as you show your parents that you are trying your hardest, they may give you some slack."
