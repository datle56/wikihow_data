      "title": "Turn off the pump on the pool filter.",
      "content": "Turn off the pump on the pool filter. Make sure that the filter pump won't be able to turn back on while you are working on it. Locate the switch for the pool filter and turn it off. This will stop water from entering the system while you clean it, as well as cutting power to the area while dealing with water. [1] X Research source The switch for your pool filter should be nearby the filter itself. For extra safety, or if you cannot find the right switch, cut power to the area from your circuit breaker box before you begin working."

      "title": "Remove the drain plug and let the filter tank fully drain.",
      "content": "Remove the drain plug and let the filter tank fully drain. Locate the drain plug near the bottom of your filter tank and unscrew it completely. This will let all of the water drain out of the tank, so make sure it is draining somewhere away from your pool that will not be affected by a lot of water. Fully draining the tank can take up to an hour, so give it plenty of time. [2] X Research source If your pool filter is in a pump house or anywhere else you don’t want water draining, quickly attach a hose over the drain plug after you remove it. This will let the water drain elsewhere. Make sure not to lose the drain plug, or any other components you remove from the pool filter. Keep them somewhere safe until they are ready to be reattached."

      "content": "Take the collar off the base of the multiport valve. Locate the collar around the edge of the multiport valve, near the top of your filter tank. Use a screwdriver to loosen the bolts on either side of the collar until you can remove them completely. Pull apart the two sides of the collar to remove them. [3] X Research source The collar on the multiport valve is used to clamp it in place, so may also be referred to as a “clamp.”"

      "title": "Unscrew the unions holding the pipes to the multiport valve.",
      "content": "Unscrew the unions holding the pipes to the multiport valve. Any pipes connected to the valve will make removing it much more difficult. Carefully unscrew the unions near any pipe attached to the valve and disconnect the pipes. [4] X Research source If the pipes attached to your valve do not have unions to allow them to be removed, you will have to use a saw to cut the pipe instead. As you’ll need to replace the sand in your pool filter regularly, install union fittings on the pipe so that you can easily connect and disconnect the pipes in future. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover the standpipe with tape or a rubber plug. This will prevent any sand from getting into the pipe and working its way into your pool while removing or adding sand. Duct tape or any strong tape will work, as will a rubber plug that fits, but make sure it is easy to remove when you're finished. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a shop vac to remove the old sand.",
      "content": "Use a shop vac to remove the old sand. Lower the nozzle of a shop vac or similar tool into the opening of the tank and begin removing the old sand from the bottom. As you remove sand, be careful to avoid directly touching or hitting any components or laterals at the base of the tank. These can be fragile and difficult to replace. [8] X Research source If you do not have a shop vac, you can use a large cup or scoop to remove the sand from the bottom of the tank. This will take longer, and as the sand has been filtering everything in the pool, can be unsanitary. If you choose to do this, always wear gloves and be careful."

      "content": "Clean the tank thoroughly. Once you have removed the bulk of the sand from the tank, use a garden hose to thoroughly clean it both inside and outside. Spraying water into the tank should help clean out any last bits of sand left inside the tank. [9] X Research source Make sure any fittings on the tank are dried fully before reattaching anything to them. The moisture can get trapped inside the threading on your tank and may damage the components over time. Keeping the tank dry will also help in detecting a leak when the pump is turned back on."

      "title": "Pour new pool silica sand into the tank.",
      "content": "Pour new pool silica sand into the tank. Position one corner of a bag of pool-grade silica filter sand over the mouth of the tank. Make a small cut in the corner of the bag to allow sand to slowly fall into the tank. Work slowly and carefully to prevent any sand from spilling. Repeat until you have added the amount of sand needed for your filter. [11] X Research source If you are worried about damaging the components on the inside of the tank, add a little bit of water to the bottom of the tank before pouring in the new sand. This will cushion the sand as it is added but may misalign the standpipe. [12] X Research source As you add sand, make sure the standpipe in the center of the tank stays right in the middle and at the right height. It will need to reattach to the base of the multiport valve when you are finished, so you can line the two up to check if you’re unsure. [13] X Research source The amount of sand needed will vary between pool filters. Check for stickers along the side of the tank or in your tank’s manual to find out how much your tank needs to operate. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Lubricate the O-ring on the valve with a multipurpose lubricant. Locate the rubber “O-ring” around the top of the multiport valve where it will form a seal with the mouth of the tank. Apply a small amount of lube to your finger and rub it around the O-ring. This will make reattaching the valve to the tank easier, as well as conditioning the rubber seal. [15] X Research source If the O-ring is damaged, you might need to replace it rather than just lubricating it. These should be available from hardware and pool supply stores in the size you need."
