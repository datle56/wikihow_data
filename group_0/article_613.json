Since the denominators of the fractions are 2 and 4, the LCD is 4, because 4 is the smallest number that is divisible by both 2 and 4. [4] X Research source"

Before you can add the fractions, they have to have 4 as their denominator, so you have to make the fractions maintain their value while having a new base. Here's how to do it: Since the denominator of the fraction 1/2 has to be multiplied by 2 to get 4 as the new base, you should multiply the numerator 1 by 2 as well. 1x2=2, so the new fraction is 2/4. The fraction 2/4 = 1/2, but has been put in a larger ratio to have a larger base. This means that the numbers are equivalent fractions. They have a different base, but their value remains the same. [5] X Research source Since the fraction 3/4 already has the base of 4, you don't have to change it."

      "content": "Convert any improper fractions into mixed numbers. An improper fraction is a fraction where the numerator is equal to or larger than the denominator. You need to convert the improper fraction into a mixed number before you can add it to the sum of the whole numbers. Since the original problem used mixed numbers, your answer should use mixed numbers too. Here's how to do it: [7] X Research source First, divide the numerator by the denominator. Do long division to divide 4 into 5. 4 goes into 5 1 time. This means that the quotient is 1. The remainder, or the number that is left over, is 1. Make your quotient the new whole number. Take your remainder and place it over the original denominator to finish converting the improper fraction into a mixed number. The quotient is 1, the remainder is 1, and the original denominator was 4, so the final answer is 1 1/4."

You can do this by multiplying the denominator and whole number of a mixed number, and then adding this to the numerator of the fraction of the mixed number. [9] X Research source Your answer will be the new numerator while the denominator remains the same. [10] X Research source To convert 1 1/2 to a mixed number, multiply the whole number 1 by the denominator 2, and then add it to the numerator. Put your new answer over the original base. 1 * 2 = 2, and 2 + 1 = 3. Place the answer 3 over the original denominator and you have 3/2. To convert 2 3/4 to a mixed number, multiply the whole number 2 by the denominator 4. 2 * 4 = 8. Next, add this number to the original numerator and place it over the original denominator. 8 + 3 = 11. Put 11 over 4 to get 11/4."
