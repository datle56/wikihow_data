The Moderate streaming quality can still stream in HD, but stops short of the 4K UHD quality offered by Automatic. Lowering your stream quality to Moderate will save you data, however. The Save Data option uses the least amount of data, but can only stream in standard definition."

Kid-poof Exit allows you to add a simple question so a child cannot easily or accidentally exit \"Junior Mode\" without your approval. Content Rating is not selectable when \"Junior Mode\" is enabled since all the content is automatically restricted to G ratings. But you can go here and select content ratings for each profile on the account.

Disney+ requires you to reenter your password before updating your content rating settings.
