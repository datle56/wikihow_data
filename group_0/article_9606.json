This is the same as saying that for every 180° Fahrenheit range, there is only a 100° Celsius range. You can express that as 180/100, which when simplified equals 1.8, so to finish the conversion you must divide by 1.8. For the example from step one, divide your result, 42, by 1.8. 42/1.8 = 23°C. Therefore, 74°F can be converted to 23°C. Note that 1.8 is the equivalent of 9/5. If you don't have a calculator or prefer working with fractions, you can divide your result from the first step by 9/5 instead of 1.8."
