This code lets you call out of the country you’re currently in.

      "content": "Connect to WiFi to avoid paying data fees. Before you make a call using the Internet, access a WiFi network so you aren’t using cellular data. When you’re making an international call, your service provider may charge you for call minutes, text messages, and even data usage. To avoid using data, turn it off in your phone’s settings. On an iPhone, for instance, go to Settings, then choose Cellular. Switch the toggle button next to “Cellular Data” off. Try a hotel, restaurant, library, or coffee shop if you’re looking for free WiFi."
