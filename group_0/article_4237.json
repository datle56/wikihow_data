Godhuman is great for PvP since it does a lot of damage and inflicts stun. Sanguine Art is an all-rounder style that does a lot of damage and breaks instinct. It also has ranged click attacks, making it great for grinding, especially when paired with Buddha. However, it is by far the most difficult fighting style to unlock. Dragon Talon is good for grinding since it has AoE skills with big hitboxes. However, it does have extremely high knockback compared to Sharkman Karate or Sanguine Art."
