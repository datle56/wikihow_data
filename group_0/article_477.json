Navigate the automated menu (listen for options about gift cards and activation), and enter the card’s 16-digit number, expiration date, and 4-digit CID when prompted.

      "content": "Sign your name on the back of the gift card. Use a blue or black ink pen and sign your signature in the box provided. Having your signature on the back of the card will allow store clerks to verify your identity by checking the signature on the card against your signature on your driver’s license or a credit card. It will also help you find the gift card if you ever happen to lose it. [5] X Research source Wait 20–30 minutes after you sign the card before putting it into your pocket or wallet, to make sure the ink is dry."

Before you start using your card, write down the card number, 4-digit CID on the front of the card, and the 3-digit card security code (CSC) on the back of the card. In the case of a lost or stolen American Express gift card, call the American Express customer service number that was provided on the back of your card. [6] X Research source If you live in the U.S., the number is: 1-888-846-4308. In most cases, if your card has been lost or stolen, American Express will reimburse you for the amount of money remaining on the gift card (not counting any funds that you’ve already spent)."

      "content": "Check the card’s balance before making a purchase. If you’re not sure how much money is on your card (e.g., if the person who gave you the card didn’t specify how much the card is worth), find out online. Find the balance by navigating to: https://balance.amexgiftcard.com/ . Type in the card number and security code, press “Sign In,” and the next web page will show your total card balance. [7] X Research source Once you’ve started using the card regularly, you can also check the balance online at any point. Knowing the balance of your card before you go shopping can prevent you from accidentally maxing out the card."
