      "content": "Find a quiet, private place to talk. You should try talking to your significant other about your self harm habits face to face, preferably in a quiet, private spot. This may be at your home or the home you share together in a neutral spot, such as the kitchen or the living room. You may also talk to your significant other in a place that you both like to go to together, such as a park near your home or a quiet spot outdoors. Pick a place where both you and your partner will feel comfortable and safe. You may say to your significant other, “Can we talk about my self harm? Let's go to a private place and talk.”"

      "title": "Explain why you self harm.",
      "content": "Explain why you self harm. Begin the conversation by telling your significant other why you self harm, as best you can. You may not know exactly why or understand the root cause of your behavior. Think about how self harming makes you feel and any possible triggers for your behavior. Use “I” statements when you explain why you self harm to your partner and try to be as honest as you can. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source People self harm for a variety of reasons, such as trauma like physical or sexual abuse or the death of a loved one. Social issues like bullying and psychological issues like an eating disorder can also lead to self harm. You may or may not identify with these reasons as someone who self harms. For example, you may tell your significant other, “I self harm because it makes me forget my trauma” or “It may seem strange to you, but self harm makes me feel better, even if it's only for a moment.”"

      "title": "Answer any questions your significant other might have.",
      "content": "Answer any questions your significant other might have. Your significant other will likely have questions about your tendency to self harm. Try to answer their questions as best you can. Being honest with your partner will help them better understand where your behavior is coming from. It will also allow them to feel you can both talk about the issue together. They may have questions like, “Why do you self harm? How long have you been doing it? How does it help? How can I help? Why don't you just stop?” Use “I” statements and be as honest as you can when answering your significant other's questions. The conversation may be difficult for both of you so take your time and be patient with each other. If your significant other asks you a question that you can't answer, it's okay to respond, \"I don't know.\" No one has all of the answers, so don't try to force yourself to give one. It's also ok if you don't feel comfortable answering all of their questions"

      "content": "Respond calmly if your partner gets angry or fearful. Your significant other may be upset when they find out you self harm. They may react with anger or fear, even after you answer their questions about why you self harm. Be calm and patient with your partner. Reassure them that you are aware of the issue and that you appreciate their concern. Tell them that you are being honest with them about your tendency to self harm because you would like their support and understanding.

For example, you may tell your significant other, “Moving forward, let's promise to be honest and open with each other. I want us to be able to talk about my tendency to self harm and how if affects our relationship.”"

Try to have a meaningful conversation with your partner at least once a day and let them know how you are doing. If you are having a bad day, be honest about this and let your significant other know. If you are having a good day, tell your partner and celebrate this together.

      "content": "Try not to hide your self harm from them. Though you may struggle with your tendency to self harm on a day to day basis, try not to keep your habit from your significant other. Often, you feel a sense of shame when you self harm. But hiding it from your partner will only make your relationship more difficult and push your partner away. Being honest about your self harm and talking about it will show your partner that you are not keeping any secrets from them. For example, you may say to your significant other, “I self harmed today because I wasn't feeling good” or “I self harmed today because I felt triggered.” Don't be surprised if they ask you to pull up your sleeve or pant leg to see if you have done more self harm. Remember that they care about you, so it's normal for them to be worried about your safety."

      "content": "Accept encouragement and support from your significant other. Part of working through the issue with your partner is accepting their encouragement and support. Your partner may suggest that you talk to a mental health professional or your doctor if your tendency to self harm gets worse or becomes more frequent. They may also encourage you to build your self-esteem and confidence so you can stop self harming. Try to be open to their suggestions and not get defensive or angry at them. [2] X Research source For example, you may say to your significant other, “Thank you for always encouraging and supporting me. I appreciate you” or “I appreciate your support and encouragement. Thank you for listening and being there for me.” If your partner suggests that you stop self harming and you are not ready, tell them that you need more time. Be honest about where you are at and let them know putting pressure on you to stop will not help the situation. You may say, “I need more time. Please respect my decision” or “Putting pressure on me will not make this better. Please respect my choice.” If you do want to stop self harming but don't think you can, be honest with your partner about it. You could say, \"I really want to change this part of myself, but I don't know how to stop.\" Be ready to accept professional help after you talk to your partner about wanting help."
