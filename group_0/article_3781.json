      "content": "Instagram Beta gives Android users early access to new updates. In other words, you get to experience new, unreleased features before the rest of the general public. You can also submit feedback regarding the features to programmers to help them improve the app. For example, Instagram’s “dark mode” was a feature available to beta testers about a month before it was officially released. If you want to share your app usage data to improve Instagram's performance, consider joining the Instagram Android Beta program. You may experience more glitches and bugs than regular app users, but these should be tested and fixed promptly. Instagram beta is not available for iOS users , but this may change in the future."
