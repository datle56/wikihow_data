You can determine roughly how many calories you’ll burn exercising for 1 minute by using the following equation: (0.035 X body weight in kg) + ((Velocity in m/s ^ 2) / Height in m) X (0.029) X (body weight in kg) [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, if you're 1.6 meters tall (or about 5.25 feet tall), weigh 60 kg (or roughly 132 lbs.), and usually run at a rate of 2.86 meters a second (roughly 5.7 mph), you'd calculate (0.035 X 60 kg) + ((2.86 x 2.86) / 1.6 m) X (0.029) X (60 in kg) = 10.96. [18] X Research source In other words, if you weigh 132 lbs. (60 kg) and are 5.25 feet (1.6 m) tall, you'd burn about 10.96 calories a minute running at a pace of 5.7 mph, or 200 calories in about 18.24 minutes. You can use the University of Rochester Medical Center’s calorie burn rate calculator to get a general idea of how many calories you’ll burn doing certain activities. Just keep in mind that while your current weight factors into how you burn calories, it’s not the only factor: your age, sex, current weight, and height also affect how your body burns calories."

But one study found that exercising intensely for just 2.5 minutes can spur extra calorie burn throughout the rest of the day—up to 200 calories' worth. [19] X Research source You don't need to do the full 2.5 minutes at once: bike or sprint at full capacity for 5 30-second periods, broken up with 4-minute breaks during which you exercise slowly. While 2.5 minutes of exercise is a great way to start bringing more exercise into your day, aim for 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week, or 75 minutes of intense physical activity.
