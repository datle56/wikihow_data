Note that you will only be able to see the outer aspects of the ear; you won't be able to see inside the ear canal or eardrum since these turn in horizontally where the ear meets the head.

      "content": "Take your cat to the vet if you spot any abnormalities. It is normal for cats to have earwax and dirt on, in, and near their ears.

      "content": "Make sure your cat is relaxed. Some cats do not like having their ears cleaned and can put up a struggle. Bring your cat to a quiet room where there are no other pets. Your may need to have a second person readily available who can help you hold the cat while you clean the ears. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source The person holding the cat should use minimal restraint. A grip that is too firm will cause the cat to become less cooperative and more likely to claw to escape. If the cat won’t cooperate, you can also try to “burrito” the cat by wrapping her body (including all limbs) securely in a thick towel. If the cat becomes too agitated during any part of the cleaning process, stop. You don't want her to claw or bite you."

      "content": "Obtain a liquid ear cleaner. A good ear cleaner is mildly astringent and quick drying. You can purchase an ear cleaner at the veterinarian’s office or a reputable pet supply store. [9] X Research source Kirk and Bistner’s Handbook of Veterinary Procedures and Emergency Treatment. Ford and Mazzaferro. Elsevier You can also make your cleaner if you're in a pinch. A mixture of one part white vinegar and one part rubbing alcohol will work if used sparingly. Keep in mind that if your cat has any scratches or infections, using this homemade cleaner may sting. [10] X Research source Kirk and Bistner’s Handbook of Veterinary Procedures and Emergency Treatment. Ford and Mazzaferro. Elsevier Water should not be used as an ear cleaner because it can sit in the ear and allow yeast to grow. One alternative for cleaning the outer ear is to use a cotton swab moistened with olive oil."

Elsevier Use a firm but gentle pressure while rubbing the ear base. Do not rub vigorously as this can damage the eardrum.

Ford and Mazzaferro. Elsevier Do not clean too deep into the cat's ear canal. Doing so can damage the tissue that lines the ear canal and can even rupture your cat's eardrum. If the eardrum is ruptured, the cat may show signs of pain (pawing at the ear, meowing, etc.), lose her sense of balance or sit with her head tilted to the side. If you notice any of these symptoms, take your cat immediately to the vet's office for examination."
