      "content": "“Clock that tea” basically means “Hey! Pay attention to this information!” It's used to call attention to something that's gone unnoticed or that someone might be trying to hide. “Clock” means “recognize” and “tea” means “truth” or “gossip,” so “clock that tea” is like saying “Hey! Pay attention to this information!” The expression lightheartedly calls out or exposes someone for something they’re trying to hide, or to emphasize and agree with what someone has just said. Person A: “I don’t think Jordan is that smart, they cheat on every test!” Person B: “Clock that tea! Why is no one talking about this?” “Did you see how dark her roots were? She’s not a real blonde, clock that tea!”"

      "content": "To “clock” means to see something in someone that they're trying to hide. It sounds confusing, but here’s an example: Say a glamorous drag queen has a really visible wigline, putting a dent in the “illusion” she’s creating. You could say you “clocked her wig” or “clocked that hairline” because you saw something she didn’t want you to notice. [1] X Research source “Clocking” looks is common in drag, but you can clock just about anything: “Did you clock Brad and Jenny last night? They’re trying to act like they’re not together but it’s so obvious!” “Clock that cop lurking over there like no one can see him.”"

      "content": "“Tea” means “truth” and can refer to personal authenticity or gossip. “Tea” (sometimes “T”) is a common drag term that’s used in a variety of contexts. It can refer to living as your true self and celebrating your uniqueness (“I’m trans and that’s my tea”), or to gossip about others (“Have I got some tea for you!”). [2] X Research source “She’s living her true tea and I’m proud of her!” “Gather around, the tea is hot and I’ve got to share it now!” “Tea” pops up in a lot of common drag phrases, like: “ Spill the tea ” (“Share the gossip” or “tell me what’s going on”) “What’s the tea?” (“What happened?” or “What’s the gossip?”) “No tea, no shade” (“Don’t take this as an insult or gossip”) “Tea!” (“Yes” or “I agree”)"

Say “clock that tea” to point it out. It’s like saying, “ This is what you need to be paying attention to.” Person A: “Why is he so mad about the game? He’s being a sore loser.” Person B: “Clock that tea. He’s been like this all season.”"

Person A: “You like my new sweater? I got it in Europe.” Person B: “By Europe do you mean Target? I see that tag sticking out, clock that tea!”"

So, when someone makes a point you fully support, toss out a “clock that tea” to emphasize your agreement. Person A: “They painted over that gorgeous exposed brick and it looks bad.” Person B: “Clock that tea! I hate when people ruin it like that.”"

      "content": "“Clock that tea” has roots in drag, transgender, and Black culture. It’s not totally clear exactly when “clock that tea” emerged, but it’s likely that it came from NYC’s ballroom culture in the 80s and 90s. Balls were underground queer dance parties where people who were shunned for their sexuality or gender expression—especially African-American and Latinx folks—could dance and present how they wanted to. [3] X Research source The ballroom scene is responsible for a lot of the Back, queer, drag slang terms we know and love today! “Clock” has a specific (and sometimes problematic) meaning in the trans community. Historically, getting “clocked” meant being recognized or outed as transgender, or not “passing” as your preferred gender. [4] X Research source Later, “clocking” expanded to include more than just gender presentation (but drag queens still love to use it to jokingly make fun of each others’ looks). Similarly, “tea” originated with Black drag queens, many of whom were trans. Originally spelled “T,” it referred to your genuine, inner truth about who you are (things like being gay or trans or your core beliefs). [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Drag slang like “clock that tea” went mainstream on social media and TV. Unlike in the past, when hip-hop music was the main gateway into Black culture and slang, many Gen Zers and Millennials have picked up on drag and ballroom slang from viral TikTok videos and online influencers. Not all of these influencers identify as Black or LGBTQ+ themselves, raising questions about cultural appropriation (what used to be considered “informal” or “wrong” language when spoken by African-Americans or queer people is now “trendy” when said by white creators online). [6] X Research source Mega-hit queer TV shows like RuPaul’s Drag Race have also launched ballroom lingo into the public vocabulary. For example, trans Drag Race contestant Monica Beverly Hillz performed an original song called “ Not a Soul Can Clock ” on All Stars 8 celebrating her passing feminine looks."
