For best results, choose a mild, unscented soap meant for use on the body (in other words, do not choose hand soap).

The key thing to remember with an uncircumcised penis is to wash under the foreskin. [2] X Research source Gently pull the foreskin back as far as it will go. Do not force the foreskin past its natural point, as this may damage the penis and cause scar tissue to develop. [3] X Research source Apply soap under the foreskin, and thoroughly rinse away all the soap and any debris that may have collected.

      "content": "Keep it clean. Personal hygiene is important, but doctors warn against over-washing the penis. Washing too frequently, especially with soap or shower gel, can cause soreness and irritation. You should also thoroughly dry the penis after showering. If you use talc or body powder on your testicles, resist the urge to powder the penis. If talc gets under the foreskin, it can cause irritation and discomfort.

There may be a link between talcum powder and ovarian cancer [7] X Trustworthy Source American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support Go to source â€” so if you have vaginal sex with a partner who has ovaries and have talc powder on your penis, you may be putting them at risk."

With proper care and hygiene, having an uncircumcised penis does not present any significant health problems; however, failure to clean under the foreskin can cause a buildup of oils and debris, called \"smegma.\" [8] X Research source Other common foreskin problems include: inflammation, usually caused by forced retraction and irritants like harsh or perfumed soap [9] X Research source infection, such as posthitis and balanitis, typically caused by poor hygiene and unwashed smegma build-up [10] X Research source"

[12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In the absence of the foreskin, all you have to do is lather the penis and thoroughly rinse away the soap under the shower or in the bathtub. Be sure to thoroughly dry the penis after showering or bathing. Without foreskin, it's technically safe to apply talc or body powder, but you should still exercise caution to avoid getting talc in the urethra or causing skin irritations. [13] X Research source"
