Give them an address to send their payment, as well as your contact information in case they have to contact you. [1] X Research source Include what forms of payment you will accept. If you will accept credit cards, tell them. The more payment options you offer, the more likely it is the debtor will be able to pay. Request that all communication be handled in writing.

      "content": "Ask for your money all at once. If you request all of your money up front as a lump sum payment, consider giving the debtor a discount, which might include an interest waiver.

      "title": "Consider drafting a payment plan.",
      "content": "Consider drafting a payment plan. If the debtor cannot satisfy the debt all at once, put together an agreeable payment plan. Try to agree to a plan that is feasible for the debtor.

If you and the debtor agree to a payment plan, fill out a Stipulation for Time Payments and file it with the court once you and the debtor have signed it. [3] X Research source This form makes the court aware of the payment plan, which will be helpful if the debtor fails to make their payments. If you and the debtor cannot agree on a payment plan, a lot of states will allow you and the debtor to file requests to make payments, which are documents asking a judge to incorporate a certain payment plan. [4] X Research source Each party will get to file their own request, and the judge will decide on an acceptable payment plan after analyzing both requests."

[8] X Research source This form requires the debtor to reveal the location and identification of all of their assets. [9] X Research source If the debtor failed to fill out and return a Statement of Assets, you can get the court to order the debtor to return to court in order to reveal the location and identification of their assets.
