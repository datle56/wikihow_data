A child support enforcement agency can help you get an initial child support order. To find your office, search “child support enforcement” and “your state.” If you currently receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Medicaid, then you should already be enrolled.

You might need to attend the hearing. For example, you may need to attend in order to testify. However, the child support enforcement agency should do most of the work at the hearing. You should talk with the child support enforcement agency to ask how you can prepare for the hearing and what your role will be."

In some states, such as California, it may temporarily be suspended for 90 days unless the parent can pay. Generally, however, only a judge can change the child support order. An incarcerated parent who wants to reduce or suspend child support payments can usually file a motion with the court asking that their child support be modified. The jailed parent might complete a form and send it to your state’s child support enforcement agency. The agency will review the information and decide whether to agree to the modification or to oppose it. If the parent files a motion to have their support payments modified, you should receive a copy."

Typically, the other parent will claim they are not able to pay child support because they are in jail and therefore unable to work. The parent will also ask the court to reduce the payments or temporarily suspend them. You should honestly assess whether you think the parent can continue to make child support payments even while in jail. Talk this over with your case worker.

In this situation, the agency will file documents in court and attend a hearing. However, the agency might decide not to oppose the incarcerated parent’s motion. (Remember, the agency represents the state, not you.) If you disagree with the child support enforcement agency’s decision, then you should seek out an attorney to consult. Only a qualified lawyer will be able to advise you whether you are likely to succeed in opposing the parent’s motion to modify. Make sure to show the lawyer proof that the jailed parent has assets that could be used to pay the child support. You can get a referral for a lawyer by contacting your state or local bar association. Call the lawyer and schedule a consultation."

In some courts, the clerk will fill out the order. Be sure to get a copy and read it closely. It will tell you what changes (if any) have been made to the parent’s child support payments.

In some states, the parent won’t have to make payment if incarcerated; however, support obligations will start up again when the parent is released from jail.

The payments should be made to your state agency, which will disburse them to you. Unfortunately, you can’t get water from a stone. If the other parent doesn’t pay while in prison, there is little the court can do. The typical punishment for contempt is imprisonment, but the other parent is already in prison. For this reason, contempt might not jog the other parent to pay while they are in jail. However, child support obligations will continue to accumulate, and interest on the payments will also accrue as the parent serves out his or her jail sentence. When the parent is released, you can garnish his or her wages and intercept tax returns to get your owed child support."
