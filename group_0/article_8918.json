      "content": "Write a draft of your essay. A title is the first thing your reader will see, but it is often the last thing a writer creates.

      "content": "Determine your target audience. Write down a few groups of people who would be interested in your topic, and why they would be drawn to it. [3] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source If you are writing a school assignment, or your audience are academics and specialists in your topic, use formal language. Avoid using a playful tone or slang terms. If you are trying to reach an online audience, think of what keywords a reader might use to find your article. For example, if you wrote a how-to article, include words like \"beginner\" or \"do it yourself\" that would identify your writing as appropriate for all levels of ability. If your piece is a news story, consider who you are writing about. For example, if are writing about an athletic team write down terms like \"fan,\" \"coach,\" \"referee,\" or the team name. Readers with an interest in sports or that team can quickly identify your perspective and the topic of your story."

      "content": "Think about the function of a title. Titles predict the content in the essay, reflect the tone or slant, include keywords, and catch interest.

      "content": "Seek ideas from your own writing. Reread your work to find sentences or phrases in which you refer to your main ideas. Often the introductory or concluding paragraphs of your work will have a phrase that would work well as a title. Highlight or make a note of any words or phrases that explain your ideas. Look for attention-grabbing descriptions or phrases you're proud of. For example, in an essay on censorship choose a phrase like \"forbidden music\" that is descriptive but also intriguing."

      "content": "Review your sources. Search quotations from sources you've used to support your points for something that grabs a reader's attention.

      "content": "Respect conventions. Different disciplines, such as the sciences, the humanities, or the arts, may have different rules about what a title should look like. If you are aware of a specific expectation, you should conform to those guidelines. There are some general rules to remember: [8] X Research source Most words in your title should begin with a capital letter. The first word and the first word after a colon should always be capitalized even if one of the \"short words.\" In general, do not capitalize the following words: and, a, an, the, or short prepositions if they are not the first letter in the title. If the title of a book or film is part of your essay title, it should be put in italics, e.g., Gender Relationships Between Vampires in Twilight. Short story titles are always in quotation marks. Know if the paper follows MLA, APA, or another style. Websites like Purdue University's Online Writing Lab , APA Style , and MLA Handbook can help you with conventions for titles."

      "content": "Make the title exciting. Dull or generic titles won't catch the reader's eye. Titles such as \"The Tree\" or \"The Train\" might name the subject or a symbol in the story, but it doesn't excite the reader. Try adding a more descriptive word to the basic title.

      "content": "Make the title easy to remember. Titles are not only supposed to catch the reader's attention, but also spread the word about your work.

You want to come up with an exciting, yet catchy and easy to remember, title. Read your title out loud. Does it roll off the tongue? Is it exciting? Does it sound boring? Would you check out this title? The answers to these questions can help you revise the title."

      "title": "Use strong, vivid language.",
      "content": "Use strong, vivid language. A title needs to stand out. Strong action words, vivid adjectives, or intriguing nouns can all make your title compelling. Look at the words in your potential title. Are there synonyms that are more descriptive or unique? Can you choose a word that has a less general meaning? Some words are so common their meaning doesn't impact readers the same way. For example, the use of the word desire in Eugene O'Neill's Desire Under the Elms is far more interesting than Love Under the Elms . [10] X Research source"
