      "content": "Fill a bucket with lukewarm water if you don't have a detachable shower nozzle. You will need to use a large bucket with a smaller plastic cup or jug to rinse your dog, as this will allow you to direct the water onto the dog's coat. Avoid using just a regular shower head to bathe your dog with, as you won't be able to direct the flow of water and they could get shampoo in their eyes. [8] X Research source If your dog has a particularly long coat or if you have a large dog, fill up 2-3 buckets of water before you begin so that you don't run out."
