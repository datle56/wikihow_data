      "content": "Cut back on calories. The most important part of losing weight is not working out until you collapse — it's your diet. If you burn 500 to 750 more calories than what you eat every day, you will lose 1–2 pounds every week (any more than that is considered unsafe weight loss). There are tons of little changes you can make to cut calories from your diet, from replacing high-calorie dressings with vinaigrette and asking for all dressings/sauces served on the side, eating at the table instead of in front of the tv, skipping cheese and other fatty additions to your salads and meals, using smaller plates, leave off the whipped cream on your coffee drink, and on and on. [2] X Research source Try tracking your daily food intake and portion sizes in a food diary to better understand your eating habits and how they affect your body. Reader Poll: We asked 240 wikiHow readers and 50% said that they don’t track their food intake . [Take Poll] But studies show that this is an effective way to lose weight, so if you haven't tried yet, that's a great, expert-backed tip to support your fitness journey!"

For instance, instead of saying, \"I want to be stronger,\" your goal is something like, \"I want to be able to bench press 100 pounds, three times in a row, three months from now.\" Or, \"I want to lose 10 pounds in the next 4 months.\" Once you have set your goals, you can make a plan to achieve them. What do you need to do to achieve your goal? As you approach your goal, start thinking about your next SMART goal to set and achieve."

In one study, researchers looked at two groups, one running for 30 to 60 minutes three times per week, the other doing four to six 30-second treadmill sprints, resting for four to six minutes between each sprint. After six weeks, it was found that the group doing HIIT training lost more weight.
