      "content": "Rule out problematic products. Don’t assume you have naturally oily skin just because it appears shinier than you would like. You might just be using the wrong product. [1] X Research source It’s possible that the moisturizer you are using is too heavy. When you use a product that is too rich for your skin, your pores can’t absorb it. As a result, the product sits on your skin, potentially clogging your pores. Conversely, you might actually be using a product that is too harsh and drying. Your skin compensates for these products by producing more oil. Stick to gentle cleansers and light, oil-free moisturizers for a few weeks to see how your skin reacts."

      "title": "Observe where and when your skin is oily.",
      "content": "Observe where and when your skin is oily. All people have natural oils in their skin, but this does not mean that everyone should use products developed for oily skin. Once you have ruled out products as the culprit, consider the following when determining where you stand: [2] X Research source If your skin is oily throughout the day and you have large pores all over your face, you probably have oily skin. If oily skin and large pores exist only in your T-zone (the forehead, nose, and chin), you probably have combination skin. If you only see oily skin in your T-zone when the weather is warm, you probably have normal skin. If your skin is oily but your pores are small, it’s a good sign that your products, and not your skin type, might be to blame."

      "content": "Do a tissue test. Wash your face with a gentle cleanser, and don’t put anything on top of it. In an hour or two, blot with a tissue. If you see greasy splotches, your skin is probably oily. If not, you probably have combination skin. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine a course of action. If you determine that your skin is not really oily, look for a moisturizer for normal skin. On the other hand, if you have truly oily skin, look to Part 2 for help choosing the right product."

      "title": "Read the label.",
      "content": "Read the label. Moisturizers designed for oily skin will often include key words like water-based, non-comedogenic (won’t clog pores), non-acnegenic (won’t cause acne) and/or oil-free. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Oil-free products are more complicated than you think, however, as they may contain other ingredients that can clog your pores (like waxes) or irritate your skin (like alcohol).

    {
      "title": "Examine the ingredients.",
      "content": "Examine the ingredients. People with oily skin should be on the lookout for the ingredients that can both help and harm their skin. Water-based products should have a word than ends in “-icone” (like silicone) as one of the first few ingredients. [6] X Research source Dimethicone is often used as a replacement for petrolatum, which is oil-derived. Dimethicone is both moisturizing and mattifying, which means that it can help control grease and shine. [7] X Research source Look for exfoliating ingredients. Oily skin can often be dull and thick, so choose products with ingredients that will aid in cell turnover. These include lactic, glycolic, and salicylic acid. [8] X Research source Avoid products that include paraffin, cocoa butter, or oils."

      "title": "Think about texture.",
      "content": "Think about texture. Moisturizers come in many different forms. From lightest to heaviest, these include gels, lotions, and creams. Keep in mind their different properties when choosing. [9] X Research source People with oily skin should avoid creams and heavy lotions. Instead, choose gels or light lotions."

      "title": "Consider the other products you use.",
      "content": "Consider the other products you use. Oily skin can also be acne-prone, which means that you might be using harsh and drying anti-acne products. Don’t irritate your skin further by layering anti-acne moisturizer on top of these products. Instead, look for moisturizer for sensitive skin. If you’re not using other anti-acne products, moisturizers that also fight breakouts might be a good bet for you."

    {
      "title": "Look for SPF.",
      "content": "Look for SPF. Experts recommend that you look for a moisturizer that also protects your skin from the sun. Many people with oily skin worry that sunscreen will exacerbate greasiness and shine, so again look for products that claim not to clog pores or cause acne. You might also want to consider using sunscreen as moisturizer. Sunscreen hydrates your skin, so you might want to skip a second layer, especially if your skin is oily. (If you wear both, put on sunscreen first.) [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Shop around. You want a moisturizer that leaves your skin hydrated but not greasy, fresh but not tight. It might take you a little while before you find a product that matches your particular skin. Since you might have to try a few different products before you find the right one, don’t think that you have to buy the most expensive brand. Cheaper options can often work just as well.

This is especially important for people whose skin is also sensitive. Unless you have an immediate reaction, try to wait two weeks before deciding if the product is right for you.

[13] X Research source As long as your skin is not acne-prone, even those with oily skin may want to consider using an ointment in winter. Similarly, those with normal and combination skin may want to switch to a lighter lotion or gel during the summer months, when their skin may be oily."
