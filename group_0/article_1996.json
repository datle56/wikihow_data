Yet, Buddha considers desires(i.e. especially unfulfilled desires) and cravings as suffering as well. These two things are considered the roots of suffering because humans are rarely ever satisfied or content. Once one desire is met, another desire is created. This is a vicious cycle. Dukkha means \"that which is difficult to bear.\" Suffering is a large spectrum and includes things that are great and small."
