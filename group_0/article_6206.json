If you want to get to the bottom of your partner’s behavior, Allen Wagner, MFT, MA agrees that confronting them directly and asking for full transparency is the best option. When you have a quiet moment, sit down with your partner and tell them how you’re feeling. Example: “Hey, I noticed that you’ve been a lot more private with your phone lately and it’s making me feel a little unsure of the relationship. Is there something we need to talk about?” Example: “I noticed that you’ve been texting another guy a lot lately, and I feel a little uneasy about it. Can you tell me more about who they are?” According to Tara Vossenkemper, PhD, LPC, if a partner isn’t guilty of cheating, they will usually act concerned or worried about the accusation. If they start acting defensive, then it may be a sign they’re guilty."
