      "content": "Attend a wrestling school. If you want to become a professional wrestler, you have to learn how to wrestle properly. Do an online search to find wrestling schools in your area. Look for schools that are run by former professional wrestlers. Additionally, these schools should have former students that have gotten into the WWE or the TNA. [1] X Research source Ask questions such as: “How much does it cost to attend your school?” “Have any of your graduates ever joined the WWE or the TNA?” “Does the instructor have professional wrestling experience?” If possible, find a school that hosts matches for the trainees. This will give you valuable performing experience."

      "content": "Eat a protein-rich diet. If you want to be a professional wrestler, you have to be strong. Build and maintain your muscle mass by eating a lot of protein. Eat one gram of protein daily for every pound of body mass that you have. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, you should eat at least 160 grams of protein every day. [2] X Research source Greek yogurt (23 grams of protein per serving), whey protein powder (24 grams of protein per scoop), ground beef (18 grams of protein per serving), and chicken breasts (24 grams per serving) are all high in protein. For example, if you ate two chicken breasts, a cup of broccoli, and drank a protein shake for lunch, you would have eaten 74.6 grams of protein."

      "content": "Add cardio to your workout . Many people who want to build muscles skip cardio training because they think it’s unnecessary.

Cardio exercises include: Running on a treadmill Going for a jog Using an exercise bike"

    {
      "title": "Decide on a persona.",
      "content": "Decide on a persona. Professional wrestlers often use a persona while competing. First, choose whether you’ll be a “good guy” or a “bad guy.” Next, create a heavily exaggerated personality for your character. For example, if you’re a bad guy, you could be a loud, angry clown with an unreasonable love for flamingos. Give your character a crazy backstory to help you craft a memorable persona. Alternatively, create your persona by exaggerating aspects of your existing personality. For example, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson plays a more intense version of himself on stage."

    {
      "title": "Choose a name.",
      "content": "Choose a name. Your character’s name should reflect their personality. Think of what kinds of names would be meaningful to your character. For example, the angry, flamingo-loving clown might be called “Pinkie.” Other great names include: “The Ogre” for a large, unpleasant-looking bad guy “Sir Lancelot” for a charming, medieval-themed good guy “Earthquake” for a large, powerful man of few words."

    {
      "title": "Create a signature pose or gesture.",
      "content": "Create a signature pose or gesture. Many famous wrestlers have signature movements that set them apart from their peers. Stand out from the crowd by inventing character-specific poses that you can strike throughout a wrestling match. For example: “The Ogre” might shout insults at the crowd every time he hurts the “good guy” “Sir Lancelot” may throw roses out into the crowd as he enters the ring “Earthquake” might stomp his feet and yell before each match"

    {
      "title": "Choose an outfit.",
      "content": "Choose an outfit. Contact a wrestling outfit manufacturer when you’re ready to choose an outfit. Do an online search to find a manufacturer or talk to your instructor for recommendations. These manufacturers will be able to help you design a good outfit based off of your name and your persona. However, be prepared to wait a few weeks for your costume to be finished. These costumes are often expensive. However, if you use a ready-made costume, your look won’t be unique or memorable."

      "title": "Move to Orlando, Florida.",
      "content": "Move to Orlando, Florida. Many professional wrestlers and coaches advise serious wrestlers to move to the U.S. state of Florida. Orlando, FL is the home of the WWE Performance Center and has a huge wrestling circuit. If you’re lucky, you may meet a great booking agent or get to wrestle against a developing WWE wrestler.

      "content": "Find a manager or agent. A manager, also known as a booking agent, will help you find wrestling matches and work to further your career. Do an online search to find reputable agencies in your area. Alternatively, talk to your wrestling instructor or an experienced wrestler for help finding a good manager. It may be hard to get a good manager early on in your career. If so, continue finding matches on your own to build a name for yourself. Avoid people who want to take advantage of you. For example, don’t give a stranger money to book you."
