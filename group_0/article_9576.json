If you and your partner can effectively bond, you will find that it is easier to work together to solve problems. It will lessen your need to control him. [1] X Expert Source Maya Diamond, MA Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 17 January 2019. Choose your timing. If you want to have an important conversation, choose a time that is good for both of you. Don't try to have a deep conversation right as he is walking in the door from work, for example, or if you know you have to leave for the gym in five minutes. Watch your body language. During important talks, try sitting side by side with your man. This makes you both feel equal, and is more effective than if one of you is standing over the other. You should also try to maintain eye contact, as that conveys trust and respect."

But as a relationship progresses, it can become easy to fall into a rut. Perhaps you're spending all of your time together watching tv rather than actually enjoying each other's company. Make sure to get some quality time together each week. [2] X Expert Source Maya Diamond, MA Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 17 January 2019. Having alone time with your man is very important for your relationship. It helps you connect to each other as adults.

This will help you relax and feel more comfortable with one another. If your man enjoys your company, you will need to worry about controlling him."

The best way to get to know each other better is to ask questions. These questions can be as simple as saying, \"How was your day?\" The important part is that you both give detailed honest answers, and that you both actively listen to the other. You could also try asking more creative questions, such as \"If you could be any character in a book ,who would you be?\" These types of conversations will allow you to learn more about each other. The more you know, the more you will trust each other. You will be able to communicate instead of controlling."

Could we schedule a time for us to go to a movie together?\" By explaining what you need, you are more likely to get it."

For example, if it is important to you that you two never go to bed angry, make that one of your relationship rules. [5] X Research source If you feel like you need to control your man's actions, try setting some guidelines in advance. For example, ask that he only spends one or two nights away from home with his buddies. He'll appreciate that you are flexible, and you'll know when you can count on him to be home. You can also set some rules about how to communicate with one another. For example, if you aren't morning people, you can agree never to discuss a serious subject before you've had your coffee."
