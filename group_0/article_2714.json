      "content": "Don’t lie about your interests or pretend to be someone else. Women will be able to tell if you try to be someone you’re not, so just be honest. Being irresistible isn’t about putting on a show; truly irresistible people are authentic. [1] X Research source For example, if you don’t like sports, don’t tell a girl you like that you’re great at football just to impress her. Instead, look for interests that you actually share. There's a better chance that she'll be attracted to you if you truly have things in common. Additionally, authentic people are trustworthy. If people know they can trust you, they’re more likely to gravitate toward you. Be yourself, but don’t feel like you have to lay out all of your baggage when you’re just getting to know someone. Being honest doesn’t mean you need to confess your deepest secrets on the first date."

[Take Poll] So while getting touchy-feely too soon may not be the best strategy, you can still convey open body language with good posture and a warm smile."

If they told you that they love music, ask about their favorite genres or bands instead of changing the subject."

[8] X Expert Source Connell Barrett Dating Coach Expert Interview. 24 September 2019. Be sure to compliment a woman you like on things other than her looks, and never make inappropriate or sexually charged comments. [9] X Research source Offer thoughtful compliments such as, “You made such a sharp point in class today,” “You’re a brilliant singer,” or “You have great taste in music.” Comments about appearance are occasionally welcome, provided they're respectful and balanced with compliments about personality. For instance, telling someone “You're absolutely beautiful” or “That's a really nice dress—I love your style!” can be sweet, but saying “Hey hottie, you're looking good!” isn't very nice."

Irresistible people are magnetic; they attract people, but they don’t beg for attention. [11] X Research source Furthermore, when it comes to dating, coming on too strong can turn off the object of your affection. If you find yourself sending multiple paragraph-long texts and receiving one-word responses, it’s time to give your crush some space. [12] X Research source Bear in mind giving someone space doesn’t mean you need to play hard to get or ignore them completely. You can be honest about your feelings without seeming needy or desperate for attention. For instance, if you want to ask your crush to hang out, say, “I’ve really wanted to try that new coffee place. Want to meet up there later today?” After a first or second date, it’s okay to say (or text) “I had a great time on our date!” However, you probably don’t want to send a 5-page text gushing about how you’re madly in love with her."

It’s okay to vent to a loved one if something bad happens, but avoid laying all of your problems on someone you’re just getting to know.

Taste is subjective, and women, and people in general, are unique individuals. [21] X Research source Remember that attraction isn’t a choice; it just happens. If someone doesn’t find you irresistible, that doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you. That said, if someone expresses a negative opinion of you, it’s okay to think about how you can use that feedback to improve yourself. If, for example, someone says you talk a lot, work on listening and asking questions when you have conversations."
