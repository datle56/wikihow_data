      "content": "Take time to decide what type of woman you want to look like. This greatly influences the other steps. How old are you? What is your body type? What kind of style do you want? Envision the woman you will become. You can be classy, provocative, trendy, or even angelic. What you want to look like will change over time, and outfit choices vary from day to day. [3] X Expert Source Inge Hansen, PsyD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. Remember to dress for the occasion and take your daily life into account. If you will be passing as a woman on a regular basis and work in a professional environment, provocative or flashy clothing will not be appropriate. If you’re going out clubbing, wearing more revealing clothes is fine. If you’re passing as a woman for a party or special event, feel free to go all out. Be over the top in your clothing choices. Use your close female friends' looks for fashion inspiration."

      "content": "Jump in the shower to get started. Showering is the first step in most grooming rituals. Traditionally, women are known for having smooth skin , clean and shiny hair , and a clean body, so take your time. Invest in shampoo and conditioner that smell nice and fresh. Scrub down with a loofah and body wash to exfoliate your skin and leave it clean and smooth."

      "title": "Shave your face",
      "content": "Shave your face if you prefer a smooth look. Use a new razor and take your time. Also, be gentle; you don't want to irritate your skin. Using plenty of shaving cream and razors with three or more blades will keep razor burn to a minimum. If you really want to keep stubble away, you can try waxing, electrolysis, or even permanent laser hair removal, but consult with a professional first. Buy quality razors to shave with since cheap razors can irritate your skin. If you'd like, you can shave your entire body, too. You might go through multiple razor blades, so keep extra on hand. For more sensitive areas like your belly or armpits, avoid using too many strokes. Instead, use a few long, even strokes against the grain of the hair. Use moisturizer after shaving to soothe freshly shaven skin."

      "title": "Pluck your eyebrows",
      "content": "Pluck your eyebrows to soften your face. Women generally have thinner eyebrows than men. Remove stray hairs by plucking them firmly from their roots. For highly stylized brows, you may want to seek a professional, but plucking eyebrows can easily be done at home. The start of your brows should be about one inch above the inner corner of your eye. [4] X Research source Remove the strays in between. The end of your brows should be about one inch above the outer corner of your eye. [5] X Research source Pluck any stray hairs that come after this edge. Pluck hairs from under the brows until a natural arch-shape is achieved. The arch should peak above the outer rim of your eye. [6] X Research source Remove stray hairs along the bottom of your eyebrow’s arch. Do this part the slowest, and be sure your brows are parallel in thickness. It is natural for the skin on your face to become red and sometimes swollen after plucking. This will quickly fade."

      "content": "Clean, trim, and manicure your nails. Though getting clean nails generally happens in the shower but could require you to use a nail cleaner to remove dirt and grime. Use a nail board to file down uneven edges of your nails. Paint your nails if you desire. Clear polish is always classy, but there is a world of options. If you’re trying to be sassy, pick out a bright red or neon color; if you want a more subtle color, stick with nude shades like beige or silver. Get a manicure if you have a large amount of hangnails, stubborn grime, or unsightly callouses. A professional manicurist can cut, buff, and paint your nails for you."

      "content": "Style your hair. A simple head of clean hair is all you really need to pass as a woman, but curly, coarse, and long hair require more work. In general, make sure your hair is brushed thoroughly and use styling products if it is overly frizzy or unruly. Going to a salon can be helpful. A good stylist can tell you not only what's in style but what will look good on you. They can also recommend products for your hair type. Have an idea of what you want, but be open to input as well. Keep your hairstyles simple unless you’re experienced in working with hair. There are hundreds of articles and YouTube tutorials about easy hairstyles. Practice different styles well in advanced of any event. There is nothing more stressful than trying a new hairdo on a deadline! If you’ll be passing as a woman for an extended period of time, grow your hair to the length you desire. Buying a wig is also a good idea. Wigs come in a variety of cuts, colors, textures, and lengths, so you can find a wig that fits your style. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply your foundation to even out your skin tone. Foundation helps to cover up any blemishes and will mask a five-o-clock shadow (if that's what you want to do). Find a cover-up and/or liquid foundation that closely matches your skin tone, plus a matching powder to \"set\" the make-up, making it look naturally feminine. Visit beauty stores that provide help from makeup professionals to point you in the right direction. This is very important if you’ve never used foundation before. They will let you know what brand works best with your skin and budget. If you’re shopping online, read the reviews before purchasing foundation. Look into which offer full coverage. Use a moisturizer and primer before applying the foundation. The rest of your makeup will go on much easier and look better. Use your fingers or an applicator to blend the foundation so there's no clear line between makeup and skin."

      "content": "Experiment with makeup looks if you want to. Decide if you want a full or natural look , but either way, don't overdo it. You don't want to appear clownish. Lipstick, blush, eye-shadow, eyeliner, and mascara are all options for you to use. If you want a more natural look, a bit of mascara and some eyeliner should suffice. For a fuller look, apply eyeliner, eyeshadow, blush, and lipstick, too. The temptation to overdo makeup is common for most beginners. Remember to tailor your makeup to the occasion. Keep it classy, and you'll pass. Applying makeup is already difficult for women; be patient and ask friends for help. You’ll get the hang of it. Find YouTube tutorials for complicated looks like a smokey eyes or cat eyeliner."

      "content": "Pick an outfit that makes you feel good about yourself. Dressing like a woman involves planning your look from head to toe, beginning with your top or dress. The color choice will vary depending on your personal style. If you’re going for a business look, choose more neutral colors, but if you’re going for a night out clubbing, go for bright colors and patterns. Also, choosing a top or dress that flatters your figure is important. Choose a top or dress that best suits your frame. Plunging necklines draw attention from broad shoulders, so these are often good choices for passing as a woman. Knowing your body and working with it is essential to passing. If you are more full-figured and have a larger midsection, don’t get a shirt that shows your belly. [8] X Research source Fabrics that stretch like polyester can be very comfortable. If your arms are very bulky, consider using a shawl to cover them when wearing sleeveless outfits. Corsets, gaffs, breast forms, and other specialized bodyshapers are also available."

      "content": "Choose flattering bottoms. Thinner individuals will have an easier time finding flattering jeans, for example, and a full skirt will accentuate curves nicely. Multiple trips to several stores may be necessary for you to find the right bottoms. Be wary of purchasing pants or skirts online, as sizing can be difficult to predict. Start with a skirt with empire waist, which is a great choice to begin with. These look good on narrow hips and flatter bottoms. Go shopping with a female friend to get a second opinion. Consider learning to tuck and tape if that makes you feel more feminine and empowered."

      "content": "Pick out cute accessories. There are tons of pretty accessories on the market today, including rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and hair decorations. Try to tailor accessories to the outfit you’re wearing. Matching is a good idea. For example, if you’re wearing a green skirt and a white top, put a white flower in your hair or wear a green bracelet. Don’t wear too many accessories. Wearing three accessories at a time is more than enough. Jewelry can get expensive, but stores often have more affordable items alongside the more pricey ones."

      "content": "Select shoes . Your shoes should be comfortable but still stylish. Women don't always wear heels, so you don't have to punish your feet. Flats may look better for because men are normally taller than women, so wearing heels could make you tower over others. Once again, think about the occasion. If you’re going to be walking a lot or on your feet all day, heels will not be comfortable. Heels make your leg muscles tense, so they can make them seem more bulky. This is especially true if your legs are already very toned. Ballet flats are affordable and come in an array of colors and patterns. If you do get heels , wearing them around the house can help you become used to walking in them."

Decide if there is any part of your outfit that looks unfashionable or unflattering. If there is, change! Give yourself about an extra half hour to get ready just in case you need to do any last minute changes."

      "content": "Get in touch with your feminine side . Watching movies and reading books centered on strong female characters will help you understand these traits even better. Remember that overall, women are known for being gentle and caring. One of the easiest ways to understand feminine traits is to spend time around ladies. Drum up your female friends and set up a book club, wine night, or other weekly time to hang out. Empathize with others and be sensitive to those around you. Try to be accepting and assertive in a gentle way."

It is well-known that women often gesture while speaking, which adds femininity and personality to any conversation. [9] X Research source Note the gestures and facial expressions of the women around you and try to imitate how they move. Try to make smaller, more graceful movements as opposed to big steps and heavy gestures. This will help you move with ease. Standing up straight will also give you poise and will make your body appear more feminine."

      "content": "Practice speaking in a higher voice if you'd like to. Women's voices tend not only to be higher pitched, but also more melodic. Women tend to take on the vocal patterns of those they spend a lot of time with, so find a female friend to emulate. Be active! The best practice is talking to real people in public situations. This will help your progress, so don’t be shy or embarrassed. There are also tapes, articles, and the guides available on the web. Spend a few hours on the internet researching practice methods. If you're not satisfied with your progress, consider seeking out a professional speech therapist."
