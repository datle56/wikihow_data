      "title": "Research and compare laptop costs.",
      "content": "Research and compare laptop costs. Do research into the type of laptop you need or want. Ask yourself questions such as: What will I mostly be using this for? What programs will I use? How much storage space do I need? It may help to research if lots of people in your peer group have laptops. Parents often make decisions based on what's happening in your social group."

      "title": "With these needs in mind, compare prices on laptops with the features you want.",
      "content": "With these needs in mind, compare prices on laptops with the features you want. Try looking at the refurbished or used laptops that brands and retailers sell for very reduced prices. [1] X Research source Create your own comparison chart of prices and features of several possible laptops, or find and print one from online to show your parents that you've given this a lot of thought and research.

      "title": "Come up with an offer or bargain.",
      "content": "Come up with an offer or bargain. Consider what you can do in exchange for your parents buying you a laptop. Promise good grades on your next report card, a certain amount of chores per week or month, or another goal you know your parents would like to see you achieve. Try coming up with a specific goal that you can stick with and achieve. When you talk to your parents, you can say, “I'll get a better grade in English next semester,” or something that you know could use improvement and that you think you can achieve.

    {
      "title": "Come up with practical reasons for a laptop.",
      "content": "Come up with practical reasons for a laptop. Think of all the ways that a laptop would make your life easier or more successful. When the time comes to talk to your parents, point out to them your practical reasons to have one, as well as the benefits of a laptop over a desktop, like portability, convenience, and that it doesn't take up space. For school, think of how you could use a laptop to take notes (if allowed), to bring to study groups or tutoring, or to access online libraries and other reference resources. If you're off to college in the near future, you can point out to your parents that you will need a laptop for notes, research, and to make video calls home! [4] X Research source Some students actually do better in school with laptops if they have a very slow handwriting speed or other difficulty taking notes. If you struggle with this, use this in the argument you bring to your parents. [5] X Research source Sharing a good reason for wanting something might convince your parents to give it to you."

      "title": "Plan to use the laptop for hobbies and skills.",
      "content": "Plan to use the laptop for hobbies and skills. Think of an argument for how you can use a laptop to cultivate useful talents and beneficial hobbies. Want to get into graphic design? Computer coding? Writing? You need a laptop to learn and practice these skills that could later become jobs. Show your parents that there are lots of educational resources for free online that you would be able access on a laptop and have more time and freedom to use than on a school or family computer.

    {
      "title": "Show moderation in your computer usage.",
      "content": "Show moderation in your computer usage. Display to your parents that you don't use your current family or personal computer too often, so you won't be on your own laptop all the time. Commit to cutting down on your screen time, if necessary, in advance of talking to your parents, so that you can point out to them your good habits when you sit down to talk. Try getting on the computer for only a half an hour at a time, or only when all your homework is done at the end of the day."

      "title": "Put your offer in writing.",
      "content": "Put your offer in writing. Compile all your research, reasoning, and offers for a laptop and write them down neatly or type them up into a document to print out for your parents. Show them you are responsible, have given this a lot of thought, and are willing to stick to your goals to own your own laptop. You can even create your own “contract” or agreement for whatever you offer in exchange for a laptop, so you can track your progress and let your parents hold you to your goals.

      "title": "Ask nicely and show gratitude.",
      "content": "Ask nicely and show gratitude. Talk to your parents in a calm, patient, and respectful manner when you bring up the subject of wanting a laptop. Make sure to explain why you want one, what you're willing to do to get it, and how much you would appreciate their help in buying it. Try asking like this: “Hey Mom and Dad, I'd really like to get a laptop of my own. I know I don't have enough to pay for all of it right now, and I was hoping you could help me out and give me your permission to get one. I really appreciate the things you've bought or helped me buy in the past, and I think this will be something that's useful to me and worth the money.\""

      "title": "Show them your written argument or contract.",
      "content": "Show them your written argument or contract. Offer your parents the research and reasoning you've written out. Give them time to look it over and discuss any questions or comments they have about it. If you've created a contract or agreement, you can have them make edits or additions and tell them you can all sign it when you're in agreement, to make it official."

    {
      "title": "Talk through their concerns.",
      "content": "Talk through their concerns. Listen carefully to the reasons they might have for hesitating or being unwilling to buy you a laptop. Avoid reacting with anger, whining, or impatience, because they will be even less likely to agree or even talk about it with you. If their concern is the cost, talk to them about paying for part of it or paying them back over time. If they think you're not old enough to have your own laptop, mention a friend your age who has one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Discuss the cost and consider a payment plan.",
      "content": "Discuss the cost and consider a payment plan. Show that you understand that a laptop is an expensive investment, and you're willing to pay for part of it, if you have the money, or pay them back for all or part of it over time. Use money from an allowance or job, or discuss other ways that you could earn money and pay your parents back if possible. Try offering to match funds with your parents if you have some money saved. You can say, “I only have [x amount of money]. If I contributed that, would you be willing to pay the rest?” [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Agree on limits.",
      "content": "Agree on limits. Discuss with your parents any limits they may want to put in place if you do have your own laptop, like where you can use it, how long you can be on it, and what you can do on it. Consider giving in to them setting parental controls on the laptop or other measures they feel they need to take. You might agree to only use the laptop in your living room while at home, only use it for schoolwork and internet instead of games, or another similar compromise. Also discuss any consequences there would or should be for losing or damaging a laptop. You could offer to pay for a durable case or cover to ensure it doesn't get broken, or even chip in on insurance for it if your parents want to help you look into that option."

      "title": "Be willing to wait.",
      "content": "Be willing to wait. After laying out your whole argument and discussing options with your parents, give them time to consider it. Wait patiently for them if they need more time to think it over or do their own research on the best laptops and prices. You can even say to them, “I just wanted to tell you all this now, but I don't need a yes or no right away. Come back to me once you've had time to think it over.” [9] X Research source If your parents do say no, accept their answer and don't fight it. Show your maturity and let the subject drop for now. You can bring it up with them in a few weeks or months with a new angle or argument, or agree with them on a time that they might be more willing to consider your offer."
