      "content": "The video is a viral TikTok of a salsa instructor performing a dance move. The original video is from 2022, but it only recently found internet fame on TikTok. The video features Russian dancer Ruslan Aydaev (Руслан Айдаев) demonstrating a samba move for a class. It’s interesting, notable, and viral because Aydaev’s moves are smooth, hypnotic, and fun to watch—and to try out for yourself. [1] X Research source In the video, Aydaev is showing his class the “Samba Whisk,” a dance move where the dancer steps side to side while gyrating their hips. The video snippet was uploaded to TikTok in February 2025, and since then the dance itself has become viral, with users posting their own renditions and parodies , as well as remixing the video to different music or with different backgrounds."

      "content": "The Assumption dance is the TikTok name for the Samba Whisk. When you’re watching the blue shirt guy whisk his hips, you probably see people referring to the dance as the “Assumption.” They’re not wrong, but also not 100% correct. The blue shirt guy is indeed dancing the Whisk, but the song in the video is “Assumptions” by Sam Gellaitry , so people started calling it the “Assumption” dance. Notably, the blue shirt guy isn’t dancing to “Assumptions” in the original. In the original, he’s dancing to a more traditional Samba beat (likely Gael Stone’s “Left and Right” ), and somebody edited the video’s speed and added “Assumptions” later."

      "content": "Step to your right, then step your left foot behind you. Let’s start just by learning the footwork, and the hip whisks will come after. To begin, take a step to your right with your right foot, then lightly touch your left foot to the floor just behind your right foot. [2] X Research source When you put your left foot down, take the weight off your right foot, and lift your right foot slightly off the floor to introduce a small bouncing motion. When you bring your left foot behind you, pretend like you’re dragging your toes across the floor for a smoother motion."

      "content": "Step to your left, then step your right foot behind you. Now, do the same step, but to your left. Once you’ve placed your left foot down, gently touch the floor with your right foot, just behind your left foot. Lift your left foot a little off the ground, with your weight on your right foot. This is the basic back-and-forth motion of the Samba Whisk! [3] X Research source As you step, stay elevated on the balls of your feet—the broad, flat parts just before your toes. This helps you stay nimble, and also emphasizes your hips and butt, which is important in a Samba. As you step side-to-side, count, “1 and 2,” with your foot stepping to the side on “1,” and your back foot lifting you slightly on “2.”"

      "content": "When you step to the side, bend that knee slightly, then straighten. Now we add a little knee action to give the dance that signature bounce. When you step to the side, bend the knee of the leg you’re stepping with. Then, straighten that knee as you step the other foot behind you. [4] X Research source For example, when you step to the right, keep your right leg bent. Once the step is finished, straighten your right leg as you step onto your left. Keep the leg that follows straight until you step that foot behind you, so it looks like you’re dragging it behind you."

      "content": "Start rotating the leading side of your hips forward each step. Now we inject the hips into the dance! Keep stepping back and forth. Now, though, when you make a large step to the side, rotate the “leading” hip forward as you step. For example, when you step with your right leg to the right, rotate your right hip forward. [5] X Research source This makes it look like all the action is coming from your hips, and like you’re using your hips to “drag” your following leg into position. Eventually, it won’t just look like it—that’s what will be happening!"

      "title": "Whip your hips in the other direction when your foot is behind you.",
      "content": "Whip your hips in the other direction when your foot is behind you. When you finish the step to the side, your hip will be rotated forward and jutting out to that side. Now, when you step with your other foot behind you, give your hips a little flourish . As you shift your weight to your back foot, rotate the hip on that side backward. [6] X Research source For example, after you step to the right and rotate your right hip forward, step behind you with your left foot and swivel your left hip backward, so now your hip is jutting out and back on the other side. Give your hip a little upwards pop at the end of this back swivel to really emphasize the motion and add some pizzazz."

      "content": "Keep your elbows up and point your hands in the direction you step. All that’s left is the arms! Your arms add some flair to your upper body while your lower body does the work. Keep your elbows up and to the side as you dance to help you balance. To add more pizzazz, extend your corresponding arm in the direction you’re stepping, moving it smoothly. [7] X Research source For example, when you step to the right, extend your right arm in that direction. Then, when you start to step to the left, extend your left arm while retracting your right hand back near your chest. When you move your arms, move them in a circular, windmill motion, rather than just side to side."

That’s why the original Samba Whisk blue shirt guy video shows him teaching a class: it’s not your average TikTok dance, but with a little practice, you’ll get it down in no time!"

      "content": "The Samba Whisk is a fairly advanced Samba dance move. Professional dance instructor Andrey Stanev explains that many dances traveled the world through sailors. In the ports of Rio de Janeiro, sailors learned the Samba. “So Samba is a dance that is typical for Brazil,” Stanev says. “It came out of Bossa Nova music, which has exactly the same rhythm like Samba but much slower.” The Samba Whisk is a common “whisk” variation of the samba. A “whisk” is simply when one foot crosses behind the other. [8] X Research source It’s hard to say exactly where and when the whisk move entered Samba, but it had been a staple step in waltzes for ages, and is a natural addition to any Samba. The Whisk found new popularity online when the blue shirt guy video went viral in 2025."
