      "content": "Bakaderes are anime characters who are child-like and silly. Bakadere is one of the many anime archetypes used to sort characters by common personality traits. Bakadere characters are often well-meaning, simple-minded people who often behave strangely to try to impress their love interest or friends. While they usually fail at these antics, viewers find them amusing and endearing. [1] X Research source The word bakadere is a combination of “baka,” meaning “foolish,” and “deredere,” meaning “to be lovestruck.” When put together, these words explain how the character feels and expresses their love—in this case, foolishly. The term originated online in Japan to describe the character Fuko Ibuki from the 2009 anime Clannad ~After Story~ . The term was used in the media for the first time in 2013, when it was featured on the 90th episode of the Maji Pon! radio show. Anime characters often call each other “baka” as an insult, but when fans label a character as bakadere, it’s a term of endearment."

      "content": "In Western media, ahoderes are oblivious to love. These characters are typically oblivious to their own romantic feelings and can’t tell when someone else is in love with them. The term originated on the Western internet in 2020 and is thought to be a misunderstanding of the Japanese version of ahodere. [9] X Research source “Aho” means “a character who lacks common sense and is unaware of their surroundings” and “dere” comes from “deredere,” which means “to be lovestruck.” When put together, it’s easy to see how fans would interpret this as someone oblivious to love. One way to think of the two ahodere archetypes is the Japanese archetype is a fool in love, while the Western version is a fool at love."

ENFPs are extroverted (E), intuitive (N), feeling (F), and perceptive (P). This MBTI type fits the bakadere archetype because these characters aren’t shy about their feelings and remain optimistic. [10] X Research source The Japanese ahodere type is the same MBTI type as bakaderes, while the Western version is most closely associated with the ISFP type (introverted, sensing, feeling, and perceiving). Myers-Briggs or MBTI is a personality test used to sort people into 1 of 16 personality types based on factors like introversion vs. extroversion and feeling vs. thinking."
