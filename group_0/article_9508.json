For instance, you might identify a recently passed grandparent with whom you were close as your guardian angel.

Creating a shrine or designated space to honor your guardian angel may help you to harness your energy or make contact with them. To create a sacred space, set aside a small area (like a bookshelf or the top of a dresser). Place a cloth over the area, then add a candle and an object that reminds you of your guardian angel. Some people like to include photos, foods, herbs, crystals, incense, and water as part of their altars. [4] X Research source As you choose items for your shrine, consider the objects, colors, numbers, and other items that are associated with your angel—either in your own mind or in holy texts and stories. When choosing your candle, use one that will only be lit when you’re trying to contact your guardian angel, not one that you use on an everyday basis. If you think of a deceased loved one as your guardian angel, place photos of that individual as well as some of their favorite items on the altar."

      "title": "Meditate to meet your guardian angel.",
      "content": "Meditate to meet your guardian angel. Find a quiet space where you won’t be disturbed and turn off any electronic devices that may distract you, advises Graf. Light the candle on your angel shrine (or just light any candle and place it in front of you). Sit in a comfortable position on a cushion, or lie down to meditate (as long as you’re sure you won’t fall asleep. Close your eyes or watch your candle. Try to empty your mind completely and take deep, slow, and steady breaths in and out. If you notice that you have started thinking about something, then take a moment to acknowledge the thought and then refocus on your breathing. In your mind, say \"hello\" to your angel. Thank your angel for watching over you. Then, let your angel know about any problems that are bothering you and ask your angel for guidance. If you have learned or prepared a prayer, then take a moment to recite the prayer. You can do this in your head or say the prayer out loud. Listen for your angel's reply. Any sign that your angel is there will most likely be subtle. For example, you may hear a faint noise, see a fleeting image in your mind's eye, notice a sensation of warmth, or get the feeling that someone is in the empty room with you. When you have finished speaking with your angel, say goodbye. You may want to end your meditation with a prayer as well. If your eyes are closed, open them. Then, sit quietly for a minute or two as you let your mind go back to normal. Keep in mind that meditation is a difficult skill to master. You probably won't get it right on your first attempt, and that’s okay. Just keep practicing your meditation, and it will become easier. If traditional meditation isn’t your thing, “you could instead take a quiet walk in the woods, someplace where you’re quiet and out of your head,” recommends Cartagenova. “You want to be more in your body and heart-centered to allow yourself to see what you’re connecting with.”"

      "content": "Learn a special prayer to call on your guardian angel. Many people use specific prayers to help them make contact with their angels. Some angels have prayers that are connected to them, which you can learn and use when contacting your angel. If your angel is not well-known, then you may want to consider coming up with your own prayer to that angel. You can write a prayer by following this basic structure that’s commonly used in prayers to angels: address your angel by name, acknowledge your angel’s presence and their special attributes and powers, identify your needs and what help you’re seeking from your angel, close your prayer with an expression of gratitude and a farewell. Alternatively, here are some prayers connected to well-known guardian angels: Archangel Michael: Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil; May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; And do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan and all evil spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.

Please help me hear what God has to say to me, so I can follow his guidance and fulfill his purposes in my life.

Please help me do my part to take good care of the natural world that God has created.

      "title": "Reflect on recurring signs or symbols your guardian angel may be sending you.",
      "content": "Reflect on recurring signs or symbols your guardian angel may be sending you. Cartagenova instructs clients to just “ask for a sign and say, ‘Okay, angels…in the next two weeks, show me a rainbow, or show me something so I know you’re there.’ Ask for something specific or keep it more open-ended. Once you ask for it, it’s important to just let it go…it’s almost as if you’re looking to find love; the harder you look, the harder it is to find something…Put it out there, say, ‘This is what I’m looking for,’ and then let it go. It always works for me.” Keep a journal to record anything that you believe your angel might be sending to you. Write down signs and symbols you see in your everyday life, as well as moments of inspiration that may occur during meditation. Keep in mind that signs and symbols may not always be obvious or manifest as physical things. Try paying attention to feelings of strong intuition, or your “gut.” Some people believe that these gut feelings are the main way that angels communicate with us. For instance, if you need to make a tough decision and don’t have time to meditate, mentally ask your angel what you should do. If an answer pops into your head, your angel may be guiding you. “Everybody has different abilities when it comes to their claircognizance [or] clairvoyance, which are your psychic abilities that everyone has, whether they know it or not,” explains Cartagenova. “You might hear things. You might smell things. There are different ways that people perceive [an angel’s] energy,” and it may not be by literally seeing an angel. “You might have a feeling,” continues Cartagenova. “The hair might stand up on the back of your neck…not in a creepy way, but just feeling some energy. That can be a sign from your guardian angel or, again, if you’re more clairvoyant, you’re able to see different colors or signs.”"

      "content": "Repeat your practice every day at a designated time. To increase your chances of contacting your guardian angel, you should designate a specific time each day to pray and meditate. Having a daily practice will give your guardian angel more opportunities to contact you. [12] X Research source For example, you might start or end each day with five minutes of prayer, meditation, and visualization near your shrine. You can also contact your angel at any time of need, but it’s best to have regular contact with your angel as well."

      "title": "Remember that your guardian angel is by your side.",
      "content": "Remember that your guardian angel is by your side. “Your angels are always around you,” claims Cartagenova, even if you can’t see or communicate with them. The feeling of never being alone and always being protected is the greatest gift that a guardian angel can give. Let this faith give you the confidence to get through tough times. It’s also important to keep in mind that “your angels always want to help you, but they can’t help you unless you ask because of free will, and they don’t want to get in the way of that,” as Cartagenova explains. In other words, guardian angels may be there to guide you, but you still have free will as a human being to make your own decisions and life choices. Since an angel may not want to inhibit your free will, you’ll have to call on them directly when you need their help—which is why these steps toward contacting your angel are so important to learn."

      "title": "Guardian angels are divine beings that protect and guide a person.",
      "content": "Guardian angels are divine beings that protect and guide a person. While the details may differ between distinct religious belief systems, guardian angels are generally described as spiritual companions who support, guide, and protect those whom they’re assigned to look after. In most cases, these angels are believed to be assigned to a human at birth and are tasked with protecting them from physical and spiritual harm and leading them toward righteousness throughout their lifetime and afterlife. [13] X Research source Even though many religions believe in guardian angels, they hold very different opinions about their nature. While most faiths believe that angels are a separate kind of being (distinct from humans), others believe that people become angels after they die. Catholics, for instance, believe that every person is assigned a guardian angel, while Muslims believe that everyone has two guardian angels—one to go in front and one to go behind. [14] X Research source In Judaism, there are conflicting views on guardian angels; some scholars assert that people don’t have individual guardian angels but that God may send one or many angels to a person in a time of need. Others believe that every mitzvah a person does creates an angel companion, while others still will say that an angel called Lailah watches over a person from conception to death. [15] X Research source If you want to learn more about guardian angels in your particular belief system, conduct research via reputable online sites or academic books. You can also ask a trusted person in your community, like your parents or a religious leader."

      "content": "Guardian angels provide comfort, protection, and spiritual guidance. According to religious beliefs, the main benefit of having a guardian angel is to receive protection from physical and spiritual harm and guidance toward virtuous and holy actions. Guardian angels may also offer comfort during times of grief and uncertainty, helping their charges to make difficult life decisions and navigate through their despair or confusion. [16] X Research source According to some faiths, guardian angels can also offer your prayers and requests directly to God. Guardian angels may also appear at your hour of death, when they’re believed to offer comfort as you transition into the afterlife."

      "title": "Finding a guardian angel is a personal decision, but some advise against it.",
      "content": "Finding a guardian angel is a personal decision, but some advise against it. While it’s certainly recommended to acknowledge and invoke your guardian angel, many religious followers believe that it’s not appropriate or advisable to name your angel. One reason is that angels in the Bible declined to give their names when asked, and God only named a select number in scripture. Therefore, interpreters of the text have concluded that we are not meant to know the names of other angels and we should not seek them out. [17] X Research source Naming something may also imply that you have authority over or possession of it, which is considered disrespectful to angels, over which humans are thought to have no authority or control. Some also believe that fallen angels may interfere in the search for a guardian angel’s name, which may lead to greater challenges or poor decisions."
