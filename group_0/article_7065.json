      "content": "Avoid past mistakes. Try to limit your cat's interactions with places and situations that expose him to ear mites. If you have an outdoor cat, you might consider keeping him inside if he is prone to frequent ear mite outbreaks. However, outdoor cats can be difficult to keep inside if they're accustom to coming and going as they please. If your cat suffers from Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) he should not go outside. Not only does his weakened immune system make him more susceptible to ear mites, the spread of FIV can be prevented by limiting his exposure to strange cats. Be wary of animal shelters and pet stores where ear mite outbreaks are common. Check all incoming kittens and cats for signs of ear mites before releasing them into your home."
