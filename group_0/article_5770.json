Place them an inch or so apart on a line. Connect them with an arch, so that you know that those two multiply together to make 14. Move inward, making a factor rainbow by making an arch with each set of factors. Divide by 2 next, which divides evenly because 2 multiplied by 7 equals 14. Therefore, the next two factors are 2 and 7. Connect those with an arch. However, 3 does not divide into 14 evenly, and neither does 4 or 5. At this point, you've reached the middle of the factor rainbow, so the factors are 1, 2, 7, and 14."

Three does not divide evenly into 28. However, 4 does, so the next factors are 4 and 7. Neither 5 nor 6 divide evenly into 28, so you've reached the end of your factor rainbow for 28. Your factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28."
