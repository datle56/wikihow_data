      "title": "Use worms and mealworms when in doubt.",
      "content": "Use worms and mealworms when in doubt. This bait is widely used in many types of fishing. Use earthworms or manure worms in freshwater and bloodworms or sandworms in saltwater. Mealworms and other live grubs are usually used for trout or bass. Pierce through several smaller worms or cut up worm halves to hide the hook in a mass of wriggling worms. Some hooks come with smaller hooks attached to the side for this purpose. For large worms, thread a single worm along the hook until the hook is mostly or completely hidden. For very large worms, pierce the hook through several points of the body. Leave a length at the end to wriggle and attract fish."

      "title": "Use minnow or sardines as a general purpose bait fish or specialize with another variety.",
      "content": "Use minnow or sardines as a general purpose bait fish or specialize with another variety. Many fish feed on minnow, but make sure you pick a size appropriate for your target fish to eat. Sardines also make great bait and attract most fish. [1] X Expert Source Michael Reynolds Professional Fishing Instructor Expert Interview. 26 February 2021. Ask at the bait shop what kind of local fish your target eats, too. If you are dragging the bait behind you in a moving boat (trolling), hook the fish under its jaw and exit through the top, or just through its upper jaw for especially large bait fish. Alternatively, you can hook it through both nostrils. Any of these hook methods will maximize the fish's ability to swim with a natural motion to attract predator fish. [2] X Research source For fishing while still or moving slowly, hook the bait fish on its back just in front of the dorsal fin. Hook it underneath the spine to avoid paralyzing it. This forces the fish to swim more frantically and head-downwards, attracting attention. You can fine tune the depth by placing it further ahead of the dorsal fin; this causes it to swim at a shallower downward angle. If you are freelining (fishing while stationary, using no floats or weights), you can hook the bait near the tail to make it swim forward. To force it to swim downward instead, hook into the mouth and exit through the gills. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Hook certain species with crayfish.",
      "content": "Hook certain species with crayfish. Fish that are attracted to crayfish bait include smallmouth bass, catfish, and walleye. Thread the hook shallowly through the back or front of the crayfish, pushing it out again on the same side. Don't go any deeper than necessary to get under the main shell segment, or you may kill the crayfish. Alternatively, thread the hook through the meaty tail. This can hide most of the hook and will not hit any of the crayfish's vital organs. Start at the end of the tail and push the hook out just before the body."

      "content": "Use shrimp when saltwater fishing near the shore. Shrimp are a common, cheap bait that many inshore fish varieties feed on, including redfish, jacks, and grouper. [4] X Expert Source Michael Reynolds Professional Fishing Instructor Expert Interview. 26 February 2021. [5] X Research source These are similar in anatomy to crayfish, but you may need to use a thinner hook for small varieties. Hook shallowly through the body or through the meat of the tail. Remove a few segments of shell so the shrimp scent is stronger."

      "title": "Bait freshwater fish with insects.",
      "content": "Bait freshwater fish with insects. During the summer when insects are plentiful, fishermen can simply catch adults from the ground or young nymphs from under the water surface to guarantee bait that's part of the local fish diet. Trout are especially attracted to insects. [6] X Research source Insects should be handled carefully, as they area easily killed while baiting. Tie a flexible thin wire to the shank of the hook, then wrap it carefully around the insect to affix it to the hooked section. If you can't affix it with wire, hook through the rear section of the body. The vital organs are mostly in the front and should be avoided. It doesn't matter which direction the insect is facing."

      "content": "Use fish pieces to attract fish that hunt by scent. This includes many saltwater fish such as sea trout and bluefish, as well as freshwater bottom feeders such as carp and catfish. [7] X Research source If you are fishing from one spot (still fishing), cut the fish into chunks thick enough to hide most of the hook. If you are dragging the fishing line behind a moving boat (trolling), cut the fish into long, thin V-shaped strips. Pierce the hook through the thicker end so the moving strip imitates a swimming fish."

      "content": "Bait with crayfish tail in freshwater or brackish water and shrimp tail in saltwater. Any fish that hunts crayfish, such as pike or catfish, can be attracted by a severed tail with the hook pushed along the length of the meaty center. The same hooking process can be used to attract shoreline fish with a shrimp tail bait."

      "content": "Customize doughballs to your fish species. Commercial doughball paste can be purchased in labeled varieties that attract bass, trout, or another specific species. You can also make your own by boiling hot water, flour, cornmeal, and molasses for a few minutes and letting it cool. Fishermen add anything from cheese to garlic to this recipe in their efforts to attract an individual fish species. Form the paste into a ball over the entire hook. Press it into place so the hook is hidden completely. Some hooks include wire springs to help keep the doughball in place."

      "title": "Use local clam and other soft meat.",
      "content": "Use local clam and other soft meat. Shellfish are great for attracting fish in their native area. Clams, mussels, liver, and other soft meat should be left out in the sun to harden before use, or else frozen beforehand and used when partially thawed. Once the meat is hardened, pierce the hook through it in as many different places as possible. Hide the end of the hook in the meat. If it still won't adhere to the hook or you suspect a fish could peel it right off, use fine thread or wire to tie it on."

In addition to customizing for your fish's habits, you can find artificial bait intended to attract a specific species by smell or appearance. In order to hook a standard artificial \"grub,\" thread the hook through the mouth of the bait until the front reaches the eye of the hook. Push the end of the hook out through the grub's stomach."

      "content": "Learn how to use a bridle. A bridle is tied between the hook and the bait fish in order to keep the bait fish alive for a long time and to increase the chance of a good hook, since it is difficult to pull the bridle off. Bridling is most often used in saltwater fishing to catch larger fish, since the proportionally larger bait fish is less replaceable and more easily manipulated."
