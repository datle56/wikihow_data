      "content": "Encourage each other. It’s difficult to grow and become a better person in an unhealthy relationship. If you’re with someone who is verbally, physically, or sexually abusive, ask yourself if this person is helping you grow. If you’re with someone who hurts you or someone who engages in unhealthy habits, it’s likely that you may get pulled down into bad habits or negative emotions. Focus on being in a healthy relationship and with a partner who encourages you to grow and better yourself. [1] X Research source Find ways that your partner wants to grow and determine to help each other grow.

      "content": "Change together. In long-term relationships, many changes can occur. You may change, your partner may change, and ultimately, these changes affect the relationship. Events can also change the relationship: moving, starting university, getting a new job, or having a baby can all greatly affect a relationship. Check in regularly with your partner and ask what changes are occurring and how they are positively or negatively affecting the relationship.

How are your actions helping or hurting the relationship, and how are they affecting the overall quality of the relationship? [4] X Research source Avoid growing apart as a result of change; instead, grow together. For instance, if your partner starts a new job, don’t let the long hours get in the way of spending time together. Find new ways to spend quality time together, such as cooking together or reading a book together. Do your part to adapt well to change. It’s not your responsibility how your partner adapts, so keep the focus on what action you can take to adapt to change and be supportive of your partner. When you notice yourself not adapting well or not checking in with your partner, set aside some time to talk. Talk about how to support each other and contribute to the quality of the relationship."
