      "title": "Align the concrete with the wood block.",
      "content": "Align the concrete with the wood block. Mark where you will drill in both with a permanent marker. The spots you mark are the areas you plan to concrete the concrete and wood with the hammer-set concrete fasteners. This will keep your drill holes precise so your fasteners will fit securely into the wood and concrete. You will need hammer-set concrete fasteners to connect the wood and concrete, which you can get online or from most home improvement stores."

      "title": "Predrill a hole in the concrete.",
      "content": "Predrill a hole in the concrete. Drill a hole into the concrete approximately 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) deeper than your concrete fastener. When you're finished drilling, blow any remaining concrete dust out of the hole with a small vacuum. [1] X Research source Take all necessary safety precautions while using a drill, and put on safety goggles and professional-grade earmuffs beforehand. In a pinch, you can also use a syringe blower to remove the dust."

      "title": "Drill a hole through the wood.",
      "content": "Drill a hole through the wood. Using your screw markings as guides, align the wood with the concrete object and drill through the wood into the drilled concrete hole. This will help you make sure that the holes are aligned. Unlike the concrete, where you only have to drill 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) deeper than the fastener's length, you should drill completely through the wood."

      "content": "Drive the anchor through the wood and concrete. Keeping the wood and concrete holes aligned, position the fastener into the hole and hammer it through. After driving it through the hole, the concrete fastener should expand at the back and wedge itself tightly into the concrete. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Select concrete screws based on the length of the intended hole.",
      "content": "Select concrete screws based on the length of the intended hole. Your screw should be long enough to penetrate completely through the wood and at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) into the concrete. Measure the depth of your wood and concrete objects, and purchase screws that will fasten the wood securely. [3] X Research source Although 1 inch (2.5 cm) of concrete penetration is the minimum, deeper penetration will result in a stronger hold. The longer your screws are, the tighter they will connect the wood and concrete. Concrete screws are the newest method of fastening wood to concrete and generally the most popular because they are easy to remove. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Predrill holes into the concrete and wood.",
      "content": "Predrill holes into the concrete and wood. The holes should be approximately the same diameter as the screws that you're using. Drill completely through the wood and about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) deeper than the screw's length into the concrete. [5] X Research source Mark the holes in the concrete and wood using a permanent marker first to make sure your holes are precise. Blow the residual dust out of the concrete hole using a vacuum or syringe blower."

      "title": "Insert a piece of copper wire into the holes.",
      "content": "Insert a piece of copper wire into the holes. Copper wire ensures that the concrete screws will fit tightly into the hole. Cut a piece of copper wire approximately the same length as the concrete and wood hole, and thread it through the holes before you drive the screw in. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Drive the screw through the wood and concrete.",
      "content": "Drive the screw through the wood and concrete. Use a drill or screwdriver to drive the screw completely through the wood and concrete holes. If you are driving multiple screws, use the first screw you drive in as a test screw to make sure the hole is deep enough and you've used enough wire. [7] X Research source You will know that you have used enough copper wire if the screw fits tightly into the hole and the connection between the wood and concrete is not loose or wobbly. Thread extra copper wire through the hole if it's too large for the screw."

      "title": "Use mortar nails on concrete blocks secured with mortar.",
      "content": "Use mortar nails on concrete blocks secured with mortar. Because these nails are not strong enough to hammer through concrete, try this option only if your concrete was secured using mortar. If your concrete object was not connected with mortar, you must use concrete screws or fasteners instead. Mortar nails are generally the cheapest attachment option for wood and concrete."

      "title": "Select nails that will penetrate at least 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) into the concrete.",
      "content": "Select nails that will penetrate at least 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) into the concrete. Your mortar nails should go through the wood entirely and penetrate the concrete by 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm), if possible. If you can find nails that will penetrate the concrete deeper than 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm), this can create an even more secure hold. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Mark and align the holes in the wood and mortar.",
      "content": "Mark and align the holes in the wood and mortar. Indicate where you intend to put holes in the wood and concrete objects with a permanent marker. Using these markings as a guide, place the wood marking directly over your concrete marking. The wood should lie flat against the concrete object. [9] X Research source Make sure the marked area you choose for the concrete object is in the mortar, not the concrete itself."

      "title": "Drive the nails into the wood and mortar with a hammer.",
      "content": "Drive the nails into the wood and mortar with a hammer. Use sharp, powerful blows to work the fastener through to the bottom of the hole. Continue hammering until you drive the nail completely in and cannot hammer it further. Put on safety goggles before hammering the nail into the wood and mortar. [10] X Research source"
