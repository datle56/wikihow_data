      "content": "Maintain your GPA. Your cumulative GPA is one of the criteria used to see if you make National Honor Society standards. If you want to be in NHS, work on maintaining a high GPA. [1] X Research source Members of National Honor Society must have a GPA of 3.5 or higher on the 4.0 scale. On a 5.0 scale, this would be at least a 4.375 and 5.25 on a 6.0 scale. On a letter grade scale, this would be at least a B+ and 90% or higher grade average on a 100 point scale. Start working on your grades early in high school. If you start off with a low GPA you'll have to work extra hard to pull it up in the following semesters. Take your studies and homework seriously. If you're struggling with a particular subject, consider hiring a tutor or asking a friend in class to help you out. Most people do not excel equally well in all subjects. You might be an excellent chemistry student but struggle remembering dates for history class, for example."

A solid application can increase your chances of being accepted into NHS. Include all the experience you have related to NHS's core values: scholarship, leadership, service, and character. Include things like work on school clubs, experience with sports, volunteer work, after school jobs, and any awards or achievements. Many chapters of NHS require an essay as part of the membership application. The essay might be a broad overview of your qualifications or it might ask a specific question, like \"If you had to have dinner with anyone living or dead who would you pick?\" Spend a lot of time on your essay. Write a couple of drafts and have a friend or family member look it over for you. If you are not granted membership, you have the right to appeal the council's decision. However, appeals must be made to the local chapter itself - state and national NHS agencies do not hear membership appeals. Do not be discouraged. Continue your service activities and leadership activities and maintain your good GPA. You can always apply again next year."
