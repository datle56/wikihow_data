      "content": "Mudras are Buddhist hand signs that reflect the Buddha’s state of mind. The word “mudra” means “seal” or “sign” in Sanskrit. The 5 fingers of the hand represent the 5 levels of consciousness required to reach a state of Buddhahood. By gesturing the hands and fingers in a particular position, you can better get in touch with the meanings behind the mudra. When performing mudras, the right hand symbolizes a method of action that is skilled and focused; it also stands for the male principle. The left hand symbolizes wisdom, emptiness, and contemplation as the female principle. This explains why many Buddhist pieces of art depict Buddha with an active right hand and a resting left hand. [1] X Research source Mudra hand signs appear in Buddhist art and are ways of teaching others different narratives about the life of the Buddha. Mudras also exist in Hinduism and Jainism.
