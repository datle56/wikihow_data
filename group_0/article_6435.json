To do this, leave a bowl outside overnight and collect it at dawn; that way, you can use the dew inside to wash your face."

To make the flower crown : Measure a piece of grapevine wire to fit your head and secure the ends with floral tape , forming the base of the crown. [6] X Research source Attach a light layer of greenery around the base of the crown with floral tape. Ivy, eucalyptus, or myrtle are all great options for this step. Tape together small flower bunches with one big statement flower (roses, daisies, and peonies are all large and colorful) and a couple of filler flowers (like lavender and baby's breath).

To make one: Squeeze clear school glue into a circular plastic lid (any reused butter, yogurt, or sour cream lid will work). Place colored flat glass gems into the glue, arranging them in any pattern or design you want. Then, add another layer of glue over the top of the gems to solidify your design. Let the glue dry for 4 to 5 days. Once dry, remove your new suncatcher from the plastic lid and hot-glue a length of ribbon to the suncatcher so that you can hang it up and enjoy it."

You’re the gnomon (the dial that casts shadows on a sundial). Have someone place another stone at the top of your shadow (where your shadow’s head is) and write “12” on it. This is now 12 o’clock (noon) on your sundial. From there, set a timer every hour and repeat this, marking each shadow with a new stone (1 o’clock, 2 o’clock, and so on). Keep doing it until the sun sets. The next morning, complete your sundial by doing this each hour from sunrise until midday.

      "content": "The summer solstice is the longest day and shortest night of the year. This is caused by the Earth’s orbit; on the summer solstice, one of Earth’s poles has its maximum tilt toward the sun, causing longer periods of daylight. It’s also when the Sun is at its highest point in the sky. At either pole (North or South, depending on which is tilted toward the sun), there’s constant sunlight for the entire day.

Its spiritual significance varies by culture; some have specific holidays or festivals for the occasion, while others prefer to attach their own meanings to it. Many people treat the summer solstice as a time to soak in the sun, connect with nature, and bolster their spirits by getting ready for the new season. [24] X Research source Historically, some summer solstice rituals and festivals were related to fertility or even sun gods. German-speaking cultures refer to the summer solstice as “midsummer” and celebrate with bonfires and feasting. Midsummer was also Christianized as “Saint John’s Day.” In Celtic traditions, midsummer is called “Litha.” It’s a pagan holiday celebrating Mother Earth—and, in some cultures, it’s also a battle between light and dark. In Sweden, midsummer is a major holiday; the country closes its institutions and businesses, just as you might see on Christmas."

      "content": "The summer solstice falls on June 20 or 21 in the northern hemisphere. For the Southern hemisphere, the summer solstice falls on either December 21 or 22. That’s because there are 2 solstices every year (one in June and one in December). June is summer and December is winter for the northern hemisphere, so that’s when the summer and winter solstices are, respectively. For the southern hemisphere, the summer and winter solstices are flipped. [25] X Research source In 2024, the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere will be on Thursday, June 20. In 2025, the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere will be on Friday, June 20. The date of the summer solstice changes (between June 20 and 21) because the earth’s orbit takes slightly longer than 265 days each year until a leap year rolls around and re-aligns the calendar and orbit."
