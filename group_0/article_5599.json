However, it's critically important that when doing this, you don't put yourself at risk of being injured. There is already one emergency, don’t make it two. If the victim is bleeding a lot, apply direct pressure to the wound to stem the flow of blood. Tie a towel or shirt around the wound, then apply pressure. You can also use any available items around to create a makeshift tourniquet . A belt will do in a pinch, but is not ideal for this. If the injury occurred in a car accident, you may need to assist by removing the injured individual from a car that is smoking or smoldering. If the injured person is in a dangerous area, like a busy roadway, move her to the side of the road so that she doesn't get hit by a car or other vehicle. Don’t ever approach a vehicle that is already on fire and, if the injured person has suffered a spinal injury, never try to move the person yourself. You could make her injury worse or get yourself blown up."

The steps are listed below. [8] X Research source When performing CPR, begin with chest compressions. Place the heel of your hand over the center of the chest, push down 2 inches (5.1 cm), and repeat 30 times. Make sure you pump your hands hard and fast, achieving a rate of at least 100 pushes per minute. You will be pushing down faster than once per second. [9] X Research source After pumping the chest 30 times, blow 2 breaths of air into the person’s lungs. To do this, gently tilt the injured individual’s head backward and lift the chin upwards. Then, form a seal between your mouth and the victim’s mouth by pinching his nose and covering their mouth with yours. When providing air, blow until you see the injured person’s chest rise up. Blow in 2 breaths each time for 1 second each. [10] X Research source Repeat the process for as long as necessary, pumping the chest 30 times for every 2 breaths of air you give. [11] X Research source If you are not familiar with CPR, it is better to allow someone else to administer it, as you could injure the victim in the process."

[12] X Research source Try to help the individual relax and let her know she is not alone. If she is already on the ground, keep her lying there. If she is upright, have her lie down.
