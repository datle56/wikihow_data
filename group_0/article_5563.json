[8] X Research source Here is a list of timezones in Canada and Ireland. Ireland is in the GMT time zone, which is the standard from which other time zones are calculated.

Ottowa is in the GMT-5 time zone, meaning it is 5 hours behind Ireland. Winnipeg and Regina are both in the GMT-6 time zone, meaning they are 6 hours behind Ireland. Edmonton is in the GMT-7 time zone, meaning it is 7 hours behind Ireland. Vancouver is in the GMT-8 time zone, meaning it is 8 hours behind Ireland. To calculate the time difference between your location in Canada and Ireland, add the number of hours you are behind to GMT to the current time. For example, if you were making a call from Vancouver at 7 o’clock in the evening, it would be 3 o’clock in the morning in Ireland!"
