The butterfly kiss works best if you two are lying down, sitting next to each other in a comfortable and private setting, or just feeling close to one another. A butterfly kiss is best done in private, when you're both relaxed, and you should be cuddling , snuggling , or touching each other a bit first. It's a little hard to go from zero to butterfly kiss, and you don't want to catch your partner by surprise. [1] X Research source This is the kind of kiss you should try with someone you've been with for a while. Though it's not particularly sexual, the butterfly kiss is very intimate, and you don't want to shock someone you've only been dating for a few weeks with this tender gesture.

      "content": "Move your eyes closer together. You can try to bring your faces together so that both of your eyes line up, though this may be more challenging because your noses will get in the way. You can also just move your right eye closer to your partner's right eye or your left eye closer to your partner's left eye. Move slowly, so the motion is gentle and effortless.

      "content": "Flutter your eyelashes even faster. Beat those wings like you've got places to fly! Try moving your eyelashes even faster by blinking more rapidly to increase the effect you're going for. You can even mix it up, going between blinking really fast and slowing down those flutters. Butterfly kisses can last just a few seconds, though, so you don't have to overthink it too much. But if you really do like butterfly kissing, you can be at it for a minute or more! Some people even give butterfly kisses on the cheek, or other tender parts of their significant other's face. This also creates a tender feeling that is hard to replicate! The next time you and your partner are lying down or cuddling, you can try this tender gesture."
