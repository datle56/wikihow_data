      "content": "Highlight your curves and body shape. The softness of your natural curves is your feminine gift. Accentuate and embrace your female body to bring out the feminist aesthetic. This often means wearing clothes that highlight your chest and waist. Yet the easiest way to highlight your curves is to wear clothes that fit. [1] X Research source [2] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 23 April 2019. You can try to wear somewhat tight clothing, or just enough to accentuate your beautiful figure. A woman's figure is markedly different from a man's, and calling(even a small amount) of attention to it will naturally look more feminine. If you feel comfortable and feminine in an outfit, then it makes you more feminine. You do not have to show skin to appear feminine."

      "content": "Wear undergarments that make you feel sexy. No one has to see what you're wearing underneath for it to make a difference.

      "content": "Pay attention to the societal and cultural image of femininity. Though there is no one right way to \"be feminine,\" there are fashion cues that signal femininity. Looking feminine, however, does not mean you must submit to traditional gender roles. Rather, it is a stylistic choice that accentuates many classic examples of femininity such as grace, dignity, flirtiness, and sexuality. [5] X Research source Anyone can bring feminine style into their wardrobe regardless of gender or sexual identity. Think about \"classic\" examples of feminine beauty, such as Halle Berry, Marilyn Monroe, and Nicole Kidman. What makes them feminine to you? Anyone -- male, female, transgender, etc. -- can look, dress, and be feminine. Feminine is not the same as \"female,\" because it is a social, not biological, concept. [6] X Research source"

Men rarely wear make-up, but can successfully pull off eyeshadows and liners for a more feminine look, as many rock stars like Morrissey or Marilyn Manson show regularly. Paint your nails, experiment with new makeup, or emulate celebrities whose look you admire. (Make up isn't the main way to appear \"feminine\", natural beauty is #1. With confidence you will glow). :) You do not need make-up to appear more feminine, but if you love the art behind it, why not go for it. A bold red lipstick is very feminine.

Think of pulling yourself forward by your lower half of the body, not \"falling\" forward and letting your feet catch up. [8] X Research source The first step is to have good posture (spine straight, shoulders over hips, chin parallel to the ground), but there are a few extra steps that can help make your walk extra-feminine. Keep your shoulders back, elevating your chest. Swing your hips slightly towards of the foot taking a step (ie. swing left when stepping with your left foot). Walk slowly, as if you're never in a rush."

You have a unique, incredible personality that you should never be afraid to hide. Being more feminine is not about learning to act a part or conform to a role. It is about being happy with who you are and accentuating the qualities you enjoy. Remind yourself that no one has a monopoly on being feminine -- you get to decide what it means as much as anyone else. Femininity is about being free to be yourself, love your body and life, and love others. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Be compassionate. Just like you shouldn't expect other people to judge you on your femininity, you shouldn't judge others. Historically, femininity is rooted in ideas of compassion, wisdom, and nurturing. This is why some people view acting feminine as weak or vulnerable, as typical feminine behavior isn't rooted in selfishness. Yet the ability to be flexible and caring is important for everyone and helps foster community and togetherness that can solve the hardest of problems. Be respectful and polite, even when wronged. Taking the high road is not only dignified, it often diffuses problems before they occur. Avoid unnecessary conflict whenever possible by distancing yourself from petty fights."

      "content": "Think about other people, not just yourself. Having emotional empathy is one of the keys to being more feminine that all people, men and women alike, can embrace. Empathy is when you try and put yourself in someone's shoes to see how they feel. This allows you to better manage conflicts, help friends in need, and make long-lasting friendships. [12] X Research source Ask yourself: \"What is their side of the story?\" before getting angry. Think of problems in terms of other people, not just yourself. Recognize that rarely is something one person's fault-- there are a lot of factors in their life that affect them, just like in yours."

      "title": "Be receptive to the world around you, good and bad.",
      "content": "Be receptive to the world around you, good and bad. Many people still see traditionally feminine words like \"submissive,\" or \"receptive\" as bad. But they are incredibly powerful ideas that can help you be more at peace with life, open yourself up to change, and accept love into your heart. While masculine ideas often clash with this, preferring to be in-charge or commanding, the truth is that no one completely controls their life. Learning to accept the things you cannot change with grace and humility is crucial to accessing your feminine side, and it will make you happier as a result. Recognizing that you cannot change everything does not mean \"giving up.\" It means finding the things you can change and focusing on them."

      "content": "Recognize that being more feminine has nothing to do with success or accomplishment. Being feminine does not mean that you cannot be smart, powerful, or assertive. All people, male and female, exist somewhere between femininity and masculinity-- no one is all one or the other. That is a good thing, since both sides are important for a successful, well-balanced life. Taking pride in your appearance does not mean you are unfit for a job or career. Having \"girly\" preferences, such as liking the color pink, does not mean you cannot be taken seriously. Never ditch your dreams, goals, or projects because they don't conform to someone's notions of femininity. [13] X Research source"
