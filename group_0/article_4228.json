      "content": "Wait until you are a short distance away from the person. Blowing a kiss is a non-verbal show of affection that works best when you are a short distance away from someone (e.g., across the room.) If you blow someone a kiss at close proximity, it may seem odd and unnecessary. Opt to express your feelings verbally instead of blowing a kiss if you are close enough to do so.

      "content": "Lock eyes with the person you are blowing a kiss to. Making direct eye contact when blowing a kiss lets the person you are sending it to know that it is for them. Look at the person until they look back at you and smile when they meet your gaze. Hold that eye contact while you blow them a kiss. [2] X Research source If they break eye contact before you make the gesture, wait until they look back at you to try again."

      "title": "Be mindful about your cultural surroundings.",
      "content": "Be mindful about your cultural surroundings. Blowing a kiss is a gesture that is well-understood in North American culture, but not necessarily in others. Be aware of your cultural surroundings or the cultural background of the person you wish to blow a kiss to. If you make the gesture to someone who doesn't understand it, you may be left in an awkward situation. [3] X Research source In Brazil, for instance, the gesture of bringing your fingers to your mouth as if you kiss them signifies the enjoyment of a meal and not a sign of affection."

      "title": "Choose an appropriate time and place.",
      "content": "Choose an appropriate time and place. Before you blow a kiss, make sure it is an appropriate situation and done in the right context. Blowing a kiss is often seen as a flirtatious gesture, which can be problematic in the workplace. It is also a gesture that you and the recipient of your kiss may not wish for certain people to see (e.g., gossiping neighbors.) [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure the person won't be uncomfortable. Blowing a kiss is a bold statement of affection that you should think about carefully beforehand. A person who does not want to receive your affections may feel uncomfortable or harassed by the gesture. If there is any chance that the person will be made uncomfortable by the kiss, avoid doing it. [5] X Research source For instance, if a person has already rejected your romantic advances, avoid blowing them a kiss."
