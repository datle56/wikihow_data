Use 100 grit sandpaper for unfinished pieces, and work with the grain of the wood. Sand gently until the piece is smooth. If your piece is stained, use 240 or 280 grit sandpaper."

Varnish is beautiful, durable finish, but it is prone to attracting dust, hair, and other impurities before it dries. Plan to varnish your piece in a place that is clean and will not be disturbed. [4] X Research source Try to apply the varnish in a different location than the one you sanded your piece in. If you have to use the same location, vacuum (don’t sweep) thoroughly after sanding. Wet mopping the floor before you begin can also help keep dust down."

Make sure to get: [5] X Research source Varnish (read the label carefully to make sure it is true oil-based varnish, not polyurethane) A paintbrush (natural bristle is preferable) A stirring stick A large, clear measuring cup with markings on the side Paint thinner (turpentine or mineral spirits) Rubber gloves and a respirator (optional)"

      "content": "Stir the varnish carefully. Avoid shaking the container of varnish. Open it carefully, and use your stick to stir the varnish thoroughly. Work slowly and gently -- you don’t want to introduce air bubbles into the varnish. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Thin your varnish.",
      "content": "Thin your varnish. Pour enough varnish for the first coat into your measuring cup. The exact amount will vary depending on how large your piece is, but generally it pays to start small - you can always add more. Then, add some paint thinner directly to the varnish and stir carefully. [7] X Research source Experts suggest using 20-25 percent thinner for the first coat of varnish, and 5-10 percent for subsequent coats. For instance, if you pour three quarters of a cup of varnish for your first coat, add one quarter cup of thinner. For subsequent cups, you can pour 9 ounces of varnish and 1 ounce of thinner."

      "title": "Brush varnish lightly onto your wood.",
      "content": "Brush varnish lightly onto your wood. Dip just the tip of your brush into the varnish-thinner mixture, and gently apply it to your piece. Work in the direction of the wood grain, not back-and-forth. Start in one corner and do a one foot square. When that is finished, move your brush and start another square right next to it. Repeat until the entire surface is covered. [8] X Research source Keep dipping your brush into the varnish to keep it wet. Wear rubber gloves and a respirator, if you want to protect yourself from fumes and spills."

      "title": "Tip off while the varnish is still wet.",
      "content": "Tip off while the varnish is still wet. “Tipping off” smoothes out the surface of the varnish and helps prevent any bubbles and streaks. Hold the brush at a right angle to the work surface, and lightly brush just the tip of the brush over the whole varnished surface. Once again, work in the direction of the wood grain."

      "title": "Apply two thin coats of varnish, then sand and apply another.",
      "content": "Apply two thin coats of varnish, then sand and apply another. Most projects will need several coats of varnish. Let each coat dry thoroughly. This will take at least 6 hours, and probably 24 or more. After the second coat has dried, sand the piece with 320-grit sandpaper. Wipe away the residue, then apply at least one more coat of varnish. [9] X Research source Varnish is dry when it does not feel tacky to the touch. If your sandpaper becomes clogged with residue, it’s a sign the varnish has not sufficiently dried. Light-wear projects, like trim, may only need one coat of varnish. Heavy-duty pieces like furniture may need around five. Let the final coat cure for several weeks before using the item."

Oil paintings should cure for several months before they are ready, while acrylic paintings should be completely dry in 24 hours. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Gather your varnishing supplies. A wide, flat, and soft brush is ideal for varnishing. To keep impurities out, dedicate a brush solely to varnishing, not painting. Clean it after each use. You will also need some artist-quality varnish (for acrylics or oils, depending on your paints), and a shallow tray to pour the varnish into."

      "title": "Add another layer, if desired.",
      "content": "Add another layer, if desired. One coat is enough varnish for many paintings. If you would like thicker coverage, let the first dry for 24 hours before applying a second coat. For the second coat, run your brush horizontally rather than vertically, as you did for the first coat. This will provide optimal coverage. If you missed spots in the first coat, don’t go back over it until it has dried thoroughly. For a very thick coat, you can add a third coat of varnish after waiting for the second to dry."
