      "content": "Remember that you didn't choose to be attracted to members of the same sex. Attempts to change your orientation are usually painful and pointless in the end. When talking with heterosexual friends or family members, it's sometimes tough to help them understand this, because they have no frame of reference for your experience. Try to encourage others to see your sexual orientation in the same way as they see your eye color - it is something you were born with and did not choose . It is something that is simply a part of your being, and not something you can change. Or want to or should! [3] X Research source There isn't any need to change yourself - being gay is just another way of simply existing, and there is nothing wrong with it at all. Neither is there anything wrong with you for being gay. [4] X Expert Source Deb Schneider, LCSW, PPSC Licensed Clinical Social Worker Expert Interview. 2 April 2021.

If you can't accept your sexual orientation and feel comfortable and confident in your skin, then other people find it harder to accept you fully. It's your right to love; no one has the right to tell you otherwise. Tell yourself: \"I am a person with feelings and intellect and life, just like everyone else. I am unique and individual, and no one has the right to choose my life for me. The fact that I am gay is just another facet of who I am, just as being creative, or optimistic, or having brown eyes is. I may not be like many of my friends, but I choose to live my life authentically and happily. It's my life, and I choose to be happy.\""

They share the same interests, goals, and dreams for their lives. Being gay does not necessarily make you any less masculine or feminine, and there is no need or pressure to conform to stereotypes that don't feel right to you - because you are who you are. [5] X Research source You do not need to fit into the gay community just as much as you don't need to fit into the straight community. These are arbitrary social constructs. Are boys inherently about football and burping? No. Society has told them that that's okay. In 100 years, \"gay\" will be an entirely different concept. Don't pressure yourself to fit in one way or another. Be genuine with yourself so you know your values. Knowing what you value will help you choose whatâ€™s important to you rather than what society thinks is important. Brainstorm and write down what you value."

If anyone tries to force an opinion on you that you do not agree with, such that your desires themselves are unnatural, sinful or symptoms of a mental disorder, look elsewhere for support. There is no evidence that \"helping gay people to become heterosexual\" is possible. If someone tells you it is, walks the other way. Treatments to \"change\" sexual orientation that was common in the 1960s and 1970s were very damaging to those patients who underwent them and affected no change in their sexual orientation. In fact, conversion therapy is slowly getting banned across the US. Homosexuality is not viewed as an illness and in short, it won't be treated as such. [6] X Research source"

[12] X Research source Don't come out to a particular person if it doesn't feel right to you. This is a good rule to follow in general - there could be many reasons why, but if it doesn't \" feel right \" then it is probably not the right time to come out to that person. The time to tell them maybe later, or never. What is most important is that you come out to yourself. Once you are at ease with your sexual orientation and have a healthy self-image, the when and how of coming out often fall into place naturally"

[14] X Research source If you were raised in an environment that frowns on homosexuality, you are not worth any less. The laws in the Bible were mainly for health purposes - shunning homosexuality is right next to not getting tattoos, not eating pork, and not wearing mixed linens, but you can bet your bottom dollar all your neighbors do those things. Know that how you were raised is just cultural-specific. You are still you and you are good. If you'd like to morph your religious beliefs you're more than welcome to, but you don't have to.

There are over 7.6 billion people in the world, and you can't please everyone; those who care about you will still love you for who you are.
