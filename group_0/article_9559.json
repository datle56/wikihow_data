      "title": "Usage.",
      "content": "Usage. Create a circular area of control where you can toss buildings and other inanimate objects, but the Fruit doesn't work outside the circle (see this wikiHow article for more on rankings of Fruits in Blox Fruits). None of the skills damage Sea Beasts, so Control Fruit is a horrible choice for grinding Sea Events. Each skill has a high amount of mastery to use, so it takes more work to learn and use."

      "title": "Control Area/Z.",
      "content": "Control Area/ Z . 1 mastery. Create a circular area where you can use Control abilities. If you use the legendary sword Koko, its X and Z moves are massively buffed."

      "title": "Echo Knife/C.",
      "content": "Echo Knife/ C . 150 mastery. Strike the area before you with a ghostly purple and blue sword; if anything is caught in the strike area, you attack the target with multiple slashes, with the final strike launching them into the air. This is a single-target skill. Only the enemy who triggers the attack will be damaged."

      "title": "Gamma Rush/V.",
      "content": "Gamma Rush/ V . 350 mastery. Launch a greenish projectile toward your cursor; if the projectile hits anyone, a cutscene triggers where you launch green slashes all around the control area, damaging everyone inside. This attack deals the most damage to the enemy who triggered it."

      "content": "Teleport/ F . 250 mastery. Teleport to your cursor, but you can only teleport inside the Control Area. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pros:",
      "content": "Pros: Bonuses for swords and guns. (Using this Fruit with either of those weapons massively boosts the X and Z skills of that weapon.) Great stuns, mobility, and high combo potential. Good value in trading. Fun to play with."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cons:",
      "content": "Cons: High mastery requirements mean you can't use the best abilities until you've used the Fruit a lot. Attacks can only occur within the Control field, so other players can avoid damage by stepping outside the circle. Requires aim and precision. Attacks are poor against Sea Beasts. Control Area only lasts for 1 minute, so you have to reactivate the area to keep using Control skills. Teleport only works on solid surfaces; you cannot teleport into the air."

      "title": "If it fits your playstyle.",
      "content": "If it fits your playstyle. Control Fruit is powerful in PvE once you unlock all the mastery requirements, and it is very fun to play. It might be worth it to you for purely PvE circumstances. Most of the skills require you to aim them, so if you're not good at aiming, this most likely isn't the fruit for you."
