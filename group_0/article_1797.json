      "title": "An art journal is a visual diary that combines writing and visual art.",
      "content": "An art journal is a visual diary that combines writing and visual art. Unlike a traditional journal, an art journal (or visual journal) incorporates color, images, patterns, and various materials to create different mixed-media artwork on each page. You can use any materials you like, though things like paint, markers, ink, and watercolor are common. The purpose of an art journal is to express yourself and your emotions by experimenting with various art techniques and materials. [1] X Research source Think of an art journal like a sketchbook that incorporates several art materials instead of just ink or pencil. Every person art journals a bit differently, so there are no definitive rules for what you should or should not include."

      "title": "Choose a journal or sketchbook with thick paper.",
      "content": "Choose a journal or sketchbook with thick paper. Before starting an art journal, consider what kind of journal you want. In general, it’s best to choose a journal, sketchbook, or other medium with thick pages, as paint and ink may bleed through thin paper. Consider how large or small you want your journal to be, and if you prefer a spiral or hardbound book. [2] X Research source If you want something on the larger side, go for an A4-sized journal . For something a bit smaller, consider an A5 . Spiral-bound sketchbooks and journals can lay flat or fold over, making them a practical choice, especially if you want to take out pages. Hardbound journals , on the other hand, may not lay as flat, but they offer greater durability and protection. You don’t have to use an actual journal for your art journal. Sketchbooks and notebooks also work, or you can make your own art journal by painting over the pages of an old book. If you want to get creative, bind your own journal ."

      "content": "Gather your favorite art supplies and set up your workspace. You don’t have to have any specific art supplies to start your journal. However, some common materials include pens, markers, paint brushes, acrylic paint, and watercolors. [3] X Research source Gather whatever you want to use and set up your workspace, like a desk or a table. Cover the surface with newspaper or old towels so you don’t make a mess."

      "title": "Decide what type of art you want to put in your journal.",
      "content": "Decide what type of art you want to put in your journal. There isn’t a right or wrong way to art journal, so it’s up to you what kind of art you want to do. Some people include many different types of art, like painting and collaging , in a single journal, while others prefer to keep different journals for different types of art. If you’re not sure what you want to do, go with the flow! [4] X Research source Feel free to look up different art journaling spreads online to get a feel for what you like. Check the “art journaling” tag on social media sites like Pinterest, Instagram , or YouTube ."

    {
      "title": "Make a background.",
      "content": "Make a background. To begin your first art journal spread, design your background. Many people prefer to do this by painting the journal’s pages with acrylic paint, but you can use whatever medium you like. If you prefer, use some scrapbooking paper or cut a page out of a magazine and glue it into your journal to use as the first layer of your piece. Creating a background removes some of the stress or anxiety of staring at a blank white page, and it gives you an open area to start journaling. [5] X Research source If you don’t want to make a definitive background, that’s totally fine! It’s your journal to do as you please."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add layers with different art supplies.",
      "content": "Add layers with different art supplies. Once your background is dry, give your spread more depth and color by adding layers with different art supplies. Paint on a design, stamp on a pattern, or add some stickers. Glue in some images from a magazine or some loose papers you have lying around to add texture. [6] X Research source When deciding what you want to paint or draw, Schweiger says, “Ask [yourself] what types of techniques, tools, colors, lines, and shapes [you can] use to really express your message. [Choose] specific paint brushes, specific brush strokes, and a specific composition that really supports what it is that you’re wanting to say, what you’re wanting to express.”"

    {
      "title": "Create a focal point.",
      "content": "Create a focal point. If your spread feels incomplete or like it’s missing something, add an image to be your focal point—the place your eyes are first drawn to. Draw or paint an image yourself, or if you prefer, cut out a large image to finish off your collage. As usual, your focal point can be anything you want. For example, if your background and layers are mainly blue, consider an ocean-themed focal point, like a dolphin. Consider following the \"rule of thirds.\" Imagine your image is divided into 9 equal parts, like a tic-tac-toe board. The imaginary lines mark the thirds of the image, and adding an object to one of those lines will naturally attract the eye."

      "title": "Write a journal entry.",
      "content": "Write a journal entry. Once you’ve finished your spread and allowed it to dry completely, you may choose to write something. Like all elements of an art journal, this isn’t required, but it can be a nice touch, especially if you like the “journaling” aspect of art journaling. Write about your day, include your favorite quote or song lyrics, or write whatever you feel like writing. [7] X Research source If you’re not sure what to write, try looking up some writing or journaling prompts online."

      "content": "There’s no fear of judgment. Often, people stop pursuing art because they fear they’re not as talented as other people. However, your art journal is private—unless you choose to share your work with someone, you’re the only one who will see it. This is a great way to build confidence and do what you enjoy without worrying what others think. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Incorporate old art into a new spread. Sometimes, our art doesn’t turn out the way we envisioned, and that’s okay! If you’re not happy with an existing piece, give it new life by using it in an art journal spread. Try cutting or ripping up a piece of art and glue it into your art journal as a collage. You may like the new piece more than the original!"

      "content": "Make swatches of your art supplies. If you’re in the mood to create but can’t figure out what to paint or write, fill a page or two with swatches of your art supplies. Test each one in a square on the page so you can see what they look like. This is great if you just bought some new supplies and aren’t sure how they’ll look in your journal. For example, if you just bought a new pack of colored pencils, scribble them on the page so you can see how bright the colors are."

      "content": "Create a spread based on your travels. Some people use their art journal as a type of travel journal that documents all their adventures. If you’ve recently traveled somewhere new, draw or paint the landscape, a popular tourist attraction, or items that remind you of that place. If you have photos, travel tickets, or receipts from your visit, glue those in, as well.

      "content": "Make a piece of abstract art. Creating an abstract painting or drawing is a great way to get inspired, as you can do whatever you want without trying to recreate something specific. Play around with shapes and colors, and don’t worry about getting messy. Schweiger says, “Abstract art is really about creating your own language. It’s asking yourself ‘What is it that I’m wanting to say? What is it that I feel? What is it that I’m wanting to communicate?’ It’s a lot of experimentation, a lot of exploration, and it’s really about trusting one’s own intuition about what they want to say and how they want to say it.”"

      "content": "Illustrate your favorite song lyrics. Think about your favorite song and how you can interpret it visually. Whether you paint, draw, or collage, create an art journal spread based on the song’s lyrics and how they make you feel. If you want, write down the lyrics that inspired you, or leave them out so the piece is up to interpretation. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Try a writing prompt.",
      "content": "Try a writing prompt. While some people prefer to focus solely on visual art in their art journals, adding journal entries or words can often add an extra layer to your spreads and make them more visually interesting. Additionally, writing in a journal is a great way to express your feelings. Here are a few writing prompts to try out: [14] X Research source Paint your favorite quote. Make a gratitude list —write down at least 5 things you’re grateful for this week. Create a dictionary of your feelings—choose a word that describes how you’re feeling and write down the definition. Then, paint and decorate around it. Record something meaningful about your day. Do a brain dump—write down whatever comes to mind, stream-of-consciousness style. Make a dream journal by writing down whatever you dreamed the night before. Include positive affirmations or manifestations . Write down ideas for future art journal spreads or other personal projects. Make a list—a grocery list, a bucket list , a list of your favorite things, etc."

      "content": "Pens, pencils, and markers Pens, pencils, and markers are great art journaling supplies for beginners. You can use them for almost anything, including writing, doodling, sketching, outlining, and tracing. While you can use any pens and markers you like, try to find ones that are waterproof and don’t smudge. [15] X Research source Recommendations: Unipin fineliners , Faber Castell pitt pens , Posca paint pens If you plan on doing a lot of drawing, Schweiger recommends a blending stump : “Instead of blending the colors with our fingers, we can use a blending stump. The best way to use it is to very gently press your blending stump onto your paper and [move it] in a very gentle circular motion. It will smooth out the pencil and blend it to be a smoother consistency.”"

      "title": "Watercolors",
      "content": "Watercolors Watercolor paint is great if you want to create light, airy paintings, as it is transparent and allows you to easily create different layers. Professional watercolor sets can be pretty expensive, so if you’re just starting out, it may be best to choose student-grade, which is more affordable but not as high-quality.
