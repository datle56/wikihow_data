Your iPhone's Bluetooth address is a device-specific string of numbers and letters that lets other Bluetooth devices know where and how to send and receive information. For example, you can have both a Bluetooth keyboard and a Bluetooth mouse connected to a Mac at the same time, and the Mac will know which information it is receiving from which device based on their individual addresses."
