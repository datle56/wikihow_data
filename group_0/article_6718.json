TikTok takes your language settings into account when displaying clips on your For You page. This means that if you add the language of a certain region, you'll see videos made by people from that region. This isn't foolproof, as many languages are spoken in multiple regions. For example, if you're hoping to see more Chilean content, setting your language to Spanish would also include TikToks from Spain and Puerto Rico. This will not help if TikTok is banned in your region. In that case, you'll need to use a VPN."
