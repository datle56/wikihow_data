[3] X Research source There are many online resources that will help you calculate possible area codes for each US ZIP code. US mobile phones may be assigned to any area code. Usually a mobile phone's area code indicates the area in which service was first established. But an individual can keep the same cell phone number, including area code, when they relocate, so the cell phone's area code doesn't always match the geographical location of the user. If the 3-digit prefix is 800, 877, 866 or 888, this indicates that you're calling a toll-free number. The phone receiving a toll-free call could be anywhere in the country, or the call could even be routed to a call center in another country."
