      "title": "Start with exploration.",
      "content": "Start with exploration. You might go to a large evangelical meeting in a stadium or a small group Bible study. The size does not matter for where the Spirit of God is presented/manifested: there you'll find the love, joy and peace of God that can satisfy the seeker's soul. Seek first the will of God and all His provisions can freely be yours on your life's path and at The Judgment. If one place does not have really receptive and welcoming followers of Jesus, you need to find a happier group of believers at another meeting place. Try different Christian meetings, churches in your area, and see how you feel."

      "title": "Get a Bible and begin to read it.",
      "content": "Get a Bible and begin to read it. A Bible is a universal book you can find in many places. A Bible contains both the \"Old Testament,\" Jewish/Hebrew books or law, foretelling of Jesus, and of prophetic scriptures -- and the \"New Testament,\" Christian scriptures together. [1] X Research source \"The New Testament\" is what you'll want to read to understand Jesus Christ and Christianity. Its first four books are a day-by-day report in the actual words and teachings of Jesus (the books of \"Matthew\", \"Mark\", \"Luke\" and \"John\", written by those four of his disciples) depicting the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and presenting great teachings by Him and several other of his disciples, especially of St. Paul, who explained the essentials of Christianity in great detail. You will learn about love, hope, salvation by grace through faith, and doing good works appointed to you, but realizing that works do not buy grace which is free (a gift of God), and forgiving the wrongs of others, helping the needy/least of God's children, and much more. As you read, there may be times when you become unsure or confused. If so, you can ask believers about scriptures, including teachers, priests, pastors, and search the Bible online or in Christian books. Just keep in mind that some teachings differ among different denominations, so at times, you may receive differing \"answers\" to your questions. Keep in mind that Satan is the author of confusion, but God is the author of mercy, grace and peace (choose God's way of grace). God's grace is beyond understanding, but it is all sufficient. The most popular English Bible for Protestants for over 400 years has been the King James Bible. Does that translation sound like Elizabethan/Shakespearean English, well that's simply that the early, modern English \"thee, thou, thy, thine, hence, thence, whence, comets, ghost, etc.\" are from that time period. It is important to consider that English speaking Roman Catholics use the Douay-Rheims Bible (with Apocrypha), also from about 1600. [2] X Research source Whereas, Protestants use Bibles with only 66 books (omitting the Apocrypha by excluding several Jewish writings, of chapters and books of obscure origins such as Esdras and Maccabees, etc.).

      "title": "Be willing to accept the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart.",
      "content": "Be willing to accept the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart. Converting to Christianity is based on your belief that Jesus is God's only begotten Son, and that He does all manner of miracles including Salvation. Christianity starts with being saved, trusting Christ to save you, and then entails living a good and godly life that is pleasing to God. Both are important."

      "title": "\"Be saved by believing the Christian gospel (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).",
      "content": "\"Be saved by believing the Christian gospel (1 Corinthians 15:3-4). This means that you believe that Jesus died for your sins and rose again. Since he paid for your sins you can be forgiven, and because he rose again He has power to give you eternal life. Believing this message you respond, \"Lord Jesus, I believe you died for my sins and rose again, so now please save me, a sinner.\" That saves you and begins your Christian life. Continue to believe. A key passage describing salvation is Romans 10:9-10, \"That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved. For with the heart (core being) man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\" Such belief is called faith and leads to God freely giving you the gift of salvation by grace through faith not by work or great deeds. Romans 10:9-10\""

Be sure that your relationship with Jesus is not based on formalities, such as baptizing but is based on your personal belief in Him, following Him (and His teachings). Yes, be baptized by another believer, if you can, but the most important baptism for a Christian is his spiritual baptism into Christ Jesus (Galatians 3:27)."

      "title": "When you receive the Holy Spirit (officially become a Christian), do anything you can to strengthen your faith and belief in Jesus.",
      "content": "When you receive the Holy Spirit (officially become a Christian), do anything you can to strengthen your faith and belief in Jesus. Christianity is about God's love, so start showing His love that you received freely, to others such as being willing to forgive everyone and anyone who has wronged you. Jesus said, \"You have heard, 'Love your neighbor', but I say to you, 'Love your enemy, and do good to those who hate you and spitefully use you.' \". We may try to fail miserably -- but God's supply of grace is sufficient, in His boundless mercy, as the grace of God is the power of God unto salvation, not by work, lest any boast . How can anyone afford to reject such great salvation, so rich, and yet so free. Do good deeds because you believe in God and are a Christian. \"This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that you affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. \" Titus 3:8; \"That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\" 2 Timothy 3:17. Jesus Christ has said, \"And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\" Revelation 22:12. Fulfill Jesus' commission (Matthew 10:7-8) by going out and preaching the Gospel and healing the sick."

      "content": "Take the time to learn the teachings and practices of the churches you choose to visit and feel free to ask questions. A good way to examine beliefs of a church is to read the particular church's Statement of Faith, a list of basic beliefs and compare it to others. There are many Christian denominations, including Anglican, Assembly of God (and other Pentecostal denominations), Baptist, Christian (denomination), Churches of Christ, Episcopal, Lutheran, Methodist, Orthodox (Eastern, Greek, Russian), Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, and United Church of Christ. There are other Protestant groups, with some called \"nondenominational\", \"not affiliated with (____)\" or \"independent (____)\" churches of one kind or another. [5] X Research source Although all Christians share belief in Jesus Christ, each denomination has its own unique emphases on certain teachings, traditions, customs, and beliefs. Different groups form consensus on understandings of different doctrines about The Sacraments, The Triune God (versus Arian Belief concerning God), pastor, order of services, offices of bishop, presbyter, deacon, and such, marriage, healing, prophesies, praying to saints, speaking unknown tongues, formalities, rituals, written prayers, or informality, pray as the Spirit of God gives utterance, etc. It is wise to research organizations very carefully and thoroughly before you get involved with them too deeply. Some people have had negative experiences because they rushed into a group too quickly before finding out all about it. Don't let yourself be rushed into a commitment to a group until you feel comfortable. Beware falling under the sway of religious cult leaders who won't respect your right to make your own decisions or who try to control your life in a manipulative manner."

Many churches have somewhat different confessions of faith and/or catechisms that are based upon their own interpretation of the Christian creeds, Holy Ordinances, system of church organization, and other matters. See, for example, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the Lutheran Formula of Concord, the Westminster Confession, the Anglican 39 Articles, the 1689 Baptist Confession, the 1919 Doctrinal Statement of the World Conference on Christian Fundamentals, and others. The Lutheran Service Book has the following text: [7] X Research source I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth. And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into Hell. On the third day He rose again from the dead. He ascended into Heaven and sits at the right and of God the Father Almighty. From thence He will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit the holy Christian Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen."
