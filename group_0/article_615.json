The FrameworkSetup file will contain the necessary framework for your mods - a folder named Overrides, a folder named Packages, and a file named \"Resource.cfg\". The Packages folder will already have two files in it (\"nobuildsparkles.package\" and \"nointro.package\") so you'll be able to check if your mods will work. If you start up your game and get no intro animation, nor any sparkles when placing walls or fences, everything is working. The \"Resource.cfg\" file may trigger some antivirus software programs. This is because it's a \".cfg\" file, not because it's malware. The file is safe and necessary to install mods on The Sims 3. Very old versions of The Sims 3 (prior to the release of World Adventures and its patch) would have mods and content in the Program Files directory.
