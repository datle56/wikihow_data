      "title": "Agree to disagree.",
      "content": "Agree to disagree. The best part about making friends is understanding each other. If your friend is communist and you uphold a different ideology, you can still get along very well. Politics will be one area where you won't meet eye to eye. Understand that you don't have to agree with your friend to get along."

      "title": "Show respect.",
      "content": "Show respect. If someone doesn't share the same beliefs as you do, they don't deserve to be criticized or scrutinized. Set aside their beliefs and treat them based on the respect you feel they deserve. Friendships should be void of harsh treatment of one another. Respect can focus on things such as hard work, treatment of others, their abilities, and characteristics."

      "content": "Focus on the better aspects of your friendship and find common ground. Arguing about communism is not going to create a strong bond. People offer other interests aside from politics. Figure out what drew you to that person in the first place, such as school, sports, or work. The best friendships are well-rounded."

      "content": "Ask your friend about her or his beliefs. Learning from one another is essential to any relationship, and friends should have much to offer. Inquire about your friend's Communist beliefs. Ask open-ended questions that start with what or how , and let yourself refrain from any interruptions or judgement. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn about communism.",
      "content": "Learn about communism. Communism is a theory, and when you focus on the errors of those who falsely practised that theory, you prevent yourself from learning. Read some easy fundamental Works like \"The Communist Manifesto\" and \"Value, Price and Profit\" by Marx, but also some good Texts that show the humanistic and libertarian core of communism, like Oscar Wilde's \"The Soul of Man under Socialism\". Read some good introductions, like Bini Admczak's \"Communism for Kids\", Michael Heinrich's or David Harvey's introductions to \"The Capital\" or Etienne Balibar's \"The Philosophy of Marx\". Be careful with the sources you seek; propaganda and biased journalism exists to create fear and hate at times. [2] X Research source"

Most countries that have attempted to execute a communist economy have resembled more of a dictatorship or a tyranny.

      "title": "Consider the Marxist theory.",
      "content": "Consider the Marxist theory. This theory states that all governments in human history have been a class dictatorship, meaning that the state is under the command of the interests of one social class. This is why communists refer to capitalism as the \"dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (capitalists)\" and refer to socialism as the \"dictatorship of the proletariat (workers). Modern communists refer - in accordance with the intention of Marx - to capitalism as the dictatorship of capital, i.e. of a blind and automatical-moving power that was created by men but is now out of control. States are than not simply under the command of the interests of capitalists, but have to respect the rules of capitalism to fulfill their tasks. On the other side, \"dictatorship of the workers\" means the end of \"dictatorship\" itself and the end of classes. Marx described communism as the \"free association\" of free individuals, in which the free development of each one is the condition for the free development of all. Also against a work-fixation of traditional communists, Marx saw in communism the wind of work as a heavy and alienating task, the end of the \"kingdom of necessity\" and the begin of the \"kingdom of freedom\"."

You might be interested to see that communism can be made up of several differentiating political parties similar to what the United States has. Also, communism shares a lot of views that are not necessarily political; communism cares about the environment in a similar way the USA and other countries do. [4] X Research source ."

      "content": "Listen with interest and reply without sarcasm. A discussion can turn in to an argument quickly, and the best way to avoid that is by listening like a good parent or student. Listening to someone does not mean you are submitting to their beliefs. Also, when you reply, speak kindly and intelligently. We enjoy a lot of political analysts who use sharp and sarcastic delivery in both monologues and dialogues. However, all that is done for entertainment. In the real world, sarcasm is not received well by all and is taken offensively by a lot people. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Leave out harsh judgments. Your friend doesn't hold communist beliefs just to anger you. If you start feeling angry during a conversation with your friend, ask yourself where the anger is coming from. It might not actually have its source in your friend's beliefs. Distinguishing your vulnerability before hand can help you avoid certain specific topics. If ever you feel the discussion may have triggered you, be kind enough to ask to change the subject."

If you enter discussions with hopes of manipulating the conversation and influencing your friend's beliefs, then nothing well will come out of it. Ignore any thoughts of changing how your friend views the world. Even if you are passionate about the subject, that doesn't give you the right to impose upon your friend. [7] X Research source"

When your friend is discussing a point, don't interrupt. Give the person time, and don't counter-argue by repeatedly stating but, but, but ; using that word immediately negates what was just said, like it didn't even matter. If you wish to get along, you should treat each other's ideas as though they do matter. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Admit when you are wrong. If discussions lead to arguments all the time, then something must be changed, and someone must be wrong. If the discussions lead to an argument that you keep bringing up over and over again, chances are you can be wrong for trying to manipulate the discussion. Try to refrain from confusing facts for opinions. Facts should speak for themselves--whether you like believing them or not. Opinions are arguable, so when you feel the discussion is getting very opinion-heavy, refrain from being stubborn on a certain point. Admitting you're wrong is fine around friends. If you feel admitting you are wrong is some kind of defeat or concession to your friend's beliefs, then reevaluate why you have discussions with your friend. [9] X Research source"
