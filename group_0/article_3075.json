This means no more insulting yourself when you look in the mirror, setting harsh dieting rules, or beating yourself up when you make a mistake.

It's usually good to wear something you can move around in. You don't need to wear makeup. If you decide to try it, start small and work your way up as desired. Wear clothes that make you feel happy. Whether you love lace, rainbows, overalls, or poofy skirts, you should choose clothes that work for you. Skimpy outfits can move around when you wear them, and it's no fun to be constantly monitoring your neckline or hem. Wear clothes that are comfortable to wear and carry so that you can have fun without worrying about whether your clothes are in place."

Surround yourself with media that celebrates your values, and the type of person you want to be. Look for media that supports your self-esteem, especially in fighting negative stereotypes. A girl who loves robots could watch TV with women in STEM, a girl who uses a wheelchair could read books about people with disabilities, and plus-size girls can look at pictures of stunning women of the same size.

It's okay to feel sad, get a bad grade on a test, or lose your cool every once in a while. Being good does not mean you have to be perfect, and people will understand that. If you feel down, try talking to someone about how you feel. You'll feel better, and they'll be glad they could help. If you make a big mistake, talk about it. Apologize to anyone you hurt, and ask how you can make up for it. The mistake is less important than how you handle it."

[2] X Research source Parents aren't perfect, and sometimes they give bad advice and make bad decisions. Hear them out, and then explain your point of view as calmly as you can. Work together to figure out a good approach. Don't accept a bad situation. Most parents are good (or at least decent), but some are mean or abusive. If things are bad at home, talk to another adult you trust. Try a teacher, school counselor, parent of a friend, clergy member, relative, or other adult who is a good listener.

Help out your parents and anyone you see who could use a hand. Offer to babysit for your neighbor's young children when they go out at night. Teens can traditionally make good money this way. Try yard work like mowing your lawn, taking care of the plants, and weeding. Try your hand at basic engineering tasks, such as auto repair, changing a flat tire , and fixing a leaky tap . Girls are better at engineering than most people realize! Some parents are willing to set up an allowance in exchange for chores, or pay you for doing chores (e.g. $10 for mowing the lawn)."

Don't feel obligated if you don't have the energy. To keep your room clean, try to get rid of all the clutter first.
