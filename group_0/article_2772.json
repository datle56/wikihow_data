Pretending to be something you're not takes up all your resources you could be using on doing what you actually enjoy and could get excited about. [1] X Research source Life coach Sandra Possing notes, “So many of us are kind of confined [by]...who we think we should be based on…society's expectations, fears, parents, all of that…[we've] never really given [our]selves permission to just be curious and to be honest.” [2] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. It's only when you're naturally you that you can find what drives you and grab a firm hold. Then you can work on being enthusiastic."

      "content": "Figure out why you're lacking enthusiasm. Maybe someone around you is giving you a hard time about your lack of energy. Maybe your job or love life isn’t going how you wish. Or maybe you’re just feeling generally low, with no apparent cause. It's natural to get stuck in a rut. These things happen. They also end at some point. But mental health conditions, like clinical depression, could also make it very hard to feel motivated or inspired.

They can help you unpack your lack of enthusiasm and find ways to manage your mental health."

      "title": "Start thinking positively.",
      "content": "Start thinking positively. Worrying or assuming things won’t pan out how we hope can leave us feeling negative and unmotivated to even try. Reframing your mindset to be more hopeful can help you feel more enthusiastic and excited. [4] X Research source Positive thinking doesn’t mean ignoring bad situations—it just means approaching them with a more productive and less dire attitude. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Practice positive self-talk. Periodically, throughout the day, pause and check your thinking: is it mostly negative or mostly positive? If it's mostly negative, try to spin your thoughts to be more positive. Possing also recommends counteracting negativity with what she calls “positivity brainwashing”: “I do my best to consume as much positive content as possible…to basically counteract the amount of negative content that's always coming at us from all directions.” [6] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020."

      "content": "Define your goals and how you'll achieve them. It's hard to be enthusiastic when we're floundering about life without purpose. [7] X Research source What are your dreams? What steps do you need to take to fulfill them? [8] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. If you’re not sure what you’re passionate about, Possing says that the answer lies in “creating a little bit of space to tap into a childlike wonder and curiosity. Putting pressure on yourself to go find your passion doesn't necessarily feel fun, and then that can flow down and halt the process.” [9] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. Knowing exactly what you want to do and exactly how you want to go about it will make it easier to be enthusiastic about it. For instance, if you want to lose weight, don't just plan to \"lose weight\"—plan to eat more vegetables and fruits and to work out a few times a week."

      "content": "Convince yourself. It's all well and good to have goals, but you gotta actually believe that you can achieve them. If your goal is too lofty, bring it down a notch, until you can readily believe that it's something you can make happen. [10] X Research source If your goal feels too big and overwhelming, it may also help to start on a slightly smaller scale. For instance, want to start your own business but don't know a thing about how to do so? Make goals of taking business courses and networking. Smaller things are totally doable and totally useful."

      "title": "Get over your fear of failure.",
      "content": "Get over your fear of failure. Often when we're not enthusiastic, it's because we've made up some excuse as to why not to be: maybe we don't want to get our hopes up, we're too unsure, or we're worried others will judge us. [11] X Research source If you can put these worries aside, you can become more enthusiastic, confident, and hopeful. Possing notes that many people “want to have the perfect plan and they want to have it all figured out…before they go do anything. So I love to challenge them to…just take imperfect action…. Just getting into action creates some energy.” [12] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. Realize that your desire to be enthusiastic is there—it's just buried under a pile of worry and fear. When we grow up, often adults call that \"reason.\" We had enthusiasm when we were children; it's time to get it back!"

Do it as much as you can. Give your life that spark it needs to generate enthusiasm. [13] X Research source It does not matter what it is. Whether it's building model airplanes, karate, or German karaoke, do it. Make time for it. Rearrange your schedule. Sacrifice other obligations. Make it a part of your routine."

If you want to work on your positivity and enthusiasm, surround yourself with positive, enthusiastic people. [14] X Research source The first step is to end your toxic friendships . If you think about it, you'll probably have a good idea of who you need to cut ties with. Once the negativity is expunged, think of 3 people that truly make you feel downright good .
