      "title": "A good, effective presenter knows who they’re talking to.",
      "content": "A good, effective presenter knows who they’re talking to. Are you talking to a class filled with bored teens, or a seasoned panel of experts? By knowing exactly who you’re talking to, you can tailor your presentation specifically to your audience, making it more dynamic and memorable. For example, if you’re presenting at a microbiology conference, you won’t have to define any scientific terms that are well-known in the field. If you’re speaking to a less-informed audience, it might help to sprinkle some extra definitions into your presentation. If you were pitching to a group of investors, you’d want to provide some background information about yourself and your company."

      "title": "Your presentation can only be as good as your research.",
      "content": "Your presentation can only be as good as your research. Pretend you’re sitting in the audience—how would you feel if someone’s presentation skipped over important points or seemed to be missing valuable chunks of information? Chances are, you wouldn’t take it too seriously. Really knowing your stuff helps make your presentation as clear, direct, interesting, and understandable as possible. Doing your research is especially important if there’ll be a Q&A session at the end of your presentation."

      "title": "A story-style presentation is more likely to stick with audience members.",
      "content": "A story-style presentation is more likely to stick with audience members. When you just spout off information, the average audience member will collect the info in their frontal lobe, which fills up pretty quickly. Turning your presentation into a story allows the audience to use their brain’s memory and emotion centers to process the information, which boosts their chances of remembering it later on. [1] X Research source Here’s an example: if you were giving a presentation about breast cancer prevention, you could start off with a story about a woman’s trip to the doctor’s office rather than rattling off a bunch of statistics. You might describe a day in the life of a low-income household instead of jumping into a lot of economical terms and poverty statistics."

      "content": "This is a great way to connect with your audience. Whether you’re in class, at a business meeting, or at a conference, your audience will want to know what to expect. Asking a question will connect you with your audience right from the get-go, and help them feel like they’re a part of your presentation. [2] X Research source Try tailoring your opening question to your presentation topic. For instance, if you’re discussing the importance of charity and giving back to the community, your opening question could be “What would you do with a million dollars?”"

      "content": "A good slideshow needs to be brief and well-balanced between text and visuals. Believe it or not, short presentations are much more professional than longer ones; in fact, consulting professionals suggest condensing 20 slides of a Powerpoint to just 2 slides. Pairing the text on your slides with a dynamic image is another great way to make the most out of your slideshow presentation. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Here are a few other rules of thumb to keep in mind: The 5/5/5 Rule: Limit each slide to 5 lines of text, capping each line off at 5 words. Also, don’t have more than 5 text-filled slides after one another. Choose fonts that are simple, sleek, and easy to read. Extravagant fonts may look fun, but they’re a pain for audience members to read. Contrast your slide background and text color so audience members have an easy time reading what’s on the screen. Keep your transitions as simple as possible—big loops, fly-ins, and other fancy animations won’t add anything to your presentation. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Notecards can provide useful reminders during the presentation. They’re not meant to be a replacement for good practice and memorization, but you can use them to keep you on track. Jot down only the most important parts of your presentation, so you aren’t relying on your cards as a script. [5] X Research source Always write in big, easy-to-read letters. You don’t want to be squinting at your notecards during the presentation!"

      "content": "“Um”, “so”, “uh”, “like”, and “you know” are some common filler offenders. While these words feel helpful in the moment, they don’t do anything to boost your credibility. Instead, use that blank moment to just pause and recenter your thoughts. [9] X Research source You can try practicing pausing in your regular conversations, too! Chances are, you probably sprinkle in a few ums and uhs when talking with friends and family. Try recording yourself the next time you practice your presentation. Then, listen back and see how many times you use filler words.
