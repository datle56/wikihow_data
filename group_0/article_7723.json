      "content": "Pour baking soda, white vinegar, and hot water down the drain. This is the easiest method for cleaning drains, as it eliminates mild clogs and odors caused by the buildup of bacteria, grease, and organic residue. Pour ½ a cup (118 ml) of baking soda down your drain, followed by ½ a cup (118 ml) of white vinegar. Cover or plug the drain immediately and let the mixture sit for about 15 minutes. Boil some water in a kettle or saucepan, then pour the boiling water down the drain to clear it. You may need to repeat the process a couple of times to completely clear out any blockages. [1] X Research source If your drain is really clogged, pour boiling water down it before and after the baking soda and vinegar. This will help loosen any buildup. Some also recommend adding ½ a cup (150 g) of salt to the baking soda. If your drain isn’t clogged and you just want to get rid of the smell, it may be enough to pour the baking soda and vinegar down it, then simply rinse it out with hot water from the tap. A solution of baking soda and vinegar can also clean stains and mineral deposits around the outside of your drain. [2] X Research source Alternative: Pour a generous amount of dish soap down the drain, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then flush with boiling water. This may not be as effective, however."

      "content": "Use a commercial biological or enzymatic cleaner as an alternative. Enzymatic cleaners can keep your drains smelling nice, get rid of potentially harmful bacteria and mold, and prevent future clogs. Biological or enzymatic drain cleaners , like Zep , are relatively safe and environmentally friendly. They’re also safer for your septic system than most chemical cleaners. Follow the instructions on your cleaner’s package to properly treat your drain and eliminate odors and buildup. [3] X Research source Cleaning expert Bridgett Price recommends an orange-based cleaner to make your drain smell good: “We typically have a snake tool that we use to gather any hair or anything that’s in the sink. From that point, we use hot running water, and then we will have some type of orange-based product that we pour down the sink. It creates a nice scent that permeates throughout the bathroom.” Most plumbers do not recommend using chemical cleaners as they can be harmful if misused and may cause property damage, which is why enzymatic cleaners are preferred. If you must use a chemical cleaner , follow all instructions on the package exactly. If this is your only option, however, it’s probably better to call a plumber."

      "content": "Scour garbage disposals with ice, salt, and lemon peels. If your garbage disposal runs well but smells bad, organic residue and bacteria have likely begun to build up on the grinders. To clean it , fill the disposal with a few cups of ice cubes, a handful of coarse salt, and a few lemon peels. Turn the disposal on and grind the mixture for a bit to scour out buildup. This mixture is an “abrasive” that will not hurt its steel grinders. [4] X Research source As an alternative, turn on the hot water and pour a few drops of dish soap down the drain. Turn the disposal on and run it and the water simultaneously for three minutes. When time is up, turn both off, then dump a cup of ice cubes down the disposal. When the sound of crushing ice subsides, run the hot water again for about 30 seconds, then turn the disposal off."

      "content": "Use a plunger to clear a clog. Plumber David Balkan recommends “the good old plunger ” for unclogging drains, especially if they have standing water. Plungers are great for unclogging toilets , but they also work well on clogged sinks and tubs. Fill the sink or tub with enough water to cover the drain. Press the plunger firmly down over the drain to create a tight seal and give it several quick pumps. [5] X Research source Bellows-style plungers may work best. If you have a double-bowl sink, you may need to close one of the drains with a plug or a washcloth before plunging in order to create a complete seal. Balkan warns, “You never want to put in a chemical drain cleaner and then use a plunger because that will splatter, and commercial chemical drain cleaners can burn.” If you know your drain is clogged, unclog it before cleaning it so you don’t have to clean twice."

Barbed drain cleaners , like the Zip-It Bath and Sink Hair Snare , are a great solution for clogs near the drain opening. Just slide the tool into the drain and pull it out. The back-angled barbs will pull out hair and other materials that have built up in your drain. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a gas- or water-powered cleaner to blow out stubborn clogs. Aerosol drain cleaners can blast clogs out of a drain with compressed air or gas, while water bladders use pressurized water to accomplish the same result. [7] X Research source Follow your cleaner’s instructions to use it properly. If you choose a gas-powered drain cleaner, make sure the device fits over your drain properly. It may be necessary to use an adapter. If you don’t create a good seal, the blast could be directed back at you instead of into the drain. Water-based drain cleaning devices typically attach to a garden hose, but you may be able to get an adapter that will allow you to attach it to an indoor faucet."

      "content": "Treat buildup with an enzymatic cleaner. Treat slow or partially clogged drains by pouring an enzymatic or bacterial drain cleaner down it and letting it sit overnight. Follow the directions on the package to make sure you use the cleaner correctly. Biological cleaners may require repeated treatments to be effective. [9] X Research source Biological cleaners are slower to work and less effective than chemical cleaners, but they are safer for you, your plumbing, and the environment."

      "title": "Clean deep clogs with a plumber’s snake.",
      "content": "Clean deep clogs with a plumber’s snake. Augers, or plumber’s snakes , are great for clearing deep clogs that can’t be reached by other means. If necessary, remove the trap under the sink, then slowly push the snake into the pipe opening. Once it’s in a few inches, crank the handle while pushing the coil firmly into the pipe. When you meet resistance, wiggle the snake gently to loosen the blockage, then turn the crank the other way to pull the snake and the clog out. [10] X Research source Wear protective goggles and rubber gloves with a good gripping surface . Buy or rent a cable auger from a hardware store. A 25-foot (7.5 m) cable should be plenty for most household needs. The “trap” is a j-shaped pipe under your sink. Some can be removed by hand but others require a wrench or channel lock pliers. Use a bucket to catch any water that drains from the pipe after you remove it. Once you’ve removed the blockage, run a little water in your sink or tub to see if it drains properly. If not, try running the auger through your pipes a second time, and repeat as necessary until your drain is clear. If you haven’t used a drain snake before, Balkan stresses that you should call a professional: “In the hands of the unskilled, people take a snake and they puncture a trap, or they go through a drain line and they need a repair. They don’t know how to properly handle it.”"

      "content": "Perform maintenance cleaning on drains and stoppers. Pour a few gallons of boiling water down sink drains once a week as part of your regular cleaning routine. Clean your sink stoppers regularly, as well, as they often accumulate grime, hair, and other particles that can cause clogs. [14] X Research source Cleaning expert Chris Willatt emphasizes that you should clean the rubber gasket on your kitchen drain: “That thing gets pretty dirty. You can [clean it] when you’re washing dishes. Just put some soap on the scrubby part of your sponge and get in there. Take the rubber part out and throw it in the dishwasher, then scrub around it.”"
