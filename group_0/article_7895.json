      "content": "Add 8 tbsp (120 g) of baking soda to a large mixing bowl. No, this won’t seem like much baking soda for such a big bowl. However, once you add the vinegar, the mixture will foam up like a school science fair volcano! [2] X Research source You can use less baking soda for a smaller job, or more for a bigger one. Once mixed, this amount should be enough to cover around 1 sq ft (930 cm 2 ). The important thing is to mix the baking soda and vinegar in a 2:1 ratio (that is, twice as much baking soda as vinegar). This method eventually involves vigorous scrubbing with a gritty paste, which may damage softer materials like wallboard or finished wood. Use this option only for harder materials like tile or masonry."

      "content": "Pour in 4 tbsp (60 ml) of white vinegar and let it foam up. The foaming action isn’t particularly useful in getting rid of mold, but it is fun to watch! Wait until the foaming slows down before beginning to stir the mixture—that way it will be less likely to foam over the edges of the bowl. [3] X Research source If you’re curious about the science behind the foaming, here it is: a pair of reactions actually take place when you combine baking soda and vinegar . The first is an acid-base reaction between the hydrogen in the vinegar and the sodium and bicarbonate in the baking soda. The second is a decomposition reaction, as the carbonic acid created by the first reaction breaks down into water and carbon dioxide. [4] X Research source"

Cover all visible areas of mold with as much of the paste as will stick to it—probably around a 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) thick layer. Mix up more of the paste if needed. Once the mold is covered, let the paste dry on the mold. [6] X Research source Wear protective gear whenever you’re contacting or disturbing the mold in any way."

You have multiple safe disposal options for the mixture of dried paste and removed mold: [8] X Research source Put a plastic drop cloth beneath your work area to catch the debris. When you’re done, ball it up carefully, seal it in a thick trash bag with tape, and put it outdoors for trash collection. Suck up the debris with a vacuum cleaner that has a HEPA filter. If it’s a bagless vacuum, empty the canister into a trash bag outdoors, then clean the inside of the canister by misting it with white vinegar and wiping it. If the moldy item is portable, clean it outside, well away from your home or other structures, and don’t worry about the debris."

Apply a light mist of vinegar to the surface you just cleaned and allow it to dry without wiping it. You don’t need to soak the surface—a light mist is all you need to help prevent mold! [11] X Research source If the moldy area is in your shower stall, for example, misting on some vinegar after each shower will help prevent future molding. If the mold is due to a moisture issue like a leaky pipe or poorly-sealed window, however, it’s important to treat the root cause of the mold."

Fill a clean, empty spray bottle with white vinegar, then put on your protective gear: dishwashing gloves, protective goggles, and an N-95 (or equivalent) mask. Spray the vinegar directly onto the mold until it and the immediate surrounding area are visibly damp. You don’t need to completely saturate the area, but spray on more than just a light misting. [13] X Research source The potent scent of vinegar will go away fairly quickly, but you can improve the scent by adding a few drops of your favorite essential oil if you wish.

The vinegar you sprayed onto the mold will visibly dry within a few minutes, and you can proceed at this point if you’re in a big hurry. However, you’ll get better mold-killing action if you wait the full hour. Near the end of the hour, add 2 c (500 ml) of warm water and 1 tsp (5 g) of baking soda to a second clean, empty spray bottle. Shake the bottle vigorously to combine the mixture.

Pour warm water and white vinegar into a clean, large bowl or bucket, then submerge the moldy clothing item completely into the liquid. Leave it for at least 8-12 hours, then pull out the item and rinse it under warm water. Keep repeating the process as needed until the mold stain fades substantially (it probably won’t completely disappear until you launder the item). [19] X Research source Don’t use this method on clothes that are too delicate to put in the washing machine or are labeled “dry clean only.” Call dry cleaners in your area and find one that specializes in removing mold from clothing. They may ask you to bag up and seal the moldy clothing before bringing it in."

If there’s still a stain, try repeating the entire process again. Otherwise, press down on the fabric with a wad of paper towels to blot up any remaining dampness. [23] X Research source If the mold stain is still there after multiple rounds of cleaning, contact a professional cleaner. Take the vacuum outdoors and bag up and discard the vacuum bag. If it’s a bagless model, empty the canister outdoors, spritz the interior of the canister with the vinegar and water solution in your spray bottle, and let it air dry."
