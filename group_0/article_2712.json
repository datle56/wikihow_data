      "content": "Stick to a crowd when possible. If you’re at school or a social event, try to stand near other people. If everyone else is in a group and you’re standing alone, you risk sticking out. To be invisible, hang out at the edge of a group of people. For example, when you’re walking to class try walking a few steps between a few other people. They probably won’t even notice you, but you’ll blend into the group ."

      "content": "Avoid making eye contact. Eye contact might cause someone to start a conversation with you. If you’re looking to avoid interaction, try not to catch anyone’s eye. You can still look around, but try to train your gaze just above or just below most people’s eye level. You can also glance down at your phone to appear busy. Try not to just stare at the ground or a wall. That might draw unwanted attention."

      "content": "Wear a classic outfit in neutral colors. When you’re trying to blend in, don’t wear flashy or trendy clothes. Instead, choose an outfit in muted tones, like black, grey, navy, or tan. A pair of jeans with a white shirt is also usually a safe bet. While you might want to hide behind a big hat or sunglasses, wearing either of those indoors might actually cause people to notice you."

      "content": "Spend time with close friends. It’s okay if you’re shy or deal with social anxiety . A lot of people deal with that and you’re not alone. However, that doesn’t mean that you should completely isolate yourself. That can lead to feelings of loneliness. Plus, being labeled a “loner” can make you stand out even more. [2] X Research source Look for friends that share common interests and spend time with them. For example, maybe you hear some classmates talking about playing video games after school. If that’s what you’re into, ask if you can join them sometime! Make a point to connect with people on a regular basis, even if you prefer to spend most of your time alone. It’s okay to not go to every party or event. But make it a point to try to do something social each week, even if it’s just eating lunch with some other people. [3] X Research source"
