      "content": "Defeat the Elite Four and the Champion. Before you are able to find and capture Kyogre, you'll need to beat the main game by defeating the Elite Four and the Champion. You'll have to defeat all of them in one go, or else you start over, so make sure you're prepared. [1] X Research source Stock up on Hyper Potions. These are the most cost-effective potions in the game. Most Pokémon won't have more than 200 HP, making these just as effective as a Max Potion for much less money. Stock up on Revives as well. You'll want to be able to bring back your key Pokémon between rounds. Make sure your party is Level 56 or higher. Every Pokémon in your main party should be at least Level 56 before you take on the Elite Four. If you have Rayquaza, use it in this battle since it is much higher level than the Elite Four's and Champion's Pokémon. Save after you beat each Elite Four member. This will allow you to reload instead of starting over from the beginning. See How to Beat the Elite Four on Emerald for more details."

      "content": "Level up your Pokémon to at least Level 70. Kyogre is a Level 70 Pokémon, so you'll want a party that can take a beating and keep fighting. Leveling your entire party will take a while, so you can probably focus on just raising a few of your most powerful Pokémon. Rayquaza will be a big help, since it is Level 70 when you catch it. Grass- and Electric-type attacks will help quickly lower Kyogre's health. [2] X Research source You'll need to have a Pokémon that knows Dive in order to access the cave that Kyogre is in."

      "content": "Stock up on Net Balls and Timer Balls. Net Balls are the most effective Poké Balls to use against Water-type Pokémon. Try to have at least 40 of them in your bag. Timer Balls are also very useful, and are more effective than Net Balls after the 30th turn. Make sure to do all of your prep before you go hunting Kyogre, as it won't stay in one place for very long. If you have your Master Ball, you can use it on Kyogre to catch it instantly. You only have one though!"

[4] X Research source If the scientist says that there is a \"drought\" on a certain route, that means that Groudon is active.
