      "content": "Check your tofu for sliminess. Refrigerated tofu is often stored in water, so it’s normal for it to be wet. It shouldn’t, however, feel slimy to the touch. If your tofu feels pretty slimy after you remove it from the package and drain the liquid, it’s probably gone bad. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for discoloration or mold. If your tofu has gone bad, it may appear more yellow, tan, or brownish compared to the creamy white color of fresh tofu. You may even notice visible mold spots, depending on how old the tofu is. If you see any of these changes on your block of tofu, it’s best to throw it away. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "The shelf life of tofu depends on whether it’s been opened, cooked, or frozen. Things like whether or not the tofu is opened, cooked, frozen, or refrigerated all play a role. Here’s a breakdown: Unopened: Unopened tofu that’s been consistently stored in your refrigerator will stay good at least until the “best by” date printed on the package, and it will usually remain fresh for 3-5 days beyond this date. Opened: Once you open a package of tofu, it will typically stay good for about 3-5 days in your fridge. After that, it’s best to throw it out, even if the “best by” date on the package is further in the future. Cooked: Tofu that’s been cooked or added to a dish should stay fresh for about 5-7 days in your fridge if stored in an airtight container. Frozen: Frozen tofu has the longest shelf life. It will usually stay good for about 3-5 months past the printed “best by” date on the package. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Store tofu in its original package in your fridge until you’re ready to use it. When you open a package of tofu, its shelf life shrinks considerably. Because of this, it’s best to leave your tofu in the original package until you’re ready to cook it. It’s also essential to keep your tofu refrigerated at a temperature of 41°F (5° C) or lower to prevent spoilage and bacterial growth. [6] X Research source"

If you opened a package of tofu but didn’t cook all of it, start by placing the leftover tofu in a clean, airtight container, says professional chef Jerran Boyer. Next, pour filtered water into the container until the tofu is submerged, and place the lid on tightly. Store the container in your fridge and use the tofu within 3-5 days."

To do this, open your package of tofu, drain the liquid, and pat it dry . Next, cut the tofu into cubes or slices, then place them in an airtight container or Ziploc bag for 3-5 months. When you’re ready to use your tofu, thaw it in the fridge overnight. [7] X Research source"

If your tofu is unopened and has been consistently refrigerated, it should still be safe to eat it for 3-5 days past the “best by” date printed on the package. If you’ve frozen your tofu, it should be okay to eat for 3-5 months after the date printed on the package.

      "content": "How long can tofu stay out at room temperature? Tofu is susceptible to spoilage when it’s left out at room temperature, so you should aim to keep it refrigerated at all times. If you do leave your tofu out accidentally, it should stay fresh for 1-2 hours, depending on how warm it is in the room. If the tofu is left out longer than two hours, the risk of bacteria growth increases significantly, so the tofu should be thrown away. [9] X Research source ."

      "content": "What is shelf-stable tofu? Some tofu products are “shelf stable,” meaning that they don’t need to be refrigerated. [10] X Research source If you’ve purchased this type of tofu, store it in your pantry according to the instructions on the package. If you’re not sure what type of tofu you have, go by the way it was stored at the grocery store when you bought it. For example, if the tofu was in the refrigerated section at your store, it’s not shelf-stable, so you’ll need to keep it refrigerated at all times. If the tofu was being kept on an unrefrigerated shelf at the grocery store, it’s shelf-stable, meaning it doesn’t require refrigeration. Shelf-stable tofu usually stays good for about 6 months unopened. Once opened, it must be stored in the refrigerator, and you’ll need to use it within 3-4 days. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "What is tofu, and how is it made? Tofu is a plant-based food made from soybeans. It’s produced by coagulating soymilk into curds, then pressing those curds together to form a block. Tofu is rich in protein, B vitamins, calcium, and iron, so it’s a great meat substitute for vegans and vegetarians . [12] X Research source It’s also a staple in Asian cuisines."
