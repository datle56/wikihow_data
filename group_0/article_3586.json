      "content": "Major in physics for your undergraduate work. The first step in becoming a medical physicist is establishing a firm background in physics. There are no undergraduate degrees in medical physics, so most students complete a BS in physics with some life science or medical electives to prepare them for graduate work. Earn your physics degree for an important step towards becoming a medical physicist. [2] X Research source Take courses that involve laboratory and research work as well. You’ll be a stronger candidate for graduate programs if you have hands-on experience like this outside the classroom. If you didn’t major in physics, a bachelor’s degree in engineering or a similar natural science could also qualify you for graduate study in medical physics. Even though there are no undergraduate degrees in medical physics, some schools give recommended tracks to design a course program for students who want to pursue graduate work in medical physics. See if your school offers this service, or find a sample course track online. [3] X Research source If you’re at all unsure on what courses will prepare you for graduate work in medical physics, speak with an adviser at your college."

      "title": "Apply to CAMPEP-accredited Master’s degree programs in medical physics.",
      "content": "Apply to CAMPEP-accredited Master’s degree programs in medical physics. The Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Education Programs (CAMPEP) is responsible for certifying medical physics graduate programs. Explore certified MS programs and find out the admissions requirements for each. Usually, programs require your transcripts, a personal statement, and letters of recommendation. Some may also require an interview. Keep track of each program’s requirements and due dates so you submit all your applications correctly. [4] X Research source Highlight any lab or non-classroom experience you have in your personal statement. Medical physics is a hands-on field, so graduate programs will like to see candidates with hands-on experience. Keep your grades up during college to increase your chances of getting into graduate school. Many graduate programs require at least a 3.0 GPA for entry. For a current list of graduate programs offering medical physics degrees, visit http://www.campep.org/campeplstgrad.asp ."

      "title": "Complete your MS degree in medical physics.",
      "content": "Complete your MS degree in medical physics. Master’s programs in medical physics require 2 years of full-time study. Starting in the fall, these programs provide a rigorous schedule of classwork and practical lab or internship duties. At the end of the program, you may have to write a master’s thesis or take a comprehensive exam. Work through the program to obtain your MS degree in medical physics. [5] X Research source Always work with your program adviser to design your program so you know the correct courses to take for your degree. Some universities require an internship during the program as well. This provides hands-on training in the field and will help you build experience to find a job. Programs require either a master’s thesis or a comprehensive exam to complete your master’s degree. Some give you a choice, and some require one or the other. Follow your program’s requirements to complete the degree."

      "content": "Pursue a PhD if you want to enter university work. For most jobs in the medical physics field, an MS degree is all you need for entry. But if you want to work at a university, either as a teacher or a researcher, you’ll probably need a PhD. Find CAMPEP-accredited PhD programs, just like you did for your MS, and apply for entry. PhD programs usually require 30 more credits of coursework, a comprehensive examination, and a detailed research project that results in your written dissertation. This could all be 3-5 years or more of work. When you finish, you’ll be qualified to hold university positions in medical physics. [6] X Research source Make sure your career goals require a PhD before making the commitment. You may be able to work with only an MS, meaning you won’t need several more years of schooling. A PhD may also open new career opportunities in industry work as well. The degree isn’t required for entry-level work, but it may qualify you for promotions and pay raises later on. If you feel like your career reached a plateau, a doctorate may open new doors."

This is a knowledge test based on the material in your MS coursework. The ABR accepts applications for the exam in the fall, and tests are administered at a Pearson testing center. Study and pass this test to move on in the certification process. [7] X Research source Pearson testing centers are located throughout the US. Find the one closest to you by visiting https://home.pearsonvue.com/Test-centers.aspx . You have 5 years from the completion of your degree to take and pass this test. For a content guide of what to expect on the first test, visit https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/part-1-exam/content-guide . The part 1 test is not required for getting residencies, but getting a good score on the test could increase your chances of getting the residency of your choice."

These 2-year programs give you practical experience working in a clinical setting. This training prepares you to practice as a medical physicist independently. It also qualifies you to take the next 2 parts of the ABR certification test to become fully certified. [8] X Research source The CAMPEP also accredits residency programs. For CAMPEP-approved residencies, visit https://www.campep.org/campeplstres.asp . Different programs may have different application requirements and timelines. Investigate all the programs you’re interested in and keep track of their different requirements. Residencies are competitive, and most programs only let in 1 or 2 residents per year. Apply to multiple programs to increase your chances of being matched."
