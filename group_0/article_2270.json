      "content": "A pair of scissors or some electric clippers will do the trick. Don’t immediately start shaving with a disposable razor—the thicker clumps of hair may dull your razor blade. Instead, trim your hair down until it’s about 1 to 3 cm (0.39 to 1.18 in) long. [2] X Research source A dull razor can lead to nicks and cuts. Never trim your pubic hair with a dull pair of scissors."

      "content": "Exfoliating removes dead skin cells, resulting in a closer shave. Gently go over your pubic area with an exfoliating sponge, loofah, or washcloth. Don’t use any harsh exfoliating products. Not enough exfoliation to remove excess layers of skin causes ingrown hairs. Daily exfoliation will prevent razor bumps because the hair will never get a chance to regrow towards the skin and become trapped. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source"

      "content": "A sharp razor gives you a smooth, close shave. Pubic hair is really coarse and thick, so it's best to use a fresh, sharp blade each time. [5] X Research source If you can, shave with a disposable razor built with cushions and moisturizing strips, which help protect your skin."

      "content": "Shaving cream helps guard your skin as you're shaving. Special creams and gels create a “barrier” of sorts, which helps protect your skin. Get a cream made for sensitive skin and try to avoid using regular soap, which can leave your skin dry and irritated. Pick up shaving cream or gel from any store that sells razors and other personal grooming tools."
