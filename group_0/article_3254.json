      "content": "Try video games. Some tomboys prefer video games to sports games. Instead of running around outside or on the court, spend your free time gaming. You can play games by yourself or with a group of friends. Ask your parents for permission before trying a new game."

      "content": "Enjoy \"boy\" toys. Tomboys play with a variety of toys. Some prefer motorized toys, like remote control cars, dirt bikes, and drones; others like to play with skateboards and BMX bikes. Also, not all tomboys have to like the same activities.

      "title": "Don't be afraid to get dirty!",
      "content": "Don't be afraid to get dirty! Tomboys are unapologetically active. They don't shy away from rough and tumble activities. While most girls prefer to sit on the sidelines, tomboys don't think twice about getting their shoes muddy on the field or ripping a new pair of jeans while climbing a tree. Be more concerned about having fun than how you look. For example, don't shy away from a game of tag on picture day."

      "content": "Hang out with the guys. Girly-girls and tomboys don't always have a lot in common. When you're at school, you may find that you prefer to spend time with boys. Don't be afraid to spend your recesses racing around the playground with the guys. If you are having fun, that's all that matters! [2] X Research source Instead of going to the mall, spend your Saturday playing video games with the guys. Instead of ballet, ask your parents to sign you up for baseball."

      "title": "Be confident in your decision.",
      "content": "Be confident in your decision. Once you start acting like a tomboy, your family and friends may start to question your decision. When they ask why you're acting like a boy, take the time to explain your choice. While you shouldn't have to explain yourself, it may help them understand you a little better. For example, you could say “I don't want to wear dresses and skirts because it is easier to run and play in pants” or “I don't want to go to the mall because I would rather be outside playing.” [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Compromise with your parents.",
      "content": "Compromise with your parents. While some parents support their daughter's decision, others may not like that their daughter is becoming a tomboy. If your parents are not okay with your decision to become a tomboy, try your best to compromise with them. For example, you could offer to wear a dress to family events, but wear athletic clothing in your daily life. If you feel upset by dresses, try to explain to them that they make you feel bad about yourself. Explain that you like the way you look in your tomboy clothes, and that you aren't yourself in a dress. You might say \"I am who I am. I need you to accept me. I feel bad when I tell you who I am and you tell me I'm not that person.\""

      "content": "Seek support when needed. As you become a tomboy, adults and kids may tease you or question or decision. If your peers are teasing or bullying you, tell a supportive adult immediately. If your teachers do not agree with your decision, speak with your parents, a school administrator, or a school counselor. If adults are pressuring you to \"act\" or \"look\" like a girl, remember that you don't have to conform to their definition of \"girliness.\" You can decide how you want to look and act."
