When these guys make the rounds at a party, they won’t notice those chatting quietly on the sidelines or playing it safe in small circles. They love excitement and energy in all things, so when they’re looking for their next sexual experience, it’ll be the loud, striking people that catch their eyes. Don’t go for subtlety when you’re after an Aries man; show him confidence, and he’ll be hooked. [1] X Research source At a party, find a way to liven up the room.

To men of this sign, there’s nothing more exciting than getting to pursue a crush and “win the game.” Even though he already knows you’re interested too, getting to go after you will be like the best possible foreplay for him.

Impress me with dinner and then we’ll see about a date…” Let your Aries crush sweat a bit while waiting for your text.
