All you'll need to do is link your PayPal account to Meta Pay, which is easy to do in the Facebook mobile app and on the website. However, not all sales qualify for payment with PayPal. There are two ways to buy and sell on Facebook Marketplace: Selling with Shipping: If you plan to ship an item you're selling, you can receive your payment via PayPal or your bank account. If you're buying an item that can be shipped (you'll see a Buy Now button if the item qualifies), you can pay with PayPal. [1] X Research source To pay for an item with PayPal, the buyer will click Buy Now on a listing, then use their PayPal account to make the purchase. Four days after delivery confirmation, the seller's money will be available in PayPal. [2] X Research source Purchases made through the Buy Now link are covered by Facebook's Purchase Protection program. [3] X Research source Local transactions: There is no \"Buy now\" option available for local transactions, so you cannot be paid or send payment for these transactions with PayPal through Facebook. You can accept PayPal for in-person transactions, but you'll need to arrange that outside of Facebook Marketplace, and the transaction will not be protected by Facebook's Purchase Protection program."
