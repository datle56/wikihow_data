In that case, use the method below the heading \"When progeny size is small\". In case your progeny size is small and you feel that the number of recombinants and non-recombinants accurately represents the genetic distance between the two genes (which is rare in human genetics), use the method under the heading \"When progeny size is large\".

So the probability of Data if the two genes are linked is ((0.05)^2)*((.45)^11) The probability of Data if the two genes are non-linked is (0.25)^(R+NR) = (0.25)^13 Now log of odds = (probability of Data if the two genes are linked)/(probability of Data if the two genes are non-linked). So, Log of odds = (((.05)^2)*((0.45)^11)) / ((0.25)^13) = 25.7 The LOD score will be log10(25.7) = 1.41."

This is given by ((R/(R+NR))^R)*((1-(R/(R+NR)))^NR), where R = number of recombinants, NR = number of nonrecombinants. [6] X Research source For example, in the MNS blood group system, M and S are linked, and N and s are linked. Suppose that in 100 random individuals, 25 have MS haplotype, 30 have Ms haplotype, 6 have NS haplotype, and 39 have Ns haplotype. Since M and S are linked, and N and s are linked, MS and Ns are non - recombinants, and Ms and NS are recombinants. Thus, the number of recombinants = R = 30+ 6 = 36, while the number of nonrecombinants = NR = 25 + 39 = 64. The recombinant frequency is R/(R+NR) = 36/(36+64) = 0.36. The probability of obtaining the results assuming the two loci are linked is therefore ((0.36)^36)*((1-(0.36))^64) = 4.19187538*10^-29."
