      "content": "Acquire the Lapras ride pager and the fishing rod from Lana. At the start of the second trial on Akala Island, you will receive Lapras on your ride pager from Lana, the trial captain, meaning you will be able to go in water to look for Pokémon. You must complete the trial, however, to acquire the fishing rod, meaning Mareanie's capture is not possible until the second trial's completion. If you're a bit confused on how to use your ride pager, then read this article for some advice."

      "content": "Head to the ocean on the right with Lapras and surf to the Melemele Sea. Go back and forth until a fishing spot (a small collection of rocks under the water) is bubbling/rippling and press A to fish. When approaching the fishing location, be sure to approach the rippling fishing spot slowly, or it will stop rippling. Press A again whenever the line starts shaking, or an exclamation mark appears above the fishing rod."

      "content": "Repeat going back and forth in between Route 1 and the Melemele Sea to find a rippling location until you encounter the Pokémon Corsola. Now, there are 2 methods to proceed. Either way, Mareanie will only appear if Corsola makes an SOS call, so you must either lower Corsola's health until it's red, or use an adrenaline orb. Both of these methods will cause Corsola to make an SOS call. If you are using the former method, and Corsola uses a healing move, keep the health low."

      "title": "Catch Mareanie.",
      "content": "Catch Mareanie. The process to catch it is relatively simple. Before you catch it, however, you will have to eliminate Corsola, as the game will not allow you to catch a Pokémon if there are two wild Pokémon present. Once Corsola has fainted, simply lower Mareanie’s health and throw either a Great, Ultra, or Net Ball at it for the best catch chance. If it is night, you may also try Dusk Balls. Repeat until you have caught a Mareanie, and enjoy your new Pokémon! Mareanie has a slightly higher than normal catch rate, so this process shouldn’t take too long."
