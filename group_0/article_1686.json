      "content": "Find the dimensions of your doorway to determine the height of your arch. Put the end of the measuring tape at the top of the doorway, and extend it down to the floor to find the height. Then, check the width of the opening at the top of the frame since that’s where you’ll install your arch. Aim to have the top of the arch extend about 4 inches (10 cm) down from the frame so people can comfortably walk through it. [1] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 24 September 2021. Avoid extending the arch down too far in your doorway since taller people may not be able to fit through it comfortably. Try to keep the top of your arch about 78–80 inches (200–200 cm) from the floor. [2] X Research source If you’re adding an arch to an existing door, remove the trim with a pry bar and take off the drywall around it to expose the frame.

      "title": "Mark the top and bottom edges of your arch on a sheet of plywood.",
      "content": "Mark the top and bottom edges of your arch on a sheet of plywood. Use a sheet of 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) plywood that’s the same width as your doorway for the frames of your arch. Use your measuring tape to mark 4 inches (10 cm) in from the short side of the plywood sheet. Then make another mark 10 inches (25 cm) down from the first one for the bottom corner of your arch. Snap a chalk line across the plywood so you have 2 parallel lines. [4] X Research source You can buy chalk lines from hardware or home improvement stores. If you don’t have a chalk line, you can also use a pencil and a straightedge to draw your lines. If you don’t want to draw or cut your own arches, you can buy a prefabricated kit that provides the pieces you need for your archway. Search for a kit that’s adjustable or matches the width of your doorway."

      "content": "Draw lines from the center of the arch to the bottom corners. Divide the width measurement of the doorway by 2 and measure that distance in from the edge of the plywood. Make a mark on the top line you drew for the middle of your arch. Use a straightedge or your chalk line to draw a line from the mark you just made down to the ends of the line for the bottom edge of your arch. These lines will help you draw a perfect curve for your arch. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Make perpendicular lines extending from the midpoints of the lines you drew. Find the midpoint of one of the lines you just drew and mark it with a pencil. Place the right angle of a speed square on the mark you made and start drawing a perpendicular line with your pencil. Repeat the process with the line on the other side of the arch to make another perpendicular line. Use a straightedge or a chalk line to extend the lines down the plywood until they intersect. Double check your measurements to make sure they are accurate before moving on. That way, you can catch any errors before you make any cuts."

      "content": "Place a nail where the lines intersect and hook your tape measure to it. Find the point where the 2 lines intersect one another and tap a nail into the plywood. The nail acts as a pivot point and will help you draw a curve for the top of your archway. Make sure the nail is deep enough in the plywood so it doesn’t come out when you pull on it. Slide the end of the tape measure over the nail and make sure it doesn’t slip off easily. Tape measures have holes in the end so you can easily attach them to a nail. If your tape measure doesn’t have a hole in the end, then you can wrap a string around the nail instead."

Extend the tape measure until it reaches mark at the top of your arch, and then lock it in place so the tape can’t retract. Hold a pencil on the mark next to your tape measure, and move it toward the side of the plywood. Since the tape measure is locked in place, it will draw a curve that stops at the end of the bottom line. Move the tape measure to the other side to finish the other side of the arch. Be gentle with the tape measure since it may still extend slightly if you pull on it hard enough. If you’re using a string instead of a tape measure, tie it to your pencil."

Once you have the first piece of your archway cut out, trace it onto the plywood with a pencil so your pieces are identical. Use your jigsaw to cut the other piece out from the plywood. After you make the cut, hold the 2 pieces together to ensure that they’re the same size, and make any additional cuts to even them out if you need to. Clamp the 2 pieces of plywood together if you need to make adjustments to both to ensure that they stay the same."

Since most doorways are framed with 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) boards, you need to space the plywood pieces apart to fit. Line the curved edge of the archway with 2 1 ⁄ 2 in (6.4 cm) thick wood pieces and nail them in from each side. Leave about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) between each of your spacers so it’s the same thickness as the doorway.

Hold a board that’s the same width as your doorway at the top of the door frame so there’s 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of space on either side of it. Drive screws into the middle of the board every 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) to secure it in place. Then screw 2 vertical boards that are each 10 inches (25 cm) long on the sides of the frame so the short edges are flush with the top board.

Carefully guide the archway you built over the 2 1 ⁄ 2 in (6.4 cm) boards so the plywood is flush with the door frame. Once your archway is at the correct height, have a helper hold it in place while you drive 3 in (7.6 cm) nails through the plywood into the boards every 4 inches (10 cm).

Make sure the new pieces match the thickness of your existing drywall. Hold one of the pieces against the archway so the top edges are flush with one another and nail it in place every 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm). Work on one side of the archway at a time so it’s easier to handle and maneuver. [11] X Research source You can buy sheets of drywall from a home improvement or hardware store.

Start at the bottom corner of the arch and saw along the curve of the archway. Once you saw through the drywall on one side of the door frame, attach the other side and saw through it as well. [12] X Research source You can buy a flush-cut saw from your local hardware store. You can also use a reciprocating saw to cut through the drywall faster if you want."

Hold the strip against the bottom of the archway and lightly push on it so it bends along the curve. Screw the strip of drywall every 2 inches (5.1 cm) along the edges of the plywood using screws that are 2 inches (5.1 cm) long.

If the fiberglass netting bunches up rather than lying flat, then use a pair of scissors to cut halfway through the netting every 2 inches (5.1 cm).

Cover the fiberglass netting completely to hide it and seal the seam between drywall pieces. Compact the drywall mud as much as you can before smoothing it out and removing the excess. Let the second layer of mud set completely for at least 24 hours. Once you’ve finished applying drywall, you can paint the wall ."
