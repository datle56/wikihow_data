      "content": "Place 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts into a medium-size pot. Spread the chicken breasts out along the bottom of the pot, so they're not overlapping each other. [2] X Research source If you don't have a pot large enough to do this, a deep, covered skillet works as well. If you don’t have chicken breast, you can use chicken thighs instead, as long as they are boneless and skinless as well. [3] X Research source Avoid feeding your dog chicken with additives, if possible, as they may be harmful to your dog's health. Make sure that your chicken is completely defrosted if it was frozen. The frozen meat will affect the cooking time of the chicken and could potentially cause the meat to cook unevenly. If it is still frozen, finish defrosting the chicken in the refrigerator before cooking it. Always check to make sure that the chicken you’re using is fresh. If the chicken is slimy, sticky, discolored, has a filmy layer on top, or has an unpleasant odor, it’s probably gone bad, so you shouldn’t feed it to your dog. [4] X Research source"

Just be careful not to fill your pot with so much water that it bubbles over while cooking. Keep about 2 in (5.1 cm) of head space to avoid this. Do not add any additional seasonings to the chicken, as those may cause your dog to have an upset stomach. Keep the chicken bland, and then pair it with other dog-safe foods later if you want.

The skin, for example, has a higher fat content, so it’s more likely to upset your dog’s stomach. Cooked chicken bones also splinter easily, which can cause your dog to choke, or even puncture their gastrointestinal tract. Because of this, it’s best to feed your dog chicken breast or thighs that are boneless and skinless.
