      "content": "Preheat your oven to 400 °F (204 °C). Get your oven ready to go by turning it on while you get started preparing your haddock. Set it to your cooking temperature and allow it to fully heat up. [1] X Research source Most ovens will beep or make a sound to indicate that it’s ready."

      "title": "Spray a baking dish with non-stick spray.",
      "content": "Spray a baking dish with non-stick spray. Choose a baking tray or sheet that will hold all of your haddock filets in a single layer so they cook evenly. Coat the baking dish with non-stick cooking spray so your filets to stick to the surface. [2] X Research source If you don’t have non-stick spray, you can lightly brush olive oil on the surface of the baking dish. Haddock is a delicate white fish, so it can easily stick to a pan and fall apart."

    {
      "title": "Place the haddock in the baking dish and sprinkle with salt and pepper.",
      "content": "Place the haddock in the baking dish and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Take your filets and place them at the bottom of the dish. Place them next to each other lined up in the same direction to form an even layer that will cook consistently. [3] X Research source Don’t stack the filets or they may not cook consistently. Use another baking dish if you don’t have room to fit them all. Sprinkle kosher salt and freshly cracked pepper evenly over the fish. Use as much as you prefer."

      "title": "Melt the butter in a bowl and add the lemon juice and garlic.",
      "content": "Melt the butter in a bowl and add the lemon juice and garlic. Place your butter in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it for about 30-45 seconds until it’s fully melted. [4] X Research source Then, add 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of lemon juice and 2 minced garlic cloves into the bowl and stir it to combine them. [5] X Research source Keep an eye on the butter as it melts so it doesn’t pop or splatter. As soon as it’s melted, it’s good to go."

      "title": "Brush the mixture evenly over the haddock.",
      "content": "Brush the mixture evenly over the haddock. Use a kitchen brush to spread the mixture over the haddock filets in the baking dish. Coat all of the filets evenly and use all of the buttery mixture. [6] X Research source If you don’t have a kitchen brush, carefully pour the mixture over the fillets. The buttery mixture will also help keep the fish from sticking to the dish."

      "title": "Sprinkle the parsley, tarragon, and paprika over the fish.",
      "content": "Sprinkle the parsley, tarragon, and paprika over the fish. Take ½ teaspoon (.27 g) of parsley and sprinkle it over all of the filets, then add ¾ teaspoon (.45 g) of crushed tarragon. Carefully sprinkle ½ teaspoon (1.15 g) of paprika lightly and evenly over the haddock for a touch of heat. [7] X Research source Use your fingers to sprinkle fresh herbs and salt. Spices typically come with slotted caps so you can season the fish evenly."

      "title": "Bake the haddock for 12 minutes until it’s flaky.",
      "content": "Bake the haddock for 12 minutes until it’s flaky. Slide the baking dish onto the center rack of your oven. Set a timer for 12 minutes and leave the fish undisturbed to cook. When it’s done, take it out and use a fork to make sure it’s nice and flaky before you serve it. [8] X Research source Use the center rack so the convection cooks the haddock evenly. If the fish isn’t flaky, put it back in your oven until it reaches an internal temperature of 145 °F (63 °C)."

      "content": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet on medium-high heat. Place a skillet on a burner set to medium-high heat on your stovetop. Carefully add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil to the pan and wait until it starts to produce a small amount of smoke to know that it’s heated. [10] X Research source Olive oil can burn, so don’t let it smoke for too long before you add your fish. You could also use 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of butter instead of olive oil, or your preferred cooking oil."

      "content": "Place the haddock in the pan with the seasoned side down. Gently pick up a haddock filet and carefully place it in the hot pan with the seasoned side facing down. Add the rest of the filets into the pan the same way without stacking them so they cook evenly. [11] X Research source If you can’t fit all of the haddock in the pan, cook them in batches. The hot oil can splash up and burn your hands so add the haddock carefully into the pan."

      "content": "Season the other side with salt and pepper and let it cook for 2-3 minutes. Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the non-seasoned sides of the haddock as it cooks in the pan. Allow the filets to sear and cook for a few minutes. [12] X Research source Because haddock is so delicate, it doesn’t take too long to cook in a hot pan. Alternative: Just season salt/season the top of the fillet, as fish can get really over salted."

      "title": "Flip the haddock and let it cook for another 2-3 minutes.",
      "content": "Flip the haddock and let it cook for another 2-3 minutes. After a few minutes, use a flat spatula to carefully flip the haddock so the other side can cook. Flip all of the haddock filets in the pan and let the other side sear. [13] X Research source The sear gives the fish a nice color and flavor. Pro tip: Use a fish spatula if you have one—the edge is sharp/thin to get underneath delicate fish and the slots let the excess oil fall back in the pan."

      "title": "Remove the fish from the skillet and serve it hot.",
      "content": "Remove the fish from the skillet and serve it hot. Once the filets are cooked, take them out of the pan. Add them to plates and serve the haddock while it’s still hot. [14] X Research source You can garnish the filets with fresh lemon wedges or capers if you like. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in your refrigerator for 3-5 days. Fish has a pretty delicate life span."

      "content": "Place the top oven rack 6 inches (15 cm) and turn on the broiler. Make sure the uppermost oven rack is close to your broiler. Turn on the broiler so it’s ready to go when your haddock filets are prepared. [15] X Research source You don't need a rack to broil—you can just use a well-oiled sheet pan. The direct contact with the pan helps sear the bottom of the fish while you're broiling the top."

Place your haddock filets on the pan in a single layer so they cook consistently. [16] X Research source If you don’t have a broiler pan, use a baking sheet lined with tin foil."

Wait until the fish is white and flaky, which takes about 6-8 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven. Garnish the haddock with a lemon wedge and serve it while it’s hot. [19] X Research source Pour some of the butter from the pan over the fish and add any additional garnishes like freshly squeezed lemon. If you have any leftovers put them in an airtight container in your fridge. They should be good for up to a week."

      "content": "Heat canola oil in a cast-iron pan over high heat. Use a cast-iron skillet, which can handle higher temperatures than other pans. Add about 3–4 tablespoons (44–59 mL) of canola oil so you have enough to fully cover the bottom of the pan and fry up your haddock. [20] X Research source Use canola oil or vegetable oil, which has a higher smoke point than olive oil or butter and is better for frying."

Then, place it in the bowl of cornmeal and flip it over so both sides are covered with the batter. Use your fingers to sprinkle the cornmeal batter over any exposed areas of the fish so it’s fully covered. Dredge the rest of the filets the same way. [23] X Research source"

Place the cooked filet on the bun and add some tartar sauce, coleslaw, and crunch pickles as condiments. [25] X Research source Enjoy the sandwich with some tasty chips or french fries. The fish filets can be stored for 3-5 days in an airtight container in your fridge. Just keep in mind that breaded fish doesn't tend to keep as well and may get mushy."
