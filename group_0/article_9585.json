      "content": "Express your boundaries to the person in a direct, yet gentle manner. It’s important to express your needs to the person in a direct way so that it’s very clear what you’re requesting. With someone who demonstrates narcissistic traits, however, you may have more success if you avoid making demands of them. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, you might say something like, “I enjoy spending time with you, but I’ll have to leave if you call me that name again.” Or, you might say, “I’m glad you called, but I will need to hang up if you keep yelling at me.” Keep your tone friendly and your voice calm. Avoid getting angry about the things they say and do. For example, avoid responses like, “You can’t talk to me like that! I’m leaving!” or “If you don’t stop yelling at me right now, I’m hanging up!” These statements are more forceful and someone who tends toward narcissistic reactions may get more upset in response."

      "content": "Follow through with consequences for violating a boundary. Once you’ve expressed the boundary to the person and the consequence for violating it, see if they abide by it. If they violate the boundary you’ve just set, follow through with your pre-established consequence. [4] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, if you tell the person you’re going to leave if they call you a specific name again and they repeat the name, then get up and leave. If you have warned the person that you will hang up on them if they keep yelling at you and they continue to yell, hang up the phone. Make sure that you follow through with your established consequence right away. Don’t give them a second warning, hesitate, or give in if they try to apologize or convince you to stay using flattery."

      "title": "Anticipate changes in your relationship as a result of your boundaries.",
      "content": "Anticipate changes in your relationship as a result of your boundaries. Once you start setting boundaries with the person and enforcing them on a regular basis, you may notice that the person behaves differently around you or wants to spend less time around you. This is because they will have realized the dynamic is changing and they cannot get what they want from you as easily or at all anymore. This is a good thing, but it may be difficult at first. [5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, after setting boundaries with the person about the way they speak to you, you might notice them speaking to you less or ignoring you completely. Even though the change might be quite noticeable, don’t indicate that you’ve noticed any difference in their behavior or your relationship with them."

      "content": "Reflect and regroup if you become lax with your boundaries. There might come a time when you do not enforce your boundaries or when the person finds a way to skirt them. If this happens, reflect on the situation and identify how you can reinforce your boundaries in the future. [6] X Research source For example, if you have set a boundary about leaving the room if the person calls you names or threatens you, but you don’t leave the room on one occasion, reflect on why this happened. Were you distracted? Did they do or say something to make you stay? How can you overcome this obstacle to enforcing your boundaries for the next time? Keep in mind that enforcing your boundaries will be an ongoing part of your relationship with the person. Be persistent and continue to enforce your boundaries with the person on a regular basis."

      "content": "Stay calm and avoid rising to their attempts to upset you. Someone with narcissistic qualities may make comments that are meant to get a rise out of you—don’t take the bait. Respond calmly to what this person says to you, and if you find yourself getting upset, stop and take a deep breath or go for a walk to calm yourself before you engage with them. [7] X Research source It’s perfectly fine to walk away from the person if they’re being abusive toward you. If the person is criticizing you, blaming you, calling you names, threatening you, or doing something else that is upsetting you, you have every right to walk away."

      "content": "Listen to the person carefully and attentively when they talk. Craving attention is a key trait of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), so someone who’s been officially diagnosed with this disorder may like to talk a lot. [8] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 6 September 2018. Be prepared to be on the receiving end of most conversations and show them that you're actively listening to them. Some things you can do to show that you’re listening include: [9] X Research source Smiling and nodding while maintaining eye contact. Saying things like, “Yes,” “I see,” and “Mmhmm,” to encourage them to keep talking. Asking questions to clarify if something they say is unclear, such as “What did you mean when you said you had a bad day?”"

      "title": "Distract them by asking about a topic that interests them.",
      "content": "Distract them by asking about a topic that interests them. People with narcissistic qualities love to talk about themselves and share what they know, so asking them about something that they find interesting is a good way to distract them from their anger. This may be especially useful if they’ve been arguing with you or verbally attacking you. [10] X Research source For example, if the person knows a lot about cars, you might ask them a question about cars. Or, if they consider themselves knowledgeable about money, you could ask them for financial advice. You might have to wait until the person has calmed down slightly to engage them in this way. For instance, if they’re sulking or giving you the silent treatment, try waiting 20 minutes and then ask them a question to distract them."

      "content": "Show empathy for their feelings to soothe them. While people diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) may be incapable of empathy for other people, showing them empathy can help calm them down if they’re feeling upset. Try saying something to them to indicate your concern for them and your empathy for how they must feel. [11] X Research source For example, you might say something like, “You must have felt very upset to have to wait so long for a ride home.” Or, you might engage them with something like, “It seems like you’re pretty angry right now. What’s bothering you?” Keep in mind that NPD is a very real and very challenging mental health condition. NPD symptoms may manifest as egotistical and sometimes manipulative behavior—however, someone who’s been medically diagnosed with the personality disorder is likely suffering from severe insecurities and challenges with empathy that they have little-to-no control over.

      "content": "Avoid feeding their superior self-image. A key feature of narcissistic behavior is that the individual appears to feel superior to others (but in reality, they’re deeply insecure and unsure of themselves). [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source As a result, they gravitate toward people who feed this image of themselves, but doing so will only make matters worse. Avoid giving the person what they want if they fish for compliments or brag about themselves. Ignore their comments or change the subject. [14] X Research source For example, if the person is going on and on about what a great salesman they are, try saying something like, “Yeah. Oh, by the way, do you have any ideas about what you want to do this weekend?” If you do want to give the person a sincere compliment when you think they deserve it, that’s fine. Just avoid complimenting them all the time or this will inflate their sense of self even more."

      "content": "Use non-accusatory \"I\" language to express yourself. Occasionally, you will have a dispute with someone who’s continually acting in a narcissistic way. That individual will likely be offended if you bluntly criticize them, but that doesn't mean you need to back down completely. When you point out what the person has done wrong, simply phrase it as a personal and subjective opinion instead of an accusation. [15] X Research source In general, \"I\" language reduces defensiveness, aggressiveness, and rage. People with narcissistic traits, especially, are known to demonstrate these reactions in excess, so mastering \"I\" language will give you significant leverage. For example, say \"I feel hurt by your actions\" instead of saying \"You just did something really cruel and careless.\""

      "content": "Research what they tell you since they may be lying to you. If something conflicts with their view of themselves, a person with narcissistic qualities will reflexively lie to avoid facing it. This means that you may not get accurate information from them 100% of the time. If you have any doubts about what the person is saying, look into it for yourself. Don’t take everything they say as the truth. [16] X Research source For example, if the person relays a story about something that happened at work and it makes them out to be the hero, get someone else’s perspective on the matter."

Regularly dealing with someone who has diagnosed narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) or who demonstrates some narcissistic traits can be exhausting and disheartening. If the person is a friend, you might be able to avoid spending as much time with them, but it can be especially difficult if you live with the person or work with them. Talk to trustworthy friends and family members about what you’re going through and ask for their support.
