      "content": "Dialog boxes are often displayed to give the user a choice between options or to provide important information about a task. The program creator may want the user to be sure they understand the effects of the requested action, avoid liability, and give the user a chance to back out of an action before it begins. Dialog boxes are typically helpful and not bothersome, though they can sometimes be difficult to close if there's a problem with the program. Some common dialog boxes you'll see in various Windows and Mac apps: Prompting you to save your work before exiting a program. Asking you to confirm that you really want to perform a certain action. Giving you an opportunity to choose between two or more options. Providing information about an action or task the program is completing. Telling you how to undo a change you've performed. Telling you there is an error in the program preventing you from completing an action. Informing you that updates are available. Alerting you of notifications, such as new email messages or social media posts."
