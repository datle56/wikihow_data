      "content": "Know your population size. Population size refers to the total number of people within your demographic. For larger studies, you can use an approximated value instead of the precise number. [1] X Research source Precision has a greater statistical impact when you work with a smaller group. For instance, if you wish to perform a survey among members of a local organization or employees of a small business, the population size should be accurate within a dozen or so people. [2] X Research source Larger surveys allow for a greater deviance in the actual population. For example, if your demographic includes everyone living in the United States, you could estimate the size to roughly 320 million people, even though the actual value may vary by hundreds of thousands."

[3] X Research source The margin of error is a percentage the indicates how close your sample results will be to the true value of the overall population discussed in your study. Smaller margin of errors will result in more accurate answers, but choosing a smaller margin of error will also require a larger sample. When the results of a survey are presented, the margin of error usually appears as a plus or minus percentage. For example: \"35% of people agree with option A , with a margin of error of +/- 5%\" In this example, the margin of error essentially indicates that, if the entire population were asked the same poll question, you are “confident” that somewhere between 30% (35 - 5) and 40% (35 + 5) would agree with option A ."

      "content": "Set your confidence level. Confidence level is closely related to confidence interval (margin of error). This value measures your degree of certainty regarding how well a sample represents the overall population within your chosen margin of error. [4] X Research source In other words, choosing a confidence level of 95% allows you to claim that you 95% certain that your results accurately fall within your chosen margin of error. A larger confidence level indicates a greater degree of accuracy, but it will also require a larger sample. The most common confidence levels are 90% confident, 95% confident, and 99% confident. Setting a confidence level of 95% for the example stated in the margin of error step would mean that you are 95% certain that 30% to 40% of the total concerned population would agree with option A of your survey."

      "content": "Specify your standard of deviation. The standard of deviation indicates how much variation you expect among your responses. [5] X Research source Extreme answers are more likely to be accurate than moderate results. Plainly stated, if 99% of your survey responses answer \"Yes\" and only 1% answer \"No,\" the sample probably represents the overall population very accurately. On the other hand, if 45% answer \"Yes\" and 55% answer \"No,\" there is a greater chance of error. Since this value is difficult to determine you give the actual survey, most researchers set this value at 0.5 (50%). This is the worst case scenario percentage, so sticking with this value will guarantee that your calculated sample size is large enough to accurately represent the overall population within your confidence interval and confidence level."

[6] X Research source You can calculate z-scores by hand, look for an online calculator, or find your z-score on a z-score table. Each of these methods can be fairly complex, however. Since confidence levels are fairly standardized, most researchers simply memorize the necessary z-score for the most common confidence levels: 80% confidence => 1.28 z-score 85% confidence => 1.44 z-score 90% confidence => 1.65 z-score 95% confidence => 1.96 z-score 99% confidence => 2.58 z-score"
