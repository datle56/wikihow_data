Siri: If Siri is enabled, you can send messages this way even if the Messages app is restricted. Just say, “Hey Siri, text [your friend’s name].” Then, dictate the message and confirm that you want to send it. You can also ask Siri to read your texts to you.

There’s technically no way to completely restrict the use of the Contacts app, but whoever is managing your Screen Time settings could limit your allowed use of Contacts to 1 minute per day in Settings > Screen Time > App Limits . Share : There’s not much that can be done to prevent this method. To do it: Take a picture or a screenshot , then tap the Share button. Select Messages and enter the name or number of your contact. If you want, delete the image. Type your message into the blank text field, then tap the Send button (it looks like an arrow pointing up).
