      "title": "Capricorn and Sagittarius have the potential to be a great match!",
      "content": "Capricorn and Sagittarius have the potential to be a great match! These signs complement each other really well. Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter (the planet of expansion and learning) and Capricorn is governed by Saturn (the planet of discipline and structure). When subjects of these planets date, they form a partnership that encourages personal and creative growth. Capricorn and Sagittarius have no problem supporting each other’s ambitions and adventures. When they’re on the same page about what they want in a relationship, Capricorn and Sagittarius can be a strong long-term match. These signs make a great yin and yang—Capricorn’s grounded and practical earth sign energy mixes well with Sagittarius’s outgoing and creative fire sign energy."

      "title": "Capricorn and Sagittarius aren’t outwardly emotional people.",
      "content": "Capricorn and Sagittarius aren’t outwardly emotional people. Fiery Sagittarius is too in-the-moment to be bogged down by heavy feelings, and Capricorn is not generally a “mushy” sign—they are more practical about the people they love. If the Sagittarius in the partnership is warm and mellow, they can fill in the emotional gaps that the colder Capricorn has. Even when this isn't the case, these rational-minded signs can build an emotional connection through their mutual understanding of each other. Their biggest emotional conflict will be deciding the fate of their relationship. Capricorn wants to date long-term and eventually marry, but Sagittarius is the most non-committal of all the signs."

      "title": "Capricorn and Sagittarius have an easy time trusting each other.",
      "content": "Capricorn and Sagittarius have an easy time trusting each other. They’re both incredibly loyal and believe in committing to their partner (although it takes Sagittarius longer to decide they’re ready to commit). Sagittarius is especially honest and straightforward—they won’t accept deceit or lies from anyone. [1] X Research source This puts cautious Capricorn at ease since they are slow to enter relationships for fear of being wounded. When these signs date, they will never let anyone outside their relationship mess with their partnership. Sagittarius has a real need for freedom and space so they can explore the world. While Capricorn will trust Sagittarius to be faithful, the Goat will worry about the Archer’s safety and responsibility while they’re both apart."

      "title": "Capricorn and Sagittarius have no problem being open with each other.",
      "content": "Capricorn and Sagittarius have no problem being open with each other. They tend to be blunt with their observations (especially Sagittarius) and won’t downplay their feelings or pretend to be somebody else. This can lead to arguments sometimes, but Cap and Sag usually have the ability to put themselves in each other’s shoes and find a solution. Capricorn has a hard time articulating their feelings, but intuitive Sagittarius can usually tell what’s up with their Goat partner without saying anything. Capricorn is not the best texter. If it doesn’t revolve around their sense of humor or needing their assistance, Sagittarius may get ghosted."

      "title": "Capricorn and Sagittarius are both intelligent signs that want a smart partner.",
      "content": "Capricorn and Sagittarius are both intelligent signs that want a smart partner. They make a dream team when it comes to working together and problem solving. Saturn-ruled Capricorn is very practical and incredibly ambitious. Jupiter-ruled Sagittarius is a creative that tends to have good luck and knows how to roll with things. Sagittarius’s visionary ideas get put into action by Capricorn’s workaholic attitude, and there’s nothing they can’t accomplish together. Their different methods for getting things done might cause some friction, but once they accept each other’s way of working, their intellectual bond is unbreakable."

      "title": "Capricorn and Sagittarius operate at different speeds when it comes to intimacy.",
      "content": "Capricorn and Sagittarius operate at different speeds when it comes to intimacy. Cap moves slower and needs a real, deep connection to get the most out of a physical relationship. Sagittarius moves faster and doesn’t see why Capricorn thinks sex is such a big deal—for a Sag, it’s all about fun! Their sex life will probably be more physical than romantic, and they’ll need to be patient with each other while they find the right balance between fun and emotions. Capricorn needs to trust their partner before going to bed together and it can take a while for them to be ready for intimacy. Sagittarius needs to respect Capricorn’s need for connection, and Cap needs to loosen up and go with the flow to meet Sagittarius’s needs."

      "title": "Private Capricorn is way less outgoing than Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Private Capricorn is way less outgoing than Sagittarius. They’ll probably meet somewhere familiar for Capricorn, like school or work, and Sagittarius will need to make the first move. Capricorn’s don’t socialize well outside of their few close companions, so Sagittarius needs to become part of Cap’s close circle first. On their first date, Sagittarius’s flirty charm and witty jokes will help Capricorn loosen up and become less serious. It won’t take long for them to start enjoying each other’s company. Cap and Sag are bright, intellectual people. Dates to places like museums or live performances would satisfy them both. It can be hard to catch Cap's eye at first. Sagittarius can get their attention by asking for help with something small, like car trouble or a household “emergency.” If Cap comes to the rescue, Sag will know they're interested."

      "title": "Finding activities to do together will be a fun challenge in the beginning.",
      "content": "Finding activities to do together will be a fun challenge in the beginning. Capricorn and Sagittarius are very different, but this is what makes them so curious about each other. Sagittarius is always down to try something new and will have to use their charm to convince Capricorn to come along. Cap will try to resist change, but Sag will enjoy poking at them until they cave (Capricorn can’t help but crack a smile and go along with Sagittarius’s plans eventually). Creative activities, like a painting class or learning a new instrument, are a good middle ground for the introverted Capricorn and extroverted Sagittarius to enjoy."

      "content": "A Capricorn-Sagittarius relationship takes work, but the results are worth it. The two signs are opposites in many ways, but when they take the time to understand and accept each other’s differences, their dating experience will be refreshing and fun. Laughter will bond them in the beginning—Capricorn can’t help being charmed by Sagittarius’s alluring wit. Capricorn will make the wild Sagittarius feel secure and show them how to put their ideas into action. Sagittarius will be the adventurous, carefree influence that Capricorn needs to be happier and optimistic. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Compromise and understanding are the keys to making it last.",
      "content": "Compromise and understanding are the keys to making it last. Capricorn and Sagittarius will have fun together when they first start dating, but their differences will become more pronounced the longer they’re together. Finding balance between Sagittarius’s need for space and Capricorn’s need for affection is necessary for building the trust and emotional connection they need to stay together. Sagittarius can give Capricorn attention and commitment by supporting Cap’s career and professional ambitions. Capricorn can make Sagittarius feel secure by being less critical and trusting they can take care of themselves on their personal adventures."
