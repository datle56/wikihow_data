      "content": "This relationship takes work and commitment to bloom. Although these signs aren’t traditionally seen as compatible, both Virgos and Aries are always ready to put in the effort to get what they want, including a healthy relationship. If they can work on their communication and patience, these signs have a lot to offer one another as they work on meeting their goals. One of the challenges for this pair is that their elements of Earth (Virgo) and Fire (Aries) have difficulty finding romantic chemistry. Earth signs value long-term stability and fire signs live in the moment, which makes it tough for them to see eye to eye. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "An Aries will likely make the first move. When an Aries likes you, they’ll be upfront with you about it quickly, but a cautious Virgo might prefer to admire you from afar. But Virgo’s initial reservedness isn’t a turn-off for Aries—few signs like a challenge as much as this one. If you’re a Virgo contemplating making the first move, it doesn’t hurt to try. An Aries will likely feel flattered by the attention, so give it a shot."

    {
      "title": "These signs can struggle in the bedroom at first.",
      "content": "These signs can struggle in the bedroom at first. Aries is extremely impatient about nearly everything, and sex is no exception. Venus, the planet of emotion, is debilitated in Virgo, which means that Virgos tend to think about sex logically and carefully, rather than emotionally. This means that an Aries might be taking it way too fast in the bedroom for a Virgo’s liking. For this relationship to work, an Aries will need to respect a Virgo’s boundaries, and be willing to take their time before sex. This might mean waiting to have sex until a Virgo feels more comfortable, or engaging in plenty of foreplay beforehand."

      "title": "This pair might have fun switching up their roles.",
      "content": "This pair might have fun switching up their roles. If Aries, the sign of the aggressive ram, can let Virgo, the sign of the virgin, try being the dominant partner in the bedroom, they can keep their sex life interesting and flexible. [2] X Research source Asking a simple question like “What are you comfortable with in bed?” can help both partners get a better understanding of each other’s desires."

      "title": "These signs lend themselves to a unique kind of chemistry.",
      "content": "These signs lend themselves to a unique kind of chemistry. Although Aries tend to be pretty self-obsessed, this doesn’t mean that they’re narcissists, and some gentle prodding by a Virgo who can see their flaws can actually get them excited. Both signs will want to best out of each other, and this can lead to a relationship that encourages their growth. Although a Virgo’s criticism is well-intentioned, it’s important that it’s carefully delivered. An Aries likes to stay positive, so if you’re a Virgo, tell them something nice before you offer tips for improvement."

    {
      "title": "Showing vulnerability to one another can be a challenge.",
      "content": "Showing vulnerability to one another can be a challenge. As an aggressive sign ruled by Mars, Aries doesn’t tolerate weakness in themselves or others. Virgo, ruled by critical Mercury, is similarly unforgiving of flaws. It takes effort to get these signs to be vulnerable with one another and deepen their relationship. Even if it’s tough for these signs to open up, it’s necessary. Letting your partner know that you’re there to support them can make them feel safe, so say something like “I care about you, and I’m not here to judge you.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Both of these signs value honesty.",
      "content": "Both of these signs value honesty. An Aries doesn’t like beating around the bush, and a Virgo values their insightful and critical eye too much to avoid sharing their observations. But since both signs appreciate the value of straightforwardness in communication, they don’t have much to fear when it comes to their partner lying to preserve their feelings. Honesty is a real strength for this couple. A Virgo-Aries pair can take advantage of it by having frequent check-in conversations with each other or a couple’s counselor about their relationship."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sometimes these signs are honest to a fault.",
      "content": "Sometimes these signs are honest to a fault. At their worst, an earth-fire pairing can cause explosive fights when normal communication breaks down. Although they’re likely to be able to return to normal soon, practicing deescalating fights can keep them from getting out of hand. [3] X Research source For example, if a conversation seems to be getting too heated, try saying something like, “How about if we take a break for an hour or so and do something else? We can return to this conversation later.”"

      "title": "These signs use their smarts to get things done.",
      "content": "These signs use their smarts to get things done. Virgos are excellent critics that use their intelligence to find areas for improvement in themselves and others. Aries are ambitious and driven, and thrive when it comes to outwitting their competition. These signs’ intellectual strengths can help each other achieve their goals. Aries love being supported by others, and having a Virgo on your side is a great asset. A Virgo can use their intelligence to help Aries succeed in their career, athletic, or personal pursuits."
    },
    {
      "title": "Both signs like improving themselves.",
      "content": "Both signs like improving themselves. While an Aries might not be as inclined toward abstract intellectual pursuits as a Virgo, these signs are always thinking about ways to grow as individuals. With their ability to stay motivated, an Aries can help a Virgo put their plans for improvement into action. For example, a Virgo might put together a smart and detailed plan to improve their fitness, and an Aries will motivate them to stick to their goals by being a dedicated running partner or gym buddy."

      "title": "Virgo and Aries may clash, but they can also grow together.",
      "content": "Virgo and Aries may clash, but they can also grow together. Although a Virgo’s diligence and carefulness might not seem to be a great match for Aries’ impulsiveness and bluntness, both signs share a drive to grow as individuals. If they can work through their sexual and communication issues, they can have a strong relationship. But if romance doesn’t work out, they’ll find in one another a friend who balances out their strengths."
