      "content": "Blot up excess liquid with a microfiber cloth. Microfiber cloths work well for blotting up stains before they set in because they’re very absorbent. Use the cloth to lightly dab at the stained area to soak up some of the stain before it dries. Do this as soon as you can so that the stain will be as minimal as possible. If you don’t have a microfiber cloth on hand when you notice the stain, try using something else absorbent, such as a regular cloth or a paper towel."

      "content": "Mix dishwashing soap and water to create a cleaning solution. Fill a small bowl with water. Add 1-2 squirts of dishwashing liquid to the bowl and mix the contents together to create some sudsy water. When used sparingly, this mixture can help to clean off stains on your velvet shoes. As an alternative, fill a small bowl with lemon juice and add in 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of baking soda. Stir the lemon juice and baking soda together until a foam forms."

      "content": "Scrub the stain with a toothbrush and wipe away the mixture. Use a soft brush to apply a conservative amount of the mixture to the stained part of your shoes. Then, scrub the stain gently with the brush. Leave the shoes alone for a couple of minutes, and then wipe away the mixture with a clean, dry cloth.

      "title": "Dry the area with a microfiber cloth.",
      "content": "Dry the area with a microfiber cloth. Gently press a fresh microfiber cloth, or a regular cloth or paper towel if you don’t have one, against the stained area. The cloth should soak up the moisture from the stain-removing mixture, which may help to dry the spot. Use a hair dryer or fan if you want to quicken the drying process."

      "content": "Take your shoes to a professional cleaner if the stain remains. If you’ve tried applying a stain-removing mixture a couple of times and are still struggling to remove the stain, it may be a good idea to consider getting a professional’s help. Velvet is a tricky material, so rather than taking a more aggressive approach to getting the stain out yourself, it may be best to find a professional shoe cleaner who has experience.

      "title": "Allow the shoes to dry completely if they’re wet.",
      "content": "Allow the shoes to dry completely if they’re wet. Velvet can become easily damaged when it’s wet. If your velvet shoes have some mud on them, it’s best to try to clean them once they’re no longer wet. Wait for the shoes to air dry completely before you try to remove any mud or dirt."

      "title": "Use a cloth or toothbrush to remove dirt and dust.",
      "content": "Use a cloth or toothbrush to remove dirt and dust. When your velvet shoes are totally dry, take a soft, clean, dry cloth and try to wipe away the dirt or dust that’s on the shoes. If this doesn’t work, you may have a bit more luck with a soft-bristled toothbrush. Either way, make sure you wipe or brush the velvet carefully in the same direction so that you don’t accidentally damage it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Brush the velvet after every wear.",
      "content": "Brush the velvet after every wear. To keep dirt and dust from getting caked onto your shoes, brush the velvet lightly with a clothing brush or a soft-bristled toothbrush after each time you wear your shoes. This will help keep the dirt and dust to a minimum, and should also prevent the velvet from becoming crushed. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Select a product that’s safe for velvet. Contrary to popular belief, fabric and furniture protectant sprays that are made for suede or leather aren’t always safe to use on velvet. Look for shoe or upholstery protectant sprays online or in general department stores. As you shop around, read the label to make sure that it’s suitable for velvet. [5] X Research source Look for a product that repels stains, waterproofs materials, or does both. Try products like Scotchgard or Vectra Furniture, Carpet and Fabric Protector Spray."

      "content": "Spot test a small area first. Even if you find a product that you think won’t damage your velvet shoes, it’s best to try it out on a small, inconspicuous part of a shoe before spraying the whole thing. Spray just a little protectant onto the back of one of your shoes. Then, observe it to make sure that the spray doesn’t have a negative effect on your shoes, such as darkening the color or hardening the material."

      "content": "Hold the spray 6 inches (15 cm) away from the shoes and spray them. If you spray the protectant too close to the velvet, you may cause damage to your shoes. Hold it at least 6 inches (15 cm) away and then lightly mist the entire surface of each shoe. This may help to significantly minimize day-to-day staining and damage due to weather. [6] X Research source Reapply the spray every 4-8 wears to get the best results."

      "content": "Let the shoes air dry before you wear them. Set your misted shoes outside underneath a covering, such as a carport, for best results. This way, your shoes can dry thoroughly in the fresh air while being protected from the elements. Touch the velvet to make sure it’s totally dry before putting them on and wearing them out and about."
