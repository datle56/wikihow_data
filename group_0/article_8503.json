      "content": "Check the drain. Remove the bottom rack on your stainless steel dishwasher. Examine it for clumps of debris that might cause it to drain improperly. Remove anything that might be clogging the drain. [2] X Research source If you can easily access the drain, scrub it with some soapy water to clean it.

      "content": "Run the wash with vinegar. Fill a dishwasher-safe cup on the top rack of the stainless steel dishwasher with vinegar. Slide the rack back in the stainless steel dishwasher and close the door. With only the cupful of vinegar inside, turn the stainless steel dishwasher on and run it on the highest water temperature setting. [4] X Research source The vinegar will help loosen grease and grime, and remove any odor that the dishwasher might have acquired. Use distilled white vinegar or specialized cleaning vinegar.

      "content": "Wipe the edges along the door. Check the area around the dishwasher door for debris and grime. Some dishwashers cannot adequately clean this area, which leads to an accumulation of yucky material. If you see anything, use a damp cloth to wipe the area down. [7] X Research source Additionally, use a damp cotton swab to clean along the ridges of the seal."

      "title": "Wash the filter.",
      "content": "Wash the filter. The stainless steel dishwasher’s filter collects prevents large debris from entering the drain. You’ll probably have to use a screwdriver to remove the screws that hold the grate in place. Some newer stainless steel dishwashers, however, have filters that simply pop out when turned. Rinse the filter in your sink under warm water. Dip a soft-bristled toothbrush in warm, soapy water. Use the toothbrush to scrub the filter until clean. Replace it after cleaning. [8] X Research source Not every stainless steel dishwasher has a filter. If you can access the filter in your dishwasher, try to clean it every 3 months.

      "content": "Clean the utensil rack. The utensil rack is a small container attached to the dishwasher rack. You might have just one, or one on each rack. Remove it and rinse it in the sink beneath warm water. Use a sponge dampened with warm, soapy water to clean the inside and outside of the utensil rack. If the utensil rack does not detach, just clean it inside and outside with a damp sponge or dishcloth. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the spray arms. Most stainless steel dishwashers have two spray arms – one beneath each rack of the dishwasher. Pull each rack out. Untwist the spray arms by loosening the central bolt that holds them in place. They generally twist off quite easily by hand. [12] X Research source The top spray arm is usually affixed to the bottom of the top dish rack. The lower spray arm is usually affixed to the bottom of the dishwasher itself."

      "content": "Use a toothpick to clean the spray holes. Along the top side of each spray arm is a series of small holes. When the stainless steel dishwasher is in operation, water is ejected from these holes. But over time, they might become clogged with gunk. To keep them clear, poke a toothpick through each hole to get them clean. [14] X Research source There are usually eight to ten spray holes on each spray arm."

      "title": "Locate the grain of the stainless steel.",
      "content": "Locate the grain of the stainless steel. Stainless steel dishwashers and other products have a differentiated surface, with small flecks or striations in it. These flecks or striations are collectively known as the grain of the stainless steel. Conduct a close visual inspection of your stainless steel dishwasher to determine what direction the grain is oriented in. It might be up/down, left/right, or diagonally oriented.

      "content": "Wash the outside of the dishwasher. Dip a sponge or dishcloth in warm, soapy water. Move it along the surface of the stainless steel dishwasher in a motion consistent with its grain. For instance, if the grain of your stainless steel dishwasher is oriented up/down, wipe with your sponge or dishcloth using an up/down motion. [16] X Research source If you wish, you could substitute a specially-formulated stainless steel cleaning product for warm, soapy water. Bar Keeper’s Friend, for instance, is a popular product.

      "content": "Dry the stainless steel dishwasher. Once you’ve washed the stainless steel dishwasher, use a dry sponge or dishcloth to dry it. Wipe away the warm, soapy water by moving the cloth or sponge along the direction of the dishwasher’s grain. In other words, if the grain of your stainless steel dishwasher is oriented in an up/down direction, move the dry cloth or sponge in an up/down direction. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Do not use abrasive cleaning materials. Cleaning solutions that contain chlorine should not be used to clean the exterior of your stainless steel dishwasher. This could cause corrosion. Likewise, do not use steel wool or other harsh cloths, as doing this could lead to scratching the surface. [19] X Research source"
