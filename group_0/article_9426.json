      "title": "Introduce yourself.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself. This is your opportunity to introduce yourself and explain why you wanted to reach out to President Carter. This doesn’t have to be an extensive introduction. Your name, where you’re from, and whether you’re a student or a professional should all be included. In an email, you have less space for introductions so you can keep it short. If you are a student who is contacting President Carter because of a school project you could say something like, \"Hello President Carter, My name is Sarah and I am a 6th grade student at Monroe Elementary. We learned about you during class and I was really interested in the work that you have done to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.\""

      "title": "Be specific.",
      "content": "Be specific. Once you’ve introduced yourself, you can get to the main point of your message. This section should describe why you’re reaching out to President Carter and for what reason. This makes your letter more personal and gives you an opportunity to connect with your reader. It can also help to increase your chances of receiving a response. Some reasons you might reach out would be to congratulate him on a recent achievement, to thank him for his work, to share how his work has impacted your life, or to request an interview or meeting. [1] X Trustworthy Source The White House Official website for the Executive Branch of the U.S. government Go to source If you’ve ever attended any event where President Carter spoke, or you’ve met him before, include that information. For example, you could say \"I attended a lecture at Emory University on July 16th where you spoke about your work with the Carter Center. I wasn't able to attend the meet and greet session after the lecture so I wanted to reach out to you via letter.\" Making your letter personal also helps to reduce the possibility that a staffer thinks it is spam. Since President Carter receives fan mail frequently, his staff have to filter out spam messages and you don't want that to happen to your thoughtful letter."
