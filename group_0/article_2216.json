      "title": "Use a unique password.",
      "content": "Use a unique password. Your password should be really hard to guess! Never make it obvious, like \"12345678\", \"abcdefgh\", your username, or your street name. Your password should be at least 8 characters long and contain a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Be very creative. For example, try the last name of someone you don't know too well plus a number and an exclamation point at the end. Hackers can find information about you online and use it to guess your password. So if you live at 123 Williams St, a hacker may try 123Williams as your password."

      "content": "Never give your password to anyone . Even if someone is trying to offer you free Roblox Premium or Robux, never tell anyone your real password.

If a website that claims to give you free Robux or special cheat codes asks for your password, close the page! You may see comments from people that claim the site works. Don't believe them. They're either fake comments the creator put up or people who say that just to make other people believe that it's real. They might even get paid to say stuff like that. Why can't you hack Robux? All Roblox currency is stored on Roblox servers. Hacking servers is considered very difficult and is also illegal. Hackers will receive fines, and prison terms if they are convicted of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, if they are in the US (which is very broad, so they won't be able to tread the line)."
