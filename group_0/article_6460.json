      "content": "Chakras are a series of energy centers along your spine. In Sanskrit, chakra means “wheel” or “circle” and refers to 7 spots where the flowing life force (prana) in your body gets concentrated. The chakras contribute to your overall well-being when they’re open or balanced, but can negatively affect your mental, emotional, and spiritual health when they’re blocked or unbalanced. [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The channels or lines where prana flows between chakras are called nadi. Each chakra also corresponds to a part of your body and is believed to influence the health of that region, but there is little scientific research to back this up. Uplifting and mindful activities like deep breathing, thinking positively, exercising, and eating a healthy diet can support your chakras and the flow of energy through your body. Poor lifestyle habits and negativity, on the other hand, can contribute to blocking your chakras and disrupting the energy flow in your body."

      "content": "Meditation Meditating on each chakra every day is one of the best ways to keep them balanced and help your mind and spirit continue developing. To start, get comfortable in a quiet, private room and do breathing exercises for a few minutes to clear your mind. Then, focus on each chakra one by one, starting with the root chakra and working your way up. Close your eyes and visualize each chakra in your body. Imagine a spinning ball or pool that’s glowing with the color of each chakra (for example, red for the root chakra or blue for the throat chakra). Focus your thoughts and sensations on each area of the body where a chakra sits. What do you feel? What emotions or thoughts are coming to your mind? If you’re new to chakra meditation, try using a guided meditation video online or an app like Chakra Meditation Balancing ."
