      "title": "Note the filter brand.",
      "content": "Note the filter brand. The housing around your well water filter, or the filter itself, lists what brand your system is. If it's not on the housing of the filter, try checking the system itself. You'll need to know the brand name to ensure you get the right filter. [1] X Research source Some common well water filtration system brands are Whirlpool, Reynolds, and Culligan."

    {
      "title": "Check the filter model number.",
      "content": "Check the filter model number. The model number should be listed near the brand name on your filter housing. There might be a label on the housing that lists the model number, or it might be stamped right into the metal or plastic of the housing. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Purchase a new filter.",
      "content": "Purchase a new filter. You can buy well water filters at most home improvement stores, or you can order them through online retailers. You can also check the website for the brand you have; they sometimes sell their filters directly. You can expect to spend between 25 and 35 dollars for your replacement filter, depending on the brand and model."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a metal filter wrench.",
      "content": "Get a metal filter wrench. A filter wrench is designed specifically to make removing old filters easy. Metal filter wrenches have a handle, usually coated in plastic or rubber, on one end. On the other, you'll see a large circle made of metal. It will slide over your filter. You can purchase a metal filter wrench from most online retailers."

    {
      "title": "Place a bucket under your filter.",
      "content": "Place a bucket under your filter. When you remove the filter casing, chances are some water will pour out. Place a bucket directly under your filter to catch this water and prevent anything else from getting wet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover any nearby electrical panels.",
      "content": "Cover any nearby electrical panels. Your water filter will likely be located near the electrical unit that controls your filtration system. Cover that unit — and any other nearby electrical panels or outlets — with plastic. Use a plastic grocery bag or plastic sheeting to cover any exposed electrical panels. Just make sure there aren't any gaps where water can get in. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn off your water.",
      "content": "Turn off your water. The exact location of the water shut-off valve will be different depending on the type of system you have and how your home's plumbing is set up. Look for it near the filter. The shut-off valves might look like knobs that need to be turned either vertically or horizontally, or wheels that need to be spun to the right or left. [4] X Research source If you're not exactly sure where the shut-off valve is, look up the user or owner manual online. If you're still not sure, you can ask a representative of the company to come out and take a look."

      "title": "Press the pressure release.",
      "content": "Press the pressure release. At the top of your filter housing, you should see a small red button. This is the pressure release. In order to change the filter, press the button. When you do, a bit of water may come out. That's normal, and the bucket under your filter should catch anything that drips down."

      "content": "Reset the wrench and repeat the turn if a wall is in your way. Depending on where your filter is, there might not be enough room behind it to just continuously rotate the wrench until the filter housing comes loose. If that's true, turn the wrench as far as you can, then slide the wrench off the housing, reset it so the handle is on the right side of the housing, and turn it again. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Use your hand to unscrew the housing once it's loose.",
      "content": "Use your hand to unscrew the housing once it's loose. After you've rotated the filter wrench a few times, test the housing's looseness. It should be loose enough for you to unscrew it the rest of the way by hand. Once you get to this point, hold the bucket up as close to the housing as possible. Then unscrew the housing the rest of the way with your hand. [8] X Research source Because the housing will be filled with water, it might be heavier than you expect when it finally comes free of the filtration system. Hold the bucket as close to the housing as possible, so that if you accidentally drop the housing, you won't get water everywhere."

      "title": "Remove the old filter from the housing.",

Grasp the top of the filter and pull it straight up to remove it from the housing. Dump any excess water out of the housing after you've removed the filter. [9] X Research source"

Take the o-ring off of the housing and check it for dings, flat-spots, or holes. If you find any, you'll need to order a new o-ring. [11] X Research source You should be able to get a new o-ring from the same place you purchased your new filter."

Squeeze some of the lubricant onto the o-ring and rub it all the way around. Replace the o-ring and then squeeze a bit more lubricant into the o-ring groove in the housing. Rub some silicon around the threads on the housing, too. [12] X Research source You can find food-grade silicon grease at most home improvement stores or online."
