Due to the increasing amount of information about transgender people, you may have already heard some information about what being transgender is. Transgender people have a gender that is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. For example, a girl might have been thought to be a boy. Gender is determined in your mind and heart, not by your anatomy. If you really feel like a girl, you are a girl. It's just that not everyone knows it. Some transgender people compare it to being born in the wrong body. Others feel comfortable with their bodies. For example, a trans boy might say that because he is a boy, that makes his body a boy's body."

If someone is nonbinary , sometimes informally called \"enby\", their gender doesn't fully fit the labels of \"male\" or \"female\". While there are many nonbinary genders, here are some of the more common ones: [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Genderfluid people may switch genders from time to time. For example, maybe that means being a boy yesterday, a girl today, and agender tomorrow. Demiboys/Demigirls only partially fit the label of \"girl\" or \"boy.\" Agender people have no gender. Bigender people have two genders simultaneously. For example, someone might be both a boy and a girl, or both a girl and agender."

Some people don't totally understand what it means to be transgender or nonbinary, and come up with a lot of silly ideas about them. Oftentimes, transgender or nonbinary people are said to just be gay; however, these are not the same. Being gay means that you get crushes on people of your gender, and being transgender means that your gender doesn't match your assigned sex. If you feel like you're a girl, you're probably transgender, not gay. [2] X Research source Of course, transgender and nonbinary people can be gay or queer, as well. You can be a girl who likes girls, or a nonbinary person who likes girls. There's nothing wrong with that, either."

Try looking in a mirror and saying, \"I am a [boy/girl/nonbinary gender]\". Which one feels best to you, and feels right? It is okay to be a guy who likes feminine things, if that's what you turn out to be. Whether you're a boy who likes pink or a boy who likes to cross-dress, that's okay. You don't have to match narrow gender roles. You don't have to be 100% traditionally feminine in order to be a real girl. Some girls like baseball, superheroes, and wearing pants. If you think you're a trans girl, this doesn't invalidate your gender. Take as much time as you need to in order to figure things out. There's never any rush to know who you are."

A therapist should not try to force you into a gender role that you aren't comfortable with, tell you what gender you \"are\", or make you do anything relating to your gender that you aren't comfortable with.

If clothing is the issue, try looking for clothing that's considered \"boy's\" clothing, so that your parents don't object to it. You can find many of the same styles of clothing in the boy's section as well (e.g. skinny jeans). You can also try things like polishing your nails with a clear nail polish, wearing some very subtle makeup (if safe to do so), or practicing more feminine self-care routines, like shaving or moisturizing your skin .
