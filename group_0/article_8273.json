Avoid using shaving cream gel since this will leave a residue behind and won't work as effectively as the cream.

If your mirror has been cleaned with a multi-purpose cleanser, furniture polish, or goo-removing cleanser, these can leave a residue that will make the mirror cloudy.

If the backing of the mirror gets damaged, it can make the mirror appear cloudy or hazy. [8] X Research source If you prefer to spray the cleaner directly onto the mirror, then lay down some towels below it before you begin. This will help to catch the liquid that drips down and prevent damage to your surfaces."
