    {
      "title": "Do not give out your real name.",
      "content": "Do not give out your real name. It is wise to choose a screen name that doesn't include your first and last name, such as \"Sally Johnson\" or \"Joe Harris\". It is especially important that you don't reveal your last name. The more unique your name, the wiser it is to guard it for professional use only."
    },

      "title": "Avoid giving away your age.",
      "content": "Avoid giving away your age. It is wise to choose a screen name that does not give away your age, such as \"Roses17\" or \"Jelly 34\". Most people would be able to tell what this means. This isn't just for the very young. As you grow older, you may not want people guessing just how old you've become! This includes graduation year dates; don't use them as they give away too much self-identifying information."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do not divulge your location.",
      "content": "Do not divulge your location. It is wise to choose a screen name that does not give away where you live, such as \"Denver Chick Lucy\", or \"Madison Avenue\". Also avoid usernames that would reveal your ZIP code, such as \"Logan21508\". Don't even give away your state, city or country."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid offending people.",
      "content": "Avoid offending people. Having a screen name such as \"I Hate Sally\" or \"I Beat Up Joe\" obviously will get some people angry. Names with political or religious agendas attached to them will rub a lot of people up the wrong way too––avoid using them. Remember too, that what might be funny or ironic where you live might be disparaging or even unkind somewhere else in the world; you are interacting with people from all over the world, so be worldly wise."

    {
      "title": "Use the \"stage-name\" method.",
      "content": "Use the \"stage-name\" method. Come up with a first or a last name totally unrelated to you. Add only your first or your last name to the stage name but not both. Or, don't even do that––add together two totally unrelated names you like the sound of together. Everyone will know you by your stage-name style screen name! For example: Adelaide Anders or Martha Smith."

    {
      "title": "Use a favorite pet or object method.",
      "content": "Use a favorite pet or object method. Combine the name of a favorite pet or object with a surname or other name. For example, Woofie Bugbear; Trixie Paws; Reptilian Greg; Ovalbowl Harry; PurpleCrayonMarsha."
