      "content": "Insert fresh batteries or charge your keyboard. If your keyboard has a battery slot, insert the batteries as indicated in the keyboard's packaging. Some keyboards use built-in rechargeable batteries instead of AAs or AAAs. If your keyboard came with a charger, charge it for a while before turning it on."

      "content": "Plug in the keyboard's receiver. If your wireless keyboard came with a small USB receiver/dongle, plug it into an available USB port. USB ports are the thin, rectangular slots found on the sides of laptops and on the front or back of desktop towers. Some keyboards let you choose between using the manufacturer's default radio frequency or Bluetooth. If you plan to use Bluetooth , you may have to move a switch on the keyboard to the Bluetooth position—look for a symbol that looks like a sideways bowtie. If you just purchased the keyboard and can't find the receiver, check inside the battery compartment. If your keyboard came with a wireless mouse, the receiver is usually in the mouse's battery compartment. It may also be in the keyboard's original packaging."

      "title": "Install drivers if prompted to do so.",
      "content": "Install drivers if prompted to do so. Depending on your keyboard, Windows may automatically install drivers (or prompt you to download them from the manufacturer's website) as soon as you plug in the receiver. This is common if your keyboard doesn't use Bluetooth. If drivers are automatically installed, you can usually start using your wireless keyboard right away. If Windows installed drivers and your keyboard is already working, you're all done! However, if your keyboard has extra features, such as programmable media keys, you may need to install software from the manufacturer's website to use them. Check your manual to be sure—if you don't have the manual, search for your keyboard model online to find out what's required. If you're setting up a Bluetooth keyboard, keep reading!"
