In the derivation below, we will work with an Earth-rocket system and assume that this system is isolated. [2] X Research source In conservation of energy, we equate the initial and final potential and kinetic energies K 1 + U 1 = K 2 + U 2 , {\\displaystyle K_{1}+U_{1}=K_{2}+U_{2},} where K {\\displaystyle K} is kinetic energy and U {\\displaystyle U} is potential energy."

Kinetic energy is energy of motion, and is equal to 1 2 m v 2 , {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2},} where m {\\displaystyle m} is the mass of the rocket and v {\\displaystyle v} is its velocity. Potential energy is energy that results from where an object is relative to the bodies in the system. In physics, we typically define the potential energy to be 0 at an infinite distance from Earth. Since the gravitational force is attractive, the potential energy of the rocket will always be negative (and smaller the closer it is to Earth). Potential energy in the Earth-rocket system is thus written as − G M m r , {\\displaystyle -{\\frac {GMm}{r}},} where G {\\displaystyle G} is Newton's gravitational constant, M {\\displaystyle M} is the mass of Earth, and r {\\displaystyle r} is the distance between the two masses' centers."

When the rocket achieves the minimum velocity required to escape Earth, it will eventually stop at an infinite distance from Earth, so K 2 = 0. {\\displaystyle K_{2}=0.} Then, the rocket will not feel Earth's gravitational pull and will never fall back to Earth, so U 2 = 0 {\\displaystyle U_{2}=0} as well.
