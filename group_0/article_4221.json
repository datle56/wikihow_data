      "title": "Locate the filling tab on the outside of your balloon.",
      "content": "Locate the filling tab on the outside of your balloon. All foil balloons have a small, 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) filling tab designed to easily blow up your balloons. Typically, this is on the outside of the balloon toward the bottom, and the tab is secured by 2-3 layers of plastic. [1] X Research source For instance, you can find this approximately where you attach a string to a standard balloon."

    {
      "title": "Insert a drinking straw into the tab to help you blow it up.",
      "content": "Insert a drinking straw into the tab to help you blow it up . You can use any standard drinking straw to help you fill up the balloon. When you locate the filling tab, separate the 2 layers of plastic, and slip the straw in between. Then, insert your straw until you break the inner seal, which is about 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) in. You’ll feel the seal snap as you insert the straw. [2] X Research source Some balloon kits will come with a straw included with the directions."

      "content": "Pinch the straw and filling tab so air doesn't come out as you inflate it. To hold the straw in place, pinch either side with your fingers. Continue holding the filling tab as you blow air into the balloon. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Blow into the end of the straw to fill the balloon with air.",
      "content": "Blow into the end of the straw to fill the balloon with air. Take a deep breath in, and blow steadily and gradually into the straw. Then, take another deep breath, and repeat the process until the balloon is full of air. The number of breaths will depend on the size and shape of the balloon. [4] X Research source When the balloon is firm to the touch, it has enough air. Be careful not to blow too much air into the balloon . If you keep blowing, the balloon will eventually pop."

    {
      "title": "Remove the straw and pinch the seal to close it up.",
      "content": "Remove the straw and pinch the seal to close it up. When the balloon is full of air, pinch the filling tab in between 2 fingers, and gently pull out the straw. Doing this automatically secures your balloon, as the filling tab is self-sealing. You can attach the balloon to a string or tape it to a wall or post for instance. If you fill your balloon with air from a straw, your balloon should stay inflated for about 1 month or longer."

      "title": "Get an air pump with a narrow tip for best results.",
      "content": "Get an air pump with a narrow tip for best results. If you want to easily fill up your balloon, find a hand pump that has a narrow tip. The smaller the tip, the easier it is to get inside the filling tab. [5] X Research source Ideally, you want a tip that is thin and about 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) long. Usually, the nozzle is angled, and you can easily insert it into the opening of the foil."

      "title": "Place the air pump in between the plastic seal on the filling tab.",
      "content": "Place the air pump in between the plastic seal on the filling tab. The filling tab is a small section of the balloon that allows you to fill it with air. There are typically 2 layers of plastic inside the filling tab. Slip the tip of the pump in between the plastic layers so you can fill up the balloon. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold the plastic seal tightly so the air doesn’t come out.",
      "content": "Hold the plastic seal tightly so the air doesn’t come out. Use 1 hand to pinch the balloon around the opening so the air stays inside. This way, you can fill up the balloon rather than letting the air out. [7] X Research source You can use your non-dominant hand to do this, for instance."

    {
      "title": "Pump the air into the balloon to fill it up.",
      "content": "Pump the air into the balloon to fill it up. With your dominant hand , crank the pump or press up and down on the pumping unit repetitively to fill the balloon with air. Continue pumping until the balloon is about 98% full. [8] X Research source At this point, the balloon will be firm but still slightly bouncy. [9] X Research source It is easy to overfill the balloon when using a hand pump, so be careful as you do this."

    {
      "title": "Remove the tip of the pump and pinch the balloon closed.",
      "content": "Remove the tip of the pump and pinch the balloon closed. After the balloon is mostly full, secure the filling tab with your hand, and gently pull the tip of the pump out of the balloon. As you do this, the balloon will seal itself. [10] X Research source The inside of the filling tab comes coated with a self-sealing adhesive."

      "content": "Insert the nozzle of the helium tank into the filling tab of the balloon. Place the opening of the balloon around the nozzle of the helium tank so the nozzle is about 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) in. This is known as the filling tab. [11] X Research source As you fill the balloon, hold onto the filling tab securely."

      "content": "Press down on the nozzle of the tank to gently fill the balloon. To add air to the balloon, simply push the nozzle downward slightly while holding onto the filling tab. You'll notice the balloon start to fill with air. Continue pressing down on the nozzle until the balloon is completely full. [12] X Research source Keep a secure grip, as the air may come out pretty quickly."

      "content": "Remove the nozzle from the balloon after it is full. Your balloon is full of air when the center is firm but the outer edge is still slightly wrinkled. At this point, simply slip the filling tab off of the nozzle. When you do this, the balloon will seal itself with the adhesive strip on the inside of the balloon. [13] X Research source"
