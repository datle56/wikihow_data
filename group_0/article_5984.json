With the many available food choices, it can be overwhelming to select which one is best for your Chihuahua. Look for a dry food that contains approximately 30 to 33% protein. Because a high-salt diet can contribute to kidney and heart problems in small dogs, the dog food you choose should be low in salt. Consult with your veterinarian or a respected Chihuahua breeder for additional recommendations on high-quality dry dog foods."

      "title": "Do not overfeed your Chihuahua.",
      "content": "Do not overfeed your Chihuahua. Obesity is a major problem in Chihuahuas. Your Chihuahua’s outsized personality and high energy level may lead you to feed her more than she needs, which can cause obesity. Start by feeding her the amount recommended on the bag of food, but also learn to body score your dog and monitor her weight. Check both regularly and if she is gaining weight, then decrease the amount you feed her by five to ten percent. Because of your Chihuahua’s small size, even the occasional table scrap or treat can add a significant number of calories to her daily diet, which could lead to eventual obesity. Overfeeding can lead to other serious medical problems, such as abnormal bone development, skin problems, arthritis, heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes. How much you feed your Chihuahua can depend on several factors, such as age, activity level and specific medical needs. Talk with your veterinarian if you are unsure about how much to feed your Chihuahua."

      "content": "Establish a feeding schedule for your Chihuahua. Since your Chihuahua has a small stomach, he will not be able to eat large quantities at a time. Multiple daily feedings are recommended. Extremely small Chihuahuas (less than three pounds) may need to be fed as frequently as every four hours. Larger Chihuahuas can be fed two to three times a day. How often you feed your dog will also depend on his age, activity level, and medical needs. Try different feeding schedules to determine what works best for you and your Chihuahua. Rather than feeding your Chihuahua at exactly the same time each day, feed him within a general time range. This can prevent your Chihuahua from becoming too demanding at meal time. Allow your Chihuahua about 15 to 20 minutes to eat, and keep others away during mealtime — your Chihuahua should not feel like he has to defend his food."

Rather than having an ideal body condition (e.g., visible waist, slightly visible ribs, an upward tummy tuck from his chest to his hind end), obesity will cause him to look plump. Oily, flaky, or dry skin is also indicative of dietary problems. If your Chihuahua has a dull coat or dull-looking eyes, he may have some dietary insufficiencies. Abnormal feces (diarrhea, very hard feces) can indicate dietary problems. If you suspect your Chihuahua is suffering from dietary-related problems, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian to discuss potential dietary changes."

Non-core vaccines, including Lyme disease, leptospirosis, and several others, are optional vaccines. Factors, such as your dog’s health and geographic location, have influence over how susceptible your chihuahua is to infection. Your chihuahua should get parvovirus when she is 5 weeks old. Your chihuahua should get a rabies vaccination when she is 12 weeks old. Your chihuahua should at least get a combination vaccine several times while a puppy and then every 1-3 years as an adult.

Spaying eliminates any chance of pregnancy or ovarian cancer, decreases the risk of mammary tumors, and stops the heat cycle from occurring.
