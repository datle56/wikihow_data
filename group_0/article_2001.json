      "content": "Don't feel ashamed if you wet the bed. It's embarrassing to wet the bed, but there's no use crying over the situation. If you make a few adjustments to prevent an accident during the sleepover, you can attend to it without worry. You may feel embarrassed, but even at age eleven, twelve, or thirteen, lots of kids still wet the bed. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider whether you can trust your host with information about your problem. Hosts who are true friends of yours should keep your secret and won't make you feel ashamed. If you're not sure you trust them, you may have to be more discreet or have your parents discuss their parents' issues, rather than looping them in. If you respond to the host soon after you get the sleepover invitation, you can always decline without telling them why. Bedwetting can be linked with medical conditions that can affect people of all sorts. Just like some people can't see without glasses, and some can't get around without a wheelchair, some people have trouble with urinary control. A true friend will understand and accept that it's an unintentional medical issue. Sometimes people may have sensitive bladders or even sleep really still and don't wake up when their bladder tells them."

      "content": "Try to find a reliable prevention method for accidents. Getting into a routine before the sleepover will help you get used to it. Have your parents help you choose a reliable prevention method. You might use bedwetting diapers, bedwetting pads, or any of the other bedwetting protection products available. You'll inevitably need some help learning the ropes with any of these, and your parent's advice can be valuable. You may be hesitant to wear a protective garment like bedwetting diapers, but you may also find it comforting to know you won't have a visible accident."

      "title": "Utilize your prevention methods any time you may drift off to sleep.",
      "content": "Utilize your prevention methods any time you may drift off to sleep. Get used to your protection methods any time you either take a nap or go to bed. Even if you plan to wake soon, practicing with their use can help you feel ready for the sleepover. Make sure you have some back-up packs of diapers and/or bedwetting pads. You'll want enough for emergencies and so that you can practice wearing them before the sleepover. Use nighttime-specific/bedwetting diapers (not training pants or similar lighter diapers) to make sure they can hold the result of an accident all night and that they fit you well when you wear them. Place a new disposable bed pad on the bed. You may want to purchase more than one pack for extra coverage. The most common bed mats sold for bedwetting are called Goodnites Bed Mats and are available at most supermarkets and online retailers. You may also need a waterproof mattress cover so any overflowing urine won't make it onto the mattress. You can find these at various retailers, including Toys 'R' Us. If possible and practical, you may want to use a cover at your host's house too, but the feasibility of this may depend on where you're sleeping and what you're willing to tell them about your bedwetting."

      "content": "Set up a system to ensure you won't forget to change into your diaper before bed. You may choose to keep your bedwetting diaper packages out and visible at first, so you don't forget them. Have your parents check on your supplies every few days to make sure you don't run out. It's better to be prepared for an emergency than to run out. As long as you have some emergency and back-up supplies, you should be fine. Set up your changing routine so changes can be quick and easy. Open your disposable bedwetting diaper packages properly so that it's easy to grab a fresh diaper quickly. Use a fresh diaper each night. Used diapers should be thrown away regardless of whether or not you had an accident in them."

      "title": "Watch your use of the diapers before the sleepover.",
      "content": "Watch your use of the diapers before the sleepover. Track your daily diaper use and discuss with your family how you can tackle problems you may encounter. Ensure you know how to change your own bedwetting diapers at the sleepover, and get help practicing if needed."

Ensure that you pack more than one disposable bedwetting diaper to ensure that you don't have any protection problem accidents during the night, along with at least two sets of clean clothes. Pack a bed mat or two on the bottom to cushion the backpack and clothes and keep things clean. Be sure to pack a few plastic grocery bags too, for used diapers and so you can bring home any wet clothes to wash and dry."

Make sure they know you have a system, so they realize you won't damage the mattress. Some parents may need reassurance that you'll have the supplies you need, and they won't be responsible for cleaning up."

You can be discrete about your habits, but your host or any of the other sleepover invitees may realize that you're wearing diapers or using bedwetting pads. You don't have to be ashamed. If asked, tell them, \"It doesn't happen much, but I wanted to be safe.\" You're entitled to your privacy, and you don't have to explain any more than you want to. If the parents corner you and ask you about your bedwetting problem, talk to them privately over on the side when their kids aren't in earshot range. The parents may need to be reassured that you can handle your problems yourself so that they may check in with you. Just explain that you have it under control. Don't be shy or ashamed. Say as much or as little as you want to say about it. Determine if you can divulge your secrets to the host family's kids. Don't be shy or ashamed, but tell them what you want to tell them. It's easy enough to be fairly discrete about your underwear and bathroom habits."

The diaper and bed mat may protect your body and the bed, but no piece of clothing is foolproof, no matter what it claims. Keep some spare supplies and clothes nearby for a quick change if needed. If your bedwetting is severe, you might want to choose to double-diaper yourself. However, for most bedwetters, double-diapering isn't needed."

If you have time before the host family's kid awakens, you might be able to slip into the bathroom and change yourself out of the diaper early. However, if the host family's kids are awake and want to be discreet, you may prefer to delay your clothing change. If you don't have enough time to change when you wake up, you may end up having to change your clothes once you are back at home. However, if you did have an accident, your diaper may smell, so changing right away is preferable."
