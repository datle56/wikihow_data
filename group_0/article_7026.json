      "content": "ChatGPT requires a phone number to create an account for security reasons. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, uses your phone number to verify that you're a real person. Your phone number is also used to identify the country you live in, which is necessary because ChatGPT isn't available in all countries. Unfortunately, you can't use ChatGPT until your account is verified. [1] X Research source It's not possible to sign up with a landline or most VoIP numbers. This means you can't use Google Voice , Dingtone, TextNow, or other online phone number services to create a ChatGPT account."

      "content": "Use WhatsApp (in some regions). In certain countries where ChatGPT is not officially available, you can use WhatsApp instead of a phone number to verify your account. WhatsApp will appear as a verification option if you live in India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Israel, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Ukraine, Malaysia, Egypt, or Turkey only. [2] X Research source And while WhatsApp does require a phone number for sign-up, you can use a landline or VoIP number. When creating your ChatGPT account, select your country from the drop-down menu. If you select one of the WhatsApp-supported countries, you'll see \"Do you have WhatsApp?\" below the phone number field. If you don't see this option, it's usually because you're using a VPN server in a different country. Disable your VPN , or switch to a server in your own country. Tap Yes , then tap Send code via WhatsApp to receive your code. Finally, enter the code to verify your account and start using ChatGPT."
