Feel for the mouthfuls of air traveling down your esophagus. In effect, you are transferring air from your lungs into your stomach.

Inhale again and swallow the air to continue filling your tummy. If this feels kind of weird at first, you’re probably doing it right! Swallow 2-3 more times until you feel like your stomach is full.

      "content": "Let out your massive and monstrous burp. Open your mouth and let all the air out to burp. As you let the air out, squeeze with your stomach muscles. This may take some practice. The goal is to squeeze your stomach like a bellows to force the burp out in one loud push. Use your diaphragm and abdominal muscles to firmly (but not violently) push. If done correctly, you'll get a loud belch. [4] X Research source Keep practicing and you’ll get better and better at burping quickly and loudly on demand ."

      "content": "Fuel your burp by eating a big meal quickly. People normally need to burp because they swallow a bunch of air while they’re eating. So, you can increase your burping power by eating like a wild animal! Grab some food and eat your meal as quickly and loudly as possible. Take big bites, chew with your mouth open, and swallow early and often. [5] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Club soda, pop, beer, or any other carbonated beverage with lots of fizz will also increase the amount of air in your stomach. Vegetables are also great if you want to fuel a huge burp. [6] X Research source Beans, dairy, whole grains, fruit, and onions can all increase the gas in your stomach and cause burps, too. The gas from a huge burp will contain gas from the food you've eaten. For truly horrifying odor combinations, experiment with different foods!"

The only question is whether your body digests the gases and air or not. If the air and gas float up to your stomach, you burp it out. If you digest the air and gas, you’ll experience flatulence."
