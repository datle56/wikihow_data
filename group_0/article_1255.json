It’s a reminder that you have the ability to turn your thoughts and desires into reality—all you have to do is take action.

For example, if you’re manifesting more money , you might include how much you want or need, when you’d like to have it, what you plan to spend it on, and why that purchase or investment is so important to you. Then, visualize what it looks and feels like to have what you want. Keep this feeling in mind to stay motivated as you work toward your goal. If you’re struggling to visualize, try meditating with crystals to focus your intention— clear quartz and citrine complement the energy of 34 and are great for manifesting. Then (and most importantly), come up with a concrete plan to tackle your goal. For example, if your goal is more money, you could come up with a savings plan or look for occasional extra work to pad your income. Remember to stay positive and optimistic.
