      "content": "Beard burn is a skin irritation caused by facial hair rubbing against skin. Also known as “stache rash,” beard burn is a type of contact dermatitis (or skin irritation) that is caused by the friction of someone else’s facial hair rubbing against your skin. This often occurs during kissing or oral sex. [1] X Research source The repeated friction causes inflammation and irritation, which can lead to the loss of the skin’s natural moisture. In general, stubble causes more irritation than longer beards because shorter hairs are coarser and cause more friction. Longer beards can still cause irritation, however. Beard burn may look and feel similar to razor burn, but it isn’t the same thing. Razor burn only occurs after shaving."

      "content": "Beard burn often appears as a red, itchy rash. The friction of the facial hair rubbing against the skin often causes the skin to become inflamed, red, itchy, and dry. In severe cases, beard burn may cause a red rash that’s swollen, painful, and bumpy. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While beard burn can occur anywhere facial hair touches the skin, it’s commonly found on the lips and face because of kissing and on the outer parts of the genital area because of oral sex. In some cases, beard burn may also cause small, pimple-like bumps. These can sometimes be pus-filled, as well."

      "content": "Avoid sexual activity until the burn goes away. While it may not be ideal, if you have beard burn on your genital area, it’s best to avoid sexual activity until the burn heals. Sexual activity causes friction that may make your burn worse. It can also increase your chances of developing an STI, as the beard burn may have caused small cuts in your skin. [10] X Research source If you really can’t wait until the beard burn heals completely, practice safe sex by using a condom or another physical barrier.

      "content": "Keep your own skin moisturized. If you get beard burn on your face, regularly apply a barrier cream and/or moisturizer. This can help prevent irritation and redness caused by moisture, friction, or contact with harsh substances. Apply moisturizer and/or barrier cream after washing your face or right after you get out of the shower. [13] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source “The term ‘moisturizer’ can be misleading,” explains dermatologist Lydia Shedlofsky, DO. “Moisturizer cream and lotion do not put water back into the skin. They simply prevent water loss and can restore the top layer of the skin. Therefore, applying facial cream or moisturizer should be performed shortly after washing or wetting the face to prevent water loss.”"

      "content": "Anyone can get beard burn, but those with sensitive skin are more susceptible. Anyone can develop beard burn after coming into contact with facial hair. However, those with sensitive skin are more prone to irritation because of their skin’s heightened reactivity to external factors, like friction. Those with dry skin can also be more susceptible, as the friction strips away natural oils from the skin. [17] X Research source If you have skin conditions like rosacea or eczema, be extra careful if your partner has facial hair. You’re also at higher risk of developing beard burn if you have a sunburn or rash or if you’ve recently had a chemical peel. Some medications and skin products, like retinol and exfoliators, can also leave you more susceptible."
