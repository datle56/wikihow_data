      "content": "Find a private, quiet area where you can talk. You should ask your friend to meet you in an area that is quiet and not very crowded so you can talk in private. Choose an area that feels like neutral ground, as you do not want your friend to feel uncomfortable. You may opt for a quiet spot at school or a bench in a park nearby. [1] X Research source You may also choose a coffee shop or local hang out you and your friend enjoy going to.

      "content": "Express regret for your actions. Start the conversation by expressing regret for what you did to your friend. Humble yourself and be vulnerable. Do not get defensive or make up excuses for your actions. Instead, let your friend know that you regret what you did and realize it was wrong. [2] X Research source For example, you may say to your friend, “I realize now that pulling that prank on you was wrong and inconsiderate. I regret doing that to you.” Or you may say, “I know now that lying to you was the wrong thing to do. I regret my actions.” Make sure that you do not use this as an opportunity to point out things they may have done to you in the past."

      "content": "Use “I” statements in your apology. You should then apologize to your friend in a sincere, heartfelt way. Always use “I” statements in your apology and focus on your perspective on what you did. Do not use “you” or “we”, as this can come off like you are blaming your friend for your mistake. Instead, focus on your actions only in your apology. [3] X Research source For example, you may say “I am truly sorry for what I did to you. I hope you can accept my apology.” Or, you may say, “I realize now what I did was wrong. I am very sorry for my actions.” You may also want to acknowledge that you may have hurt your friend. Try saying something like, “I’m sorry that I hurt you.”"

      "content": "Tell your friend you will adjust your behavior. Even if your friend accepts your apology and forgives you, it still may take time for your friendship to recover. You should take steps to make amends for your behavior so your friendship can move forward in a positive way. Making amends, even in a small way, can help your friend get over your mistake. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source You may make amends by making a promise to change your behavior. For example, you may tell your friend, “I will be more honest with you going forward and never lie to you again” or “I will not play any more pranks on you.” You can also ask your friend how you can make amends for your actions and be willing to follow through on their response. You may ask, “What can I do to make it up to you?” or “How can I repair our friendship?” If you don't show that you've changed your behavior, your friend won't see your apology as genuine.

      "content": "Let your friend have some space. Though you may have a good talk with your friend and feel you have both reached a better place in your friendship, your friend may still need time to process and accept your apology. You should step back and give your friend some space. Allow them some time to digest your apology and work through their own feelings around forgiving you. [6] X Research source For example, you may tell your friend, “I know this is a lot to process and I understand if you want some time alone to digest my apology.” You may then follow up with your friend in a few days to see how they are doing and to try to talk to them again. They may be more willing to renew your friendship if they have had some time away to process their feelings."

      "content": "Maintain healthy boundaries. Friends are close by nature and you may have a very close relationship with your friend. It may become even closer once they have forgiven you and your friendship has recovered. But you should still try to maintain healthy boundaries in your friendship. This means you may not spend every waking minute together, and you should set aside time to hang out with other friends or partners. Having boundaries in your friendship will ensure you do not become too emotionally wrapped up in your interactions with your friend. [9] X Research source For example, you may make plans once a week with your friend so you have time to hang out. But you may then devote the rest of your time to studying for school, spending time with your family, and hanging out with your partner. Having a balance in your life will ensure none of your relationships suffer or become too emotionally draining."
