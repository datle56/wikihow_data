It's important to be familiar with the terms that are used for calculating specific heat before you learn the formula for specific heat. You'll need to know how to recognize the symbol for each term and to understand what it means. Here are the terms that are commonly used in the equation for calculating the specific heat of a substance: [1] X Research source Delta, or the \"Δ\" symbol, represents the change in a variable. For example, if your first temperature (T1) is 150ºC, and your second temperature (T2) is 20ºC, then ΔT, or the change in temperature, represents 150ºC - 20ºC, or 130ºC. The mass of the sample is represented by \"m\". The amount of heat is represented by \"Q\". The amount of heat is represented by \"J\", or Joules. \"T\" is the temperature of the substance. Specific heat is represented by \"C p \"."

Once you become familiar with the terms used for calculating specific heat, you should learn the equation for finding the specific heat of a substance. [2] X Research source The formula is: C p = Q/mΔT . [3] X Research source You can manipulate this formula if you want to find the change in the amount of heat instead of the specific heat. Here's what it would look like: ΔQ = mC p ΔT"

[4] X Research source Let's look at this problem: Find the specific heat of 350 g of an unknown material when 34,700 Joules of heat are applied, and the temperature rises from 22ºC to 173ºC with no phase change."
