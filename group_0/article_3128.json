      "content": "Learn through script reading. Read the scripts of your favorite plays and movies. Familiarize yourself with the classics, like Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Anton Chekov, and Tennessee Williams. [1] X Research source Read these scripts aloud on your own or with friends. With every reading, try to capture the feeling and emotion in the scene. By exposing yourself to the \"greats\" of play writing, you'll build up your knowledge of good scripts and develop an intuition for reading them. Many copies of your favorite scripts can be found in part or whole online. Do a general keyword search for your favorite movies to find these. The classics, especially ancient ones (like Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus) can usually be found online for free. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Watch great actors.",
      "content": "Watch great actors. Deconstruct your favorite actors' habits. How do they use their bodies? What facial expressions do they use effectively? Practice these gestures and expressions in a mirror. Exercise your facial muscles by doing things like smiling in uncommon ways, raising your eyebrows, raising one eyebrow at a time, puffing out your cheeks, and so on. While some facial expressions, like quirking a single eyebrow, can be difficult at first, as you practice they should become easier. Combine your favorite gestures and expressions with a recitation of your favorite lines from scripts, movies, and plays. This is an excellent way to integrate your body with spoken lines."

      "title": "Develop audition material.",
      "content": "Develop audition material. Some auditions will require you to read from a pre-selected piece or a portion of the script that will be used in the show. In many cases, however, you'll have to choose your own audition piece. [3] X Research source Monologues are common requirements for individual auditions. [4] X Research source Find books of monologues at your local library or online. Try to choose at least two tonally contrasting monologues that are rock-solid home runs and that aren't frequently performed. [5] X Expert Source Jim Jarrett Acting Teacher Expert Interview. 28 April 2020. Perform your favorite monologues to friends, family, and strangers. Ask for feedback. Friends and family may be overly kind to you, so it's a good idea to perform in front of people you don't know, too. Steer clear of monologues that pop up when you search something like \"best monologues,\" and also try to choose one that isn't from an iconic film or performance. You don't want to be compared to multiple people, and you don't want to be automatically compared to Oscar winners either.

      "title": "Get a professional headshot.",
      "content": "Get a professional headshot. When you audition, especially for serious parts, a headshot is often required. This is generally an 8x10, high-quality print where your face is clearly visible. While it may be tempting to just have a friend take these, professionally done headshots are essential at any level higher than basic commercial work. [7] X Expert Source Jim Jarrett Acting Teacher Expert Interview. 28 April 2020. Your name should be on the print, in most cases in the lower right hand corner. To this print, you'll need to staple an acting resume, which includes things like: Your basic stats (hair and eye color, height, weight, age, etc.) Acting training and experience Special skills and abilities the director might find desirable"

      "title": "Take a class.",
      "content": "Take a class. Community centers and colleges frequently offer acting classes. Take an improvisation (improv) class or stand-up comedy class to work on your stage presence, delivery, and onstage flexibility. Beyond simply giving you more experience, you'll also receive professional level critique and advice from the instructor of the class. If you're nervous about taking a class by yourself, invite a friend to join you. Many basic acting/improv classes have open enrollment."

      "content": "Find a suitable performance. Keep an eye on local theatres. These will post casting calls when planning for a new performance. Join acting related social media groups, like those on Facebook or Twitter, to network with fellow actors and hear about potential gigs. When choosing a performance to audition for, keep your personal style in mind. You may be a versatile actor, but oftentimes people are strong-suited for certain roles, like comedic or dramatic ones.

      "title": "Visit the brick-and-mortar location of local theatres.",
      "content": "Visit the brick-and-mortar location of local theatres. Drop off your headshot. Talk to staff and let them know you're interested in getting involved. Getting your foot in the door can help you network and land a future part. Even if you aren't cast in a performance, ask if you can work as a stage hand or backstage. This will expose you to active talent, directors, and producers."

      "title": "Choose a part to audition for.",
      "content": "Choose a part to audition for. All of your audition choices should prove that you're the right person to play this part. Sometimes, you may be asked to list two or three parts you're interested in. Your main part should be the focus, but have some backups on hand, just in case. [9] X Research source In some cases, a director may love your ability, but think you're the wrong choice for the part you've selected. By having backups, you'll show that you're really interested in being a part of the performance and not just a single part."

      "title": "Do your homework.",
      "content": "Do your homework. What kind of performance are you auditioning for? If it's dramatic, you'll want to showcase your dramatic acting skills. What time period and environment does the performance take place in? This might influence how you act, speak, and treat others onstage. Some plays or musicals, like My Fair Lady , are set in a location that requires an accent. In the case of My Fair Lady , which takes place in London, you'd want to show off your British accent. Watch famous, popular, or iconic recordings of the performance for which you're auditioning. These can help you identify features you'll want to demonstrate in your audition."

      "title": "Select an audition piece.",
      "content": "Select an audition piece. The tone of your audition piece should suit the part you're auditioning for. Try to match your audition piece with the local color of the part you're trying out for. Local color includes things like time period, region, and manner of speech. [10] X Research source Analyze the performances of other actors who played the part you'll be trying out for. Include your favorite features of their performance in your own."

      "title": "Audition boldly.",
      "content": "Audition boldly. Make big choices with your audition. There may be many people trying out for the same part, and standing out from the crowd will improve your chances of being remembered. Try not to be over-the-top silly, but aim to leave a mark on those watching your audition. [11] X Research source Come to the audition dressed in period clothing for the audition piece you'll be doing. Be confident. If you're the only person dressed up, that might work to your advantage. Choose a pivotal moment in your audition piece. Craft that moment so it has a large impact on those watching. Usually this involves (believably) accentuating a moment of high energy, like a punchline or dramatic climax."

    {
      "title": "Research your part deeply.",
      "content": "Research your part deeply. Look into your character's backstory. If it doesn't have one, research similar jobs to that of your character to get a feel for the kind of person your character might be. For example, if you're playing the part of Bert from Mary Poppins , you might look into the life of a chimney sweep. [12] X Research source Use the information you learn about your character to add depth to the part. This might be reflected in your gestures, delivery of lines, and more. Think about how a character's life choices or job affect things like their posture or mannerisms. A military part, for example, would likely have good posture."

      "title": "Investigate your part's connection to other parts.",
      "content": "Investigate your part's connection to other parts. Pay careful attention to the words your part exchanges with other characters. These will reveal the inner thoughts and feelings of your part. From these observations, draw conclusions about how your character feels about the world and other people in general. [13] X Research source For example, in My Fair Lady , the character of Pickering is described as \"a confirmed bachelor.\" You might interpret this to mean the character isn't interested in women. In Fiddler on the Roof , the main character, Tevye, sings \"If I Were a Rich Man.\" When playing this part, you might act somewhat self-consciously around successful characters."

      "title": "Embody your part.",
      "content": "Embody your part. Lose yourself in the character you are playing. Train yourself to think thoughts natural to your character. When in-character, your personal thoughts will likely detract from your performance. As a general rule, if you believe you are the character, so will your audience. [14] X Research source A good technique for losing yourself in your character involves imagining yourself and your personal experiences burning up in a flame, leaving only your character behind."

      "title": "Take care of your instrument.",
      "content": "Take care of your instrument. An actor's body and voice are their instrument. Performing on stage requires energy, speed, and stamina. Exercise so you're up to the challenge of performing. Avoid smoking to protect your voice. Avoid drinking alcohol before performing. Alcohol dehydrates you, which can strain your voice before performing. Get plenty of sleep before performances so you feel refreshed and at full energy when you go on stage. It's common to be affected by nerves before a performance. Take melatonin, which is available at most drug and convenience stores, to aid in getting a good night's sleep."
