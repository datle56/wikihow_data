      "title": "Mix a cleansing solution in a bowl.",
      "content": "Mix a cleansing solution in a bowl. Pour 2 cups (470 ml) of water and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of mild soap such as laundry detergent or dishwashing soap into a bowl. Stir the mixture until the soap dissolves. You should see a few bubbles in the cleansing solution, but it won't foam up a lot. Keep in mind that heavily fragranced soaps may scent your shoes for a few days."

      "content": "Dry the shoes if they're muddy. Avoid rubbing the mud into the shoes which will make them more difficult to clean. Instead, leave the shoes to dry completely. Then you can gently brush off the dried mud using your fingers or a small brush."

      "title": "Use a toothbrush to scrub the solution into the soles.",
      "content": "Use a toothbrush to scrub the solution into the soles. Dip an old toothbrush into the cleaning solution and gently rub it onto the jute soles of the espadrilles. Continue to dip the toothbrush into the cleaning solution as you scrub. If your shoes have parts made of suede, use a brush designed for suede instead of a toothbrush. Ensure that you don't saturate the jute with water since this can damage it. Instead, try to scrub the dirt out of the soles and then stop scrubbing."

      "title": "Wipe the soles with a damp cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe the soles with a damp cloth. Hold a clean cotton cloth under warm running water. Wring out the cloth so it's damp and not wet. Then use it to wipe away the cleaning solution and dirt from the soles. If the soles are very dirty, you may need to run the cloth under clean water again and wring it out. Wipe until there's no visible dirt on the soles."

      "content": "Air dry the espadrilles. Set the shoes somewhere with good air circulation and leave them to air dry completely. Don't put them in the dryer because the heat can shrink the fabric of the upper-part. The espadrilles should be dry within a few hours if they didn't get completely saturated.
