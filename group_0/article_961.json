If your straps keep slipping off your shoulders, pull on this section of denim to tighten your overalls into place. [1] X Research source If your overalls continue to slip after you’ve adjusted the strap, you may need to purchase a set in a smaller size, or visit a tailor."

      "content": "Pull down on the buckle to give your overalls more slack. Grip both sides of the adjustment buckle, which is the buckle located further up your overall strap. Pull and drag this buckle down, which increases the length of your straps and gives you more wiggle room. [2] X Research source Most overalls have 2 buckles—1 for adjustment, which sits higher up on the strap, and 1 that attaches to the button portion of your lower garment."

Twist your overall strap so you can see part of the adjustment clip, which helps you change the length of your. Then, take a pair of pliers and undo this latched wire beneath the adjustment wire, along with any latched wire beneath the lower, rounded buckle. Remove both the adjustment clip and the circular buckle from your strap, then rethread the connecting buckle back into place through the circular buckle. [3] X Research source Oftentimes, these buckles are twisted and secured beneath the fabric strap, which helps hold the buckle mechanisms in place. Some overalls may have an adjustment buckle instead of an adjustment clip. [4] X Research source"

Secure the latched wires back in place within the strap so it stays in place.

Drag the buckle upwards so it’s at least 4 in (10 cm) above the bottom of the strap. [6] X Research source You can find overall strap buckles online, or in some fabric stores."

Take the raw, loose edge and fold it along the back of the strap. Set your iron to high heat and go over the folded edge to hold it in place. Repeat this process on the other strap so they both look uniform. [8] X Research source"

Draw 2 dots or other small marks along both sides of the material with permanent marker, chalk, or some other writing tool. Check to make sure that both dots are mirror images of one another so your overalls aren’t uneven once you’ve finished sewing. [10] X Research source If your overalls are really big, you can position the buttons a bit lower over your torso area."

Sew the overall buttons into place along the pre-marked spot to secure them to your garment. [11] X Research source You can find overall buttons online, or in most fabric stores. These have at least 1 opening that helps you thread the button to the fabric. If you’re experienced with a sewing machine, you may be able to adjust your settings and sew the button on in that way. Using more than 1 thread makes your stitching extra sturdy. You may also want to use a thread that’s naturally strong, like a denim thread."
