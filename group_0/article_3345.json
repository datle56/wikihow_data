      "content": "Recognize and accept that you’re going through limerence. The first step to getting over it is accepting that you have it. [1] X Research source Once you do that, you can start working through the process. Take a moment to ask yourself how you feel, or how you're acting, and whether or not those feelings and actions are due to limerence. For example, ask yourself: Am I obsessing over this person? Does my happiness feel tied to this person? Do I care about my other relationships as much as I care about this one? How would I feel if I stopped talking to this person? Is this a real relationship, or a one-sided fixation?"

      "content": "Spend time with your friends to maintain other relationships. When you’re going through limerence, your other relationships start to fall by the wayside. Georgoulis recommends that you “stay active socially with other people and consider dating other people until you know someone well and they show you they are consistent and trustworthy.” That way, you remind yourself that the relationships you already have are more important than the one you’re focusing on in your mind. If you can, schedule regular hangouts , like a weekly game night, or weekend bowling or theater visits. This way, you build healthy social habits that are easy to keep up. Even if you’re just texting or calling friends, it’s the connection that’s important. Limerence can cut you off completely, so staying in touch is vital."

      "content": "Redirect your thoughts to the present moment. When you’re going through limerence, it’s easy to get sucked into a wormhole of obsession, where the only thing that matters is the other person. “Recognize when the obsessive thinking is happening,” Georgoulis says, “and redirect your focus instead on the activity you are engaging in in the present moment.” Mindfulness is one of your greatest tools here. When you catch yourself obsessing, move to another room and practice deep breathing —10 seconds in, 10 seconds out—to stop the spiraling. Focus on your 5 senses to ground yourself. What do you see? Hear? Taste? Smell? Touch? Put away your phone and pick up a physical activity to stay rooted in the present moment, instead of letting your thoughts carry you away."

      "title": "Distract yourself with physical activities.",
      "content": "Distract yourself with physical activities. Try to stay away from intangible things, like scrolling on your phone, which doesn’t engage your body. Instead, pick up a book, draw on paper, go for a run, cook something tasty. These activities all help you stay in the present moment and inside your body, focusing your attention on the here and now. Georgoulis says to do “things you enjoy” to keep your mind happy and occupied. If possible, choose things that are totally disconnected from your crush. If they love gardening, for example, do something else that won’t remind you of them."

[2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It helps to realize that you deserve respect, happiness, and fulfillment, not a hazy and uncertain relationship. Boost your self-esteem by doing something you’re good at, or by using positive affirmations . For example, write a list of everything you’ve accomplished in the past year, or anything else you’re proud of. Also list things you like about yourself, like your skills, talents, or qualities.

Behr recommends reviewing how the fantasy version of this person stacks up to what you actually know about them to help shatter the illusion that they’re perfect. Be honest and ask yourself what you think about them and why. What are your expectations? What are you hoping will happen? Then, make a list of only the cold hard facts you know about them, and not how you feel about those facts. Are they tall or short? What do they like? What do they dislike? Are they bad at anything? You may find that your fantasy and the reality are worlds apart, which can put things in perspective. Or, you may find that you don’t actually know much at all about this person, which can be a sobering reality check."

The age of the internet has made limerence a much easier trap to fall into, since it’s easy to check in and follow your limerence object constantly. Often, the best way to kill limerence at the source is to disconnect. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Disable your social media for a while, block the person, and do your best to live in the real world. Opt for non-digital or non-internet activities instead, like reading a newspaper or book, or calling friends, rather than scrolling."

      "content": "Ask yourself what truly fulfills you, then chase it. Often, limerence is filling some hole. You want something, and have decided that this person is the best way to get it, but that’s not true. Behr recommends identifying your true craving. Ask yourself honestly what it is you want, or what you lack. Are you lonely? Do you crave validation? Do you feel unfulfilled? Bored? Do your best to pinpoint this, then ask yourself how you can achieve your true desire, rather than chasing after an impossible relationship. For example, if you feel lonely or misunderstood, you may want to fall back on a friend or therapist to talk it out. If you feel unfulfilled or bored, you may need to reconnect with your passions and get more involved in them."

It’s a cycle and a pattern, and the best way to stop the cycle is to understand yourself and what drives you. Seeing a therapist , psychiatrist, or counselor is the best way to get a professional opinion and perspective, and to start working through your hurdles in a safe environment.

Slight episodes only tend to last a few weeks to a few months, while more extreme episodes can last years. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source What’s important is remembering that, no matter how long it lasts, it is temporary, and you will get through it. Wanting to end the cycle of limerence is key to shortening its length. If you give in to it, you’ll only extend the time you spend inside it. The length also depends on things like the cause and origin, if you encourage it, your relationship to the person, and your own mental health.

Before, you were totally obsessed, and everything your crush did made you feel better or worse. After limerence, though, you stop caring so much about what they say or do.

When you can’t have what you want, you put more attention into getting it, but only as long as you can’t have it. This preys on your confidence. But after limerence, you have more faith in yourself, and you detach your self-worth from the pursuit of your own desire. Your self-esteem is no longer dependent on wanting someone else.

It quickly becomes infatuation, though, as your feelings become intense and passionate, and your relationship with them starts to demand your attention. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source During this stage, you also idealize your limerence object, convincing yourself that they’d make an ideal partner, and that your interactions are proof or evidence of a spark."

Your limerence lodges itself into your mind, and becomes the main thing you organize your life around. [11] X Research source This influences your behavior. You might develop new habits or let old ones slip, like changing your schedule to match your crush’s, or losing sleep to check their social media.

      "content": "Limerence can be caused by a lack of natural brain chemicals. Those chemicals, called “neurotransmitters,” are things like dopamine or serotonin, which are the hormones that give you pleasure and good feelings. Sometimes, when someone has too little of these, their brain tries to find positive emotions elsewhere, like by obsessing over another person. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is why limerence is also linked to depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions, since these also often deprive you of these positive chemicals."

Sometimes, we feel so unworthy of love and affection that we decide that it’s better to throw ourselves into a one-sided relationship that’s doomed from the start, because it feels predictable and, in a twisted way, secure. We’re afraid of things actually working out, so we go for the thing that’s more uncertain. [15] X Research source Social media definitely doesn’t help this. When we see a constant feed of people’s life highlights, we feel worse about ourselves, and get stuck in a vicious cycle."

      "content": "Past traumas or mental health problems often encourage limerence. Trauma like abuse, abandonment, or neglect can give rise to limerence. [16] X Research source This sometimes happens because the trauma has triggered certain expectations, habits, or behavioral patterns that are easy targets for the one-sided obsession that limerence encourages. It’s somewhat common in people with anxious attachment styles, who believe they’re unworthy of a healthy relationship. For example, if you fear abandonment because of a past relationship, you might seek other uncertain relationships without actually entering one, because you’re afraid that a solid relationship might one day fail."

When we have limerence, we want the other person because we idealize them and think it’ll solve something within us. Limerence also doesn’t necessarily include sexual desire, as love often does.
