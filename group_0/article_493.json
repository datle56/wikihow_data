But it’s not that much more difficult to mentally multiply 53 x 5 = 265. First, separate 53 into 50 and 3. Second, multiply 50 x 5 = 250. Then, multiply 3 x 5 = 15. Finally, add those two results together: 250 + 15 = 265."

[2] X Research source Or, let’s say that your given series is -3, -2, -1, 0, 1. You still multiply the middle number by 5 to get your result — in this case, -1 x 5 = -5, which is also the sum of (-3) + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1."
