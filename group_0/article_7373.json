      "content": "Consider choosing the name of a saint, which is common in Catholicism. Many people choose the name of a saint as a baptismal name—in fact, it used to be a requirement in the Catholic faith to choose a saint name for baptism. Nowadays, this requirement no longer exists, but you may still want to choose the name of a saint that you admire in order to imbue your child with the qualities or protection of that saint. [1] X Research source If you don’t already know of a saint that you’d like to honor, search online for Catholic saint names and descriptions or consult the list of common saint names below: [2] X Research source Francis: For St. Francis of Assisi, a lover of nature and carer of the poor. Peter: One of the most important apostles, lauded for faith and leadership. Joan: For St. Joan of Arc, a French peasant girl who captained the French army. Anthony: For St. Anthony of Padua, known for miracles and a devotion to the poor. Bernadette: For St. Bernadette Soubirous, a girl who saw visions of the Virgin Mary. Teresa: For St. Teresa of Avila, a mystic and reformer with spiritual writings and insights. Kateri: For St. Kateri Tekakwitha, the first Native American woman to be canonized. Hildegard: For St. Hildegard of Bingen, an abbess, mystic, composer, and visionary. Cecilia: For St. Cecilia, the patron saint of musicians. Nicholas: For St. Nicolas, the patron saint of children and sailors."

      "content": "Research names connected to other religious figures, like angels or apostles. Instead of a saint, consider using the name of an apostle, an angel, or another holy figure (with positive associations) as a baptismal name. You could just pick a name that you like the sound of, or pick one based on the attributes in these individuals that you admire. Here are some ideas: [3] X Research source Matthew: An apostle who wrote one of the Gospels. Philip: An apostle known for his questioning nature and critical thinking. Thomas: An apostle who was initially skeptical but became a strong believer. Michael: A warrior angel who fights against evil forces. Gabriel: A messenger angel who announced the birth of Jesus to Mary. Raphael: An angel associated with healing and protection. Mary: The mother of Jesus and a humble, faithful, and virtuous woman. Ruth: A widowed woman known for her devotion, loyalty, compassion, and strength. Rachel: Jacob’s wife and a devoted mother who bore two of the heads of Israel’s tribes. Hannah: A humble and resilient figure who believed steadfastly in God’s plan. Eve: The first woman and the “mother of all living.”"

      "content": "Look into names associated with Christian virtues or rituals. You can keep a Christian feeling around the name without using the name of an actual saint or other holy figure. Many names of Christian virtues have become common names—even outside of the religious community! [4] X Research source However, many of these names are traditionally used for female infants, so they may not be as useful for baby boys. Nevertheless, here are some examples: [5] X Research source Faith: A trust in God and his promises. Hope: The expectation of good things coming from God’s promises. Charity: A generous and unconditional love for God and his creatures. Grace: A name reflecting God’s unmerited favor and love. Prudence: The practice of making wise and good decisions. Chastity: Having purity in thoughts, words, and actions. Temperance: The ability to have moderation and willpower in all aspects of life. Benedict: From “benediction,” when a blessing is given at the end of a religious service."

If your family has a long history of practicing Christianity or Catholicism, then you may want to give your child a name that is honored or cherished by your heritage. For instance, if the baptismal name of your child’s grandparent is “Ruth” or “Michael,” then consider passing that name down to them. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid names that are contrary to Christian values and sentiments. While baptismal names are no longer required to be the names of saints or angels, the church will likely not agree to baptize a child with a name that defies its teachings. For instance, names like “Judas” and “Lucifer” that have negative connotations within the Bible are unlikely to be accepted. [7] X Research source"

In a baptism, a pair of godparents are appointed by the infant’s parents to help with the ritual functions of the baptism, as well as to provide spiritual leadership and guidance to the parents and child throughout their life. If you choose (or if you need some help with the decision), you can ask your chosen godparents if they have any thoughts on what to choose as a name. [8] X Research source"

If you’re converting to Catholicism or another branch of Christianity as an adult, you’ll be choosing your own baptismal name! You have the option to keep the name given to you at birth, of course, or you can select a separate baptismal name to indicate your new identity. Here are some names that center around the idea of rebirth, transformation, or new life: [9] X Research source Kit : Means “bearer of Christ” in Greek. Senara: A Cornish saint's name meaning “one who brings light.” Anastasia: Means “resurrection or rebirth,” while also nodding to Saint Anastasia, who was raised secretly as a Christian despite her father’s Pagan beliefs. Anastasius: Means “resurrection or rebirth,” while also honoring Saint Anastasius, who was martyred under the emperor Nero. Genesis: The first book of the Bible and a word meaning “origin.” Zorah: A Biblical place name that means “dawn.” Liora: Means “God’s light.”"

      "content": "Discuss your final choice of name with your pastor or priest. When you choose to baptize yourself or your child, your church will want you to work with a pastor or a priest, especially since your chosen name must be officially accepted by the church. Your pastor will help prepare you and your family for the sacrament of baptism, so it’s a good idea to talk to them about your choice of name before making your final decision. You can also wait until confirmation to choose a new name. If your child is being confirmed, they’ll be old enough to choose their own name at that point, which can be more meaningful. In the meantime, they can be baptized under the name given to them at birth."

      "content": "Choose the name of a saint that resonates with you, or keep your baptismal name. While baptismal names are often given in infancy, confirmation names are given much later, when a person (typically between 12-17 years old) reaffirms and strengthens their commitment to Christ. Choosing a confirmation name is very similar to choosing a baptismal name , except the person being named has more say in the matter. Here are some quick steps you can follow to choose a confirmation name: [12] X Research source Decide if you want one. It’s completely appropriate within Christianity to simply keep your baptismal name for confirmation. If you already like the baptismal name and find meaning in it, then keeping it can only reaffirm the connection between your baptism and confirmation. If you want a confirmation name, choose a saint’s name. This is the most traditional choice, with most people choosing a saint whose life story, virtues, or actions inspire them. For example, if you have aspirations of being a veterinarian or caring for animals in some way, you might choose the name Francis for Saint Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.

      "content": "Baptismal and confirmation names are given as part of religious ceremonies, while middle names are not. A baptismal name (or Christian name) is given at a baptism, which is a ritual traditionally performed in infancy where the baby “is splashed with or immersed in water by a minister or a priest, symbolically being cleansed of their sins,” affirms Christian theology expert Liz Cooledge Jenkins. A confirmation name, on the other hand, is traditionally a Saint’s name that’s chosen at Confirmation, a rite of passage that marks full membership into the Christian community. [14] X Research source Unlike baptismal and confirmation names, middle names do not necessarily have a religious connotation. Middle names are given for legal reasons, to distinguish someone’s identity from someone with a similar first and last name, as well as to honor family tradition or pass down generational names. [15] X Research source In terms of order within a person’s full name, baptismal names often occupy the spot of a first name or middle name. Confirmation names are typically placed after the middle and before the last name. A middle name sits between a person’s first name and last name. [16] X Research source Of course, it’s unusual for a person to have a first, middle, and last name as well as a separate baptismal name and confirmation name."
