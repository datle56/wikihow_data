      "content": "Check your leafy green vegetables for discoloration and odors. Green vegetables will wilt after a couple days, especially if they're unpackaged. That is okay and doesn’t mean they are spoiled. Greens that are close to spoiling will start turning a yellowish color, become slimy, and have a foul odor. [1] X Research source You can revitalize leafy greens by soaking their stems in warm water for 10 to 15 minutes. This does not always work, however, so if your leafy greens still look droopy after soaking, go ahead and toss them. If you have bagged lettuce, you'll start to see colored liquid form at the bottom of the bag."
