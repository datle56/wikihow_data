You can output to two displays by either using a slim composite video cable with an HDMI cable or by using a cable that features both composite and component video that come with older models. Use a slim composite video connector with an HDMI cable to output from your console. [1] X Research source Use a combined composite and component video cable if you have an older model that comes with these cables, the connector has a toggle switch located on the end that connects to the Xbox 360 console, set the switch to “TV.” Only one television will be able to output sound using this method. You cannot use separate composite and component video cables."
