Then select the theater of your choice by clicking on the name. After searching nearby theaters there will be a list of your local movie theaters and their locations. On some search engines, there may also be a list of movies that are currently in theaters. If you searched a movie title using Google there will be a list of showtimes for the movie at nearby theaters. You can also go to a third party movie ticket website like Fandango and enter your zip code to find a list of theaters near you. Be wary of third party websites that are unfamiliar to you. Purchasing a ticket from an unauthorized seller may mean your ticket gets refused by the theater. If you aren't sure if a site is authorized to sell the tickets, contact the movie theater before purchasing your tickets."
