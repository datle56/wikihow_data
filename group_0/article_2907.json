    {
      "title": "Do your assignments.",
      "content": "Do your assignments. Most people don't like getting homework, but it has an important purpose. Homework helps you review a lesson while the information is still fresh in your mind. It also lets your teacher know if you understand the concepts or need more help."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take neat and tidy notes in every class.",
      "content": "Take neat and tidy notes in every class. Note-taking is a lot of work, but in the long run, it pays off. Writing stuff down in and of itself helps you remember it better. And when the test rolls around, you'll have plenty of material to study from. [1] X Research source Focus on vocabulary when taking notes. Knowing the definitions of different terms in your classes is always helpful. Sometimes teachers might give you extra credit, merits or points."

    {
      "title": "Clear your mind and focus on the teacher.",
      "content": "Clear your mind and focus on the teacher. Focusing on the teacher will not only allow you to learn the subject, but if you don’t listen to the teacher, you might risk not knowing how to study for an upcoming test."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn in your assignments on time.",
      "content": "Turn in your assignments on time. If you turn in your assignments on time, your teachers will appreciate it. Also, some teachers don't accept late work, so you might lose points! Try doing the assignment as soon as possible. Don’t procrastinate until the last minute. The assignment will not receive a good grade!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Study your textbook and notes.",
      "content": "Study your textbook and notes. This is especially important for any subject you have a difficult time with. Bring your textbook home at night and go over previous lessons for the test (and maybe the next lesson, as well). If you study every night, you'll be fully ready for any test you face."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use flash cards when you study.",
      "content": "Use flash cards when you study. Flash cards are useful for geography, spelling, vocabulary, math, etc. Have someone quiz you or use them to quiz yourself. That way, you can build up your knowledge so it will stay with you."

    {
      "title": "Keep a planner to keep track of your assignment.",
      "content": "Keep a planner to keep track of your assignment. Write down your assignments, due dates, test dates, and so on. That way you can stay organized and won't have to worry about forgetting anything."

      "title": "Read every night.",
      "content": "Read every night. Reading is helpful for people of all ages: it helps you learn vocabulary, spelling, and grammar while expanding your mind to new ideas. Challenge yourself to read a variety of materials such as classics, non-fiction, autobiographies and things outside typical school reading lists.

    {
      "title": "Bring your reading book home to study.",
      "content": "Bring your reading book home to study. If you need to write a book report or essay on it later on, it will be much easier if you write down notes while reading. Post-it notes are helpful for marking important pages for later reference."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do further research.",
      "content": "Do further research. After you get home from school and finish your normal homework, why not look into what you learned during the day? Look for newspaper or online articles, essays, and informational books. Look for worksheets or quizzes as well. Taking some notes is a good idea. Try to learn something new every day. For instance, you could research a different math term every day, or a new vocabulary word. Try subscribing to a \"word per day\" website (one that suits your age group). That way you will receive a new word on Twitter or through email every day. Try to research something for each class; for instance, you could research dichotomous keys for science and composers for music. For Literature, you could study poets, and for History, you could research different historical periods."

      "title": "Keep yourself informed on current events.",
      "content": "Keep yourself informed on current events. Read the newspaper and watch the news.

      "title": "Write stories or keep a diary in your spare time.",
      "content": "Write stories or keep a diary in your spare time. This will help you practice grammar, syntax, and creative writing in general. If you dedicate time to writing, your teachers will notice."

      "title": "Be on good terms with your teachers.",
      "content": "Be on good terms with your teachers. Teachers are there to help you. Be nice and respectful to your teacher. Show them that you're serious about your education: pay attention in class, raise your hand, ask questions when you're confused, participate in classroom discussions, and so on. Let them see that you are engaged in the subject. Ask them if there's anything you should work on. And if you need help, ask them for it."

      "content": "Keep it balanced! You need a social life and some fun to be healthy and happy. Everyone needs a break once in a while. Hang out with your friends and spend quality time with your family. Being smart doesn't mean you can't have fun."
