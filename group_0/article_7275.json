[1] X Research source For Amazon gift cards , you can log in to your account on Amazon’s website and go to “Your Account.” Then, select “Gift cards” to view the balance of Amazon gift cards you’ve used or redeemed to your account. [2] X Research source The Amazon gift card must be redeemed (added to your account) before you can check the balance. Once added, it cannot be transferred to another account. Beware of scam sites that aren't affiliated with the gift card company. Only use websites linked from the company's official site, or the website printed on the back of the card. Other sites are trying to steal your card’s data to use it themselves."

Make sure the website you’re on matches the kind of card you have. For example, there are six Visa Gift card issuers (Visa Vanilla, Giftcards.com, Gift Card Mall, Commerce Bank, Navy Federal, and Walmart) that each have their own sites where you can check a card’s balance."
