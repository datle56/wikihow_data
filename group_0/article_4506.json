      "content": "Wear your jacket . A leather jacket will naturally break in over time from the minor day-to-day stresses of simply wearing it. If you want to break your jacket in as quickly as possible, make it a part of your outfit every day! Note that activities that cause you to move, bend, and put gentle stress on the jacket break it in more than those that don't. For instance, wearing your jacket on a day you go on a hike will wear it more than a day you're stuck typing at a computer."

      "content": "Wear your jacket even when you don't need to. You don't only have to wear your jacket when you're out and about. In fact, wearing it when you ordinarily wouldn't (like when you're lounging around the house) will break it in even faster. Be careful about wearing it for rough or messy activities, though — nicks, stains, and tears can be difficult to fix on a leather jacket (though, with the right approach, it's still possible.) Wearing your jacket for the following activities (and others) will break it in faster: If you really want to make the most of your time, you can even wear your leather jacket when you're sleeping to break it in for an extra eight hours each day, as long as it's not too uncomfortable to let you get to sleep."

      "content": "Use unconventional forms of wear and tear. Depending on the type of hide they're made from, leather jackets can be surprisingly durable. To break your jacket in quickly, you can try giving it wear-and-tear from activities besides being worn. Here are just a few things you may want to do to break in your jacket faster: [1] X Research source Bunch it up and use it as a pillow or backrest. Wrap it around you like a blanket. Tie it up in a bundle and play ball with it. Carry things in it, using the sleeves as handles (do not use especially heavy objects) Use it to help you gently stretch your arms and legs"

      "title": "Consider carefully using a mild abrasive.",
      "content": "Consider carefully using a mild abrasive. Some (but not all) leather care resources suggest using abrasives to wear down especially rough or stiff spots on the leather jacket. [2] X Research source If you want to attempt this method, work slowly and stop to check your work often. Leather is harder to repair than other fabrics, so gouging or otherwise damaging your leather can leave it with a permanent mark. Opt for a gentler abrasive, like mild steel wool, high-grit sandpaper, or a nylon abrasive pad. Using something harsher, like rough sandpaper, can cause more wear than you intended. The high-wear spots on the joints (elbows, shoulders) and around the seams are good targets. Keep in mind, however, that this method will actually wear away at the leather ."

      "title": "Use leather conditioner to remove stiffness from dried-out leather.",
      "content": "Use leather conditioner to remove stiffness from dried-out leather. It's easy to forget that leather is made from an animal's skin — if it dries out, it can stiffen and even crack (just like human skin.) If your leather jacket is stiff, cracked, or flat-looking, a little conditioner can help soften and protect it, making it more comfortable to wear as a side effect. Leather conditioner can be bought at specialty shops and online for fairly cheap (usually $15-$30 per liter.) [3] X Research source Good brands include Pecard, Lexol, Leather Honey, and others. Be sure to use a conditioning product that's suitable for your jacket's type of leather. Leather generally comes from one of four sources, each with its own texture: cattle, lamb, goat, or horse. Conditioners are usually formulated specifically for certain types of leather and not for others. Lighter fashion lotions are usually best for softer lamb and goatskins, while heavier all-weather conditioners are often best for cow and horse skin."

      "content": "Wear your jacket for a walk in light rain. It's common knowledge that leather gets a little stretchy when wet. As long as you don't go overboard with the wetness, you can use this fact to your advantage to help break in your new jacket. One easy way to do this (while getting a little exercise at the same time) is to go for a short walk with your jacket while it's raining lightly or drizzling. The raindrops should get your jacket just wet enough for it to become pliant, but not so wet as to damage it. Obviously, you shouldn't wear your leather jacket during a rainstorm. Too much water can stain, warp, or damage your leather permanently."

    {
      "title": "Move around while the jacket is wet.",
      "content": "Move around while the jacket is wet. Before the leather dries, take the opportunity to stretch it out a little. Bend your elbows, windmill your arms, and shrug your shoulders. You can even run, bend, jump, do pushups, or dance around to be sure all of the leather gets stretched. Physical movement is the key here — anything that starts creasing your jacket at the joints is good."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the jacket dry on you.",
      "content": "Let the jacket dry on you. Get out of the rain and into a dry indoor place. Keep wearing the jacket for a few hours until it dries naturally. As the water evaporates, the stretched-out damp leather will slowly shrink until it's completely dry. Since you're wearing the jacket, this will cause it to contract around you, breaking it in and giving it a fit that's unique to you. [4] X Research source If you have to take your jacket off while it dries, stuff it with bunched-up clothes so that it doesn't shrink."

      "title": "If you don't have rain, use a spray bottle.",
      "content": "If you don't have rain, use a spray bottle. Obviously, the water is what's important in this method — not where it comes from. If you don't want to wait for it to rain, just put a little water in a spray bottle and give your leather jacket a light spritzing all over. Wear the jacket while it dries as normal. Be careful not to use too much — remember, you're trying to simulate a gentle drizzle, not a downpour. If you accidentally spray enough to make drips, just use a towel to remove the excess water. The leather won't be damaged if you don't let it sit in prolonged contact with water."

    {
      "title": "Alternatively, use a washcloth.",
      "content": "Alternatively, use a washcloth. Another way to apply moisture to a leather jacket is to do it by hand. Soak a washcloth in water, then wring it well so that it's just slightly damp. Gently rub it across the leather, taking your time and touching every part of the jacket."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't soak your jacket.",
      "content": "Don't soak your jacket. As mentioned above, the methods for breaking in a leather jacket that use moisture all have one important caveat: don't use too much. Soaking leather can cause serious damage. Once it dries, the microscopic fibers that make it up can be stripped of their oils, leaving you with a stiffer, drier product. Prevention is the best fix here: whenever possible, do your best to keep your leather from getting too wet. Be cautious of methods that recommend you send the jacket through the washer and dryer. While the dryer will obviously dry the leather quickly, preventing long-term damage, this can still cause noticeable shrinkage and change the texture and appearance of the jacket. If your leather does get wet, try wiping it gently with a towel, then applying a layer of leather conditioner over the soaked leather to replace its oils as it dries."

      "title": "Don't break in your jacket with excessive force.",
      "content": "Don't break in your jacket with excessive force. Leather is an exceptionally durable clothing material, but once it's damaged, it's hard to repair. Keep this in mind as you break your jacket in — while nearly all leather jackets will be able to handle a certain amount of wear and tear, you should never intentionally do anything that can tear, cut, gouge, or otherwise damage the leather. If you do, you may be wearing the jacket with these marks for a long time. Keep in mind that leather jackets made from lamb and goatskin tend to be softer and more delicate than cow and horse skin jackets. Tears along seams may be able to be stitched up (see our article on mending seams ). However, tears in the middle of a piece of leather can require glue or patches."

      "title": "Don't ignore your jacket's care label.",
      "content": "Don't ignore your jacket's care label. When in doubt about how to treat any garment, including a leather jacket, look for clues on the garment itself. Usually, this will be in the form of a small tag or label somewhere on the inside with care instructions stitched in. Every jacket is different — some may even be made in such a way that the instructions in this article aren't safe for use on them. When in doubt, follow the instructions on the care label, not the ones given here."
