      "content": "Recite the adhan in Arabic, regardless of your native language. The adhan is always sung or chanted in Arabic, with the first iterations of a phrase being fairly plain while later repetitions become more embellished. Here is the adhan with an English translation and the number of times to repeat each phrase: [1] X Research source ٱللَّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ ( Allahu Akbar ): “Allah is greater than any description.” Recite 4 times. أَشْهَدُ أَن لَّا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ ( Ash hadu an la ilaha illal lah ): “I testify that there is no god but Allah.” Recite twice. أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱللَّٰهِ ( Ash hadu anna Muhammadan Rasu lul lah ): “I testify that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger.” Recite twice. أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ عَلِيًّا وَلِيُّ ٱللَّٰهِ ( Ashhadu anna Aliyyan wali Allah ): “I bear witness that Ali is protected by Allah.” Recite twice. This phrase is Mustahabb (recommended) by the Imami practice within the Shia sect, but is not recited by other Muslims. حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَاةِ ( Hayya'alas Salah ): “Hasten to prayers.” Recite twice. حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلْفَلَاحِ ( Hayya'alal Falah ): “Hasten to deliverance.” Recite twice. حَيَّ عَلَىٰ خَيْرِ ٱلْعَمَلِ ( Hayya'ala Khayril 'Amal ): “Hasten to the best act.” Recite twice (Shia only). ٱلصَّلَوٰةُ خَيْرٌ مِنَ ٱلنَّوْمِ ( As-salatu khayrun mina n-nawmi ): “Prayer is better than sleep.” Recite twice (Sunni only). Include this line only before the Fajr (dawn) prayer. ٱللَّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ ( Allahu Akbar ): “Allah is greater than any description.” Recite twice. ا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ ( La ilaha illal lah ): “There is no god but Allah.” Recite twice. Different practices have varying numbers of repetition for each phrase, so consult your imam for clarification."

      "content": "Listen to the words and repeat them silently to yourself after the muezzin. As you make your way to the mosque for prayer, reflect on what the words of the adhan mean to you and remind yourself that eager participation in prayer puts you in Allah’s good graces come Judgment Day. [2] X Research source There are only 2 lines of the adhan that require a verbal response: [3] X Research source After the muezzin calls Hayya'alas Salah (“Hasten to prayer”), say La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (“There is no might or power except with Allah”). After the muezzin calls Hayya'alal Falah (“Hasten to deliverance”), reply again with La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (“There is no might or power except with Allah”). After the adhan is called, recite a short dua (personal prayer) to yourself praising Allah before the formal prayer continues."

      "content": "Call the adhan 5 times a day before each of the 5 obligatory prayers ( salah ). [4] X Research source In mosques around the world, the adhan is called or broadcasted 5 times a day to signal it’s time to pray the Fajr (dawn), Zuhr (noon), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (evening), and Isha (nightfall) prayers. Since the prayer times are based on solar positions, the exact timing changes slightly each day. The Fajr prayer happens right at dawn, before sunrise. The Zuhr prayer happens at noon, or when the sun begins to descend after its highest point. The Asr prayer occurs when the sun is halfway through its descent. The Maghrib prayer is at sunset. The Isha prayer is when the sun’s light disappears and night sets in. Use a website like IslamicFinder to find exact prayer times in your area based on the sun’s position, or download an app like Muslim Pro for reminders."

      "content": "Historically, the adhan was called from a minaret (mosque tower). The mu'azzin (“the calling one,” or muezzin in English) would ascend to one of the minaret’s balconies or open galleries and sing or call out the adhan to the surrounding community, inviting them to come to the mosque and pray. Today, the muezzin (or even the mosque’s imam) typically recites the adhan into a microphone, broadcasting it throughout the mosque and from speakers mounted on the minaret. In some Muslim majority countries or on Muslim religious channels, TV and radio stations will broadcast the adhan to entire regions. Some Muslims also use apps that sound the adhan at prayer time, like while traveling or living in a non-Muslim majority region. [5] X Research source In some towns and cities in Western countries, noise ordinances and other municipal codes may restrict the volume or timing of the adhan (for example, restricting it at night). However, some major cities are changing their rules to allow all 5 broadcasts to be heard. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Muezzins first perform wudu to cleanse themselves for adhan.",
      "content": "Muezzins first perform wudu to cleanse themselves for adhan . A muezzin is the person designated to call the adhan , typically because of their vocal qualities or spiritual leadership abilities. Like all worshippers, the muezzin performs a ritual cleansing ( wudu ) to start with a clean physical and spiritual slate before worship. [7] X Research source Wudu is performed Bismillah (“in the name of God”) and includes ritual washing or rinsing of the hands, mouth and nose, face (and beard), arms, head, ears, and feet. Wudu ends with a short, personal prayer praising Allah: Ash-hadu an laa ilaaha ill-Allahu wahdahu laa shareeka lah, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa Rasooluh. Allahumma-j‘alni minat-tawwabeen wa-j‘alni minal-mutatahhireen. Translation: “I bear witness that none has the right to be worshiped but Allah Alone, Who has no partner; and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. O Allah! Make me among the repentants and make me among those who purify themselves.”"

      "content": "The muezzin recites the adhan facing Mecca. In mosques or minarets, the muezzin faces the qibla wall, which faces the Kaaba in Mecca (or they simply face Mecca from wherever they’re located). Their niyyah (intention) is to perform obediently for Allah; during the adhan , they focus on their devotion and the fulfillment Allah brings to help emote the adhan more joyously and passionately. [8] X Research source Some muezzins plug or cover their ears with their palms or pointer fingers in order to focus more on the words and their intention."

      "content": "A short dua (supplication) follows the adhan . The post-adhan dua is praise to Allah for the “perfect call” to prayer. [9] X Research source Both muezzins and worshipers may recite: Allahumma Rabba hadhihi-dda` watit-tammah, was-salatil qa’imah, ati Muhammadan al-wasilata wal-fadilah, wa b`ath-hu maqaman mahmudan-il-ladhi wa`adtahu. Translation: “O Allah! Lord of this perfect call (perfect by not ascribing partners to You) and of the regular prayer which is going to be established, give Muhammad the right of intercession and illustriousness, and resurrect him to the best and the highest place in Paradise that You promised him. Then my intercession for him will be allowed on the Day of Resurrection.”"

      "content": "Muezzins recite the iqama to begin the formal prayer. The iqama is the second call to prayer, occurring once worshipers have entered the mosque, and leads right into the formal salah . The iqama is almost identical to the adhan except that it’s typically recited faster and softer with fewer repetitions of each phrase: [10] X Research source ٱللَّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ ( Allahu Akbar ): “Allah is the greatest.” Repeat twice. أَشْهَدُ أَن لَّا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ ( Ash hadu an la ilaha illal lah ): “I testify that there is no god but Allah.” Recite once. أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱللَّٰهِ ( Ash hadu anna Muhammadan Rasu lul lah ): “I testify that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger.” Recite once. حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَاةِ ( Hayya'alas Salah ): “Hasten to prayers.” Recite once. حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلْفَلَاحِ ( Hayya'alal Falah ): “Hasten to deliverance.” Recite once. قَدْ قَامَتِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةُ ( Qad qamatis-salaat ): “Salat (prayer) is ready.” Recite twice. ٱللَّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ ( Allahu Akbar ): “Allah is the greatest.” Repeat twice. ا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ ( La ilaha illal lah ): “There is no god but Allah.” Recite once.

      "content": "The adhan was adopted by the prophet Muhammad in the 7th century AD. Most sects of Islam believe the adhan came to one of Muhammad’s followers, Abdullah ibn Zayd, in a dream. When Abdullah told Muhammad about his dream, Muhammad confirmed that it was correct. Ever since, the adhan has been called 5 times a day to gather Muslims for worship. [11] X Research source The Shia sect believes Allah communicated the adhan directly to Muhammad instead of through Abdullah ibn Zayd’s dream. Before the adhan was adopted, Muhammad had considered using horns (like in Judaism) or bells or wooden gongs (like in Eastern Christianity at the time) as a call to prayer."

Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi was a Sahabah (companion) of Muhammad who was known for his rich and penetrating voice. A former Abyssinian (Ethiopian) slave, Muhammad chose him personally to publicly recite the first adhan from a mosque in Medina. [12] X Research source Both the Sunni and Shia sects believe that Bilal was the first muezzin."
