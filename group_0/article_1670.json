      "title": "Unconventional.",
      "content": "Unconventional. Aquarius is an alien walking among us. They march to the beat of their own drum—this air sign is always unapologetically themselves. No two Aquarians are the same, so each time you meet a water-bearer, it’ll be a brand new, magical experience. Aquarians fascinate everyone. Their whole life, they’ve been unafraid to stand out, and this is why Aquarians grow into deeply authentic individuals."
    },
    {
      "title": "Intelligent.",
      "content": "Intelligent. Aquarius might just be the sharpest sign. Air signs are known for being the learners of the zodiac, so Aquarius is fascinated by new ideas and subjects. Our advice? Never take on the water-bearer in a debate, because you’re likely to get torn apart by this meticulous wordsmith. Aquarius’s brain just seems to be on overdrive. They actually tend to get bored with basic, everyday conversation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aloof.",
      "content": "Aloof. When people get to know Aquarius, they’ll see that they have an amazing, loyal heart. But on the surface, Aquarius comes off as distant, cool, and maybe even a little stand-offish. Aquarius just hates to deal with inauthenticity, so small talk and niceties are off the table. And though this sometimes earns them a rep for being aloof, it also makes them fascinating to others. Much of the time, people become obsessed with winning Aquarius over."
    },
    {
      "title": "Humanitarian.",
      "content": "Humanitarian. Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the planet of progress. Because of this, Aquarius obsesses over how the world can become a better place, and how they can effect positive change. Aquarius might be super into social causes, or they might just constantly think of ways to improve their friends’ lives. In short, this air sign is totally fueled by empathy, and it’s a big part of what makes them great."
    },
    {
      "title": "Independent.",
      "content": "Independent. Aquarius is the self-assured, free spirit written about in epics. This sign truly doesn’t rely on anyone for anything—so if Aquarius keeps someone around, it’s because they’re wanted, not needed. Aquarius isn’t afraid to create their own path and strike out on their own. They might choose to move somewhere new where they don’t know a soul, or they might feel comfortable staying in on Friday night to curl up with a riveting documentary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Relaxed.",
      "content": "Relaxed. Aquarius is always unbothered. Trying to pull this air sign into drama? They’re uninterested. Think Aquarius is about to stress out at the first sign of trouble? Think again. In this way, Aquarius radiates quiet confidence. Of course, it should be noted that Aquarius is totally capable of handling a crisis and taking down anyone foolish enough to challenge them. They just don’t need an audience!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Unfeeling, cold, reserved.",
      "content": "Unfeeling, cold, reserved. Some people don’t love Aquarius’ cool, detached behavior. In relationships, Aquarius is sometimes seen as too removed from their emotions, and too inexpressive. Their coolness can sometimes discourage new connections, and down the line, it might frustrate partners and close pals. Aquarius, contrary to popular belief, does experience feelings just like the rest of us—and even if it seems like a waste of time, they should consider sharing them."

      "title": "Attracting an Aquarius:",
      "content": "Attracting an Aquarius: Aquarius can be tricky, because they’re all so unique. Still, there are a few guaranteed ways to stand out from the crowd if you’re crushing on this air sign. Try to: Bring up something random. Aquarius hates everyday conversation. Talk about aliens, conspiracy theories, or off-the-wall facts instead. Focus on being their friend. Most Aquarius romances start off as a lovely friendship. Be a great pal at the outset, and let love bloom from there. Be yourself. Aquarius can smell inauthenticity from a mile away. Focus on being as open and real as possible, because this will draw Aquarius in. Wear something funky. It sounds simple because it is! Fashion is a way to express your individuality. The more unique you are, the more Aquarius will love it."

      "title": "Signs an Aquarius likes you:",
      "content": "Signs an Aquarius likes you: Aquarius can be tough to read, because they’re not a flirty sign. That said, if Aquarius is into you, they’ll drop hints here and there. Specifically: They always ask you to hang. The line between friendship and romance is thin here, so if Aquarius always wants to be around you even as pals, that’s a good sign. They hang onto your every word. Aquarius gets bored easily, but they never seem to get bored of you. Unlike other people, they find you fascinating. They love what you love. If you love Greek mythology and suddenly Aquarius is reading up, that’s a great sign. This means that they trust your tastes! They give you mixed signals. Aquarius themselves might not know they’re into you for a while. If you’re getting any romantic vibes, that’s a good sign. They actually share feelings with you. This is big! If Aquarius gets emotional, they’re probably super serious about you."

      "title": "What’s it like to date an Aquarius?",
      "content": "What’s it like to date an Aquarius? Aquarius will have you in stitches, laughing over something totally goofy. Then, all of a sudden, you’ll be wrapped up in an intense, challenging debate about global politics. This sign will be stimulating, fun, and totally devoted to their partners. You’ll grow to be a sharper, happier, and more authentic person—and you’ll have an amazing new best friend, too. Date night: A day at the science museum or aquarium. Wedding crashing, arm in arm. Volunteering for a worthy cause together. Downside: If you’re looking for fairytale romance, think again. Aquarius is a realist, and they hate mushiness. You’ll do well to focus on what you have, not what you’re missing."

      "title": "Aquarius & Gemini.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Gemini. What happens when you leave two curious, unique intellectuals in a room to bond? A gorgeous, Aquarius-Gemini romance. These two will eagerly share books, sifting through every topic under the sun together. They’ll admire each other’s brilliance, bravery, and beauty. These signs who get bored of everything will, miraculously, never tire of one another. Together, they’ll make up a dreamy, free-spirited, unrivaled romance. Gemini isn’t sensitive by any means, but still, Aquarius might need to watch their tongue at times. This is a minor issue, but if they’re not careful, someone could get hurt."

    {
      "title": "Aquarius & Aquarius.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Aquarius. Aquarius feels like an alien in the world. Who better to understand their heart than a fellow water-bearer? This is one of the strongest double-sun-sign pairings in the zodiac, because what Aquarius projects (uniqueness, intellect, and a rebellious attitude) is also what attracts them most. Plus, two Aquarians will have the same MO in love. They’ll be devoted, while still allowing their partner all the freedom they desire. Granted, Aquarius is a stubborn sign, which means that these two might struggle to fight fair. Both partners will have to remember that they’re on the same team, especially when tensions run high."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aquarius & Aries.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Aries. Aries and Aquarius are idea people, revolutionaries at heart. They’ll energize each other, discussing all of their passions till the sun comes up. Aries will know exactly how to make Aquarius laugh, and Aquarius will know how to calm Aries down. In short, these two have it made in the shade—they’ll love each other, inspire each other, and stand by each other’s side till the end. Conflict might not be a walk in the park. Aquarius is unlikely to give the emotional reaction Aries craves when they’re upset, and fielding Aries’ complaints will feel like pulling teeth for Aquarius. Both partners will have to focus on healthy, open communication."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aquarius & Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Sagittarius. Philosophical explorers of the world, Aquarius and Sagittarius will find the co-pilot of their dreams in each other. Wild adventures, silly antics, and spontaneous all-nighters will be the hallmarks of this relationship. But Sag and Aquarius don’t just bond because they crave excitement and novelty. Under the surface, these two are clever, open-minded students of the world, and this will help them forge a deeper connection. Sagittarius and Aquarius are independent, and hate feeling locked down early in a relationship. This works in their favor. Still, for a romance to follow, there has to be, well, romance. Someone will have to plan dates, light the candles, and lean in."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aquarius & Libra.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Libra. Like Aries, Libra shares Aquarius’ justice-oriented heart. Together, they’ll dream of how the world could become a better place, only breaking to giggle over silly memes or an impersonation of their partner. Yes, these two can match each other’s playful energy as well as their serious values, which makes them an amazing duo. Aquarius and Libra will just click, and communication will flow easily. Emotionally though, who will do the heavy lifting? That’s the question Aquarius and Libra will need to answer. Neither partner wants to gush or get in deep, and yet, their romance will require it. Someone will have to take the reins!"

    {
      "title": "Aquarius & Leo.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Leo. Leo is bright, and dazzling, but a little self-centered; Aquarius is aloof, and a humanitarian through and through. Surprisingly, these two can complement each other well—Aquarius loves to bask in Leo’s glow, and Leo can learn to look outside of themselves with Aquarius. Their spark will be powerful and fast-acting, but this partnership’s success relies on their ability to take things slow. Aquarius and Leo have opposite romantic philosophies. Leo is a softie who dreams of a fairytale. Aquarius believes fairytales are dishonest; they’re realists in love. If Aquarius and Aries follow their spark without a plan in place, they might crash and burn. Instead, they’ll have to ease into a relationship carefully."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aquarius & Capricorn.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Capricorn. When serious, status-driven Capricorn meets the free-spirited, funky Aquarius, an attraction is imminent. Aquarius will fascinate Cap like their favorite mystery novel, and Aquarius is attracted to outcasts. That doesn’t seem like Capricorn at first glance, but internally, this earth sign battles to fully accept themself, which will draw Aquarius in like a moth to a flame. But that’s not to say there aren’t major hurdles to overcome here. Cap is judgmental, and if Aquarius can’t learn to roll with the punches, they’ll be over it quickly. Socially, Cap might struggle with Aquarius’ openness and authenticity (which sometimes, can look like performance art to the untrained eye). These signs will need to focus on putting their love before other selfish instincts to make it out of the gate. But if they do, this could be a very special pairing!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Aquarius & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Scorpio. If you’re a fan of enemies-to-lovers, look no further than the Aquarius-Scorpio relationship. Aquarius and Scorpio are sharp signs, capable of tearing you down with powerful, biting words. In each other, they’ll find their perfect match: someone equally determined, bold, and loyal to their circle. If they find something to unite them, an intense, steamy connection will follow. If they don’t, well, they’re unlikely to get along. The hurdles don’t end there. Scorpio, a water sign, needs an emotional connection. For Aquarius, deep feelings sit like oil in water. These two will need to find a way to meet in the middle. In short: only the strongest Scorpio-Aquarius relationships will survive, but if they do, they’ll be an incredible match."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aquarius & Virgo.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Virgo. Virgo and Aquarius have the same values deep down: they live to serve other people, and they’re loyal to a fault. This could make them amazing life partners to each other, but is it enough? It depends. On a surface level, these two might struggle to get in sync, and in order to enjoy their deeper compatibility, that early connection will be a must. At first glance, Virgo looks like a stiff with a day planner. Aquarius, on the other hand, looks a vagabond wild child. Both signs will have to find a way to see past the tropes to their partner’s inner heart. If they can’t do that, this romance is unlikely to happen."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aquarius & Pisces.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Pisces. Aquarius and Pisces are both otherworldly in their own right, and this can work in their favor. They’ll enjoy people-watching from the corner of the room, and sharing things they just can’t say to anyone else. This is huge for their compatibility—which is good, because there are plenty of hurdles on the horizon for these kind, unconventional souls. Pisces needs someone who’s in touch with their feelings, but Aquarius prefers to call long-distance. Aquarius needs someone with thick skin, and that’s not Pisces. These two will have to compromise and communicate to keep things running smoothly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aquarius & Taurus.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Taurus. Taurus is romantic, sensual, and conventional. They want the white picket fence and 401k to match, but to most Aquarians, that sounds like a prison sentence. If these two end up in a relationship, they’re likely to enjoy stimulating conversations and hopefully, inspire each other to grow. It’s also possible that Aquarius will feel suffocated and Taurus will feel frustrated. Ultimately, this is a tough match. Hope isn’t lost. Venus and Mercury are arguably the most important signs for romantic compatibility, so if those pair well, these two could definitely make it work. Plus, Taurus and Aquarius are both deeply loyal people, which will help them to build trust over time. That’s huge!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Aquarius & Cancer.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Cancer. Cancer is emotional, traditional, and routine-oriented—which generally makes them a poor match for Aquarius. These two want opposite things in love. Cancer’s after a sweet soul who loves to cuddle. Aquarius just wants an open-minded co-conspirator. At first glance, they don’t have much to offer each other. The most intense emotion between these two isn’t likely to be affection, but anger. But is everything doomed for these two? Absolutely not. Sun signs aren’t the full picture, and if their charts are compatible in other areas, they might not have any issues at all, especially if they have other interests and passions in common."
