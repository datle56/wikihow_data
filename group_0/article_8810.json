      "content": "Stop wearing your earrings so the hole can close up. Slide, unhook, or unscrew your jewelry and remove them from your ears completely. Don’t slide any other earrings through the pierced holes, or else they won’t be able to close properly. Your earlobes may not close or shrink to their original size if you used gauges larger than 00g."

      "content": "Clean the area twice a day if you’re closing a new piercing. Brand-new piercings usually heal fast and close completely, but it's important to keep the area clean since the holes are basically open wounds. Follow the aftercare instructions that your piercer gave you, or clean your piercings with a saline solution twice each day. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source The Association of Professional Piercers recommends that you first wash your hands with soap and warm water. Then, dip a clean piece of gauze into saline solution and dab it over the piercing. Pat the piercing dry with a paper towel. [2] X Research source To be safe, clean your piercing twice a day for about 6 weeks."

      "content": "Monitor the piercing over the next few hours, days, and weeks. Generally, brand-new piercings close up within a few hours. If you've had the piercings for less than a year, give them a few days or weeks to close up. Piercings that are more than a year old may never close up completely. However, the holes will probably shrink down and become nearly invisible to the naked eye. Some piercing professionals have seen decades-old piercings seal over a couple days. It really depends on the person! [3] X Research source"

Then, blot your earlobe dry and treat it with antibiotic ointment. Talk to your piercer about when you can remove the jewelry and close the hole.

      "content": "Visit a cosmetic surgeon to get large or ripped holes stitched closed. Tears in your earlobes may seem pretty scary, but they’re easy to fix. Call up a cosmetic surgeon and ask if they can stitch your earlobes back together. Generally, this type of surgery only takes about 15-20 minutes for each earlobe. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source During this procedure, your surgeon will clean out your earlobes with an antiseptic and use a local anesthesia to make the actual surgery painless. Then, they’ll use sutures to repair the damaged skin."

      "content": "Spread petroleum jelly over the wound once a day for 1 week. Rub a tiny amount of petroleum jelly over your stitches—this will keep your ears moist, which helps promote healing. Place a clean bandage over the petroleum jelly to lock the moisture in place. If the skin gets too dry, it’s more likely to scab and scar.

This might be 1-2 weeks, depending on how fast your earlobes heal. Don’t wear any earrings or get any new piercings for at least 2 months after your procedure."
