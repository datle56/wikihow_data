In the Settings section, click \"Add New Address.\" You can add names and addresses for people other than yourself if you want to ship the package to someone. For example, you may want to ship items to your child in college, so you can enter that address as well your own. If you’re worried about your shipping address, you can use an Amazon Locker pickup location, which is a service offered by Amazon. Click \"Save & Continue\" when finished."

You will see a list of all of the offers for the product you are viewing. The list includes the cost and shipping fees, the product condition, the seller’s address, and the seller’s profile information. To narrow your results to either new or used products only, use the filters on the left sidebar. For example, if you don’t want a used digital food scale, you can check the “new” box on the sidebar so that you are only shown new products. Be careful about shipping. Amazon offers free shipping on qualifying orders over $35, but used items often don’t count. When making your selection, don’t forget to consider shipping costs. Check to see if Amazon is fulfilling your order through their warehouse or if you are purchasing from a private seller."
