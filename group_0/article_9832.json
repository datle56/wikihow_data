      "title": "Take your bacon out of the fridge 5-6 minutes before you start cooking.",
      "content": "Take your bacon out of the fridge 5-6 minutes before you start cooking. Letting your bacon come to room temperature before frying helps the meat cook evenly and at the right speed. Take your bacon strips out of the fridge and place them on the kitchen counter for 5-6 minutes before you start cooking. [1] X Research source If you throw cold bacon into a hot pan, it won't release its grease properly, causing it to scorch."

      "title": "Space out the bacon strips on a cool frying pan or griddle.",
      "content": "Space out the bacon strips on a cool frying pan or griddle. Make sure each strip is laying flat and try to avoid overlapping the edges so the bacon will cook evenly. If you need to, fry your bacon in batches. It's usually best to fill the skillet with strips rather than attempt to cook 1-2 pieces at a time—this usually causes the meat to burn. [2] X Research source Cast iron pans, nonstick skillets, and griddles work best for this, but you can use whatever you have on hand."

      "title": "Heat the bacon over medium heat until it starts to sizzle.",
      "content": "Heat the bacon over medium heat until it starts to sizzle. The skillet will heat up after several minutes, causing the bacon to release its grease. The grease allows you to fry the bacon perfectly, so be sure to wait for it! You'll know it's ready when the bacon starts sizzling and making slow, crackling sounds. [3] X Research source Make sure to keep an eye on your bacon—your appliance may cook at a faster rate than conventional."

      "title": "Cook the bacon strips for 10-12 minutes.",
      "content": "Cook the bacon strips for 10-12 minutes. You can start your kitchen timer when you hear sizzling. Let the bacon sit undisturbed in the pan as it fries. You'll know the strips are ready to flip when they crisp up and start to curl."

    {
      "title": "Flip the bacon over and fry it for another 7-8 minutes until it's crisp.",
      "content": "Flip the bacon over and fry it for another 7-8 minutes until it's crisp. Use tongs to flip the bacon over and continue frying it. You don't need to touch or move the bacon after flipping it! Let it fry for another 7-8 minutes until it reaches your desired crispiness. [4] X Research source If you like chewy bacon, fry it for 6-7 minutes. If you like extra crisp bacon, aim for 9-10 minutes."

      "title": "Remove the bacon strips with tongs and drain them on a paper towel.",
      "content": "Remove the bacon strips with tongs and drain them on a paper towel. Fold several paper towels and place them on top of a large plate. Transfer the cooked bacon strips to the plate and let them drain for a few minutes before enjoying them. Remove any excess grease by gently patting the bacon with another paper towel. Draining the bacon also gives it time to cool off a bit. Bacon right out of the pan is very hot!"

Make sure each piece of bacon is resting flat against the surface of the baking sheet. [7] X Research source The bacon strips will shrink as they cook, so they can be very close together."

The end result will be perfectly flat and evenly cooked bacon! [8] X Research source If you want your bacon to be extra crispy, let it bake for 20-22 minutes total."

Use tongs to transfer the bacon strips to the paper towels and let them drain. [9] X Research source Don't leave the bacon on the hot baking sheet to cool. If you do, the strips will continue to cook for 1-2 minutes and might scorch. Draining the bacon on paper towels keeps the meat crispy."

Use tongs to transfer them to a regular plate without draining the first. Give them a few minutes to cool and then dig in! [14] X Research source The paper towels soaked up the excess grease as the bacon cooked, so you don't have to worry about draining them with this technique."

The water will evaporate as you cook, leading to crispier, easily crumbled bacon that's perfect for salads, baked potatoes, and casseroles. [17] X Research source If you want to make a dish taste less spicy, you can add some sweetener to it. [18] X Research source It confuses the chemistry of your tongue because spice is a trigeminal scientific reaction. You can add a bit of fat or garnish the dish with a little sour cream. The fat helps to lift the spice away from your tongue as you eat it. [19] X Research source"
