      "content": "Confirm that the website offers driving records. Each state's department of licensing offers slightly different services. Today, most provide driving records through their website, but others might require you to visit their offices, call them on the phone, or request this information by mail. Florida, for example, does not have an online driving record service. Instead, you must purchase a copy of your record online from a private vendor. Conversely, Alabama requires that you go to a DMV office to get records. Additionally, you typically cannot receive a “certified” copy of your driving record online but instead must go into the DMV office."

      "content": "Find the link. Once on the homepage, you will still need to hunt around a bit to find a link to access your driving records. Every state's page is different, so where this information might be located will vary. For example, the Ohio webpage includes a link on the homepage under \"general information\" called \"Copy of Driving Record (Abstract)\" that will take you to a page with information about how to access your records. In Washington, this information is found under the \"Drivers\" tab but is not immediately apparent from the homepage. Many states' websites have a search function. It is typically located near the top of the page and often in the top right corner. Enter \"driving record\" or \"driver's history\" in this search box and press enter."

Most commonly, you will be asked for your name, driver's license number, and some or all of the digits of your social security number. Some states will require you to create an account in their system with a username and password. If you think you will need to revisit the page again, pick a username and password that you will remember, or write them down."

This website is not affiliated with any state's department of licensing, but is instead an independent, privately-owned company. The site’s primary advantage is convenience. You can access the information quickly and easily in a clear, understandable format. The drawback is that it typically costs a little more than getting your records directly from the state. The driving record from DMV.org is not an official record, so if you need a certified record, you must go through your state DMV (usually by going directly to a DMV office)."

Among other aspects, this law forbids any state's Department of Licensing from providing personal identifying information about any driver without their consent. [4] X Research source State statutes may govern these practices where you operate your business. It's a good idea to find out before requesting any records. This information should be available from the website of your state's government."

      "content": "Get consent. Getting consent will shield you from potential legal liability if an employee ever tries to sue you for violating their privacy. [5] X Research source Documentation may be required to actually obtain the records, and written consent is a stronger legal safeguard than oral consent. An easy way to do this is to simply specify on the application that allowing you to check potential employees' driving records is a condition of employment. You can also use a driving record release form. The form should include information like the following: “I understand that driving a company vehicle (or my own vehicle) is required for this position. Furthermore, I acknowledge that having and maintaining a satisfactory driving record is a condition of employment and will remain one. Therefore, I agree to allow [insert company name] to check my driving record, both before making a hiring decision and periodically thereafter. I understand the company will use this information for employment purposes and will not furnish the information to third parties without my prior written consent. Furthermore, I agree to release [insert company name] and its employees and agents from any liability for damage which may result from furnishing the requested information.” Then include a signature block for the employee to print name and date of birth, driver’s license number, and signature and date."

Just as is the case for viewing your own driving records, you'll need to know your employees' full name, driver’s license number, and possibly a variety of other information including their social security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, etc. Again, using the job application to collect this information is an efficient way to make sure you have all the information you need."

      "content": "Request employees' records. You can request employees' driving records through your state, as described in Method 1, above. However, this may be a slow process, especially if you need a large number of records. If time is an issue, you may wish to use a private company to obtain the records you need. [6] X Research source DMV.org suggests using drivingrecords.com to check employees' records, but there are many other services available, too. For example, http://www.drivingrecord.net/ specializes in driving record services for businesses. If you are running a business that conducts 7 or fewer driving record checks per month, this site will allow you same-day access to the information you need for employment screening purposes. Yet another site that allows you to check both your own records and those of your employees is http://www.4safedrivers.com/ . This site also provides information about additional documents required by some states to access the records of others. That information is available here ."
