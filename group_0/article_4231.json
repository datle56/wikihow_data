      "title": "Tighten the corners of your lips together to “buzz” them.",
      "content": "Tighten the corners of your lips together to “buzz” them. Keep your lips looser in the center and tight in the corners as if you’re saying the letter M. Vibrate your lips together to make a consistent buzzing noise. Put your hand in front of your mouth and check that you’re blowing out a consistent airstream or else you won’t be able to play the horn very well. [1] X Research source It may take a few tries before your lips start buzzing."

      "title": "Hold the narrow end of the horn tightly against your lips.",
      "content": "Hold the narrow end of the horn tightly against your lips. Grab the horn by the narrow end, leaving about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) between your hand and the tip of the horn. Press the hole at the end of the horn against the middle of your lips so no air can escape out the sides. Position the wide end of the horn so it’s pointing up so the sound of your horn resonates better. [2] X Research source You can buy a Viking horn online. While they are regularly made with cow horns, you may be able to find horns made from many different animals. You can also try putting the Viking horn on the side of your lips if your lips buzz more there. Don’t put any part of the horn in your mouth since it won’t play any notes otherwise."

      "title": "Buzz your lips on the horn to play a note.",
      "content": "Buzz your lips on the horn to play a note. As you’re holding the horn against your lips, start buzzing them as you practiced earlier to produce a sound from the horn. If you don’t hear any noise from your horn, then readjust the horn on your lips and try again. Check that no air escapes out the sides of your mouth or else you won’t get a solid, strong tone. Practice holding the note on your horn as long as you can so you can perfect your form. [3] X Research source Viking horns can only play a single tone that depends on the size and shape of the horn. Longer horns take more air to play a consistent note, so take a deep breath before you start playing. Larger horns produce a lower tone while smaller horns are higher pitched."

      "title": "Click your tongue on the roof of your mouth to play separate notes.",
      "content": "Click your tongue on the roof of your mouth to play separate notes. After you’ve practiced holding a consistent tone on your horn, click the tip of your tongue against the roof of your mouth just behind your front teeth while you’re playing. Each time you lift your tongue, you’ll block the air for a brief moment and play short, separated notes. Try clicking faster and slower to change the rhythm of the notes you’re playing. [4] X Research source Practice without your horn by putting your hand in front of your mouth while you practice clicking your tongue. You should be able to feel the breaks in the airflow each time your tongue touches the top of your mouth."

      "title": "Purse your lips more to play higher octaves of the same note.",
      "content": "Purse your lips more to play higher octaves of the same note. While Viking horns only have a single tone, you may be able to play higher pitches by changing your mouth posture. Tighten the corners of your lips more and keep your lips pressed together to limit your airflow more. When you buzz your lips on the horn, the faster air will make your note sound higher pitched. Practice playing your horn while you tighten and loosen your lips to play 2 or 3 different notes. [5] X Research source Large horns may be more difficult to create a higher pitch than smaller horns. You can usually play 1 or 2 different octaves on a Viking horn."

      "title": "Put your hand in the end of the horn to lower the pitch.",
      "content": "Put your hand in the end of the horn to lower the pitch. Turn your horn so the wide end faces toward your free hand. As you play your note, place the bottom of your palm on the outer rim of the horn’s wide end. Wrap your fingers over the rim so they’re inside the horn. You’ll notice the note change to a lower tone as you put your hand inside the horn and get higher when you remove it. [6] X Research source Don’t block the end of your horn completely or else it won’t make any noise."

      "title": "Get a horn with a mouthpiece if you want to play louder.",
      "content": "Get a horn with a mouthpiece if you want to play louder. Some Viking horns have a built-in mouthpiece that makes it easier to form a tight seal. Look for a horn with a metal mouthpiece and play it as you would normally. The mouthpiece will help amplify the horn so it’s louder when you blow into it. [7] X Research source If you want to add a mouthpiece to your existing horn, you may need to carve the hole on the narrow end to make one fit."
