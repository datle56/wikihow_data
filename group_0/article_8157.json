      "content": "Clean salt and grime off your car with baking soda and soapy water. Add 1 cup (240 mL) of baking soda to 1 gallon (3.8 L) of soapy hot water to make a powerful cutting agent. This can be especially effective during or after the winter, when your car is likely to build up a lot of salt. Baking soda is also great for scrubbing rust from your car’s hubcaps. Mix 3 parts baking soda with 1 part warm water to form a thick paste. Apply the paste to the hubcaps and leave it there for a few minutes before wiping it away with a rag. [1] X Research source"

Just mix 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of shampoo into a 2 gallon (7.6 L) bucket of water. Make sure that you scrub with a soft microfiber cloth so you don't scratch your car's paint. Be sure not to use too much shampoo, as undiluted cleaners can also damage your car's paint job. Baby shampoo is ideal, as its gentle ingredients won't harm your car's paint. [2] X Research source Make sure your bucket has a dirt trap . A dirt trap will prevent dirt from clinging onto the rag and ending up back in the car. Use a clean dust mop to reach difficult places, such as the roof or hood of the car."

      "content": "Remove tree sap with a denatured alcohol-water mixture. Denatured alcohol dissipates tar and sap well. After you’ve washed the rest of your car, mix equal amounts of rubbing alcohol and room-temperature water in a spray bottle and spray a generous amount over the affected area of your car. Let it sit for 1 or 2 minutes and then wipe it off with a cloth. This may take a few attempts before you completely remove the sap. [3] X Research source Don’t have rubbing alcohol? Try peanut butter. Dab a thin film of peanut butter onto the affected area of your car and allow it to sit for about a minute before wiping it off."

      "content": "Scrub stains on leather or vinyl with toothpaste and a toothbrush. Apply a thin layer of non-gel white toothpaste to stains on any vinyl or leather surfaces inside your car. Then, take a new toothbrush and scrub at the stains for about a minute. Wipe away the toothpaste with a damp microfiber rag or paper towel, and repeat as necessary until the stain fades. Always test your cleaner on a small area first. There is a chance that the dye can be affected by the cleaning agent. Swap in rubbing alcohol if toothpaste fails. Lightly dab your stain after you've tested the alcohol on the surface you will be cleaning. The more alcohol you use, the harsher the solution will be, and the more likely it will bleach whatever color your car might be dyed."

      "content": "Wipe down plastic surfaces with equal parts water and rubbing alcohol. Add room temperature water and isopropyl alcohol to a spray bottle in a 1-1 ratio. Spray this mixture on hard surfaces and then wipe them with clean microfiber cloths. Tip: if you don't have microfiber cloths, try used fabric softener sheets.

Whether you smoke or not, baking soda in your ashtray or cupholders will act as an air purifier. It may take a few days to notice the difference in air quality, but once you car’s interior smells fresher, wipe away the baking soda with a damp cloth. [5] X Research source If you don’t want to fill your car’s ashtray or cupholders with baking soda, you can fill a mug or cup and leave it in the cupholder instead. For additional zest, add a couple of drops of your favorite essential oil to the baking soda. Lavender, eucalyptus, and lemon are all popular fresh scents."

      "content": "Vacuum any fabric inside your car thoroughly before deep-cleaning. Prior to deep-cleaning, run a vacuum over any fabric surfaces in the car. Failing to do this can make it more difficult to deep-clean; sweeping up loose crumbs and dirt will prevent you from rubbing them into the fabric later. [7] X Research source If you have hair that the vacuum won't pick up (including pet hair), try running a pumice stone over the fabric. Swipe the stone in one direction to loosen the hair, then swipe it back again to pick the hair up."

If you've got gum stuck to any surface in your car, cooling the gum down will help it solidify and make it easier to scrape off with a credit card or a dull knife. Put a handful of ice cubes in a plastic baggie to prevent any potential moisture issues from occurring, then apply the baggie to the gum and wait for it to freeze, about 20 minutes. [8] X Research source Freezing the gum will make it easier to remove it in large chunks. If any small pieces are still left behind, scrub them with a toothbrush to loosen them, then vacuum them up. If you don't want to use ice cubes, you can also use a freezer pack ."

This will prevent you from having to clean up drip marks or trails. [16] X Research source Using a different wiping direction between interior and exterior can help reveal any spots you've missed. For especially dirty windows, use 2 rags, one for wiping away grime, and the other for finishing and drying excess."
