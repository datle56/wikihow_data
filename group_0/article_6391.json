They actually mean slightly different things: The term Latin-American describes people who came from Latin-American countries (or have relatives and ancestors who came from those countries). This includes the regions of Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. It also includes Latin-American countries that use Portuguese as an official language, such as Brazil.

Likewise, a person of Brazilian ethnicity would be Latino and not Hispanic, since the official language of Brazil is Portuguese ."
