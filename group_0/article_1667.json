      "content": "Search up “typing dot GIF,” then choose one to send to your bf. If he’s not looking too closely, he’ll think you’re typing a super long message to him. While you chuckle behind your phone, he’ll wait for hours for the typing dots to become a message—with how long you’re “typing,” he’ll definitely think it’s going to be a lengthy message! [1] X Research source To really spice things up, send him a cryptic text first, then follow it up with the typing dots GIF. This will really get him invested in what you’re “typing”! For example, you could start with: “I have something I have to tell you.” “We need to talk.” “I haven’t been fully honest with you.”"

      "content": "If you live together, text him that you couldn’t say “no” to the cuteness. To make the prank extra convincing, you can search for a cute pic of a pet on the internet, then send a screenshot saying that this is the new friend you’ve adopted. Your boyfriend is especially likely to fall for this if you're an animal lover! Here are some example texts you could send: “Okay, don’t hate me…I may or may not have adopted a puppy.” “So, when it comes to pets, how do we feel about turtles? Because I might have made an impulse purchase and bought one 😬” “Get ready for some kitty cuddles when you get home! I saw her at the shelter, and I just couldn’t say no 🥺” Pro Tip: You can even use this prank as a trial run to gauge his reaction if you really do want to get a furry friend!"

      "content": "Use a photo editing app to alter a selfie, then send it to him. You could edit the photo to add some wild blue or pink highlights to your hair, change your haircut into a shaggy mullet, or just use a filter to make your hair color look different. Just make sure to keep it slightly realistic, so he actually thinks this is your brand new ‘do! This is a great prank to pull to see how he would react if you really did make a drastic change. Will he be honest, or will he pretend to like it to support you? Here are some example texts to send with your pic: “I dyed my hair 🤪 Promise you’ll be honest?” “Got a new hairdo this morning, and I love it! What do you think?” “What would you think of mullets? Because I might have just gotten one…”"

      "content": "Check his schedule and pick a big event that’s coming up in the future. From there, all you have to do is send him a text saying good luck for something that isn’t happening for weeks. After he panics and checks his schedule, send “April Fools!” [2] X Research source “Good luck with your speech tonight 😊” “Heard they moved your test to tonight. That sucks, but you’ll do great!” “Quick reminder that our dinner for you to meet my parents was moved to tonight!”"

      "content": "Throw him off with a long, serious text about a big \"problem.\" For example, you could say something like, “I have to come clean to you about something that’s been on my mind for a long time. It’s time for me to be brave and vulnerable about this and just tell you the truth. So, here goes. I just want you to know…” And then, right after this cryptic message, “reveal” something totally silly and miniscule, like: “You’re the cutest guy I’ve ever seen 🤪” “I forgot to kiss you goodnight last night 😣” “I have a major crush on Shrek.”"

      "content": "Ask your boyfriend why he would post something so scandalous. He’ll likely start scrambling to make sure that he didn’t accidentally post an embarrassing pic. To really amp things up, send your text when he won’t be able to check his social media profiles for a bit (like while he’s in a class at school or during his workday). He’ll totally panic while he’s waiting for a chance to look at his phone! “I can’t believe you just posted that. You know your mom follows you, right?” “Did you mean to post that pic on your public Insta story? 😳” “Ummm, did you not check the mirror in the pic you posted??”"

He’ll be so confused as he tries to piece together what you’re doing! Songs like Elton John’s “Your Song,” One Direction’s “History,” and Ariana Grande’s “Into You” are great choices for this prank. When he gets an opening text like “I’m so into you I can barely breathe,” or “It’s a little bit funny, this feeling inside,” he’ll definitely wonder what’s going on!"

Next, send him the link along with one of these messages to make him think something crazy is going down: “Woah, should we be worried about this?” “Wait, isn’t this your grandpa’s address…” “And people said pigs can’t fly 🤯” “An actual UNICORN has been spotted!!”"

The kicker? The actual prank was the fact that there isn’t one! “They’re going to write a news article on me because of how epic this prank will be!” “How do you feel about spiders? 😏” “If I were you, I would avoid showers today, hehe.”"
