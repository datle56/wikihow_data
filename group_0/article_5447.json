      "content": "Use an extended equation if your height is in centimeters. You can still calculate your BMI if your height is in centimeters, but you will need to use a slightly different equation to do so. This equation is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in centimeters, then divided again by your height in centimeters, and then multiplied by 10,000. [4] X Research source For example, if your weight in kilograms is 60 and your height in centimeters is 152, then you would divide 60 by 152, by 152 (60 / 152 / 152) for an answer of 0.002596. Multiply this number by 10,000 and you get 25.96 or about 26. The approximate BMI for this person would be 26. Another option is to simply change your height in centimeters to meters by moving the decimal two places to the left. For example, 152 centimeters equals 1.52 meters. Then, find your BMI by squaring your height in meters and then dividing your weight by your height in meters squared. For example, 1.52 multiplied by 1.52 equals 2.31. If you weigh 80 kilograms, then you would divide 80 by 2.31 and your result would be a BMI of 34.6."

      "content": "Calculate BMI before considering more expensive and invasive options. A person with a BMI under 25 is considered to have a healthy body weight. However, if you have a higher than normal muscle percentage, your BMI might be higher. In that case, a BMI higher than 25 may not necessarily indicate that you are overweight. If you are muscled, consider getting skin fold testing to determine whether you have too much fat. Along with skin fold tests, underwater weighing, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance are some of the other options available for determining your body's fat content. Just keep in mind that these methods are more expensive and invasive than calculating BMI.
