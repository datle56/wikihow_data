      "content": "Research the qualifications. The job description for a Hooters Girl usually does not require lots of hospitality experience before applying. Instead, most ads prioritize that you should be at least 18 years of age and have the \"ability to maintain [an] attractive and fit image.\" You might find you will become more competitive for a job if you gain experience in a restaurant or cafe taking orders, working a cash register, and contributing to a large team. Although this is not strictly necessary in all locations, popular Hooters locations will consider experience in a competitive hiring environment."

You can find job postings on the \"Careers\" section of the Hooters website (www.hooters.com), but many Hooters Girls report being able to walk into the restaurant and fill out an application after you ask for one. [3] X Research source Because the value of the Hooters Girl is, according to the company handbook, based on her ideal appearance as an \"All-American Cheerleader, Surfer Girl, Girl Next Door,\" you should present yourself in a way that embodies at least one of these three archetypes. [4] X Research source Dress professionally, but in a way that also flatters your body. Consider wearing a pair of skinny, dark jeans with tall boots and a blouse, a flattering pencil skirt or even a body hugging dress in a dark color (like black or navy) when you go inside to ask about employment. Your potential manager will notice your appearance. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Hooters generally does not employ men on their serving staff, although they have faced multiple law suits over this practice. In 1997, they won a class-action lawsuit against male plaintiffs under the reasoning that hiring an all-female waitstaff was a \"bona fide occupational qualification\" for its business (meaning the core value of its business would change if it began to hire male servers).

But you might also be called in to interview at a later date. Wear an outfit similar to what you wore when you inquired about an application. Emphasize your perpetually cheerful disposition. Most job ads for Hooters Girls state that they must be \"fun, upbeat, and entertaining.\" Smile constantly during your interview and do not talk negatively about your past work experiences or complain about former bosses. Talk about your people skills and how you make conversation with strangers. You will probably be asked questions about your past work experiences, how you approach customer service, how you handle stressful situations or work in a team, your schedule and availability, etc."

      "content": "Maintain the correct hairstyle. The Hooters Handbook strictly prohibits wearing a ponytail or pigtails, hats or headbands. Hair is supposed to be done in a \"glamorous\" style, which suggests hair is worn down and long with full volume. [15] X Research source Consider putting your hair in large rollers for one hour after drying as this will give you added volume and pretty waves. You should also try back combing the roots of your hair, brushing it out, and then spraying it with hairspray to add extra volume."

Your makeup must be, according to the handbook, \"camera ready at all times.\" [16] X Research source Basic components of your beauty routine should include foundation (to even out skin tone and cover any redness), concealer (to cover blemishes and under-eye circles), lipstick, mascara and eyeshadow. Your makeup should be wholesome, yet sexy. For lips, stick to colors like pink, coral and rose tones. Avoid dark wine or plum lip shades. For eyeshadow, consider more neutral tones of brown and gray. Do not try anything too dramatic (like a bright blue or purple) or overwhelming (like a 60s eye flick or a very smoky eye). \"All-American\" means pretty and sexy, yet still natural. You are encouraged to think of yourself not simply as a waitress, but rather as a model who has been \"cast\" to play the glamorous guide through your customer's pantheon of Hooters-rooted fantasies.
