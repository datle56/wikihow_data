Place the popsocket on the back of the phone without removing the adhesive covering to see how it will line up. If you want to attach 2 popsockets to the back of your phone, test out their positioning together and make sure they line up evenly. For instance, if you want to prop up a small phone vertically, position the popsocket in the bottom of your phone. You might attach two popsockets to prop up a larger phone, or to store your headphones. Decide if you want to attach the popsocket directly to your phone, or to a phone case."
