      "content": "This phrase means that whatever happens on a larger scale is sure to happen on a smaller scale. \"As above, so below\" has been adopted by myriad groups over the course of millenia, but the definition has generally remained the same. The expression refers to the trickle-down effect of the universe and achieving balance, offering an explanation as to why certain things happen. Those who use this expression may believe that current events are the reflection of that which is happening on higher planes. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the phrase to discuss astrology or the celestial realm. Astrology is defined as the practice of understanding how the celestial realm can explain our actions on the earthly realm. In this context, \"as above, so below\" can refer to the chaos that seemingly ensues when something significant is happening astrologically , like when mercury is in retrograde. Or, you might use it to blame your sun in Sagittarius for the fact that you got let go from your job. Here are a few more examples: \"The new moon is causing people to act like lunatics–as above, so below.\" \"I didn’t understand how people perceived me until I realized I had a Taurus rising ; as above, so below.\" \"You know mercury is in retrograde, so don’t make any rash decisions–as above, so below!\" \"This Saturn Return is really kicking my butt–as above, so below!\""

      "content": "Use the phrase to compare two things on a large and small scale. For example, referring to the way Mother Nature acts as an explanation for other things is one way to use “as above, so below.\" Or use the phrase to point out how humanity may be getting worse because the health of the actual planet is declining. You can even use it as scientific support that all earthly systems are intricately similar, like cells and the universe, once again bridging the distance between the micro and the macro. \"Pollution is definitely affecting the climate, but it's also affecting our physical health. As above, so below!\" \"The cells in our bodies are constantly dying and being replaced, just like stars the stars in the sky are always dying and being replaced by new stars—as above, so below.\" \"You think that was a coincidence? Nope, as above, so below!\""

      "content": "The phrase dates back to the first millennium. With roots in Hermeticism, the phrase was initially found on the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus dating back to 200-800 BCE. [2] X Research source The original inscription was longer, translated to, “That which is above is like to that which is below, and that which is below is like to that which is above.” Hermeticism is an ancient philosophy and religion that combined a number of esoteric topics, like alchemy, astrology, and theurgy, or the process of harnessing supernatural powers. [3] X Research source In this Hermetic context, alchemy can be described as the physical transformations that occur in order to reach a higher plane. Fermentation in the body can cause major changes that they believed could transfer over to the spiritual realm. Hermes Trismegistus was not a real person. In reality, he was a mythological figure, borrowing from Greek and Egyptian mythology, and comprised of several authors over hundreds of years. It’s possible that the statement appeared even earlier in Arabic texts, with a similar implied meaning."

      "content": "“As above, so below” has many ties to the occult. Although it has origins in theology, it has been assimilated by various other groups that are associated with the occult. A few examples of the phrase being used in an occult context: Practices like palmistry seek to identify how different parts of the palm are linked to the celestial realm. Each line has a correlation to a celestial body, pointing to the macro from the micro. Eliphas Levi's Baphomet, is a controversial symbol of the occult. The image depicts a half-human, half goat hybrid that has one hand pointing up and one down, reflecting the balance of the universe and ultimately embodying the phrase, “As above, so below.” [4] X Research source The hexagram is another occult symbol. Made up of one triangle pointing up and the other pointing down, this symbol represents duality and balance. Alchemy is a tool of the occult. Although alchemy is closely associated with turning common metals into gold, the true purpose behind it was spiritual transformation. [5] X Research source"
