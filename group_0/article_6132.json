Watch for signs from your boyfriend to know if it is a good time to reach out and touch him.

In those moments he may need a little bit of time to cool off and think through things. Reaching out and touching him could set him off even more or make him feel he needs an even greater distance. If the two of you are at the end of a fight, and you aren't sure if it is a good time to touch your boyfriend, you can try asking him. Simply ask \"Is it okay if I hug you or hold you now?\" That way, you know if he's in a place where he wants to be near you."

Showing someone grace can often be humbling, but it helps him see that you are understanding and know that you aren't perfect either.

If your boyfriend continually hurts you or is constantly making mistakes, you should talk to him. Communication is key to a healthy relationship, so if you have given your boyfriend grace countless times and continue to forgive him, but his behavior still throws you off, it's time you have a conversation with him."
