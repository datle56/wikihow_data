[1] X Research source In our example, we can find the answer like this: 50 × 1.6 = 80 kilometers . Don't forget the \"kilometers\" label. You can also write \"km\" for short.

Use as much of this number as you want to get your answer more precise. [2] X Research source If we want to know exactly how far 50 miles is in kilometers, we can just multiply 50 by 1.609347. This gets us 50 × 1.609347 = 80.46735 kilometers — about half a kilometer more. You only need to do this for really precise conversions. Just use 1.6 for basic purposes!"

      "content": "To get back to miles, divide by 1. 6. Getting back to miles is easy. Since dividing is basically the opposite of multiplying, divide by 1.6 to \"undo\" the multiplication. [3] X Research source In our original example, 80/1.6 = 50 miles — right back where we started. If you used a different decimal than 1.6, divide by it instead. In our alternate example above, we would divide by 1.609347."

By treating your measurements like fractions, you can convert in a way that makes it easy to get the right answer (and units) every time. Start by writing your number of miles as the top part of a fraction (the numerator ). In the bottom part of the fraction (the denominator ), write a 1. [4] X Research source Let's say that we want to figure out how many kilometers are in 5.4 miles. In this case, we would write a fraction like this: 5.4 miles/1 . When you're converting this way, always include the units in the fractions. They will be important later. [5] X Research source"

This is a lot easier than it sounds — see below for help. We already know that there are about 1.6 kilometers in a mile. We can use this to build our fraction. In the numerator (the top part), we would write \"1.6 kilometers\" and in the denominator (the bottom part), we would write \"1 mile.\" This gives us 1.6 kilometers/1 mile ."

As you multiply, look for units that show up once in the numerator and once in the denominator. When you find a pair, cross both out. [6] X Research source In our example, we have 5.4 miles/1 × 1.6 kilometers/1 mile. \"Mile\" appears on top in the first fraction and on the bottom in the second, so we can cross both \"miles\" out. Multiplying, we get 8.64 ."

      "content": "Continue this pattern to build more complicated conversions. Now that you know how to do easy conversions, you can use the same approach for longer ones. Just follow the same steps. Write your starting measurement as a fraction over 1, then write your conversions as fractions so that your units cancel (except for the units you want your answer in) and multiply. [7] X Research source For example, let's say that you want to know what 5.4 miles is in centimeters. You don't know the conversion for miles to centimeters, but you do know that there are 1.6 kilometers in a mile, 1,000 meters in a kilometer, and 100 centimeters in a meter. This is all you need to set up your problem: 5.4 miles/1 × 1.6 kilometers/1 mile × 1000 meters/1 kilometer × 100 centimeters/1 meter Notice that all of the units cancel except for centimeters (because it only appears once). Multiplying through, your final answer is 864,000 centimeters ."
