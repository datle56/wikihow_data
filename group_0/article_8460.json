      "content": "Clean the sand off of your clams. Before you get started, give your clam shells a nice scrub so that you won’t transfer any sand onto your clam meat during the unshelling. You don’t need to use any soap or cleaning product to wash off the sand. All you need is water and friction. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Put your clams into a colander or steamer basket that fits into a pot. If you have too many clams to put them all into the colander or steamer basket, then you can split them into batches for cleaning. [2] X Research source Grab a few towels or oven mitts to help you safely handle your clams. If you don’t have a pot that’s large enough, then you can use a heat proof bowl."

      "content": "Wait 10 seconds, then remove the clams. The clams will have opened their shells with the meat exposed, but you need to cool them down quickly so that the meat doesn’t cook. Accidentally cooking the clam in the boiling water will ruin its texture and flavor. [5] X Research source Have a bowl of cold water prepared and waiting for use before you insert the clams into the boiling water."

You can lay it on a cutting board or plate so that you can easily make your cuts as you remove the inedible parts of the clam. If you are experienced in the kitchen, you may choose to hold the clam in your hand; however, doing so risks you cutting your hand. It’s best to use a hard surface instead."

Cut down below the gills and rinse thoroughly to remove any hidden sand. [9] X Research source The gills are not dangerous to eat, but most people prefer to remove them before cooking them. The mouth of the clam, called the palp, is in the same place as the gills. You will be removing these parts together if you scrape away all of the fleshy brown area. [10] X Research source"

Razor clams contain a crystalline style that allows them to break up their food, and you must remove it before eating the meat. While you’re cutting away the stomach, you should see the rod slide from inside the clam. If it doesn’t come away on it’s own, press the clam to push it out, then remove it with your fingers. [13] X Research source Don’t mistake the crystalline style for a worm. It’s a natural part of the clam. It will look like a piece of plastic. [14] X Research source"
