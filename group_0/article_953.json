[1] X Expert Source Jonas Jackel Owner, Huckleberry Bicycles Expert Interview. 18 February 2020. Make sure you have enough space around the bike to move freely around it. [2] X Research source You’ll also need to be able to reach the handlebars while you’re adjusting the brakes, so make sure you have enough space."

      "content": "Loosen the mounting bolts on the outside of the brakes with a hex wrench. Take a hex wrench and carefully turn the 2 outer mounting bolts on the brakes counterclockwise to loosen them so you can adjust the brakes. Loosen the mounting bolts just enough so you can wiggle the internal mechanisms of the brakes but not so much that they’re disassembled. [3] X Research source You can find hex wrenches at bicycle repair shops, at your local hardware store, or by searching online. If you only need to adjust the brakes on 1 tire, do not loosen the mounting bolts of the other tire or you could cause the rotor and calipers to be misaligned."

      "content": "Squeeze the brake lever on the handlebars to center the calipers. The calipers are metal brackets that squeeze the brake pads against the rotor to slow down your bike. [4] X Expert Source Jonas Jackel Owner, Huckleberry Bicycles Expert Interview. 18 February 2020. Locate the brake lever on the handlebars that control the brakes that you’re adjusting. Squeeze and hold the lever down to realign the calipers so they’re centered over the rotor. [5] X Research source"

With the brake lever on the handlebar depressed, check the rotor to see if it’s centered between and in contact with the brake pads. [6] X Expert Source Jonas Jackel Owner, Huckleberry Bicycles Expert Interview. 18 February 2020. If it isn’t, use a hex wrench to turn the centering bolts holding the calipers to tighten the brake pads around the rotor. [7] X Research source Use small adjustments and don’t overtighten the centering bolts or the brake pads will rub against the rotor. Squeezing the brake lever is often enough to realign the calipers."

Once you adjust the calipers, let go of the brake lever and check to see if there’s even space between the rotor and the brake pads. Give the tire a good spin and look for any rubbing. Listen for clicking or scraping sounds as well. [8] X Research source If you do see or hear signs of rubbing, adjust the centering bolts until the rotor rests evenly between the brake pads.

Use a hex wrench to fully tighten all of the mounting bolts so the brake assembly is held firmly and securely. [10] X Expert Source Jonas Jackel Owner, Huckleberry Bicycles Expert Interview. 18 February 2020. Take the bike off of the rack and go for a short test ride in a safe area such as a parking lot or driveway to test out the brakes to make sure they’re working. [11] X Research source Always go for a safe test ride before taking the bike out for a longer ride."

Place the bike in a stand that allows both of the tires to freely turn and so you can easily move around it to see the rotors and calipers.

Look in the space between the 2 brake pads on each tire for the rotor. [13] X Research source Check both tires and find the rotor plate between each set of brakes. If your bike only has brakes on the rear tire, then you’ll only need to check there."

If there is any rubbing, then you’ll need to adjust the calipers to realign the rotor.

      "content": "Listen for a scraping sound that signals rotor rub. In addition to checking the small rotor plate to see if it’s rubbing against the brake pads, listen for a clicking or scraping noise while the tire spins. If you hear any abrasive sounds, the calipers will need to be realigned to adjust the brakes. [16] X Research source If you see the rotor rubbing against the brakes, you’ll also likely hear it scraping. It may be difficult to see if the rotor is rubbing against the brakes, so listening can help you identify the problem."
