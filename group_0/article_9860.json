      "content": "Cut 1 pound (450 g) of boneless meat into bite-sized cubes. You can use any meat that's available. Try beef, chicken, turkey, or goat, for instance. Just make sure to cut them into evenly-sized pieces so they cook at the same rate. [1] X Research source Want to make vegetarian cassava leaves? No problem— just leave out the meat and skip the dried fish."

      "title": "Put the meat into a pot along with vegetable oil, onion, stock, and water.",
      "content": "Put the meat into a pot along with vegetable oil, onion, stock, and water. Set a big pot on the stove and put the meat cubes into it along with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. To really give the meat some flavor, add 1 of the stock cubes and 1 tablespoon (6 g) of chopped onion before you pour in 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 ml) of the water. [2] X Research source Feel free to add up to 4 cloves of chopped garlic to the pot for a richer flavor."

      "content": "Bring the water to a boil. Turn the burner to medium-high and keep the lid off of the pot so you can see when the water starts boiling— it won't take long! [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Simmer the meat for 25 minutes or until it's tender. Turn the burner down to medium and pop the lid on the pot. Simmer the meat until it's completely cooked and tender. Stir the meat occasionally to help it cook evenly. [4] X Research source Use a slotted spoon to scoop the meat into a dish and set it aside. You can leave the liquid in the pot to add to the vegetables later."

      "content": "Put eggplants, onions, flaked fish, chili, and water into a blender. While you could pound all of these ingredients by hand, the blender really speeds things up! Put 2 roughly chopped eggplants into a blender along with 2 chopped onions, and 1 Scotch bonnet (or your favorite type of chili pepper). If you want to use smoked fish, get out 1 ⁄ 4 pound (110 g) of piece and flake it before you drop it into the blender. Then, pour in 2 ⁄ 3 cup (160 ml) of water. [5] X Research source Can't get ahold of dried fish? You can substitute 3 tablespoons (42 g) of crayfish powder to get that deep, seafood flavor."

      "content": "Pulse the ingredients until they're smooth. Pop the lid on the blender and pulse until all of the vegetables are blended and you can't see any chunks of dried fish. You might have to stop and scrape down the sides of the blender a few times. Keep blending until your flavorful mixture is totally smooth. [6] X Research source Some people like to add a few diced tomatoes to brighten the flavor of the dish. You can use fresh tomatoes or open a can add the diced tomatoes to the blender."

Then, drop in your remaining stock cube and pour in 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (0.35 L) of water. Stir in 5 tablespoons (75 g) of smooth peanut butter and 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of palm oil to finish the base for your cassava leaf stew. [7] X Research source If you don't have peanut butter in your pantry, grind up any ground nuts you have until they're fine and add them to the base. The peanut butter or ground nuts help thicken the stew so don't leave it out! Don't want to use palm oil? Try substituting the same amount of coconut oil. Instead of having a savory or earthy flavor, coconut oil has a mild, delicate flavor that also works well with cassava leaves."

Keep the lid off of the pot so some of the water evaporates and your stew thickens. [8] X Research source Stir the pot occasionally so it doesn't scorch on the bottom of the pot."

Open a 1.1 lb (0.50 kg) package of pounded cassava leaves that you've thawed and put them into a fine-mesh strainer. Take it over to the sink and run cold water over it to rinse away any sand or grit. [9] X Research source Check the freezer aisles of your local African or ethnic market for ground cassava leaves. Still can't find them? It's fine to substitute the same amount of chopped spinach."
