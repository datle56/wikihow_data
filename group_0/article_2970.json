      "title": "Read the Bible.",
      "content": "Read the Bible. The Bible has all the answers and will always help you and give you advice on how to be a good Christian (a quick look at the Ten Commandments shows that). Also, most bookstores sell books that help you understand the scripture better, if you find the Bible a bit difficult to fully actualize – which happens to most of us! Participating in Bible study groups can make this a fun, enjoyable activity that you stick with over the long-term. What’s more, you’ll make plenty of like-minded friends with whom you can share the word of God. Jesus said in Matthew 24:35, \"Heaven and earth shall pass away but My words shall not pass away.\" And by reading the Bible, you make sure His words live on."

      "title": "Pray regularly.",
      "content": "Pray regularly. It’s important to put God before everything, thanking Him for everything, too. Pray when you get up (and read the Bible), pray before you eat, and pray before you go to sleep (and read the Bible). Always keep Him with you, which is easiest done with prayer. James 1:5 says that God wants to give you wisdom in abundance if you ask for it. Prayer can indeed be about anything, and regardless of what your prayer is about, God will answer you as He sees fit. Ask for advice, forgiveness, but also just drop in to say hello from time to time!"

    {
      "title": "Always praise the Lord.",
      "content": "Always praise the Lord. Be it through the way you talk to people or the way you are in the day-to-day, always praise the Lord. Let everybody see that God is present and within you. This means cultivating an aura of positivity and light, doing what He would do. Let Him live through you . Part of this is up to interpretation. Does praising the Lord mean praying regularly to you? Singing? Talking about Him with others? All of these ideas are right! Praising him means living in His light – there's no wrong way to do it. \"This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad.\" Think about this: today is a day from the Lord – how uplifting and powerful is that? Realizing that makes it easier to turn every moment into a moment of praise."

    {
      "title": "Practice forgiveness – of others and yourself.",
      "content": "Practice forgiveness – of others and yourself. This is one of the hardest things for many of us – we read the scriptures, we go to church, we try to live as He would, but at the end of the day, we still play the blame game, even if that means we blame ourselves. To be closer to God, make a conscious effort toward forgiving yourself and forgiving others. We’re all trying to do our best! Instead of acting out with anger or malice, turn the other cheek. When someone rubs you the wrong way, show them that you’re living in the light of Christ and taking the higher road. Forgive them for their sins as Jesus would do. Who knows? They may be inspired by your actions. The next time you’re beating yourself up over the tiniest thing, remember how perfect you are to Him. He would hate to see you treating yourself that way! Instead, concentrate on doing better next time, focusing on the future and not the past. Ephesians 4:32 says, \"Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.\" When you're tempted otherwise, think of this simple yet beautiful sentiment."

      "title": "Be modest and humble about your faith, even though it's beautiful.",
      "content": "Be modest and humble about your faith, even though it's beautiful. Never brag how close you are to God. This will just turn people off from the Gospel and you'll miss your chance to witness to others. No one cares for arrogance – Jesus certainly never did. In the book of Peter, it says, \"Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you.\" Remember: we are all his sons and daughters. [1] X Research source Unfortunately, some Christians come off as arrogant, assuming their faith is better than others’. Remember that Jesus preached that we are all sons and daughters of God, and that everyone should be loved equally. Keeping this in mind will make it easier to be humble in His image."

      "content": "Try to participate in religious activities. Youth groups or other get-togethers with people who share your faith can be a great thing to do to bring yourself closer to your religion."

      "title": "Help the poor and destitute.",
      "content": "Help the poor and destitute. Whether this means donating clothes to your church’s next fundraiser or buying a sandwich for that homeless man you pass on the street every day, take action. Proverbs 19:17 says, “Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him for his deed.” [2] X Research source Virtually every community has individuals that need a helping hand. And if you're uncomfortable giving money, that's fine – do you have some old clothes you don't wear anymore? Could you bake a dish for a family you know, or give it to a homeless shelter? Could you make a craft to brighten someone's day? Money isn't the only route to happiness!"

    {
      "title": "Spread His word.",
      "content": "Spread His word. Tell the world of His glory! A simple way to be a better Christian is to be proud of your faith and to talk of how wonderful it feels, being so loved. Do your part to better the world by spreading His message. Who knows, you could change a few people’s lives! When you see people who are sick or in pain offer to pray for them and expect God to heal them You don't have to do this directly (some people will not be receptive and view even the smallest comment as evangelizing); instead, you can attribute your happiness and success to the Lord. Simply embodying Him is spreading His power."

      "title": "Be genuine about your religion.",
      "content": "Be genuine about your religion. Don’t put on a show on the outside that you think He would approve of, but that you don't truly feel on the inside. The opposite is true, too: don't put on a show on the outside to blend in, asking for forgiveness later. When your religion comes up, be open about it. You have nothing to be ashamed of! Be genuine about your doubts, too. It’s only if you open up about them that others can reinforce your belief, making it ultimately stronger."

      "title": "Donate to your church and to charity.",
      "content": "Donate to your church and to charity. Give tithes to the church, as written in the Bible, for the betterment of those less fortunate that the church can help that one person alone may be unable to reach. This includes your time as well as your possessions. But other organizations would benefit from your time and money, too – so spread the love as much as you can! In Corinthians it is said, “Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” Don’t give tithes out of obligation – give them as a cheerful giver, knowing you're doing your part."

      "title": "Go to church ‘’and’’ get involved.",
      "content": "Go to church ‘’and’’ get involved. In addition to going to church every Sunday, help out! Going through the motions is not what God intended. Sing in the choir, lector, or just be a greeter – any effort is appreciated. This will help you feel more devoted to your community, too. Find out how you can help – there’s usually more help that needs to be done than there are hands. Do you have any special talents? Cooking? Playing the guitar? Sewing? Woodworking? Offer them up to your church. They’ll be able to make use of them somewhere!"

    {
      "title": "Vote.",
      "content": "Vote. A great way to truly impact the world the way God wants is to vote according to your beliefs. Whether it’s for President or just a tiny neighborhood election, your vote matters, especially to Him. This way, you’re doing your part to better your community at large. As the Bible is often subject to interpretation, think about what His words mean to you. If we are all sons and daughters of the Lord, what would be best for all of us, men and women, black and white, young and old?"

      "title": "Be creative in the name of God.",
      "content": "Be creative in the name of God. Going to church for an hour a week isn’t your “God time.” It’s 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So take that time and do something with it where you can channel your energy and produce something in His name. Whether it’s a painting, a song, a story, or a dish, He’d be proud. This \"creative time\" is good for you, too. It can help center you, relax you, and ultimately make you feel better about your situation. We all need to destress from time to time, and this may be the push you need to feel prepared to be a better Christian. Proverbs 22:29 states, \"Do you see a man skillful in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.\" [3] X Research source Talk about an endorsement from the big guy upstairs!"

      "title": "Volunteer",
      "content": "Volunteer . The Bible heavily advocates helping your sisters and brothers – Hebrews 13:16 says it well: \"Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.\" And in today’s day and age, that’s easier than ever. Volunteer at a soup kitchen, homeless shelter, or hospital. Work with neglected kids who need a mentor, organize your church’s next luncheon, or even walk a few dogs from the Humane Society! There are dozens of ways you can better your community in His name."

    {
      "title": "Visit ‘’other’’ churches.",
      "content": "Visit ‘’other’’ churches. This may sound a bit silly, but visiting other churches helps us understand other people, meet other Christians, and immerse ourselves in the Christian community, not just our one church. The more you learn about your faith, the stronger it'll be. Experiment with other denominations, too. An orthodox Christian church could be a fascinating experience. However, don’t shy away from the other Abrahamic religions (Islam and Judaism) either – visiting a synagogue or mosque will also be a fruitful, enlightening experience. After all, we all share the same roots!"

      "title": "Study great Christians.",
      "content": "Study great Christians. There is much to learn in the lives of those great Christians who lived before us. Do some research and pick out a few individuals with stories that speak to you. How can you have their faith and their resolve? How can you live as they would? You've heard of Jesus, you've head of Martin Luther King, Jr., but have you heard of George Whitefield, Dwight Moody, or William Carey? There are so many individuals who have stories that we can learn from and be inspired by. And all it takes now is the press of a few buttons!"

      "title": "Keep a faith journal.",
      "content": "Keep a faith journal. Devote a few minutes each day to your faith journal. You can talk about whatever you like – what you’re thankful for, what you’re thinking about that day, or what you’d like His guidance on. Just staying conscious of Him and His presence in your life is the goal. As time goes on, flip back through the pages of your journal. You’ll likely be amazed at all the growth you’ve made! Take it with you wherever you go – you may find a quiet moment where you feel particularly reflective and having it at your side will be handy to record how you feel right then and there. Isaiah 40:8 – \"The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever.\" This doesn't mean only the scripture, this can even be the word of God through you."
