Thoroughly cleaning a refrigerator can sometimes take a few hours, and keeping the fridge open for long periods of time wastes electricity. Therefore, it's often best to go ahead and unplug or turn off your refrigerator when you're getting ready to deep clean it. [1] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Department of Energy Official site for the U.S. Department of Energy, which provides resources related to energy safety, conservation, and efficiency Go to source If you don't want to unplug your fridge, try to keep the door shut whenever possible, like when you're cleaning removable parts. For safety, unplug the fridge if you plan on cleaning the coils or drip pan. If it's too difficult to access the plug, turn off the circuit breaker that serves the fridge."

Mix dish soap and warm water in a sink or basin, and wash each component the way you'd wash your dishes, making sure to scrub away any stubborn stains. Rinse them with clean water, then set them aside to dry completely while you clean the rest of the fridge. [3] X Research source If your shelves or drawers are made of glass, wait until they're room temperature before washing them. Running cold glass under hot water could cause them to crack. If you're not sure how to remove a component, refer to your fridge's owner's manual. It may help to take a photo of the inside of your fridge before removing the shelves so you know where everything goes when it's time to replace them. If there are spills or food remnants that are harder to get off, let the shelf or drawer soak in the sink for a few minutes. It should come right off."

Spray the entire interior of the fridge liberally, then scrub every surface with a sponge or microfiber cloth, working from top to bottom. This includes the walls, non-removable shelves, and the inside of the door. If the stains are stubborn, let the mixture sit for at least 10 minutes before wiping away.

You can also use apple cider vinegar.” [5] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 29 August 2019. While it's possible to clean a fridge with bleach, it's only recommended for extremely tough odors or stains that cannot be removed otherwise. The fridge will then need to air out for several hours."

Dip a toothbrush into the baking soda mixture and scrub any cracks and crevices you can't reach with your sponge or cloth. Pay special attention to the rubber gasket around the fridge door, as well as the hinges and other hardware. [6] X Research source After wiping down the gaskets, rub a little petroleum jelly or mineral oil along the rubber to condition it. Keeping the gasket clean helps your fridge door maintain a tight seal, which makes it more energy-efficient. While you're cleaning, look for any cracks or tears in the rubber, which can keep your fridge from maintaining a tight seal."

Leave the solution on for a few minutes, then scrub the dirt away, and rinse with clean water. Let the drip pan dry completely before reinstalling it. [13] X Research source A drip pan catches water as it comes out of the defrost drain. Drip pans are typically located at the bottom of the appliance, though their exact location varies depending on the refrigerator model. Always unplug your fridge before cleaning the drip pan to avoid getting electrocuted. If the drip pan is moldy or has an odor, allow the bleach solution to sit longer to remove stubborn mold and kill bacteria. If your drip pan isn't removable, wipe it down with an antibacterial cleaning wipe and use a claw grabber to wipe dirt from the inside of the pan."

After cleaning the interior of your fridge, open a box of baking soda and place it on a rimmed baking sheet to store in the back of your fridge. Baking soda is a natural odor-absorber without a scent of its own, so it will get rid of any lingering odors without transferring its own smell onto your food. Switch it out for a new box after a couple of months. [16] X Research source If your fridge has limited space, buy a fridge deodorizer that sticks to the side or back of the appliance. These are available online or anywhere you would normally buy cleaning products. Other deodorizers include a tray of fresh coffee grounds, activated charcoal, or even clean cat litter. Another way to eliminate fridge odors is to soak cotton balls in vanilla extract and leave them in the fridge for a few hours to provide a nice fragrance."

[18] X Research source Buy a coil brush online or at a hardware store. It also works well to clean humidifier or air conditioning coils. If you don't have a coil brush, use a brush attachment on a vacuum cleaner. Even though most of the dust will get vacuumed up, you might want to wear a dust mask while you do this, especially if you have dust allergies. Appliance technician Aaron Beth recommends cleaning your refrigerator's coils at least twice a year: “It depends on where you live, but most factory recommendations are twice a year. If you have [pets], their hair gets caught in the condenser and it needs to be cleaned more often. So it depends on where the refrigerator is, but I would say to be safe, [clean the coils] a couple times a year.” [19] X Expert Source Aaron Beth Appliance Technician Expert Interview. 14 July 2020."

If you have a larger mold problem (due to a flood, the fridge not running properly, etc.), consult an appliance repair specialist to determine the best course of action. If the mold is growing in the inner workings of the refrigerator, you'll likely have to replace it . If the moldy smell lingers, Sears recommends “[letting] the shelves and trays sit outside overnight.
