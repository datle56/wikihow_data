      "content": "Wait for the perfect time to give your compliment. Timing is everything when it comes to delivering compliments in a non-creepy way, so consider the context and feel vibe of the conversation before saying anything. If a girl has just applied lip gloss, for example, it’s a great opportunity to compliment her lip color or the gloss itself. If she’s smiling or laughing a lot, you could mention that she has nice lips or a warm smile. In general, you should wait for a lighthearted moment when the vibes feel fun or flirty."

      "content": "Maintain a relaxed and friendly tone. When it comes to complimenting someone’s lips, your delivery makes a huge difference. Saying your compliment in a super flirty way can make the other person feel uncomfortable, especially if they don’t know you that well or aren’t romantically interested. It’s best to make a passing compliment, rather than lingering on it, and deliver it in a casual and lighthearted way. For example, staring at someone’s lips while delivering a flirty compliment can come off as creepy. However, maintaining normal eye contact and saying it in a relaxed tone is less intense."

      "content": "Tie your compliment to her smile or personality. If you’re worried about being too direct or intense, connect your compliment to their smile or overall vibe. It’s a great strategy to keep things fun and light, and avoid being overly flirty. If a guy keeps laughing at your jokes, for example, you could say, “your laugh is really infectious.” If he can’t stop smiling, you could say, “your smile really lights up the room” or “you have one of those smiles that makes people smile back.” If the other person is flattered and replies in a flirty way, you can up the ante and give more forward compliments about their lips later on."

      "content": "Be genuine and don’t expect anything in return. Dating coach Louis Felix says, “honesty is the best policy” when it comes to giving compliments, and it “becomes disingenuous when you say something just to impress someone.” So, make sure your compliment comes from a place of sincerity, and don’t over exaggerate things for the sake of boosting their ego. Most people can tell when someone is being authentic, and a genuine compliment always feels more personal and meaningful. Remember, the point of giving someone a compliment is to share admiration and make the other person feel good, so don’t get upset or offended if they don’t reciprocate. According to dating coach John Keegan, a common mistake women make when complimenting men is fawning over them or being “over the top.” Overloading compliments can come across as needy or desperate, so try to give one that’s specific and subtle."

      "content": "It depends on context, but it usually means he’s attracted to you. When a guy compliments your lips, he’s probably flirting and hinting that he finds you physically attractive. Lips are linked to kissing, which makes them a more sensual feature (compared to your smile or eyes), so think of his compliment as a way to make the first move or clarify that he’s into you. With that being, pay attention to the context of the conversation, his body language and tone, and your relationship before assuming it’s a flirty compliment. If it’s mixed with other compliments about your personality or he says it in a lighthearted way, he might be giving a genuine compliment. If he stares at your lips or says it in a smooth or suggestive way, he might be crushing on you."

      "content": "Complimenting a girl’s lips is usually fine, but it depends on your delivery. As long as you deliver your compliment in a light and respectful way, you won’t seem weird or creepy. However, if it feels super flirty or sexual, it can make her uncomfortable. The best approach is to wait for the right timing, give a genuine compliment, and say it in a friendly way. If you’re worried about overstepping boundaries, compliment her smile, personality, or skills. Generally, a girl will appreciate a flirty compliment if she’s into you, but feel weird if she doesn’t like you. Before making a move, think about how she acts around you. Some signs that she might like you include: having open body language , making eye contact, trying to touch you, mirroring your movements, fidgeting around you, or giving you compliments.
