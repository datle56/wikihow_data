      "content": "Use oatmeal to clean out nose pores. Combine 1 cup (237 ml) of oatmeal with a cup of steaming hot water. Mix the ingredients thoroughly with a utensil. When the mixture is cool to the touch, apply it to your nose (and the rest of your face, if desired) for about 2 minutes. Rinse the mixture from your face with cool water. To keep the mixture on your nose, you may want to saturate a clean, lint-free cloth with it and allow the cloth to soak on your nose."

      "content": "Apply lemon juice once a week. By doing so, the citric acid of the lemon will exfoliate and flush out clogs. Apply either squeezed lemon juice or a raw wedge of lemon directly to the pores of your nose. Wait 1 to 5 minutes, depending on how sensitive your skin is, then rinse with warm water. [1] X Research source Although this technique is great for occasional pore cleansing, you’ll see the best results doing this weekly."

      "title": "Apply egg whites to nose pores.",
      "content": "Apply egg whites to nose pores. Separate an egg white into a bowl. Wash your face with a mild soap and warm water. Use a clean sponge or a lint-free cloth to apply the egg whites to your nose. When the whites have dried on your skin, rinse again with water and pat dry. After rinsing, use a noncomedogenic moisturizer that won’t clog your pores."

      "title": "Open and purify nose pores with steam.",
      "content": "Open and purify nose pores with steam. Fill a large bowl with steaming water. Drape a towel over your head and carefully position your head over the bowl. The towel will trap the steam, warming your face and cleaning your pores. Do this for about 10 to 15 minutes. Use caution with this method. Water and steam that are too hot can cause burns. Approach the steam slowly with your face to gauge its hotness. Add essential oils, like eucalyptus, peppermint, and tea tree oil to the water for extra cleansing power. Tea tree, especially, is great for skin susceptible to breakouts. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Buff the pores of your nose.",
      "content": "Buff the pores of your nose. An electronic exfoliating device, like a brush with rotating bristles, is great for deep cleaning pores. Follow the directions of your device for best results. Generally, wet the bristles lightly in warm water and apply the device to your nose pores. For added pore cleaning power, squeeze a little mild facial cleanser onto the bristles of the brush before using it. As an added bonus, using a buffing device like this can make your pores less noticeable."

      "title": "Clean out pores with a facial scrub.",
      "content": "Clean out pores with a facial scrub. Use a facial scrub about 2 to 3 times every week. Follow the directions of your scrub for best results, though in most cases, this simply involves lathering the scrub on your nose with warm water, waiting a short time, and then rinsing it off. If you have dry skin, try a creamy exfoliating product. Oppositely, for skin that is oily, try a facial scrub that has salicylic acid. These products can usually be bought in the skin care or beauty section of most stores."

      "title": "Remove blockages with pore strips.",
      "content": "Remove blockages with pore strips. Squeezing pores to clear them or release pus can further irritate skin or make breakouts worse. Instead, apply pore strips to your nose according to their directions. After the time indicated in the directions has passed, tear free the strip to remove gunk from pores. Use caution with pore strips if you have sensitive skin as they are super sticky."

      "title": "Wash your nose and face daily.",
      "content": "Wash your nose and face daily. Washing your face twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, will be best for proper nose pore management. Use warm water and a mild facial soap to clean, then rinse with cool water. Wash your face after any activity that worked up a sweat, as well. Products that are specially formulated for your skin type can help manage out of control pores. Oily skin, especially, can make your pores sensitive and may require a special cleanser. Don’t feel like you need to include a whole slew of products in order to have a great routine. Try adding in products one at a time to figure out what works best for you!

      "content": "Avoid sleeping with makeup on, if applicable. Makeup left on your skin will harm its overall quality and also contribute to blocked pores. Wash makeup from your face as you would normally: with warm water and a mild soap. Leaving makeup on for a single night isn’t likely to do any lasting damage to your skin, but every night you sleep with it on, the more clogged your pores will become. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear sunscreen. Exposure to the sun can weather skin, making it lose its suppleness. This can make your pores look larger than they would normally. Apply sunscreen to your nose before outdoor activities to prevent this. Wear a wide brimmed hat to avoid catching too much sun on your nose. Many moisturizers have mild sun protection, like those that are rated SPF 15 to 30, which is recommended when spending time outdoors.."
