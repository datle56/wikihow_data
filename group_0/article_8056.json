      "content": "Mix warm water and liquid detergent in a bucket or water basin. Fill a bucket with warm water and add a mild laundry detergent. Liquid detergent works best, but powdered detergent can be used if on hand. Swirl the solution around until the detergent is completely dissolved. If bubbles appear and the surface is worked into a lather, your solution is ready to be used. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Dip a bristle brush into the solution and scrub the shoes.",
      "content": "Dip a bristle brush into the solution and scrub the shoes. Hold the shoe above the bucket or water basin and scrub the outside with a soft toothbrush or sponge. This will remove most dirt, debris, and stains. If caked-on dirt does not yield to the brush, dip the shoes gently into the water and continue scrubbing. Avoid submerging the shoes entirely, as soaking wet shoes are more likely to mildew."

      "content": "Put your shoes in the washing machine to remove large stains. If your Sperrys still have stains after hand-washing, set your washing machine to a gentle cycle with cool water.

      "title": "Air dry your Sperrys.",
      "content": "Air dry your Sperrys. Let your shoes dry in the sun after one cycle in the washing machine. Remove the insoles and allow them to dry separately. This will prevent your insoles from molding and help them dry faster. Stuff your canvas shoes with newspaper to preserve their shape as they dry. Do not put your shoes in the dryer. The high heat can melt shoe glue and cause your Sperrys to fall apart. [3] X Research source Wait until your Sperrys are completely dry before wearing to avoid athlete's foot or other fungal diseases."

When you have polished the entire leather surface, use a separate cloth to remove the polish in a counterclockwise motion. Test the polish on a small part of the shoe first to make sure it won't cause discoloration. Cream polishes will retain your shoe's color best, but wax polishes are ideal for shine."
