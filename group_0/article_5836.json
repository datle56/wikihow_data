      "content": "Choose a chair that can be caned. To cane a chair, you’ll need one with a large, empty space in the middle of the back or seat. The seat should also have holes drilled around the edge of the seat or back frame. [1] X Research source The holes should be drilled in intervals of about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) around the perimeter of the area of the frame you want to cane. The holes should also be about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from the inner area of the seat. It is not possible to cane a chair without a large, empty space in the middle of the back or seat. Do not attempt to add holes to a regular chair in order to cane it. Only chairs with pre-drilled holes are acceptable for caning."

      "content": "Choose your caning material. A variety of materials can be used to cane chairs. For sturdy or rustic chairs, rush, Hong Kong grass, and splint are all suitable. You might also wish to use wicker. The material you choose should match the chair’s texture and color, and suit your personal preferences. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Determine the gauge of caning material you need.",
      "content": "Determine the gauge of caning material you need. To determine the gauge of caning material you need, use a ruler to measure the distance between the holes (center to center) and the diameter of each hole. The larger the hole, the larger the gauge of cane you’ll need to order. [3] X Research source If the holes are 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm) with 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm) between them, use superfine caning material of .08 inches (0.20 cm) in diameter. If the holes are 3 ⁄ 16 inch (0.48 cm) with 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) between them, use “fine fine” caning material of .09 inches (0.23 cm) in diameter. If the holes are 3 ⁄ 16 inch (0.48 cm) with 5 ⁄ 8 inch (1.6 cm) between them, use fine caning material of .1 inches (0.25 cm) in diameter. If the holes are 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) with 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) between them, use narrow medium or medium caning material of .11 inches (0.28 cm) or .12 inches (0.30 cm) in diameter, respectively. If the holes are 5 ⁄ 16 inch (0.79 cm) with 7 ⁄ 8 inch (2.2 cm) between them, use common caning material of .14 inches (0.36 cm) in diameter."

      "title": "Cut the caning material with a sharp knife if necessary.",
      "content": "Cut the caning material with a sharp knife if necessary. Depending on the kind of cane you buy, it will either come in a package as a bunch of strands (typically about 6 to 7 yards long), or as a single long spool. If it comes as a single spool, cut it into pieces of about 6 to 7 yards (6 to 7 meters) long. [4] X Research source The amount of total caning material you need to buy depends on the circumference of your chair. The larger the circumference of your chair, the more material you will need. When cutting the caning material, place it on a flat surface and use a steady back-and-forth sawing motion to cut through it. You could use a box cutter for thicker caning material and sharp shears for thinner caning material."

      "title": "Soak the caning material.",
      "content": "Soak the caning material. Before you can begin using the caning material, it needs to be soaked to make it more pliable. After about 10 minutes, most caning materials are ready for use. [5] X Research source Except for reed, plastic, and splint, don’t soak your caning material for more than 15 minutes or it might start to discolor and become weak. Reed and splint need to be soaked for 30 to 45 minutes before use. [6] X Research source Only keep a few strands in the water at a time. When you begin using the caning material, add new strands as you take out those that have already been soaked. Don’t soak plastic cane. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep the glossy side up. When the chair is in its normal position, the glossy side of the caning material should face up and away from the seat. If you’re caning the back of the chair, the glossy side should face the front. [8] X Research source Some caning materials might not have a glossy side. In these cases, either side of the caning material can face up."

      "content": "Check the soaked caning material for breaks and weak spots before using it. If a piece of caning material is frayed or thin in a certain area, discard it. The strips should all appear relatively identical. [9] X Research source The “eye” of the cane (the lump where the stem grew out of the leaf) should be smooth and unbroken. [10] X Research source If the “eye” of the cane is not smooth or has a break in it, the caning material will be weaker and might snap under pressure."

Allow about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the caning material to dangle through the bottom of the hole. Jam a peg into the back rear hole to secure it using your fingers. Pull it taut and push the other end through the front-center hole, then secure it with a peg. [11] X Research source Caning pegs are available at your local arts and crafts store. Since they taper towards a point, they only come in one size."

Finish the horizontal layer by starting again from the hole directly above the one you started from. In other words, pass a bit of caning material through the center of the hole, secure it with a peg, then pull the other end across the chair toward the corresponding hole on left side.

[20] X Research source Continue in this way until the area from the front right corner to the center of the frame has been woven with diagonals. Finish the diagonal by running a strand from the front left corner hole (or, if you’re working on the back of the chair, the bottom left corner hole) up to the hole just to the left of the one in the top right corner.

[22] X Research source After securing all loose strands, remove the pegs that kept them in place. Use your fingers to pull the pegs out. All pegs should be removed once all loose strands are secure."
