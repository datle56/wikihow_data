Search online for “cricket association near me” or search the name of your city followed by “cricket association.” If you’re already a cricket player, just find out the name of the association your league or club is a part of. In order to umpire cricket games, you’ll need to join and meet the umpiring requirements of the association in charge of overseeing the games. For example, if you want to umpire for a league or club in southern Australia, you'd need to join the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA), which oversees the cricket leagues and clubs in that region."

      "content": "Attend local cricket games and observe the umpires. If you can’t attend games in person, watch old games online. Pay attention to the umpires as you watch. Notice where they stand on the field, what hand signals they use, and how they interact with the players and coaches. Observing umpires in action will give you an idea of how you should act on the field when you're umpiring. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn the different umpire signals. Cricket umpires use hand signals to communicate with the scorer, players, coaches, and people watching the game. To be a successful cricket umpire, you should have all of the hand signals memorized. To view all the different cricket umpire hand signals, visit https://www.icc-cricket.com/video/310706 [4] X Research source For example, the signal for no ball is stretching your right arm out so it’s parallel with the ground. To let everyone know there's 1 hour left of the game, you would hold out your left arm and point to your watch with your right hand. If you wanted to take back the last signal you made, you would cross your arms over your chest and put your hands on your shoulders."

      "content": "Play by your cricket association's rules. Some cricket associations change certain rules of the game when it makes sense for their players. Make sure you know your association’s rules so you’re not making incorrect calls on the field. Your association should go over their unique rules with you during training, but ask someone if you’re confused. [5] X Research source For example, if you’re umpiring cricket at the junior level, the rules may be more lenient than if you were umpiring at an advanced level."

They might see something that you missed or vice versa, so it’s important you communicate with them. Talk to them before the game so you’re both on the same page about the rules and signals you’ll be using. [6] X Research source"
