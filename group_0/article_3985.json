      "title": "Try to craft a birthday caption that’s short, sweet, and snappy.",
      "content": "Try to craft a birthday caption that’s short, sweet, and snappy. According to social media expert Kasey Dunn, your caption should be concise to “captivate the audience in the first eight seconds” of seeing your post. After a few lines of text, Instagram hides the rest of your caption, so include the most eye-catching details at the beginning. Most users won’t read a lengthy caption, so when in doubt, keep it sweet and simple. Have fun experimenting with emojis to add more personality and character! Include questions in your caption to increase engagement . For instance, you could caption your post with “Who’s buying me a drink?” or “What should I add to my birthday checklist?” Social media and digital marketing consultant Candace Gasper also recommends “seeing what’s trending in pop culture and utilizing it in your post.” If there’s a viral song or meme, for example, you could reference it in your caption. Gaspar also recommends “coming up with five or six different captions” and choosing the best one. If you’re not sure about which one to use, reach out to a friend or family member and ask for their opinion."
