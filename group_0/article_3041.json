If you don’t want to wear heels, Bernadette suggests trying a pair of ballet flats instead. Be sure your shoes are clean and don’t have any tears or scuffs! If you want to wear heels but don’t know how to walk in them , try stepping with your heel down first, then your toe. Practice wearing heels at home before you go out in public! Sometimes, sneakers or tennis shoes are the only option. Look for styles that are sleek instead of clunky and athletic, as these are more girly. In the fall and wintertime, look for white or tan ankle boots and heeled boots for a feminine, functional footwear option. Skip the heels when there’s rainy or snowy weather—you might slip!"

When trying to decide if something fits, check that it falls at the right length, doesn’t restrict your breathing or movement, and sits at the right spot on your shoulders or waist.

Makeup simply enhances your natural beauty and femininity. If you’re new to applying makeup, keep practicing until your makeup looks natural and is easy for you to apply. [4] X Research source Start with a natural makeup look . Try using just lip balm , lip gloss , and mascara . If you’re not allowed to wear much makeup, find an untinted lip gloss that adds shine but not color. Look for eyeshadows and blushes in soft, neutral colors like light pink, beige, or soft orange.

When you sit down, sit with your back straight and your arms by your side or in your lap. You don’t have to cross your legs or your ankles, but it can add a feminine touch. To sit in a ladylike way, keep your knees and feet together, advises etiquette coach Tami Claytor. If you cross your legs, keep the lower portion of your legs close together. Don’t cross your legs when wearing a long gown or a short skirt, Claytor warns. This can look unflattering or be overly revealing."

This doesn’t mean that you should let people treat you badly—if you have to tell someone to stop or to leave you alone, do so clearly and firmly. Avoid swearing or using explicit words.
