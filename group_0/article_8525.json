      "content": "Turn off the water to the tank and then flush the toilet. If you haven’t cleaned your bathroom for a while (there’s no shame in it—we’ve all been there!) or your toilet is pretty stained, adding vinegar and baking soda to a dry bowl will help give it a deep clean. Reach behind your toilet and twist the valve knob clockwise to shut the water off temporarily. Then, flush your toilet once to drain all the water out of the bowl. [1] X Research source Don’t worry, it’s super easy to turn your water back on. When you’re ready, you can just reach behind your toilet again and twist the valve counter-clockwise before flushing."

      "content": "White vinegar is naturally acidic, which gives it great cleaning power. Measure out about 1 c (240 mL), then dump it into the toilet bowl. Start pouring from the rim, moving the cup all the way around the toilet bowl to cover the entire thing. [2] X Research source Although it can be tempting to use apple cider vinegar, its brown color has the potential to stain a white toilet. Stick to white vinegar if you don’t want to discolor your toilet bowl accidentally."

      "content": "This will help tackle tough stains. Close the lid and let the vinegar sit for as long as you can (8 hours is ideal). While you’re waiting, feel free to tackle the rest of your bathroom to get the deep cleaning out of the way. [3] X Research source This is especially important if you’re dealing with hard water stains, since those can take a while to dissolve. In a toilet, hard water stains are usually brown or rust-colored, and they usually don’t come off with gentle scrubbing."

      "content": "The vinegar will combine with baking soda, providing a deep clean. Once your vinegar has sat for a little while, grab a package of baking soda and sprinkle enough into the toilet to cover the whole surface of the bowl. Don’t worry if the mixture starts to fizz—that means it’s working! [4] X Research source The acidity in vinegar combines with the baking soda, releasing carbon dioxide gas that can help lift dirt and stains. Plus, it does it without using any harsh chemicals, so you don’t have to worry about breathing it in while you clean."

      "content": "Hard water can discolor your toilet bowl, and it’s tough to get that out. If you notice that your toilet has a ring around it that you haven’t been able to get out, add about 1 c (240 mL) of vinegar into the toilet bowl after you’ve sprinkled your baking soda. The extra acidity will help break down the hard water stains so you can scrub your toilet clean. [5] X Research source Hard water describes water that has a lot of minerals dissolved in it (specifically calcium and magnesium).

      "content": "Throw on a pair of gloves and get ready to use some elbow grease. Grab your toilet brush and give the toilet bowl a once over, then focus on any areas that are stained or discolored. The abrasiveness of the baking soda will help scrub off most tough stains, so you shouldn’t have to work too hard to clean out the toilet.

Then, flush the toilet once to get rid of all the vinegar and baking soda and reveal your shiny, clean toilet bowl. [9] X Research source To clean off your toilet brush, leave it in the toilet as you flush. The new, clean water will rinse the brush off, and you can let it dry until you use it next time."

If you aren’t quite satisfied with the state of your toilet yet, add 1 c (240 mL) of vinegar again and let it sit for about 1 hour. Then, sprinkle baking soda on top and give the whole thing another scrub. [10] X Research source If you’re having to do this a second time, you may want to let the vinegar soak overnight. That way, it has enough time to work on hard stains."
