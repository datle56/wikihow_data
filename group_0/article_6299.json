      "content": "Use a UVB light or a heating pad set on low to warm your pet’s new home to the appropriate temperatures. Lizards are cold-blooded creatures that rely on outside warmth to function. The tank should be a minimum of 80 °F (27 °C) at one end with a basking area with a temperature of about 95 °F (35 °C). [4] X Research source Do not use heated rocks because they can cause your lizard to overheat."

If you want to breed your lizard, add about half-inch soil mixed with sand. Maintain proper temperature. You should also know what sex is your gecko (male or female)."

      "content": "Capture a lizard by either setting a trap or using a lizard fishing pole. Setting a trap: Find an odorless box, cover it with plastic wrap and cut a slit. Place the box in a location where you have seen lizards and add live insect bait. Check the trap two or three times a day. It may take several days to catch the lizard, so make sure replace the bait as necessary. Using a lizard fishing pole: Source a stick that is at least 3 feet (0.91 m) and a long piece of dental floss. Tie the dental floss to one end of the stick. Make a slip knot out of the other end with a loop large enough to fit around a lizard’s neck. Approach the lizard of your choice slowly and gently fit the loop around its neck. The best time to catch lizards is early in the day because they have not had a chance to warm up and will move more slowly."
