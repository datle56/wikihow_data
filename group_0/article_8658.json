      "content": "Rest green aventurine in the light of the full moon overnight. Moonlight has the power to both cleanse and charge crystals . [1] X Research source Simply place your crystal on a patio or balcony during a full moon and let it absorb the light overnight. If you don’t have outdoor access, use a windowsill that receives lots of moonlight. [2] X Research source Place your crystal in a safe, flat spot where it won’t roll away during the night. A full moon has the most powerful light, but moonlight from any phase of the moon will cleanse your green aventurine, too. Moonlight is always beneficial for your stones and contains no harmful or negative energy."

      "content": "Leave green aventurine in sunlight for 30 minutes. Sunlight is a powerful, fast-acting cleanser that charges crystals with vibrant energy, too. Just lay your aventurine on a patio, balcony, or windowsill that receives direct sunlight. The sun’s rays will clear it of negative energy, even if it’s a cloudy or overcast day. [3] X Research source Make sure to bring your green aventurine inside after about a half hour. Too much exposure to direct sunlight can cause its color to fade. Leave your crystal out during dawn or dusk to absorb the lights of the sun and moon at the same time."

      "title": "Rest green aventurine on a slab of selenite for up to 24 hours.",
      "content": "Rest green aventurine on a slab of selenite for up to 24 hours. Selenite is a self-cleansing crystal that clears other stones it comes into physical contact with. Lay your aventurine on top of a selenite slab or charging plate , or place jewelry in a selenite bowl . The selenite will absorb negative energy, leaving your aventurine refreshed and ready for healing work. [4] X Research source Cleansing with selenite is safe for all crystals, and selenite itself rarely has to be cleansed. Try charging your selenite in the sun before using it to cleanse. That way, the selenite can charge the aventurine in addition to cleansing it. [5] X Research source Alternatively, use black tourmaline or clear quartz clusters in place of selenite."

      "content": "Soak green aventurine in salt water for up to 24 hours. Salt and water both neutralize and carry negative energy away from your crystals.

Sit near your crystal and use a bell , tuning fork , or singing bowl to generate a constant sound. Imagine the waves washing over the stone and carrying impurities away into the air. [15] X Research source If you don’t have a bell or singing bowl, chant the syllable “om” instead. [16] X Research source A sound bath is a great way to cleanse a large collection of stones all at once, or to cleanse big, heavy stones that are hard to maneuver."
