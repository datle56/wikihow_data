      "content": "Cartnite aren’t legitimate THC vape cartridges. The producer of the popular video game Fortnite , Epic Games, has not announced any partnerships with licensed marijuana companies. [1] X Research source It’s not safe to use Cartnite carts because counterfeit vape carts might be contaminated with harmful additives like pesticides. [2] X Research source https://www.runtz-strain.com/ and https://cartnite.com/ are counterfeit vape sites that claim to sell genuine Cartnite carts. The Cartnite packages also show California’s seal for marijuana products, but Cartnite is not listed in California’s Department of Cannabis Control database. [3] X Research source Any vape brand with well-known characters on it (like Mario or Scooby-Doo) is also probably fake for this same reason."

      "content": "Cartnite memes came from photos of fake Cartnite products. When they hit the market, memes about counterfeit Cartnite carts blew up on TikTok, Reddit, and other social media sites. Most of these memes joke about people who buy the carts and the crazy effects that might happen if you use them. [4] X Research source Although these memes are funny, it’s important to avoid fake Cartnite carts that may contain harmful and deadly chemicals like Vitamin E acetate, formaldehyde, pesticides, or hydrogen cyanide.

      "content": "Stick to well-known brands with good safety records. Look for THC cart brands that have existed for years, have a significant presence on social media, and have an established reputation in the marijuana community. Unlike illicit companies, these brands can’t put dangerous substances in carts. [6] X Research source Be wary of companies that sell well-known brands at low prices. These illicit companies might buy branded cartridges on sites like Ali Baba and fill them with black-market distillates. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Check that the dispensary or product is licensed with the state.",
      "content": "Check that the dispensary or product is licensed with the state. If you live in a state where marijuana is legal, make sure the vapes are labeled with the manufacturer’s information, lab results, and the state’s seal. [8] X Research source Some states also have websites where you can search the name of the company or product and see if it’s licensed with the government. Some illicit products or companies might include the state’s seal without registering with the government, so it’s important to check your state’s website too. If you live in California, for example, use their Department of Cannabis Control search tool . Use tools like Leafly’s dispensary finder to locate licensed dispensaries in your area."

      "title": "Try to avoid companies that send products to illegal states.",
      "content": "Try to avoid companies that send products to illegal states. Most dispensaries refuse to sell cannabis products to non-legal states because they could lose their licensing. [9] X Research source If you live in a state where cannabis is illegal and a company still sends you THC cartridges, they’re probably fake. If you buy vape cartridges in a state where cannabis is illegal, it’s also unlikely that the substances inside have been lab-tested."

      "content": "Look for carts made with cannabis-derived extracts. Many vape cartridges contain cutting agents like propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, vitamin E acetate, and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oils. However, some of these diluents may cause illnesses. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source To be safe, look for carts made from 100% cannabis-derived extracts. [11] X Research source Look for brands that do additional testing on their products. These tests go beyond legal requirements and may screen for pesticides, heavy metals, molds, and other contaminants."

      "content": "Ask the company for the product’s certificate of analysis (COA). A COA is a certified lab report that allows you to see what ingredients the state tests for and how well a product passes this test. [12] X Research source When ordering a new cannabis product in a legal state, ask your butt tender or the company representative for their COA. A product sold in a licensed dispensary will never fail a COA. Most COAs include sections with information about the product’s heavy metal testing, pesticide testing, and microbial impurities testing. Some states, like New York and California, require all cannabis products sold at a dispensary to have a label with a link or QR code where you can see its ingredients and COA."
