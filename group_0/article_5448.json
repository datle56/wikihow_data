They can be an easy and data-driven means of monitoring your cycle length.

      "content": "Count up to the day before you start your next period. Your count resets on day 1 of your menstrual cycle. This means that your count for each cycle should end on the day before your next period. Include a count for the day before your period starts, but do not include the start date of your period, even if it starts later in the day. [3] X Research source If, for example, your cycle started on March 30 and your next period came on April 28, your cycle would be March 30 to April 27, and would total 29 days."

      "content": "Calculate your average cycle length. Find the average for the length of your cycle using the numbers you collected while counting your period. You can recalculate this every month to get a more accurate depiction of your general cycle length. Remember, though, that the average shows a trend—it doesn’t definitively represent the length of your next cycle. To find the average, add the total number of days of your cycle for each month that you have monitored. Then, divide that total by the number of months you monitored. This will give you your average cycle length. For example, you had a 28 day cycle in April, a 30 day cycle in May, a 26 day cycle in June, and a 27 day cycle in July, your average would be (28+30+26+27)/4, equalling a 27.75 day average cycle."

Even if you pass a certain target, such as getting pregnant, keeping track of your cycle throughout your life can help you know when something is off. Medical professionals often ask for information about your cycle, as well. Monitoring your periods and cycle length will help you provide the most accurate information possible. If your doctor asks you the date of your last period, the answer is the first day of your last period, not the day it ended. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Watch your flow. Very heavy menstrual flows can be an indication of other problems. It may even lead to its own problems, such as anemia and lethargy. While you track your cycle, keep an eye on what days your flow is heavy, normal, and light. In most cases, you don’t need to measure the quantity of blood. Instead, estimate by looking at what type of menstrual products you are using (super tampons, regular pads, etc.) and how often you need to change out those products. [6] X Research source If, for example, you have to change a super tampon every hour, you may have an irregularly heavy flow. Keep in mind that most women will have heavier days and lighter days. It is normal to have different levels of flow on different days. The severity of flow varies greatly from person to person. A heavier or lighter cycle isn’t inherently problematic. Instead, watch for very heavy cycles or completely skipped periods, which may be an indicator of another medical issue. [7] X Research source"

Knowing when these symptoms are most likely to hit can help you better plan and cope.

[8] X Research source If your symptoms are extreme enough that they make daily functioning difficult, contact your doctor. They may be able to help you find a solution or proper management program. If you notice symptoms suddenly happening that you have never experienced before, such as severe lethargy, you may also want to contact your doctor.

[9] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You should also contact a medical professional if you experience severe cramping, migraines, lethargy, or depression in the days leading up to and during your cycle. Your doctor will be able to talk to you about your symptoms and run tests as necessary to see if changes in your cycle may be related to medical issues such as endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, thyroid disorders, or ovarian failure, among others."
