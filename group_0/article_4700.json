[9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Start with a smaller range of motion to work up to the explosive part of your exercise (the lifting), but avoid full extensions at the peak of motion. For leg exercises, keep your knees slightly bent. For arm upper body exercises, keep your elbows slightly bent. Move slowly on the eccentric (lowering phase) as this part of the motion is a common cause of injury. Load the muscle at the low point of the exercise. This means holding the muscle contraction before beginning the movement. If you want to add explosive movements to your squats or other range-of-motion exercises, practice with a lighter weight and a low-intensity setup first. [10] X Research source"
