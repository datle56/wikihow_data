Even if you’ve never wrestled before, build up your conditioning and flexibility, study and practice Olympic-style wrestling maneuvers, and show the coaches your determination to learn and improve. On the wrestling team, you’ll learn essential wrestling skills, be able to improve your techniques, and have the opportunity to wrestle many other people. In addition, you’ll be able to participate in local, regional, and possibly national competitions. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Hire a personal trainer for your bodybuilding program . Professional wrestlers are known for their muscular physiques, so you must build ample muscle size and definition. You can do this on your own if you’re dedicated and knowledgeable, but hiring a pro to guide and motivate you is a worthwhile investment for most aspiring wrestlers. Work out three to five times a week. Use free weights, work out with machines, and do intensive cardiovascular exercise. Focus on exercises like presses, lifts, curls, and pulldowns."

      "content": "Take protein supplements to get more muscular. In order to build and maintain muscle, you’ll need to consume at least .8 grams (0.03 oz) of protein per pound (.45 kg) of your body weight. Even if you eat a protein-rich diet, supplementing with protein powders and similar products can help you get greater results out of your hardcore strength-building workouts. [2] X Research source Some wrestlers do turn to steroids and similar performance enhancers, but you should always prioritize your long-term health and safety. Talk to your doctor about protein supplements, as well as your ideal diet and exercise program for building muscle safely."

      "content": "Go to a pro wrestling training school. At a training school, you’ll be able to learn from people who formerly wrestled on the professional circuit. Before signing up, ask whether the school has had graduates who have gone on to wrestle in the WWE or another major promotion. [3] X Research source A class or program may cost between $1000 to $5000 (USD) per year for 2 to 4 sessions per week. Even if they offer 3 or 6 month programs, plan to stick around for 2 or 3 years if you want to make it to the big time. Beginner classes will focus on basic moves, cardio, and getting you into shape to perform in the ring. Intermediate classes will focus on improving your moves, learning the psychology of the ring, and pairing with someone for a match. Search online for schools in your area."

      "title": "View your fellow wrestlers as teammates, not opponents.",
      "content": "View your fellow wrestlers as teammates, not opponents. While other heavy-contact sports like boxing are individual affairs, wrestling is much more team-oriented. Because professional wrestling is more about entertaining than winning, you’ll need to work with your opponent to entertain the crowd. This doesn’t mean that pro wrestling is “fake.” Instead, it means that the focus is on performance rather than victory. In pro wrestling, winning means giving the crowd a great show. And you can only do that by working with your ring opponent, rather than fighting against them."

      "title": "Exaggerate your personality in the ring.",
      "content": "Exaggerate your personality in the ring. Since wrestlers are constantly appealing to and rallying the crowd around them, it helps to embrace a demonstrative personality. Consider responding to things in a dramatic or exaggerated fashion. This way, you’ll magnify the persona that you’re developing and give the audience a unique personality to support. [5] X Research source Taking acting lessons or getting some experience as a performer may help you develop your persona and learn to “work the crowd.”"

When wrestling against a more experienced person, you’ll have a chance to see their unique style up close. In addition, you’ll be able to observe their persona in the ring. This will help you hone your own character and improve your style. Watch and learn, but also ask lots of questions. Most seasoned wrestlers are more than willing to share tips and dish out advice (in addition to body slams!)."

Whether you watch on television or in person, you’ll be able to observe how others wrestle, as well as express their style and persona. In many ways, watching wrestling is an education.

Never forget that wrestling ability means little without the development of a unique persona that can get the attention of the audience. You may want to exaggerate qualities you already possess for your ring persona, or try something completely opposite — like being boisterous and raunchy if you’re naturally soft-spoken and mild-mannered. [6] X Research source Your character can be very likeable or very unlikeable — the important thing is for it to be striking and memorable. Use the ring personas of several well-known wrestlers as a starting point, and blend them into a character that’s all your own."
