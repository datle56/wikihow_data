      "content": "Observe your rabbit. Before taking your rabbit to a veterinarian, try to assess for yourself why the rabbit may be sneezing. Monitoring symptoms can help you better aid the vet in determining what's wrong. Your rabbit could have an upper respiratory infection, which may manifest with runny nose, runny eyes, and sneezing. It could also be a lower respiratory infection, which would include symptoms like loud breathing. Rabbits with lower respiratory infections may also that stick their noses up when breathing. Foreign object such as a hair or a bit of food trapped in a nasal passage. In this case, there would be few symptoms beyond sneezing. A dental problem, such as an infection that has spread to the nose, can cause sneezing. This would cause other cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, and is most likely in older rabbits.

Many carriers now come with food and water dishes built in. Your pet's safety is the main thing when choosing a carrier, so find the right one for your needs before bringing your sick rabbit to the vet. Choose from crates, slings, and more. You can talk to a pet store owner or ask the vet over the phone what kind of carrier you should purchase if you don't already have one."

      "content": "Allow the veterinarian to assess the problem. The vet may have to do different tests, along with a physical exam, to determine the cause of the problem. Your appointment length will depend on what tests the vet feels the need to conduct. Some vets ask that you bring in a stool sample for testing. This sample should be less than 24 hours old. Your vet may want to do a blood tests, where blood will be drawn from your rabbit. They might also take a sample of any nasal discharge on which to run tests. These tests will help determine what kind of antibiotic will be best to help your rabbit fight the infection, if applicable. Be sure to tell the vet everything about your rabbit's home, from what your rabbit eats to what kind of bedding he uses. It may be something as simple as a change in bedding that puts an end to the sneezing."

      "title": "Use antibiotics or other medicines as directed.",
      "content": "Use antibiotics or other medicines as directed. If you are sent home with antibiotics to give your rabbit, use them as directed and do not skip any doses. You may even receive antibiotics before any test results are back as a precautionary measure. Skipping doses of antibiotics or finishing antibiotics too early can help create resistant strains of bacteria. This can make it harder to find an antibiotic that will work the next time your rabbit has an infection. Always give the full course, even after symptoms have gone away, making sure to give the correct amount at the correct time. Some antibiotics may make your rabbit's digestive system slow down. Any changes in appetite or elimination habits need to be reported to your vet to make sure it's a temporary reaction to the medication and not a sign of a more serious problem. If your rabbit does not eat or eliminate in a 10 â€“ 12 period, contact your vet immediately. This can be a sign of a potentially fatal medical emergency."

For this reason, you need to prepare a calm area ahead of time where you can medicate your rabbit. Choose a flat surface, such as the floor or a table or countertop. Pick a table that's fairly low to the ground in the event the rabbit jumps down. Have all supplies ready to go. Get out any syringes, pills, or other supplies you might need. [3] X Research source"

You should always take such precautions to protect your rabbit, but especially if your rabbit has been sick. [6] X Research source"
