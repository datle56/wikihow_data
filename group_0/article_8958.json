      "content": "Older adults may have difficulty speaking and understanding. Be sure you consider the person's health before you engage in communication. For example, they may have hearing problems, speech problems, and memory loss. These factors complicate communication. And remember, chronological age is not always a true indicator of a person’s health (see Warnings).

      "content": "Evaluate the noise level and distractions in your environment. Is there any disturbing background noise ? Are many people speaking in the same room? Is there any intrusive music? Are there any distractions that could affect your communication? Ask the older adult if the environment is comfortable for them. If you sense any disturbance, try to move to a more peaceful and quiet location.

      "content": "Direct your speech at the individual's face, and not to their side. Older adults may have trouble hearing. It is important to articulate your words and speak clearly. Do not eat your words: move your mouth and pronounce each word carefully and precisely. When your tongue “dances” inside your mouth when you talk, you articulate more clearly. If your tongue “sleeps” and plays a passive role, you are more likely not articulating as well as you could.

      "content": "Learn to adapt your voice to the needs of the individual. Evaluate the environment and how it relates to the person’s hearing abilities. Don't shout simply because the listener is older. Treat the individual with respect by articulating and speaking at a comfortable volume that is suitable for both of you. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Feel free to repeat or rephrase what you’re saying.",
      "content": "Feel free to repeat or rephrase what you’re saying. Complicated questions and sentences may confuse older adults who have short-term memory or hearing loss. Clear and precise constructions are easier to comprehend. [5] X Research source Use direct questions: \"Did you have soup for lunch?\" \"Did you have salad for lunch?\" Instead of: \"What did you have for lunch?\" The more precise you are in your language, the less difficulty the elderly have in understanding. Reduce the \"noise\" in your sentences and questions. Limit your sentences and questions to 20 words or less. Don't use slang or filler words and phrases. (\"Like,\" \"well,\" and \"you know\" are a few examples.) Keep your sentences brief and direct to the point. Avoid the confusion of mixed ideas and questions. Try to define your ideas and questions logically. If you mix ideas, it may be confusing for the older adult to understand. Express one idea and message at a time. For example, \"It is a good idea to call John, your brother. Later, we can call Susan, your sister.\" A more complicated construction would be: \"I think we should call your brother, John, first, and then later we could call your sister, Susan.\""

      "content": "Show the individual what or who you are talking about. If an older adult has a hearing or memory problem, it is important to be creative . Visual aids help. For example, it may be better to say, \"Is there any pain in your back (pointing to your back)? Is there any pain in your stomach (pointing to your stomach)?\" instead of simply asking \"Do you have any pain or discomfort?\" [6] X Research source"

      "title": "A sincere smile shows that you are understanding.",
      "content": "A sincere smile shows that you are understanding. It also creates a friendly environment in which to communicate. Remember to pause between sentences and questions. Give the individual an opportunity to understand and digest information and questions. This is a particularly valuable technique if a person has memory loss. When you pause, you show respect and patience. [7] X Research source They may experience symptoms of anxiety or depression. If they spend most of their day worrying, crying, or experiencing profound hopelessness, contact a therapist. Many therapists offer online services. Most insurance companies reimburse for teletherapy."
