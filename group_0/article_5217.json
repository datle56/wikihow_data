      "content": "Check for 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of room around your foot when you try them on. When standing in them you should be able to see about a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of the footbed all around your foot. If you try them on and your toes or heels hang over the edges, go up a size. Check for the 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of room while standing still and walking around because your foot might shift as you walk."

      "content": "Make sure the straps are a good fit and don’t rub the top of your feet. If the straps are leather or cloth, make sure it’s a snug fit. Flip flops with rubber straps can be less irritating to the skin on your feet but make sure the material isn’t too tight or too loose in certain places. [1] X Research source Tight rubber straps might cut into your skin over time and loose rubber straps might cause irritation friction."

      "title": "Choose a flip flop with a thick sole and good arch support.",
      "content": "Choose a flip flop with a thick sole and good arch support. Flip flops aren’t typically the most supportive shoes—most of the time they’re intended for convenience. Try to find a well-padded flip flop that has a thicker sole near where the middle part of your foot rests (the arch). If you can feel your heel hitting the hard ground when you walk, that’s a sign of a thin sole. Too much walking in a thin flip flop will eventually cause your feet to be sore. Light foam footbeds might seem like a cheap, easy option, but this material provides little to no support. Over time, wearing flip flops like this can cause plantar fasciitis (painful inflammation near the heel of your foot). Try bending the flip flop with your hands to test its stability. Too much bend near the center of the footbed means it provides little stability."

      "title": "Opt for foot-molding footbeds for increased comfort and support.",
      "content": "Opt for foot-molding footbeds for increased comfort and support. Flip flops that have foot-molding footbeds will gradually change their form to fit the shape of your foot. They’re a good choice if you’ll be doing a lot of walking because they usually provide good support and shock absorption. [2] X Research source Note that if you currently have foot problems like pronation or supination (that is, your weight rolling either to the inside or outside of your foot), foot-molding footbeds might exacerbate the problem."

      "title": "Opt for contoured footbeds for the most stability and support.",
      "content": "Opt for contoured footbeds for the most stability and support. If you’re going to be wearing your flip flops every day or doing lots of walking, contoured footbeds are the way to go. They’ll give you the most stability and arch support. Some are even molded to be orthopedic and will help correct any mild abnormalities in your foot muscles. [3] X Research source Try on different pairs of contoured flip flops as the heel cups (the back part cradling your heel), toe boxes (the front part holding your toes), and arch height can vary from model to model. Note that contoured flip-flops can be pricey, but it may be worth it for the health of your feet! Plus, they’ll probably last a lot longer than foam-soled flip flops."

      "title": "When walking, keep your feet pointed as straight as you can.",
      "content": "When walking, keep your feet pointed as straight as you can. If you walk with your feet turned inward (“pigeon-toed”) or outward (“duck-footed”), your flip flops might get caught on the ground or each other and cause you to trip. Walking either one of these ways can also cause foot abnormalities and other issues over time. [4] X Research source If you naturally walk pigeon-toed or duck-footed, you can correct your gait by doing hip and leg rotation exercises."

      "title": "Do penguin walks to help correct pigeon toeing.",
      "content": "Do penguin walks to help correct pigeon toeing. Stand upright with your feet turned outward. Shift your weight onto your heels and walk about 20 to 30 paces. Do about 3 or 4 sets of 20 paces at least once a day for the best results. [5] X Research source This simple exercise will help your hips’ external rotation—internally rotated hips are a common cause of pigeon toes."

      "title": "Correct duck-feet with a hip rotation stretch.",
      "content": "Correct duck-feet with a hip rotation stretch. Stand upright with your right leg raised in front of you. Lock your knee and flex your feet so your toes are pulled back. Then, rotate your right hip toward your center (so your raised toes are pointing to the left). Return to the starting position to make 1 rep. [6] X Research source Do this simple move 10 to 12 times on each leg at least once a day."

      "title": "Keep your strides natural or a little shorter, if necessary.",
      "content": "Keep your strides natural or a little shorter, if necessary. Taking large steps can put pressure on your hip flexors and, over time, this can lead to strains and lower back pain. Your gait might be a little shorter while you’re wearing flip flops because taking smaller steps helps keep them on. It’s better to go with what feels natural than to try to overcompensate by taking larger steps. [7] X Research source Taking smaller strides also helps absorb some of the shock when you step. Over-striding might can also cause sore heels and lead to plantar fasciitis over time."

      "title": "Pinch your big toe and pointer toe together as you walk.",
      "content": "Pinch your big toe and pointer toe together as you walk. Slightly squeezing these two toes together will help you to keep control of the position of the flip-flop on your foot, lessening the chance that you might trip. This is especially important if your flip flops don’t have a thong or toe hold. You don’t have to actively try to do this as it should just come naturally. If your flip flop comes off even if you’re pinching your big toe and second toe together, that’s a sign that you need to go down a size."

      "title": "Curl your toes slightly to grip the flip flop.",
      "content": "Curl your toes slightly to grip the flip flop. Curling your toes just slightly can help you keep your balance and grip on the flip flop. However, avoid over-curling your toes because doing so can cause hammer toes and lead to corns, calluses, and foot pain. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source As your foot is directly under your body, your toes will naturally curl as if to grip the ground. Then, once your foot passes behind your body, your toes straighten again in order to propel you forward while keeping your balance."

      "title": "Walk heel to toe to keep your legs and hips pain-free.",
      "content": "Walk heel to toe to keep your legs and hips pain-free. Walk in flip flops as if you were barefoot. Avoid scuffling along flat-footed because doing so can lead to hip and leg issues over time. If your flip flops fit correctly, there should be no need to continuously scuff or slide your feet to keep them on. [9] X Research source Touch the ground with the fleshy part of your heel first, then roll your foot downward onto the ground so the outside of the arch will make contact before the ball of your foot and toes. The flip flop should hit the heel of your back foot as you lift it off the ground to bring it forward again (hence the name “flip flop”)."
