      "content": "Use a silicone spray on a variety of surfaces. A silicone spray in an aerosol container can help lubricate, protect, and waterproof a surface. It can be used on a wide variety of surfaces, including metal, glass, painted surfaces, and even fabrics. [1] X Research source In addition, it is safe to use on plastics, vinyl, and rubber. Silicone sprays can be purchased at hardware stores and typically cost less than $10. [2] X Research source Consider using a silicone spray on a work surface in your home or garage to prevent objects from sticking to it. Spray the outside of a backpack to help create a water-resistant barrier."
