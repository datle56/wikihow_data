      "title": "Put them on for about an hour a day to break them in within a week.",
      "content": "Put them on for about an hour a day to break them in within a week. This is the easiest, safest, and cheapest way to break them in, even though it takes a while. Put them on first thing in the morning before your feet expand and walk in them for 30 to 60 minutes a day (or longer to speed up the process). This gives the leather time to stretch and break in gradually. [1] X Research source Compliment other stretching methods, like boot stretchers or steam, by walking around in your boots afterward. Depending on how often and how long you wear them, the boots could take several days or up to several weeks to break in. If you wear stiff boots for several hours or more in one day, let them “rest” for a day before you wear them again."

      "title": "Extra socks make your feet “bigger” and stretch the boot leather faster.",
      "content": "Extra socks make your feet “bigger” and stretch the boot leather faster. Wear 2 pairs of socks (or even one pair of extra thick socks) while you walk around in your boots to make them softer and more flexible. Try moisture wicking socks to keep your feet dry in the extra layers. Even with extra socks on, walking in new boots might get painful. Only wear them a few hours a day while they break in, and take breaks if you get sore."

      "title": "Boot stretchers",
      "content": "Boot stretchers expand your boots without you having to wear them. Insert the boot stretcher and turn the knob or handle until the area of the boot you need to stretch becomes taut. Leave the stretcher in overnight and test out your new, roomier boots in the morning. Use a boot stretcher that’s designed to expand the area that’s giving you trouble, or else you’ll expand the boot in the wrong places. Boot stretchers are also great for older pairs of boots that have shrunk or gone stiff because they haven’t been worn in a while."

      "title": "Boot stretch spray",
      "content": "Boot stretch spray makes leather more flexible overnight. Spray the insides and the outsides of the boots and then insert a boot stretcher or other materials (like rolled up socks or wadded up newspaper) to hold their shape. Let the boots sit overnight. If you’re in a hurry, put the boots on right after you spray them and wear them while you go about your day."

    {
      "title": "Leather conditioner",
      "content": "Leather conditioner makes boot fibers softer after a few hours. Use a clean cloth to apply a thin, even layer of conditioner or moisturizer to the outside of the boots. Wait for them to air-dry before putting them on to stretch the leather without cracking it. Condition or moisturize your leather cowboy boots every 3 to 6 months to keep them soft and flexible. You can also use mink oil to moisturize the leather but remember that mink oil will darken the leather."

      "title": "Soften the leather manually with a gentle beating in a few minutes.",
      "content": "Soften the leather manually with a gentle beating in a few minutes. First, apply leather conditioner and then boot stretch spray to protect the leather. Then insert a wooden board into the boots and use a hammer to tap along the outer curves and pressure points. Keep tapping or repeating the process until you’re happy with the shape, fit, and feel of the boots. Alternatively, grab your boots by the toe and knock them on the ground or a table 5 times. Try the boots on and repeat until they fit more comfortably."

      "title": "The heat and moisture helps soften stiff leather in minutes.",
      "content": "The heat and moisture helps soften stiff leather in minutes. First, boil a pot or kettle of water and then hold your boots upside down over it to let the steam inside. Hold them for about 20 seconds, then feel for any remaining stiff spots. Steam those areas for another 10 to 15 seconds. Let the boots cool slightly and then put them on while they’re still warm and soft. Walk around in them for about 10 minutes, or until they fully cool down. Too much direct heat can cause leather to fade, so be sure not to hold the boots too close to the steam for too long. Alternatively, use a clothes steamer instead of a pot of boiling water."

      "title": "As the water turns into ice and expands, your boots will expand, too.",
      "content": "As the water turns into ice and expands, your boots will expand, too. Fill 2 sealable bags with water, leaving a little room for air, and gently stuff them into the toe areas without popping the bags. Fill the rest of the boot with newspaper or socks to keep the bags in place, then put the boots in a box or container. Put the box in your freezer for at least 8 hours. The cold temperatures won’t damage your boots or the leather. Pull the boots out of the freezer and let the ice thaw in a cool, dry place before taking the water bags out. Try on your boots to see how they fit. If they’re still tight or stiff, repeat the process."

      "title": "Rubbing alcohol",
      "content": "Rubbing alcohol softens leather for a faster break-in time. Use a clean cloth to apply rubbing alcohol all over the insides of your boots, then apply some on the outsides over extra stiff or tight spots. Leave your boots to air-dry—as the alcohol evaporates, the leather will become more supple. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Hairdryers target and soften hard spots on your boot in minutes.",
      "content": "Hairdryers target and soften hard spots on your boot in minutes. Set your hairdryer to the lowest heat setting to avoid fading the leather and warm up the inside of the boots. Then target any problem areas that feel too stiff or tight, like the toe or the shaft. [3] X Research source Hold the dryer at least 8 inches (20 cm) away from the boot to avoid overheating. Apply leather conditioner or moisturizer afterward to keep the boot leather soft and smooth."

      "title": "Flex the boots at their creases to complement other break-in methods.",
      "content": "Flex the boots at their creases to complement other break-in methods. First, walk around in your cowboy boots for a few minutes and notice where small creases begin to form near the toe, ankle, or other places. Then take them off and bend them in those places with your hands. This method won’t break in the boots all by itself, but supplements other methods for a shorter break-in time. Also try flexing the sole and heel to increase flexibility and softness in thick areas."

      "title": "Use water to shrink large boots down to a comfortable fit.",
      "content": "Use water to shrink large boots down to a comfortable fit. Apply leather oil or conditioner to your boots and then submerge them in a bucket or tub of warm water for 30 to 60 minutes. Then soak a pair of socks and wear them with your wet boots until they dry out. The wet socks might feel uncomfortable, but they’ll protect you from wet boot blisters! As the boots dry, they’ll shrink and mold to the shape of your feet. Keep the boots largely in the shade so they dry slowly. If they’re thick boots, it might take several days to dry fully. Apply another layer of leather oil after submerging, and consider rubbing antibacterial lotion on the insides to keep them from smelling. Only use this method on boots that are too large. Tight boots will get even tighter after soaking. If you’re worried about damaging your boots, spray the outsides with water or wrap them with warm, damp towels instead of fully submerging them.
