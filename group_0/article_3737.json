      "content": "Attend a university with an AKA chapter. If you know you’d like to join AKA prior to choosing a school, consider colleges with their own chapter. If your school doesn’t have a chapter, look up local undergraduate city chapters. [1] X Research source Your school might be affiliated with them. [2] X Research source The only difference between a city chapter and a university one is the membership pool. City chapters serve all participating colleges in the area, allowing you to bond with sisters across town."

      "title": "Attend the official Rush.",
      "content": "Attend the official Rush. Rush begins the undergrad membership process. It lasts about 4 days, with each day sporting a different focus. If you don’t attend Rush, you’re ineligible for AKA consideration. Add a reminder on your phone so you remember Rush’s location, time, and date. Day 1 introduces you to all the houses at your school. Day 2 and 3 vary by college, but might include a skit, philanthropy presentation, or a craft, along with a house tour. Day 4 is Preference, where you’ll learn the traditions and values of the house. [7] X Research source Plan your outfits beforehand. Day 1 is the most casual, so try dark jeans and a sweater. Upgrade to a skirt and sandals for Day 2, and heels on Day 3. On Day 4, wear a cocktail dress and a statement necklace. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Begin the official Membership Intake Process (MiP). You’ll start this process when you receive a Letter of Acceptance after Rush.

[10] X Research source Pledging is not required to join AKA. Knowingly participating in pledge activities could hurt your chances of becoming an AKA, as it’s not part of the process."
