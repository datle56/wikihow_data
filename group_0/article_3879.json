For example, if you are creating text in the shape of a flag, the “Bend” slider will adjust how much the text ‘waves.’ The center of the slider bar represents 0% (no bend). Dragging the slider to the left of the center of the bar will cause the text to bend in the opposite direction."

      "content": "Adjust the distortion of the text. There are two slider bars for “Horizontal Distortion” and “Vertical Distortion.” These adjust how much the text is allowed to skew along the bend. No distortion will keep the letter shapes relatively proportional along the shape of the bend. Adding distortion skews the shape of the letters to create a sort of perspective/3D effect."

Click where you want the curved line to start. Click and hold where you want the curved line to end. While holding the mouse button, drag in the opposite direction you want the line to curve.

After you release the mouse button, you can adjust the curve by clicking and dragging the dots at the end of the straight lines (Bezier curve handles) attached to the point at the end of the line. Ellipse Tool: Click the Ellipse tool in the toolbar (the shape tool, not the selection tool). Click and drag to create an oval or circle shape to type on. To create a perfect circle, hold Shift while you drag. If you don’t see the Ellipse tool in the toolbar, click and hold the Rectangle tool. Click the Ellipse tool in the pop-out menu"
