[2] X Research source Check the packaging the sausage came in for temperature recommendations, since different sausages may have different requirements. Oven cooking is a simple way to warm large, uncut sausages indoors."

      "content": "Spread the sausages evenly on a tray lined with parchment paper. Cover a tray with parchment paper or tin foil sprayed with a non-stick cooking spray to prevent the sausages from sticking to the pan. Space the sausages 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) apart in a single layer to allow them to cook on all sides. [3] X Research source If you’re cooking a lot of sausages, bake them in multiple batches or on multiple sheets. Most sausages, both raw and smoked, don’t require any preparation to be oven-roasted. The big difference between the two is that raw sausages are roasted whole and cut after, whereas smoked sausages can be cut ahead of time and roasted in pieces."

[4] X Trustworthy Source FoodSafety.gov Online portal combining food safety information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Go to source Stab the thickest part of the sausage with the thermometer, then wait until the temperature reading is stable. Once they’re 165 °F (74 °C), they’re done. [5] X Research source If the sausage is shriveled or blackened, take it out of the oven. If you want your sausage to be extra browned/crispy, flip them once after about 8 minutes, or put them under a broiler for a few minutes. Watch the sausages the entire time—broilers can burn them quickly. You can also check for doneness through the color of the juice. If you cut open a sausage and the juices run clear, they’re done. The only drawback is that this method can dry out your sausages."

      "content": "Heat around 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of oil on a skillet over medium heat. Add enough vegetable oil to barely cover the bottom of a pan or dutch oven, then turn on your burner to medium heat. The oil helps keep the sausage from burning or sticking to the pan. [6] X Research source Wait a few minutes for the pan to heat up. Use medium or medium-high heat only. If the pan is too hot, the sausage may crack or shrivel. If you’re using the sausage as an ingredient in another dish (a pasta or soup, for example) cut them into 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) rounds, or slice them in half lengthwise."

The liquid in the pot flavors the sausage, so get creative! [8] X Research source Usually, 6 US qt (5.7 L) is enough to submerge the sausages, although it depends on the size of your pot. [9] X Research source If you have a lot of sausage to boil, do it in separate batches or use multiple pots. For extra flavor, add seasonings like lemon, bay leaves, sage, salt, pepper, or red pepper flakes. This is especially good if you’re boiling other ingredients in the pot, as well.

Leave at least 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of space between each sausage. That way the heat can reach them more indirectly, which makes them less likely to burst.

If the casing splits, turn the temperature down (for charcoal grills, close the vents) and watch the sausages very carefully. They may have been left on the grill for too long. Dark grill marks on the sausages are okay, just make sure the outer casing is a uniform golden brown color."
