You will need: 5 pounds tomatoes 1 pound canned green chilis, chopped 2 jalapeños, seeded and chopped (if you want extra spicy salsa, add two more jalapeños) 2 cups chopped white onion 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup white vinegar 1/2 cup chopped cilantro 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon sugar"

      "title": "Prepare the tomatoes.",
      "content": "Prepare the tomatoes. Canned tomato salsa tastes best when the tomatoes have been peeled. To peel the tomatoes, use the following method: Remove the stems from the tomatoes and give them a rinse. Use a sharp knife to cut an \"x\" at either end of each tomato. Put a large pot of water on the stove and bring it to a boil. Blanch the tomatoes by dropping them in the boiling water and allowing them to cook for 30 seconds. Remove the tomatoes, allow them to cool, and peel off the skin at the \"x.\" It should come right off. Taking care to preserve the juices, use a knife to slice out the core of the tomatoes. Chop the tomatoes and set them aside in a bowl with their juices."

      "title": "Pour the salsa into clean canning jars.",
      "content": "Pour the salsa into clean canning jars. Fill the jars to within a quarter inch (half a cm) of the rim. Use a funnel to ensure that the seal between the jar and the lid stays clean. You may want to wash the canning jars using the hot water cycle on your dishwasher before starting the process. Place the lids into boiling water for a couple of minutes to sanitize them. If you spill salsa on the rim of the jars, wipe it off with a paper towel before proceeding."

      "content": "Place the lids on the jars of salsa. Screw on the lid rings to make sure they stay put. Don't tighten the lids too much at this point, since air needs to escape at the next stage of the canning process."
