      "title": "Follow your sibling around wherever they go.",
      "content": "Follow your sibling around wherever they go. If they ask what you’re doing, just ignore them or say, “Nothing.” If they leave the house, follow them outside. If they lock themselves in a room, wait outside the door and keep reminding them you’re there. Every few minutes, say something like “Hey, I’m still here. I haven’t left, don’t worry!” [1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

      "title": "Repeat everything they say in a high-pitched voice.",
      "content": "Repeat everything they say in a high-pitched voice. If they catch on and ask what you’re doing, just repeat the question back to them. If they get frustrated and say, “You’re so annoying, stop it,” say “You’re so annoying, stop it” back to them in a high-pitched voice. Also, if they say something like \"I'm an idiot!\" thinking you will repeat this, change it to \"You're an idiot!\" It will drive them nuts! [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Steal food off their plate at dinner when they’re not looking.",
      "content": "Steal food off their plate at dinner when they’re not looking. Wait until they notice some of their food is missing and then pretend you have no idea what they’re talking about. If they’re not catching on, say “Woah, slow down. Why are you eating so fast?” Make sure you’re sneaky so your parents don’t catch you!"

      "title": "Bother them when they’re around their friends.",
      "content": "Bother them when they’re around their friends. If they’re watching TV with their friends, stand in front of the TV so they can’t see and demand attention. If they’re hanging out in their room with their friends, bang on the door until they let you in. If they don’t, slip notes under the door with random words or drawings on them. Eventually, they might give up and let you join them. If nothing else is working, get out old photo albums and show your sibling’s friends embarrassing pictures of your sibling as a baby."

    {
      "title": "Hide your sibling’s phone and then text or call it.",
      "content": "Hide your sibling’s phone and then text or call it. Wait until they’re distracted watching TV or doing homework and then grab their phone without them noticing. Hide it in a spot that will take them forever to find. Then, call their phone so it starts ringing, and keep calling it over and over again while they run around looking for it. The longer it takes them to find it, the more annoyed they’ll be! Try hiding it in a box of food in a cupboard or all the way in the back of a drawer. Hide it somewhere that muffles the sound so it takes them forever to find it."

    {
      "title": "Hide in their room and jump out and scare them.",
      "content": "Hide in their room and jump out and scare them. Go underneath their bed or get in their closet when they’re not around. Then, when they come in their room and get settled in, pop out and yell something loud like “Gotcha!” If you’re hiding under their bed, you can reach out and grab their leg when they walk by to scare them."

      "title": "Turn off the WiFi or Ethernet when they’re using their computer.",
      "content": "Turn off the WiFi or Ethernet when they’re using their computer. Find the modem in your house and unplug it. Then, wait for your sibling to start asking questions — when they do, pretend you don’t know what they’re talking about. Tell them the WiFi (or Ethernet) is working just fine for you. They’ll end up thinking there’s something wrong with their computer! Just remember, this will mess up the WiFi (or Ethernet) for you and everyone else in the house too. After 10 or 15 minutes, fill them in on your prank. Say something like “Oh yeah, I forgot I unplugged the WiFi (or Ethernet). Whoops!” Make sure your parents aren’t using the WiFi (or Ethernet) or you could get in trouble! This might work better if almost everyone in your home is using Ethernet."

      "title": "Rearrange their room when they’re not home.",
      "content": "Rearrange their room when they’re not home. Move their furniture around so it's all in different places. Take everything off their shelves and desk and reorganize them in funny ways. You can even take the posters on their walls down and put them back up somewhere else. Try to be as quick as possible so they don't come home and catch you! [3] X Research source Remake their bed so the pillows are at the bottom of the bed where their feet usually go. You can also turn any chairs in their room upside down."

      "title": "Wake your sibling up early in the morning with a loud noise.",
      "content": "Wake your sibling up early in the morning with a loud noise. Sneak into their room while they’re asleep and get close to their ear. Then, clap your hands together or yell to wake them up. As soon as they wake up, run into your room and jump in your bed. When they confront you about it, just say “I never did that. You must have been dreaming.\" Bring a metal spoon or pot with you and bang them together if you want to be extra annoying."

    {
      "title": "Blast a song they don’t like really loudly on speakers.",
      "content": "Blast a song they don’t like really loudly on speakers. Set up the speakers in whatever room they’re in so it’s extra loud. If they lock themselves in their room, set up the speakers in the hallway outside. Save this for when your parents aren’t home so you don’t disturb them and get in trouble. If your sibling hates country music, find a country song and play it loudly on repeat. Blasting classical music might be a great way to drive your sibling mad."

    {
      "title": "Shout in their ear when they’re talking on the phone.",
      "content": "Shout in their ear when they’re talking on the phone. Sneak up behind them and yell in their ear so they can’t hear the person they’re talking to. If they walk away, follow them and keep doing it. If you want to distract them even more, poke them while you’re doing it — they’ll only have one free hand to stop you."

    {
      "title": "Sing a song over and over again in front of them.",
      "content": "Sing a song over and over again in front of them. Don’t acknowledge them while you’re doing it — just keep singing as you’re doing your own thing. Sing a song that’s repetitive and monotone so it’s even more annoying. Eventually, they’ll get super annoyed with you. If you want to be extra annoying, don’t even sing the whole song. Just sing one line of the song over and over again, like “Mary had a little lamb, Mary had a little lamb, Mary had a little lamb…”"
