      "content": "The Third Step Prayer is a prayer used in Alcoholics Anonymous. The Third Step Prayer is a part of the Third Step in AA, which states, “[We] made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.” AA members recite the Third Step Prayer to demonstrate their commitment to the Third Step, as well as their commitment to recovery and their acceptance of God’s (or a Higher Power’s) guidance. [1] X Research source AA members usually say the prayer with their sponsor when they begin the Third Step. AA is a 12-step program that aims to help people dealing with alcohol addiction recover and achieve sobriety . Note : While the Third Step Prayer refers to “God,” you do not need to be a member of a certain religion or even be religious to say or practice this prayer. AA does not claim to be a religious organization—“God” can refer to a divine Higher Power, the Universe, your AA community, or simply something that is bigger than yourself. [2] X Research source The Third Step Prayer is on page 63 in Alcoholics Anonymous: The Big Book ."

It’s just important that you are willing to change and accept help from God and other AA members. Just start with small steps, like attending meetings and building trust with your sponsor.
