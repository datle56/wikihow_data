      "title": "Clean the corn.",
      "content": "Clean the corn. Rinse the baby corn under cool, running water, then dry it with clean paper towels. Fresh baby corn may have silks attached to the cobs, so you'll need to pull these silks away while rinsing them. If using frozen baby corn, thaw the corn before use and rinse away any remaining ice crystals. If using canned baby corn, drain the liquid and rinse the corn before use."

      "title": "Trim off the thick ends.",
      "content": "Trim off the thick ends. Using a sharp kitchen knife, trim the thick stem ends off each cob of baby corn. The rest of the miniature cob can be left whole. Since baby corn is so small, it's often left whole when cooked and served. If desired, however, you can cut the corn into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes, cut the corn into 1-inch (2.5-cm) diagonals, or slice each mini cob in half lengthwise. Note that cut baby corn requires less cooking time than whole baby corn, however."

      "content": "Transfer the baby corn to ice water. Submerge the baby corn in the bowl of ice water. Keep the miniature cobs in the ice water for 30 to 60 seconds. The ice water halts the cooking process and prevents the corn from getting any softer. When you feel the baby corn, it should still seem quite crisp."

      "title": "Serve or use as desired.",
      "content": "Serve or use as desired. Drain the water and dry the baby corn. You can then serve the baby corn as it is or use it in other recipes. You can toss blanched baby corn into salads, chilled pasta, or other cold dishes. Similarly, you can add blanched baby corn to hot dishes during the last minute or so of cooking. Since the corn is already partially cooked, you won't need to continue cooking it much longer."

If desired, you can add salt to the water after it reaches a boil. Doing so can draw more flavor out of the corn as it cooks. Do not add the salt before the water boils, however, since doing so will increase the amount of time required to bring the water up to temperature."

Place the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat, and heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). Use a frying thermometer to check the temperature of the oil. If the oil isn't hot enough, the batter could get soggy before the corn finishes cooking. If the oil is too hot, the batter could burn before the corn is adequately cooked."

Fry the corn until both sides are golden brown, flipping them once halfway through the process. Continue working in batches to avoid crowding the pan.
