      "content": "A few tell-tale clues can tell you if it’s time to schedule that video date. Check how often the person messages you—they’re probably interested if they’re texting you frequently. Plus, take a closer look at what they’re sending. Generally, a text with friendly emojis is a sure sign that they’d like to go on a video date with you. [1] X Expert Source Maya Diamond, MA Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 17 January 2019. [2] X Research source If they’re interested, they might also reply to your texts quickly and have plenty of in-depth conversations with you. For example, if they text you a blushing smile or a smirk emoji, there’s a chance they might be interested in something."

      "content": "Phone calls are a great starting point and can be a lot less intimidating than video calls. As your phone conversation starts to wind down, ask your date if they’d like to video chat next time. If they don’t feel comfortable yet, put the idea on the back burner for another time. [3] X Research source After the call, you might shoot your date a text saying, “It was so nice talking with you! Wanna try FaceTime or Zoom for our next chat?” or “Feeling up to a FaceTime call this weekend? I’ve got lots of free time on Saturday.” If you’re feeling especially ambitious, you could suggest a video date at the beginning of the phone call. You might say, “I know this out of the blue, but do you feel up for a FaceTime call?” or “I’d love to ‘meet’ you, even if it’s just virtually. Would you like to do Skype call?”"

      "content": "Suggest your idea before the conversation really gets going. Shoot them a brief message and see if they’d be interested in switching to video chat. If they’d like to give it a shot, decide on a video platform to use so you can get things going. If they don’t seem super interested at the time, reassure them that there’s no pressure and that you can always video call another time. [4] X Research source You might say, “As much as I enjoy texting, I’d love to be able to put a face to a name? Are you feeling up for a FaceTime call?” or “Wanna change things up? I was thinking we could try a video call tonight.”"

      "title": "FaceTime, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger are all fair game.",
      "content": "FaceTime, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger are all fair game. Lots of different chatting and social media platforms have their own video chat software, which can get your date up-and-running with the touch of a button. Ask your date if they’re on social media, or if they have an iPhone or iPad that they can FaceTime with. [5] X Research source Zoom, Google Meet, Google Duo, Microsoft Teams, Spike, and Telegram are other ways to host a video date. [6] X Research source Some dating apps have built-in video chat features, like Bumble, Badoo, The League, and The Intro. [7] X Research source Tinder also has a video chat service called “Face to Face.” [8] X Research source You could say, “Would you like to FaceTime later?” or “Are you up to anything this Saturday? If you aren’t busy, I was thinking we set up a video date on Facebook Messenger.”"

      "content": "Ask your date to cook dinner with you via their phone, tablet, or laptop. Invite them to pick up the ingredients for their favorite meal. Then, you can both watch each other cook from the comfort of your own kitchens. Once the food is ready, sit down at the table with your phone, tablet, or laptop. [9] X Research source For instance, you might suggest, “Want to have a virtual date? We can FaceTime while making dinner this Friday.” You could say, “My future dinner plans include spaghetti and meatballs, but I’d love if you could there, too. Free for a Zoom call on Sunday night?” Cooking a meal together might be a bit much for your very first video call together. If you’d prefer to take things slow, you could always make the meal ahead of time, pick up some takeout, or invite them to a virtual “happy hour.”"

      "content": "Invite your date to try new wines with you from the comforts of home. Encourage your date to order or pick up a specific type of wine.

[10] X Research source You might say, “Are you busy Thursday night? I was thinking we could Skype call and go on a virtual wine tour together.” You could even say, “I bought this new Merlot that I’m dying to try. Would you want to pick up a bottle and try it with me?

[11] X Research source You could say, “A new movie just dropped on Netflix yesterday.
