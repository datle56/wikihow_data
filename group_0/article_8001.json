      "content": "Make a cleaning solution with dish soap and water. Fill a bucket with roughly 1 gallon (3.8 L) of warm water. Add 1 tbsp (15 ml) of dish soap to the water. Stir the solution with your clean hands or a utensil, like a wooden spoon, until the soap is distributed throughout and bubbles form."

      "title": "Use a dampened cloth to wipe the surface.",
      "content": "Use a dampened cloth to wipe the surface. Dip a clean cloth or rag into the solution. Remove the rag and wring out excess solution into the bucket. Scrub dirty rubber firmly with your cloth until it is clean. Your cleaning cloth will absorb dirtiness while cleaning. Remove this by dunking the cloth in the solution and wringing it out over the bucket. Avoid using abrasive cleaners and cleaning tools. These can deform or cloud the surface of your rubber."

      "content": "Rinse remaining solution from the rubber. Once the dirtiness has been removed, turn on your sink and run the rubber under the faucet to rinse away all soap from the rubber. The leftover solution can be used for other cleaning projects or dumped down the drain."

      "title": "Allow the rubber to air dry.",
      "content": "Allow the rubber to air dry. Choose a spot out of the sun when air drying rubber. Sunlight will break down rubber over time. Avoid using direct heat to dry rubber, as this can also damage it. Speed up dry times by blowing air on drying rubber with a hairdryer set to “Cool.” In some cases, it may seem as though the rubber is cleaned while wet, but when it dries, stickiness may remain. Clean remaining stickiness a second time with soapy water as described, or use rubbing alcohol in the fashion described in the following step."

    {
      "title": "Use rubbing alcohol for stubborn stickiness.",
      "content": "Use rubbing alcohol for stubborn stickiness. Although alcohol is an effective cleaner for most kinds of stickiness, you should only use this cleaning agent on rubber occasionally. Dampen a clean rag with alcohol and wipe at sticky areas until they are removed. Rinse the rubber with water afterwards. [1] X Research source Exposing rubber too often or too long to alcohol may cause it to break down more quickly than normal. [2] X Research source"

Fold the baking soda into the water with a spoon until it reaches a paste-like consistency. If the mixture is too runny, add more baking soda. If the mixture gets too thick, add a splash of water.

Leave the baking soda alone for at least 5 minutes so it has a chance to absorb the stain.

When you’ve finished scrubbing the stain with your toothbrush, wipe away any excess paste with a clean rag. [5] X Research source If it is a large stain, then use a stiff-bristled cleaning brush."

This time, use a spray bottle filled with white vinegar to help lift the stain even more. Allow the paste to sit for another 5 minutes before scrubbing it off. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Rinse the mats with the spray attachment of a garden hose. Alternatively, you can use a pressure washer to blast away dirtiness from rubber mats. Turn on the water supply and spray all parts of the mats with water. [7] X Research source Rubber mats are usually designed to be durable. Mats that are flimsy, delicate, or that have a finished surface may be damaged by power washers. Power washers may spray water hard enough to blow away the mat. If this happens to you, use a clean, heavy item to weigh the mat down. Remember to clean under the item as well."

Wet the bristles of a stiff bristle brush with the cleaning solution. Scrub the mats firmly to remove stubborn buildup, spots, and so on. While cleaning, pay close attention to nooks, crannies, and corners. Dirt and debris often collect in these places. Rubber that has a finished surface or is fragile may be damaged by brushes that are too stiff. Clean an out of sight area of the mat with the brush first to determine whether it’ll harm the rubber."

      "content": "Spray tires with water to remove buildup. The dirt and grime that builds up on your tires can be especially difficult to remove. Spray all surfaces of the tire with a high pressure stream of water with a power washer or hose. A power washer is preferred for tire cleaning to more easily remove buildup, though a hose with a spray attachment should work in a pinch. If you are also planning on washing your car, be sure to do so after cleaning your tires. Cleaning tires after washing your car may spread dirtiness to already cleaned parts of the car."

If you don’t have a special tire cleaner, use a moderate amount of dish soap in a bucket of cool water. Mix the solution to distribute the soap before applying it to the tire. Severely dirty tires may need an extra strong cleaning agent, like Bleche-Wite Tire Cleaner or Pinnacle Advanced Wheel Cleaner Concentrate."

Choose a product with UV protection and be sure it doesn’t have any solvent based silicone. Follow the label instructions on your protectant to achieve the best results. Generally, protectant is applied directly to tires with an applicator, cloth, or sponge. Protectant may contain harsh chemicals and require gloves for safe use. Applying protectant to your tires will maintain their condition for longer and protect them from getting dirty again. In most cases, protectants that are milky in color are water based and most suitable for tires. Protectants that are slick and clear likely contain harmful solvent-based silicone.
