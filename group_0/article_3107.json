      "title": "Get the costume.",
      "content": "Get the costume. A red Santa hat, a red jacket with some white fur on it, a black belt, red pants with white fur on the bottoms, and a pair of black boots is great. If you do not have a long, white beard, do not forget it. Buy one that is as realistic as possible. If you do not have a pair of black boots, some boot covers will do."

    {
      "title": "Get the Santa attitude.",
      "content": "Get the Santa attitude. He is always smiling, so you should never be frowning. Smile , laugh , and \"ho ho ho\" as much as possible. Some people feel self-conscious about acting so jolly, but if you have a great costume on, people will not know it is you anyhow. Also, be sure to speak in a deep, jolly voice to sound like Santa."

      "title": "If you are going to interact with children, make sure to do it right.",
      "content": "If you are going to interact with children, make sure to do it right. If they are sitting on your lap, make sure to ask them what they want for Christmas. When they tell you, try to really listen so you can give them an answer (sometimes, even if you cannot understand them, you can simply laugh and say something like, \"That is great!\"). Give them a hug or a high five. You can also give a thumbs up; children love that stuff. Some will present the problem of saying you are not the real Santa. You can deal with this problem one way or another."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fight for your Santa right.",
      "content": "Fight for your Santa right. Tell the child, \"Of course I am the real Santa! Ho ho ho!\" and give them a candy cane so they will not say anything else that could blow your cover."
    },
    {
      "title": "Confess and say to the child, \"That is right, son / sweetie.",
      "content": "Confess and say to the child, \"That is right, son / sweetie. I am just a stand-in. The real Santa is busy making toys for everyone in his workshop at the North Pole, so he asked me to come down and visit you. / I thought I would fill in for him.\" This works well, especially if you have a fake beard because sometimes, that occasional bratty child will try to rip off your fake beard to prove you are not Santa. Plus, the real Santa would want people to spread Christmas cheer, including dressing up as him."

      "title": "Never yell, swear, or get angry at anyone or any children that come to sit on your lap.",
      "content": "Never yell, swear, or get angry at anyone or any children that come to sit on your lap. It is the number one rule of being a good Santa. Santa loves all children."

    {
      "title": "Buy a big red sack and fill it with candy canes.",
      "content": "Buy a big red sack and fill it with candy canes. If you are having children sit on your lap or take a picture with you, give them a candy cane from your sack after each child tells you what they want for Christmas and / or take a picture with you. They just love it. If you are at an adult Christmas party, bounce around happily and give candy canes to random adults. Add in the \"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!\" line, and you will most likely make them smile."
