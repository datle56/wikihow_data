      "title": "Remove the cap and set the filter aside.",
      "content": "Remove the cap and set the filter aside. Most Brita water bottles have a removable filter, so take this out of the cap and set it aside. Place it on a clean surface so that you don’t contaminate it. It’s not necessary to clean your filter, but you should replace it as directed. [1] X Research source Water bottle filters should be replaced roughly every two months."

      "title": "Fill the bottle with warm water and soap.",
      "content": "Fill the bottle with warm water and soap. Brita water bottles can withstand high temperatures, but be sure not to use water that is nearly boiling. Hot water from the faucet is sufficient. Use a few drops of mild dishwashing detergent, such as Dawn or Palmolive to wash the bottle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shake the bottle for 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Shake the bottle for 30 seconds. Put the cap back on the bottle and shake it for a little bit so that suds form. Shake the bottle right side up for 10 seconds or so and then flip it upside down and shake it for a while longer. This gives the bottle a good initial clean."

    {
      "title": "Remove the cap and wash it.",
      "content": "Remove the cap and wash it. Take the cap off of the bottle and wipe it down with a washcloth and soapy water. Clean the mouthpiece carefully and be sure to wipe all around the inner edges where the cap screws onto the bottle. Rinse the cap thoroughly after you wash it. Set the cap out to dry on a drying rack or clean dish towel. Once the cap is dry, be sure to put the filter back in before you use the bottle."

      "title": "Stick a washcloth or scrubber brush in the bottle to get the sides.",
      "content": "Stick a washcloth or scrubber brush in the bottle to get the sides. Shaking soapy water will get the bottle mostly clean, but a quick scrub finishes the job. As best as you can, swish a washcloth around and get the whole inside. Rinse all of the soap out afterward. Place the bottle upside down to dry, or dry it with paper towels to avoid leaving fibers from a cloth towel."

    {
      "title": "Take the cap off of the bottle.",
      "content": "Take the cap off of the bottle. Before you wash the bottle, always remove the cap. You can wash the cap separately by hand, or place it in the dishwasher with the bottle. If you place the bottle in the dishwasher with the cap on, it will not get clean all the way."

    {
      "title": "Remove the filter and set it aside.",
      "content": "Remove the filter and set it aside. Whether you wash the bottle by hand or in the dishwasher, always remove the filter first. Excessively hot water can damage the filter or release particles from it, which reduces its effectiveness. [2] X Research source Set the filter somewhere clean while you wash the bottle to avoid contaminating it."

    {
      "title": "Place the bottle and cap on the top rack of the dishwasher.",
      "content": "Place the bottle and cap on the top rack of the dishwasher. Brita water bottles are designed to withstand washing in the dishwasher, but it’s important to only wash them on the top rack. The top rack tends to be better for plastic. Place the bottle so the opening faces down."

      "content": "Make sure the dishwasher temperature is set below 50℃(122 ℉). If your dishwasher has a temperature setting, make sure it does not exceed the specified temperature. If there is no temperature setting, check the dishwasher’s manual for temperature specifications. [3] X Research source If you cannot determine your dishwasher’s water temperature, you may want to stick with washing your water bottle by hand to avoid avoid damaging it."

      "title": "Place the bottle upside down to dry.",
      "content": "Place the bottle upside down to dry. If your dishwasher does not dry the bottle enough, set it upside down on a drying rack or on a clean towel and allow it to air dry. If you need to dry the bottle in a hurry, opt for a paper towel or microfiber towel to avoid leaving cloth fibers in the bottle."
