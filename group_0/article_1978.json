      "content": "Find extensions in a similar color and texture to your real hair. Hair extensions should blend in with your natural hair, meaning that they should be the same color, texture, and style as your real hair. However, you can style your extensions to better match your hair. If the extensions are wavy or curly, use a curling iron to curl your natural hair. If the extensions are pin-straight, then use a flat iron to achieve the same sleek appearance. Protect your hair from the potential damage of hot styling tools by applying a dime-sized amount of a heat-protecting product like Argan oil prior to styling."

      "content": "Create a horizontal part around the circumference of your head. Use your finger or a comb to draw a horizontal line from your right temple to your left temple, sectioning off the top part of your hair. Then, secure the top section of hair with a hair tie or hair clip. If your hair is very thin, use a comb to gently tease the lower half of your hair in one-inch sections. This will help keep the extensions securely in place."

      "title": "Open the clips on your extensions and attach them to your hair.",
      "content": "Open the clips on your extensions and attach them to your hair. Align the tops of the hair extensions with the horizontal part you made. Then, gently push down on the top strip of the extensions to snap the clips into place. Some clip-in hair extensions come in one large piece, while others come in multiple smaller pieces. If you are using multiple clip-ons, attach them one by one, making sure that you evenly distribute them along the part in your hair. If your clip-on is one large piece, then start by fastening the upper row of clips near your part, eventually working your way down to the lower clips near the nape of your neck."
