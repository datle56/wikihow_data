      "title": "Let the hat sit.",
      "content": "Let the hat sit. Leave your hat for several hours to allow the powder to soak up dirt and oils efficiently. Be sure to place the hat upside down on its crown rather than on its brim. The brim can lose its shape if left on a flat surface for a long time. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the powder.",
      "content": "Remove the powder. Shake off as much of the absorbent powder as possible. Remove the rest of the powder by using a vacuum cleaner with a detachable hose, or a cordless mini vacuum cleaner. Place a breathable cloth (such as cheesecloth) over the hose or mini vacuum to reduce the suction power and avoid damage to the hat. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Store your hat in a cool place.",
      "content": "Store your hat in a cool place. Keep your hat stored in a cool place to keep it in good shape. Heat can cause the sweatband to shrink, rendering the hat unwearable. The foyer, for example, may be an excellent spot if the heating is moderate in that area. [12] X Research source"
