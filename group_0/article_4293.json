      "content": "Choose the right type of fish. Traditional fish boil recipes use fish local to Wisconsin and Lake Michigan, such as lake trout and whitefish. However, you can use scrod, cod, haddock, or salmon if you don’t have access to local whitefish. For this recipe, you’ll need (4) ½ pound whitefish steaks. If you want to adjust the recipe for a larger group, have approximately a ½ pound to ¾ pound (227 g to 340 g) of fish per person."

      "content": "Find a large cast-iron pot and fire logs for an outdoor boil. If you are planning a traditional outdoor fish boil, you’ll boil the fish in a large pot on an open fire . A cast-iron pot typically works best, and you’ll need logs or slab wood, as well as matches or a lighter, for the fire. If you can’t find a cast-iron pot or kettle for the fish boil, you can use a stainless steel or aluminum pot. It also helps to have a wire basket that you can place the fish in and lower into the pot that you’re using. That makes it easier to remove the fish while it’s finished boiling. Make sure that you have extra logs or slab wood on hand for the fire in case you to feed it during the fish boil. Instead of a log fire, you can use a propane torch to heat the pot for the boil."

Instead, use a large stainless steel or aluminum stock pot with on your stovetop. If your pot has a basket or a strainer insert, you’ll have an easier time removing the fish when they’re done cooking. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a strainer or basket for the pot, use a slotted spoon to remove the fish from the water when they’ve finished boiling."

Next, allow the pot to come to a full, rolling boil. If you’re cooking the fish on an outdoor fire, throw additional logs on the wood to feed the flames if the pot isn’t boiling. If you’re cooking on the stove, the heat should be set at high."

Once the fish flakes easily and is ready to be removed from the pot, take a moment to skim the froth from the surface of the water with a spoon so the fish won’t pass through it when you remove it. Lift the basket from the pot and drain carefully. If you don’t use a wire basket for the fish, remove the individual pieces from the pot with a slotted spoon, shaking carefully to ensure that they’re fully drained."

      "content": "Clean the potatoes and peel the onions. While you can boil fish without any vegetables, a traditional fish boil typically includes potatoes and onions, which are partially boiled before you add the fish. Take 1 ½ pounds (680 g) of medium red potatoes, and scrub them with a nylon brush to ensure that they’re clean. Gather 8 small onions, and peel the skins from them, but leave the stem ends in tact. Scrub the potatoes under cold, running water. If you don’t have a brush, you can scrub them with your hands. The easiest way to peel the onions is to slice a half inch (1.3 cm) off the top and peel back the papery skin from the top. [2] X Research source"

You can warm an oven- or microwave-safe plate in the respective appliance to warm it, or simply run the platter under hot water to warm it up. [4] X Research source"

You should also season the entire platter with plenty of freshly ground black pepper to taste."
