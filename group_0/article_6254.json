      "content": "Capture the three Golems in Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald. The only way to get Regigigas in Platinum is to have the three Golems (Regice, Regirock, and Registeel). These cannot be caught in Platinum without a special event Regigigas, so you'll need to transfer the three Golems from Emerald, Ruby, or Sapphire, where they're much easier to obtain. See Catch the 3 Regis in Pokémon Sapphire or Ruby for instructions on getting the three Golems. There are essentially two scenarios for obtaining the three Golems and Regigigas in Platinum. The common way is to transfer the three Golems from Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald, then capture Regigigas in Platinum. The other way involves using a special event Regigigas in Platinum to obtain the three Golems without Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald. Since the event is over, this is no longer possible without cheating. If you don't have access to Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald, see the next section for cheating instructions. This is the only other way to get all three Golems and Regigigas in Platinum."

Insert your Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald cartridge in the GBA slot of the DS system, then start Platinum and select \"Migrate from Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald.\" Select the six Pokémon you want to transfer, including the three Golems.
