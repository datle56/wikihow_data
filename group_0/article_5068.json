      "content": "Run at a brisk pace. Running, whether on a treadmill or outdoors, or solo or with a partner, is a great way to burn calories. Running at a pace of 6 mi (9.7 km) per hour—or 10 minutes per 1 mi (1.6 km)—can burn 500 calories in roughly 45 minutes. To shorten this time down to 30 minutes, you'll need to run at a pace of 8 mi (13 km) per hour. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Lung Association Nonprofit health organization dedicated to improving lung health through education, advocacy, and research Go to source Running interval sprints can shorten the time even further, down to about 25 minutes. Note that all mentions of calories burned and time required are estimates, and will vary based on many factors, including your body weight and metabolism. Unless otherwise noted, the estimates throughout this article assume a person who weighs between 140–150 lb (64–68 kg)."

      "content": "Jog slowly or walk for at least an hour. If you prefer not to do a full run, you can try jogging at slow, steady pace. Since jogging isn't quite as intense, though, you'll need to do it for about 60 minutes at a speed of 5 mi (8.0 km) per hour to burn 500 calories. [3] X Research source If you choose to walk at a more leisurely 3.5 mi (5.6 km) per hour, you'll burn 500 calories in roughly 90 minutes."

If you move at a faster pace, or go over a more diverse terrain, like hills and rocky paths, the time can be decreased to about 60 minutes or even less. [4] X Research source With so many variables due to terrain and other factors, it's difficult to pin down a specific amount of hiking needed to burn 500 calories. But plan for at least an hour."

If you pick things up to a more moderate pace, you may be able to burn 500 calories in 40-45 minutes. [5] X Research source In this case, a moderate pace equates to swimming 66 laps in a 36.4 yd (33.3 m) pool—which equals roughly 1 mi (1.6 km)—over the course of 40 minutes."

This is true regardless of whether you use a standard bike or a stationary exercise bike. [6] X Research source At a moderate pace—i.e., neither racing speed nor a leisurely cruise around the neighborhood—it will take around 60 minutes to burn 500 calories. However, chugging along in a spinning class can get you to your goal in around 40-45 minutes, and perhaps as little as 25-30."

[9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This might be a good candidate for a mix-and-match approach—for instance, jumping rope for 25 minutes and jogging for 30 minutes throughout the day will burn about 500 calories."

[10] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Water aerobics are less intense due to the buoyancy of the water, so it takes about twice as long to burn 500 calories."

If you choose to play doubles, increase the amount of time to about 90 minutes. Head to the beach and play volleyball for 60 minutes. You can also practice this sport at the gym, but you may need to add another 30 to 45 minutes to achieve the same effect. Try playing racquetball for approximately 55 minutes, or punch a heavy boxing bag for around 60 minutes.
