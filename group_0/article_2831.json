      "content": "You don't have to be perfect to be popular, just be confident. Even if you feel like you have to improve as a person, the first step to gaining confidence is to believe in yourself. Even if you don't feel confident, just acting confident can make you feel good. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Knowing yourself is another important aspect of confidence. According to life coach Leah Morris, you need to know about all the different parts of yourself—not just the parts that you want people to see. [2] X Expert Source Leah Morris Life Coach Expert Interview. 19 June 2020. Affirmations are a great way to boost your confidence. Morris suggests looking in the mirror and saying whatever you need to get pumped up, whether that's \"I'm going to nail this\" or \"You're going to be fine at the end of all this.\" [3] X Expert Source Leah Morris Life Coach Expert Interview. 19 June 2020. Don't hide in the corner. If you spend all of your time worrying about what other people think of you, you’ll be stuck in your head. Instead, work on loving yourself and what you do. If you love yourself, everyone will want to join in. Confidence has a lot to do with body language. Walk with your head high and your arms at your sides instead of crossed over your chest. Don't hunch."

      "content": "Find your own style so you can stand out. You don’t have to buy what everyone else is wearing. Instead, experiment and find your own style to show people that you're comfortable being yourself. Whatever you wear, have confidence in it. Checking yourself out in the mirror or asking everyone in your path if you look okay will show that you doubt yourself. Just find a look that makes you comfortable. Whether you look preppy, hipster chic, or grungy, own it. Don’t buy the trendiest clothes just because everyone else is wearing them. Only buy them if you think you can really look good and comfortable in them. If you're buying popular shoes but they look wrong on your feet, people will notice. It's good to pay attention to your looks, but looking like you're trying too hard to be popular is worse than looking like you don't care. So, if you're not really into something, don't force it just because that's what everyone else is doing. For trendy, affordable clothes, check out Aeropostale, American Eagle, or Forever 21. Try thrifting or Depop , too, as vintage clothes are all the rage right now."

      "content": "Make the first move when it comes to meeting new people and initiating hangouts. To be popular, you're going to need to take a few social risks . This means reaching out to people you want to know better. This may feel uncomfortable to you, but that’s okay. Be prepared to be bold . [4] X Research source Take risks by introducing yourself to someone you haven't met, going to a party you were invited to (even if you don't know many other guests), or by making statements that make you stand out in a crowd. If you get used to taking risks (without putting yourself in danger, of course) you will definitely get noticed more."

      "content": "Don't act like you don't care. If you act like you're too cool for school, people may not want to talk. They may notice you, but they probably won’t approach you. You may not want to be the teacher's pet and answer every question right, but participating in class and making an effort will get you more positive attention than shrugging or being rude. Part of looking like you're ready for whatever life throws at you is to smile more. Smile when people greet you or even be the one to smile first. This way, people want to get to know you. A smile goes a long way, as it activates the part of our brain that’s involved with rewards.

Give them your full focus, maintain eye contact, and chime in when it’s appropriate. Ask how school’s going, how their family’s doing, and what else is new. Then, relate by talking about a similar situation you or someone you know went through. [6] X Research source Stop thinking of ways to impress others. Of all the people skills popular people have, the one they can’t do without is empathy. Don’t worry about how you look, sound, or compare to others. Think about how others are doing instead. Practice active listening by acknowledging the other person with verbal cues and head nods and avoiding distractions like your phone. Clinical therapist Rebecca Tenzer says to “show interest in what others have to say, ask follow-up questions, and be empathetic. Make sure you make eye contact, smile, and then allow time for you to add information about yourself.

If you’re someone who scrolls through social media on the couch all day, you won’t really have much to talk about, and others won’t really be interested in you. Take up a new hobby, listen to new music, and expand your interests so that you have more things to talk about."

Instead, be tolerant and understanding by keeping an open mind. Not everyone has the same beliefs as you, so try to see where they’re coming from so you can still build a friendship. Practice tolerance by finding the fun in a given situation, lightening the mood, and giving others grace when they aren’t immediately up for something.

To make friends with others, practice being friendly . Start a conversation or say hi to them in the hall to show them that you’re friendly; it’ll make a difference. [12] X Research source The key to being kind is to do it when nobody else is looking. Strive to be a person who cares about others, strikes up conversations, and helps people out when they need it.

Not only does small talk enhance your health and happiness, but it can also give you a sense of belonging by introducing you to new people and expanding your world views. Even just a quick chat is enough to get you in someone’s good graces; just keep it casual. [13] X Research source Small talk is all about sticking to safe topics. Stay away from anything controversial, like religion or politics. If you don't, people who disagree may not take kindly to them. Ask thought-provoking questions and give authentic compliments. Practice different charismatic games, like introducing yourself to someone within 60 seconds of walking into an establishment, or going up to random people and giving them a genuine compliment."

Learn to read body language so you can see when others are uncomfortable. If a person is backing away from you, checking their phone every five minutes, or talking quietly to another friend before you approach, it may not be the best time to talk. Don't invite yourself anywhere, don't stalk, don't brag, and don't interrupt. If you do, you may come across as annoying ."

      "content": "Be willing to help others out of the kindness of your heart. Popular people don't just know everyone—they're on good terms with everyone. This is because they help people out , and they don't do it in particularly noticeable ways. They do little things, like offering someone a pencil when they need it, holding the door open for others, and listening to people when they talk . If you truly empathize with people, you'll want things to work out for them. If there's nothing you can do to help, then, at the very least, let them know that you're hoping for the best for them. Take up volunteering if you’re looking for a bigger way to help others."

You may think you need to be attractive & talented to be popular—and while that will make you a hit with people, it’s best to be yourself . By going against your values for popularity, you’ll meet people who don’t align with you. By staying true to your values and beliefs, you’ll attract similar people and become popular among them. [14] X Research source Remember, the only thing you need in order to be popular is a good set of people skills. The remainder is all yours to mold as you see fit, regardless of what others think. Part of being yourself is knowing yourself well enough to laugh at yourself. Show people that you recognize your quirks and don’t take yourself too seriously, and they’ll be impressed. According to Tenzer, “Authenticity is key to forming lasting friendships. Be true to yourself and let your genuine personality shine. People are more likely to connect with you when you’re authentic.” [15] X Expert Source Rebecca Tenzer, MAT, MA, LCSW, CCTP, CGCS, CCATP, CCFP Clinical Therapist & Adjunct Professor Expert Interview.

If you're desperate to be popular, it’ll show in your actions, and people may think you're a poser .

This is helpful for building meaningful friendships based on truth, which can help boost your reputation and make you popular. [16] X Research source Don’t confuse being real with being a jerk.

On top of that, you’ll stand out amongst your peers, learn new skills, and begin to build new friendships. If you’re into debates, join the debate club. If you’re dramatic and have always wanted to act, join theatre. If you’re passionate about animals and want to help the ones in your community, volunteer at the animal shelter.

      "content": "Put yourself out there by talking to new people. This usually means being willing to step out of your comfort zone. If you're not popular, it may be because you're not comfortable doing the things that popular people tend to do, such as: Making conversation , cracking jokes , flirting , and really engaging with people. Remember that popular kids are only popular because they are known by (and get the attention of) others. Remember, if it isn't yet working out, don't wait for someone to come talk to you, you might as well talk to others you never did before. You may be introspective, shy, or quiet, but in order to get what you want, you need to change how you interact with people. At first, that might feel like you're being shallow or fake, but remember that being yourself is, at its core, all about knowing what you truly want out of life."

You may not meet the same kind of people at the school newspaper that you'd meet on your soccer team, so it's a great idea to join a club you’re interested in. Find something you're curious about and try it out to build popularity and meet people like you. Try to put yourself in a leadership role in the club once you've gained enough experience, that way you're more comfortable being a leader and know more people. Don't worry about a club being \"too nerdy\" for you. Doing something that you love and meeting more people will help make you more popular.

If you're even a little athletic, try out for one of your school's sports teams or join a casual sports league in your neighborhood. Joining a team will expose you to more people and will help you learn how to get along with a variety of people that you might not otherwise encounter in your classes or daily life. Joining a team will also improve your social life. You'll be more likely to make plans for what to do after the game, or to go to pre-game dinners and other activities with your team.

If you’re in college, the same is true for people you party with. While it’s true that you’ll meet a lot of people because of this, you won’t necessarily cultivate deep friendships. Instead of casually being friends with people because you’re around them so much, focus on making friends with people in your study groups, after-school clubs, and other extracurriculars. You’re more likely to have level-headed conversations about your interests with people you study with rather than people you party with."
