      "content": "Kill parasites with mothballs before bringing feathers inside. If you picked up your feathers outside, they may be carrying parasites. Place a handful of mothballs in a zip-lock baggie or Tupperware container. Add your feathers and seal the container. Keep the container outside and give the mothballs at least 24 hours to kill any possible parasites on the feathers. [1] X Research source To be effective, make sure you use mothballs that list paradichlorobenzene as an ingredient."

      "content": "Use rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide to kill bacteria. Bird feathers may be carrying bacteria and viruses. Once you’ve taken care of possible mites, the feathers need to be sanitized to kill bacteria. Create a mixture that is half rubbing alcohol and half hydrogen peroxide. Soak the feathers in this solution for at least half an hour. [2] X Research source The higher the concentration of peroxide and alcohol, the better."

      "title": "Use boiling water to sanitize quills.",
      "content": "Use boiling water to sanitize quills. If the quills look dirty or have a foreign substance on them, they should be sanitized. Bring a shallow pot of water to a boil on your stove. Place the quills into the water. Hold them there for a few minutes, which will kill any germs present. Lay them out flat on paper towels to dry. If boiling loosened up any unidentifiable gunk on the quills, wipe them gently with a soft cloth to remove it."

      "content": "Create a cleaning solution with warm water and mild soap. [3] X Research source Fill a bucket, tub or sink with warm water. Squeeze a small amount of mild dish detergent (like Dawn) or mild laundry detergent (like Woolite) into the bucket. Use your hand or a spoon to agitate the water and mix the ingredients together."

      "content": "Rinse the feathers in clean water. Fill a new bucket with clean water. Take the feathers out of the cleaning solution, one at a time, and swish them gently through the clean water to rinse away the soap residue. If you’re rinsing a lot of feathers, you may need to dump the bucket and refill it with fresh water once or twice. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a blow dryer on the low setting to dry the feathers. Once rinsed, place the clean feathers out flat on paper towels. Set a regular hair dryer to its lowest setting. Pick up one or two of the feathers at a time. Hold them by the quills and gently blow air on them until they are completely dry. [6] X Research source Don’t hold the feather right up to the blow dryer’s stream. Hold them a few inches back so you won’t warp their natural shape."
