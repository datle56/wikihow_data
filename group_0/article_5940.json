      "title": "Buy a rabbit cage or hutch.",
      "content": "Buy a rabbit cage or hutch. Mini lops are small creatures, but they like to have plenty of space to hop around. Look for a large rabbit playpen or consider free roaming your rabbit. The minimum dimensions of your enclosure should be 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) wide, 2 feet (0.6 m) deep and about 3 feet (0.9 m) high. The sides should be made of wire, not glass, because the bunny will need plenty of fresh air to flow through the cage. Make sure not to use a wire bottom cage as the rabbits are at high risk of sores on their feet. [1] X Research source If you decide to go with an outdoor hutch, place it in a shady spot so that the rabbit doesn't overheat during the summer. You might need to heat the hutch during winter if the temperature drops low. It's also important to keep potential predators away. Foxes, dogs, cats, and birds of prey are all quite dangerous to a rabbit."

      "title": "Place a litter box in the cage.",
      "content": "Place a litter box in the cage. If you place a large litter box in the mini lop's cage, he will relieve himself in that same spot instead of going elsewhere, making cleanup much easier. However, some rabbits may need to be trained. You can find a cat litter box at pet stores. Line the litter box with newspaper or a puppy pad. then place a small amount of litter on top. fill the litter box to the brim with hay as this is the main part of a rabbits diet and they like to eat whilst they go to the bathroom."

Many owners of mini lops like to take their rabbits out to play. make sure you rabbits space has been thoroughly \"rabbit-proofed\" so that the mini lop won't get hurt.

      "content": "Provide unlimited hay. Rabbits both nest in and eat loads of hay, so you should put lots of fresh hay in the cage every day. Timothy hay and brome hay are good choices for rabbit feed. There's no need to set the hay in a dish; just sprinkle it all around the cage. if your rabbit is below 6 months feed alfalfa hay.

      "content": "Set out a dish of vegetables and add a small amount of pellets depending on the weight of your rabbit.. Rabbit pellets contain essential nutrients like protein and fiber. When your mini lop is still a baby, give it more pellets. Adult mini lops can get 1/8 cup of pellets for every 5 pounds of body weight. Throughout the rabbit's life, provide fresh vegetables to enhance its diet. 2 cups a day of spinach, collard greens, and turnip greens are the best choice, but you can also feed your rabbit the occasional carrot. You can also feed your rabbit a small amount of fruit, such as cut-up apples, bananas, and strawberries. Do not feed your rabbit the following vegetables, which can hurt its stomach: corn, tomatoes, cabbage, iceberg lettuce, potatoes, peas, onions, beets, and rhubarb. Never feed your rabbit the following foods: seeds, grains, meat, chocolate, dairy, and any other \"human\" food/treats."

      "title": "Pick up the mini lop gently.",
      "content": "Pick up the mini lop gently. When you're handling a rabbit, the first rule to remember is that you should never pick one up by the ears or scruff. A rabbit's ears are fragile and sensitive, and this could cause permanent damage. Instead, place one hand under his rear area and the other between his front legs. Bring the rabbit close to your chest and hold him there securely. When you're ready to put him down, crouch down and gently rest him on the floor.only do this. when necessary as rabbits are animals of pray and most don't enjoy being picked up. Do not drop your rabbit or let him jump to the floor from your arms. The impact could hurt his legs. Do not lift your rabbit from the scruff of his neck. Rabbits don't have extra skin there as cats do."

      "content": "Pet your mini lop carefully. Mini lops are pretty sturdy as far as rabbits go, but they don't like being handled roughly. Pat your mini lop gently on the head and cheeks. if your rabbit is timid approach it from the side where they can see. Never toss him, push him or pull him by the legs, ears or tail. If your bunny is afraid, don't force him to play."

      "title": "Give your mini lop plenty of exercise.",
      "content": "Give your mini lop plenty of exercise. Rabbits naturally love to hop around, and they need to be able to do so for a few hours every day to stay healthy. Take your bunny out of his cage and play with him every day. If you have an enclosed outdoor area, you can let the bunny play by himself, but don't let him out of your sight for too long. It is extremely dangerous to walk a rabbit on a lead! If a rabbit is scared, the lead can get wrapped around their neck. Rabbits can be scared to death as well. A lead is uncomfortable, scary and dangerous for your rabbit! Never let your bunny play outside the cage completely unattended. Keep cats, dogs, and other predators away."

      "content": "Offer enriching toys. Don't let your bunny get bored in his cage. He needs interesting items to explore and chew on. Put a few cardboard boxes or old phone books in the cage for him to chew on. You can also play with your bunny using a soft cat toy or ball."

      "content": "Consider getting two. Bunnies love to play together, and your mini lop will be happier with a friend. Be sure to get a second mini lop, and not another type of rabbit. And make sure both bunnies are spayed or neutered so you don't end up with a litter of babies on your hands."

      "content": "Keep the cage clean. A rabbit's cage or hutch should be cleaned out every week. Have a friend supervise your bunny or put it in a pen or carrier while you give the cage a thorough cleaning. Throw out the old hay and newspaper, wash the cage with hot, soapy water, dry it, and fill it with clean hay and newspaper. Clean out the pellet dish and water bottle every few days. Change the litter box every day."

      "content": "Groom your mini lop. Bunnies don't like to be bathed since they take care of that themselves. However, they do well with a light brushing. Use a soft-bristled brush to take care of your bunny's fur every once in a while. Mini lops molt when they're adults, and when you see this happening, you can help remove the fur using a wire brush. If your rabbit gets dirty outside, you can wash him using rabbit shampoo. Never use human shampoo on a rabbit. If you notice your rabbit's nails getting too long, you may need to trim them."
