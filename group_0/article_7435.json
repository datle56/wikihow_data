Restaurant supply stores will also have them in stock. Cooling racks are also sold online in kitchen goods storefronts and on auction sites."

      "content": "Choose the wire cooling rack according to size. What you're baking determines the size of rack. While cookies can be easily fitted onto a small rack, a cake or bread will need a rack that fits its size. It's a good idea to get a few, perhaps one square or round one and one rectangular one, so that you have both enough and the right size for the particular baked item. If you want the cooling rack to sit in a pan, be sure to take the measurements before purchasing the rack. Another consideration for size is whether it will fit in the dishwasher and/or where you want to store it. These store easily alongside cookie and baking sheets, as well as pizza pans, so if you already have these, estimate the size against them."

      "content": "Choose a material for your wire cooling rack. Most wire cooling racks are made of metal, but there are also wooden and chrome-plated racks. Available non-stick varieties are helpful for your baked items, but not essential; you can always use parchment paper (also known as baking paper) for any particularly sticky baked foods. If you plan on using the wire cooling rack for draining washed food, choose one that won't rust."

      "content": "Check the quality of the wire cooling rack. As with any purchase of kitchen essentials, be sure to check the quality. Look for neat joints throughout the cooling rack, and check to ensure that there are no sharp or loose parts and no warping."
