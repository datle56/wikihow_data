      "title": "Set out 3 different bowls to hold the eggs.",
      "content": "Set out 3 different bowls to hold the eggs. Using 3 different bowls can help you keep the egg whites separate from the yolks. Choose a glass or metal bowl to collect the egg whites. Then, select a deep glass or metal mixing bowl to beat the egg whites in. Also, select a third container to hold the yolks. If any yolk gets in with the egg whites, it can ruin them and you will have to start over. Avoid using plastic to store egg whites. Plastic holds onto oil, so even clean plastic can ruin your egg whites."

      "title": "Crack the first egg against a countertop.",
      "content": "Crack the first egg against a countertop. Tap the first egg on the countertop, but don't pour the egg into a bowl. Hold the egg upright so the whites and yolk stay in the shell. Gently pull the shell halves apart. [1] X Research source You can also crack the egg by tapping it against the rim of 1 of the bowls."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pass",
      "content": "Pass the yolk between the shell halves. Hold the shell halves over a glass or metal bowl you chose earlier. There are several ways to separate the egg, but the easiest way is to shift the yolk back and forth. Do this several times until most of the egg white has dripped into the bowl. Make sure the yolk isn't mixed in with the egg whites. If the yolk has broken, dump the egg into the trash (or use it for something else) and wash out the bowl. Carefully pick out any shell fragments that fall into the bowl."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour the yolk into your third bowl.",
      "content": "Pour the yolk into your third bowl. Store all of the yolks together in the third container you chose earlier. It can be made from plastic or any other material. The yolks can be used to make pastries, pasta, mayonnaise, sauces, and to bind meat together. [2] X Research source Check the yolk for shell fragments if you plan on cooking them. You can store the yolks in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Pour a little water into the container to prevent them from drying out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Transfer the egg white to your mixing bowl.",
      "content": "Transfer the egg white to your mixing bowl. Before moving the egg white, check it over for yolk. A little bit of yolk can ruin an entire batch of egg whites. Pour the egg white out of the glass or metal holding bowl. Then, repeat the process from the beginning with your remaining eggs. [3] X Research source Keeping the egg white in a separate holding bowl prevents the mixing bowl's contents from being tainted if a yolk breaks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Warm the eggs to room temperature for 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Warm the eggs to room temperature for 30 minutes. The egg whites get runnier when they reach room temperature, making them easier to beat. You may also notice that you get a greater volume of egg whites when you let the eggs warm up. If you use an egg separator, you can let the eggs warm up before cracking them. This makes the whites easier to separate, and you can then beat them right away."

    {
      "title": "Hold a metal whisk in your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Hold a metal whisk in your dominant hand. Use only a metal balloon or wire whisk, since plastic whisks can retain oils that ruin the egg whites. An overhand grip works best. Hold the whisk between your thumb and your forefinger, wrapping the rest of your hand around the handle. Use your other hand to hold the bowl steady. [4] X Research source You can also use an electric mixer or stand mixer. These devices can perfectly beat egg whites without you having to tire out your arm."

    {
      "title": "Whisk the eggs at a slow pace.",
      "content": "Whisk the eggs at a slow pace. Lower your whisk into the egg whites. Begin to move your wrist up and down in a circular motion. A slow pace means the whisk makes less than 4 circuits per second in the bowl. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Whisk for 30 seconds until the egg whites show foamy bubbles.",
      "content": "Whisk for 30 seconds until the egg whites show foamy bubbles. Count the time as you whisk, then check egg whites' consistency. If they are finished, they will have turned into a foam. The foam will be mostly liquid, but it will be a bright white color and have lots of air bubbles. [6] X Research source You can lift the whisk out of the bowl to get a closer look at the foam. If your recipe calls for stiffer egg whites with peaks, continue whipping the egg whites at a higher speed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Beat the egg whites until they are foamy.",
      "content": "Beat the egg whites until they are foamy. Before you can make the egg whites into peaks, you have to get to the foamy stage. Beat the egg whites for 30 seconds at a slow pace. Check them briefly for the foamy bubbles before continuing. The amount of time you need to beat the eggs to reach each stage can vary slightly each time you do this."

    {
      "title": "Add cream of tartar to stabilize the egg whites.",
      "content": "Add cream of tartar to stabilize the egg whites. Sprinkle in a little bit of the acidic substance in while the egg whites are still a little runny. Plan on adding about 1 ‚ÅÑ 8 tsp (0.62 mL) per egg in your bowl. You can buy cream of tartar at most grocery stores. If you can't find it, you can also use an equivalent amount of lemon juice or vinegar. Salt is now considered a destabilizer, so use an alternative instead."

    {
      "title": "Beat the eggs at a medium pace for about 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Beat the eggs at a medium pace for about 5 minutes. After the egg whites become foamy, you need to pick up the pace. Move the whisk fast enough for it to circle the bowl about 4 times in a second. As you whisk, the egg whites will turn white and expand in volume. [7] X Research source You can switch hands if your arm gets tired, but keep up a consistent rhythm as much as possible so the egg whites don't lose air."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the egg whites for soft peaks forming on the whisk.",
      "content": "Check the egg whites for soft peaks forming on the whisk. Lift the whisk, pulling some of the egg whites out of the bowl. Look for pointed mounds to appear on the whisk then curl over while you hold the whisk upside down. If your recipe calls for soft peaks, you can stop whisking now. If the egg whites do not form peaks, continue beating them until they do. Soft peak egg whites can be used to make food like light, fluffy pancakes or waffles."

      "title": "Add sugar gradually if your recipe calls for it.",
      "content": "Add sugar gradually if your recipe calls for it. Dessert recipes such as meringues will instruct you to add sugar. Add about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of sugar at a time. Pour the sugar down the side of the bowl while continuing to beat the eggs. [8] X Research source If you add the sugar while the eggs are foamy, your egg whites can lose volume and take longer to whip. Pouring the sugar into the center of the bowl can also destabilize the egg whites."

    {
      "title": "Beat the eggs whites into stiff peaks for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Beat the eggs whites into stiff peaks for 5 minutes. Your arm may already ache, but continue beating the egg whites at a steady, medium pace. The whites should be bright white and solid when you're finished. Lift the whisk to check for pointed mounds that don't fall over. When the egg whites are fully beaten, you can tip the bowl without them sliding out. If you beat the eggs too much, they will begin to look dry and a dull gray color. They thin and leak liquid. Stiff peak egg whites are often incorporated into desserts, including meringues and cake batter."
