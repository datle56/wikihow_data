Listen to the forms of address people around you use if you're unsure â€“ particularly staff in the mayor's office. Other countries may follow different formalities. When in doubt, listen to others around you or ask a member of the mayor's staff how you should properly address the mayor. For example, in Canada you could also refer to the mayor as \"Your Worship,\" although this is considered more formal (similar to \"Your Honor\" in the US). [10] X Research source"
