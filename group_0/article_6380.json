[12] X Research source Mix 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 ounce (14 g) of native wildflower seeds with 3.5 ounces (99 g) of potting soil. Add in 1.5 ounces (43 g) of dry clay, such as red powdered pottery clay. Mix the ingredients together. Slowly add in water until you have a thick paste. Roll the paste into balls, and let it dry on a cookie sheet covered in wax paper.
