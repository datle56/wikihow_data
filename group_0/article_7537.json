If you are using a parenthetical citation only, use the first 1-2 words of the title.

      "title": "Treat an organization as the author if they published the website.",
      "content": "Treat an organization as the author if they published the website. You can find reliable information from groups and organizations, but they don't always list an author. If this is the case, you can cite the organization as the author since they published the information. [2] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For example, you might pull information from the American Cancer Society's website. If no author is listed, you can use the organization instead. Your in-text citations could look like this: \"According to the American Cancer Society (2018), people undergoing chemotherapy benefit from having complimentary head wraps or wigs available.\" \"People who are undergoing chemotherapy treatments have a better experience if complimentary head wraps and wigs are provided to them (American Cancer Society, 2018).\""

      "title": "Include “Anonymous” as an author if it's on the website.",
      "content": "Include “Anonymous” as an author if it's on the website. You might come across a website page that lists an anonymous author. If this is the case, you can use “Anonymous” as the author in your citation. [3] X Research source For an anonymous author, your citation will look like this: \"(Anonymous, 2018)\""

      "title": "Use \"n.d.\"",
      "content": "Use \"n.d.\" for no date in your citations. APA citations usually include the author and date. However, you can't include a date if one isn't there! Using \"n.d.\" tells the reader that no date is provided on the site. [4] X Research source A citation using a title for an author looks like this: \"(“Robotics,” n.d.)\" If you're using an organization name, your citation looks like this: \"(National Robotics Society, n.d.)\" For an anonymous author, your citation would look like this: \"(Anonymous, n.d.)\""

      "title": "Include the paragraph to cite a specific passage if there's no page.",
      "content": "Include the paragraph to cite a specific passage if there's no page. APA formatting only requires a page number when you need to cite specific words or a close paraphrase or summary of a particular section. When a website doesn't have page numbers, you can use the paragraph number instead. Count the paragraphs to figure out which paragraph you are citing. Then, write \"para.\" for \"paragraph\" and the number of the paragraph. [5] X Research source For example, let's say you're citing the 4th paragraph of an article called, “Building a Healthy Relationship,” which has no author, page number, or date. You could cite it like this: \"According to “Building a Healthy Relationship\" (n.d., para. 4), communication is essential for a healthy partnership.\" \"Partners must communicate if they want to have a healthy relationship (“Building,” n.d., para. 4).\""

      "title": "Use 1-2 words of the section heading as the page number if available.",
      "content": "Use 1-2 words of the section heading as the page number if available. Section headings or subheadings are a great way to tell readers where to find the information you're citing. You can use these headings instead of the paragraph number if there are no page numbers. If the page you're on has marked headings, use those in place of a page number to cite a specific area where you found the information you're citing. [6] X Research source You may have found valuable information on a web page titled “Reducing Congestion in Large Cities,” which has section headings titled “Improving Transit Networks,” “Increasing Highway Capacity,” “Collecting Tolls,” “HOV Lanes,” and “Metered Ramps.” However, there's no date or page number. Your citation might look like this: \"(“Reducing,” n.d., “HOV”)\""

Don't put quotation marks around the title. Put a period after the title.
