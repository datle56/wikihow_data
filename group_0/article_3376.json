      "content": "To beat Brock, follow this step. Your Pokémon should be level 9 or more. This is a good chance to level up a weakling or two. Use Metal Claw if you have Charmander, Bubble or Water Gun if you have Squirtle, or Vine Whip if you have Bulbasaur."

      "content": "Use a Diglett against Lt. Surge. You can find a Diglett in the nearby Diglett's Cave. You can even use Dugtrio! Also, your Pokémon should be in the late 20s."

      "content": "To get Erika beaten, use this strategy. If you picked Charmander, than you've got nothing to worry about! If you chose Squirtle or Bulbasaur you can use a Pidgey or Pidgeotto, or use a Spearow or Fearow. Otherwise use a Fire-type (Vulpix, Flareon, Growlithe, Arcanine, Ninetales)."

      "title": "To beat Koga, use a Psychic or Ground-type.",
      "content": "To beat Koga, use a Psychic or Ground-type. Either that or a very powerful Pokémon. If you're using a Ground-type, be aware that Koffing and Weezing have the Levitate ability, preventing you from using Ground-type moves against them."

    {
      "title": "To beat Sabrina up, use a Ghost-type (Haunter or Gengar).",
      "content": "To beat Sabrina up, use a Ghost-type (Haunter or Gengar). Or you could evolve Weedle up into Beedrill, who knows Pin Missile (Jolteon also learns this move). If this fails, use a Pokémon with a strong physical move. Kadabra and Alakazam may have a high special attack and speed stat, but they don't fare well against physical attacks due to their low defense stat. Pokémon such as Fearow and Snorlax are good physical attackers."
