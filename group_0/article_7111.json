      "content": "Enter your holder’s number in the NS&I prize checker tool . All of your premium bonds are grouped together under a single holder’s number, which is printed on your bond. That holder’s number is basically your ID for the NS&I. Hop in the checker tool and enter the 10-, 9-, or 8-digit holder number to pull up the value of the bond. [1] X Research source This will also tell you if you’ve got any unclaimed prizes! Premium bond winnings never expire, so even you won back in the 1950s, the money is still good."

      "content": "Write a letter to NS&I, Sunderland SR43 2SB if you lost the bonds. Yes, we know it’s ridiculous you can’t do this online or over the phone. Write a short letter explaining that you bought bonds but either don’t know your holder’s number or don’t physically have the bonds. The NS&I will pull their records and provide you with the info you need. [2] X Research source Include your name, address, and date of birth in the letter. If you bought the bonds at an old address or you went by a different name, include that info, too. For security reasons, the NS&I will not write back if you don’t sign your letter. Even if you printed the letter out, sign it at the bottom to ensure they respond. Provide as much detail as possible. If you know approximately when or where you bought the bonds, it can help narrow it down. Do not use any old Glasgow or Blackpool addresses you’ve come across. The NS&I shuttered those offices years ago."
