    {
      "title": "Make a list of your strong and weak academic subjects.",
      "content": "Make a list of your strong and weak academic subjects. To be a Renaissance person, you should have a little bit of knowledge about pretty much every academic subject. This includes math, world history, science (physics, biology, and chemistry), reading, and writing. Figure out which spots you’re already strong in, and then focus on building up the other ones."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill any gaps in your knowledge.",
      "content": "Fill any gaps in your knowledge. Find some introductory textbooks for those subjects where you need some help. Check your library or go to the bookstore and see what they’ve got in stock. You can also order books online. [1] X Research source Public schools in your area might also have textbooks they’d be willing to lend you over the summer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Read several newspapers to stay aware of current events.",
      "content": "Read several newspapers to stay aware of current events. Renaissance people don’t just bury themselves in old textbooks, they’re aware of what’s going on in the world around them! Read lots of well-respected newspapers to keep aware of new and important developments happening around the world. [2] X Research source Reading newspapers is also a great way to stay informed of new discoveries in science, history, and math. For English-speaking newspapers in the United States, try the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal . Look at the Guardian for a paper based in the United Kingdom. If it’s in your budget to subscribe to a daily paper, do so. If not, you can usually read several articles from popular newspapers based in the United States and elsewhere for free each month."

    {
      "title": "Look up lists of new and old books you should read.",
      "content": "Look up lists of new and old books you should read. Reading teaches you new words and makes you think about the world in new and different ways. Don’t just stick to the classics, however. Go online to find suggestions of great books written both recently and a long (sometimes long, long) time ago. [3] X Research source Goodreads.com and Amazon both provide suggestion lists of books that you should read before you die. The New York Times Book Review also releases yearly “best book” picks that can keep you updated on the good new releases."

    {
      "title": "Get familiar with opposing points of view.",
      "content": "Get familiar with opposing points of view. Renaissance people are well rounded and can think about issues from lots of different sides. If there’s a hot-button debate going on in your town, state, or country, take the time to read up on both sides. Wait until you have as much information as possible before deciding on your own position. [4] X Research source This might require you to read sources produced by different news outlets, politicians, or experts. For example, to get a good picture of the debate about climate change, you can look at what different politicians around the world are saying and doing about the issue. Be sure to look at people from different parties. Run a Google search to find easy-to-read scientific studies. Finally, check out coverage from news outlets with different political leanings (such as Fox News and MSNBC in the U.S.)."

      "title": "Study a map of the world to think globally.",
      "content": "Study a map of the world to think globally. If the only country you can point out on a map is your own, spend some time learning world geography. This knowledge will help you better understand global history, as well as current political conflicts and environmental concerns. [5] X Research source It’s also a good idea to know the capitals and major cities of countries around the world."
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn a new language.",
      "content": "Learn a new language. Learn to communicate with people outside the country where you were born. Renaissance people are travelers and explorers (even if they can’t afford to actually visit other countries). [6] X Research source If you speak another language, read a newspaper or listen to the news in that language! It’s a great way to build your skill and expose yourself to another perspective."

      "title": "Commit to an exercise plan.",
      "content": "Commit to an exercise plan. Renaissance people spend time balancing the needs of their mind with those of their body. Stay healthy by exercising regularly. If you’ve never exercised before, now’s a great time to start! [7] X Research source Try to exercise for at least 20-30 minutes each day. Make this workout hard enough to get your heart pumping. Jogging is great exercise. Try going for a 20-minute jog three-four times per week, and taking a walk or hike on your off days. You may want to join a gym. This membership gives you access to lots of classes, weight rooms, and machines that could motivate you to really commit to your plan."

      "title": "Have a healthy, balanced diet.",
      "content": "Have a healthy, balanced diet. It’s not enough to exercise. If you want to keep up good health, it’s important to eat right. Use your diet to get all the essential nutrients you need, and try to limit the good-tasting (but not-so-good-for-you) sweets. [8] X Research source Stick with lean meats such as chicken and fish. Go heavy on the fruits and veggies, and make sure you’re also eating food from each food group. Make your own meals instead of eating out. This will help you control exactly what you’re eating. Try simple recipes like baked chicken and spinach salad."

      "title": "Drink plenty of water.",
      "content": "Drink plenty of water. Drinking lots of water helps your body function better. It’ll keep you focused during the day. If you’re drinking water, you’re also probably avoiding unhealthy liquids like soda and sugar-filled energy drinks. [9] X Research source Drink enough water so that you’re never thirsty, or about 8 glasses of water per day.

      "title": "Sleep for at least 8 hours each night.",
      "content": "Sleep for at least 8 hours each night. Sleep keeps stress under control, and it’s critical for good health. If you don’t get enough sleep, you’re going to feel too tired to work out. You also won’t want to go grocery shopping or cook for yourself, which could lead to a few not-so-healthy meals. [11] X Research source To get better sleep, avoid nicotine, caffeine, and heavy foods for the last few hours before you head to bed. You should also limit your daytime naps to about 20 or 30 minutes. Try to stick to the same sleep schedule each night. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Take stock of any creative abilities you have.",
      "content": "Take stock of any creative abilities you have. If you’ve ever played an instrument or shown some talent for drawing, revisit those skills. Maybe you never stopped. Renaissance people spend time working on their creative sides, so get ready to develop any existing talent you’ve got."

      "title": "Practice frequently if you’ve already got artistic skills.",
      "content": "Practice frequently if you’ve already got artistic skills. The only way to be good at music or art is to spend lots of time practicing. Look for free time in your schedule and fill those spots with practice sessions. You may be able to take 20 minutes during your lunch hour to practice. You can also practice after you’ve eaten dinner at night during the weekdays. Add a longer practice session on your off days. Try to practice at least 4-5 days per week, for about 20 minutes to an hour each day. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn new artistic skills.",
      "content": "Learn new artistic skills. If you’ve never sang a note or picked up a paintbrush, don’t despair! It’s never too late to start. Figure out what artistic skill (or skills!) most appeals to you and start learning. [14] X Research source Gardening, cooking, writing, baking, photography, website design… the list of things that qualify as art goes on and on. Find your passion and have fun with it. Take an art or music class in school if you’re a student. If not (and it fits into your budget), sign up for one at a local community college. You can also find guided tutorials online or at bookstores for learning artistic crafts or musical instruments. If you’re hoping to get into music, look for a community choir or band that accepts beginners. This is a great way to meet people and develop your creativity."

      "title": "Go to museums, cultural centers, and shows.",
      "content": "Go to museums, cultural centers, and shows. Get inspired by what past artists have produced. Attend concerts and art shows to see what’s being put other there now by fellow artists. These events will teach you new things about the people and world around you. [15] X Research source Observing other artists can also help you decide on your own style. You may start out by imitating something you like, and then you’ll slowly start to create your own special artwork. Craft shows and local fairs are also great events for experiencing art and culture. These may even let you see the folksy side of art that you can’t get in all museums."

    {
      "title": "Read for at least 20 minutes a day.",
      "content": "Read for at least 20 minutes a day. If you’ve decided to be a Renaissance person, you’ve got a long reading list ahead of you. You don’t have to read everything in a day. Start small, and spend 20 minutes reading something different each day. [16] X Research source You can alternate days to get through the various textbooks, novels, newspapers, etc. that you’re reading. If you have time and you want to, read for longer! The more hours you dedicate to becoming a Renaissance person, the farther along you’ll get on your quest."

    {
      "title": "Schedule a few hours on your off day for exercise.",
      "content": "Schedule a few hours on your off day for exercise. Since you won’t necessarily have time to work out on days when you have a full school or workday, take advantage of down time. Plan to do your more intense workouts on those days. [17] X Research source Even on busy days, 10-15 minutes of exercise is better than zero minutes."

      "content": "Listen to podcasts or audiobooks when you’re on the move. Travel time can be used for learning, too! Turn your commute into a classroom by picking audio content that interests you. This’ll help you start and end your workday on the right foot. [18] X Research source Try NPR’s Politics Podcast for an in-depth review of the American political scene. The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe is a fun way to learn about science, and it promotes critical thinking. The Moth is also an interesting option for those interested in literature and storytelling.

      "content": "Make art instead of vegging out in front of the TV. Since your artwork may feel like a hobby or something you do for fun, it could be harder to find time for this than for exercise or reading. Use the time you’d usually spend relaxing in front a mindless show or movie to relax productively."

      "content": "Use your off-days to explore and see new things. Renaissance people are curious and always looking for new ways to learn. Get out there and explore. When a new museum or restaurant opens up in your town, be the first through the doors. [20] X Research source"
