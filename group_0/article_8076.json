      "title": "Wet the inside of your cup with cold water, then pour out the excess.",
      "content": "Wet the inside of your cup with cold water, then pour out the excess. Hold your teacup under cold or cool running water from your tap. Gently swish the water around until the sides of the cup are wet all the way around, then tip the cup over your sink to pour out any extra water. [1] X Research source Don’t use hot water to rinse out your cup. If the water is too warm, it might dissolve the baking soda, so it won’t scrub away the stain as effectively."

      "title": "Sprinkle about 1/4 cup (45 g) of baking soda into the cup.",
      "content": "Sprinkle about 1/4 cup (45 g) of baking soda into the cup. Add the baking soda while the inside of your cup is still wet. You can measure the baking soda if you’d like, but you can also just estimate the amount you want to use. If you pour in too much, just shake out a little into a dish and discard it. If you don’t have enough, sprinkle in a little more. Baking soda is a natural cleaner, and it will help absorb the stains from the inside of the cup. For extra cleaning power, mix a little baking soda with a few drops of hydrogen peroxide to create a creamy paste. Then, spread the paste inside of the cup and let it sit for 30 minutes.

      "title": "Turn the cup sideways and rotate it to spread the baking soda evenly.",
      "content": "Turn the cup sideways and rotate it to spread the baking soda evenly. Once you’ve turned the mug onto its side, gently shake it so the baking soda is covering the inside of the cup from the bottom to the top rim (or at least to the line where your stain starts). Then, roll the cup toward you, shaking it so the baking soda falls forward as you do so. Do this until the entire inside of the cup is covered in the baking soda. [3] X Research source The baking soda should stick to the water on the inside of the cup, forming a thin layer over the stains."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the baking soda sit in place for about 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the baking soda sit in place for about 30 minutes. Place your teacup somewhere that it won’t be disturbed and let the baking soda dry on the inside of the cup for about half an hour. It’s okay if some of it falls off of the sides, but if you notice that most of the baking soda is falling off, you may have had too much water on the inside of your cup, and you may need to start the process over. [4] X Research source If you’re in a hurry, you can rinse your teacup after 5 minutes. You may not remove the stain completely, but it should be noticeably lighter, and you can repeat the process after your next cup of tea if you’d like."

      "title": "Use a soft cloth or sponge to scrub the baking soda gently into the cup.",
      "content": "Use a soft cloth or sponge to scrub the baking soda gently into the cup. Wipe the baking soda off of the inside of the cup with a gentle circular motion. The baking soda is slightly abrasive, so you should be able to scrub away any stains left on the inside of your teacup. Some stubborn stains might require a little more scrubbing power, but be careful not to crack your teacup!"

      "title": "Wash the cup as usual.",
      "content": "Wash the cup as usual. Once you’ve scrubbed away most of the stains, you can either wash your teacup by hand, or, if it’s dishwasher-safe, you can wash it on the top rack of your dishwasher. Either way, once your mug is dry, you should notice that the stains appear much lighter, or they may even be gone completely! [5] X Research source Although the baking soda is slightly abrasive, it’s a very gentle cleaning method, so you can use it whenever you notice stains forming inside your cups. Be sure to wash the cup thoroughly so you don't have any baking soda taste when you have your next cup of tea! [6] X Expert Source Jon Gholian Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 3 December 2020."

      "title": "Pour 1–2 US tbsp (15–30 mL) of vinegar inside of your cup.",
      "content": "Pour 1–2 US tbsp (15–30 mL) of vinegar inside of your cup. Measure out about 1–2 US tbsp (15–30 mL) and pour it into the bottom of your cup, then swish it around to wet the sides. If there’s any excess, pour it out when you’re finished. [7] X Research source The measurement doesn’t have to be exact. A generous splash of vinegar should be enough if you don’t have a measuring spoon or you don’t feel like using one."

      "title": "Allow the salt to sit for about 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Allow the salt to sit for about 5 minutes. Vinegar is acidic, so it won’t take long to start breaking down the tea stains inside of your cup. Place the cup somewhere out of the way, and wait for about 5 minutes before you finish cleaning it. [10] X Research source The salt will start to dry slightly during this time, but it shouldn’t harden completely. If it does, you may need to rinse the cup with a little water before you scrub it."

      "content": "Scrub the salt into the cup with a soft cloth or a sponge. Wipe the salt away from the cup using a circular motion to scrub away any tea stains. Scrub gently, since you don’t want to scratch or break your teacup, but do use enough pressure so you can see the stains coming off of the cup. [11] X Research source Continue scrubbing all the way around the inside of the cup. Avoid using an abrasive sponge or a rough cloth, as these could scratch the inside of your cup, especially if you use this cleaning method often."
