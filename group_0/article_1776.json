You should make sure that the lighting, smell, and sounds in your crib are set for romance. Here's how to do it: [1] X Research source Have soft and sexy lighting. When you walk into your apartment, the lights should already be turned down low—just enough for your lady to see you, but not so brightly that she feels self-conscious. Light a few candles. If you don't have any candles, just have a few lights on that make the room dim. Have a sexy-smelling apartment. If you know you'll be having a lady over on a particular night, open your windows during the day and let in some fresh air. Some manly potpourri can help your apartment stay fresh too. When your lady arrives, casually light some incense, or make sure those candles are scented. You can also use a nice scented air freshener. Play sexy music. Your lady will be more turned on if you turn on the right music. Jazz can make her feel sophisticated, and R&B can put her in a sexy mood. Whatever you choose, make sure you're casual about putting it on, and play it softly."

Chances are that you've come back from drinking at a sexy dinner date, and to keep things going, you should always have something extra to sip on just in case. Something to eat. If you need more time to warm up to get to the bedroom, sharing a sexy snack can help set the mood. Be prepared with sexy foods like grapes, strawberries, cheese and crackers, or chocolate. Avoid eating anything greasy or fried that can give you gas, which will definitely not be a turn on. Something to clean up with. If you plan on doing the deed, have a clean towel and fresh soap for your girl, so you don't turn her off by giving her a wet, moldy towel."

      "content": "Start taking off your clothes. Once your kissing is getting hot and heavy, it's time to start removing your clothes so you can get it on. To set the tone for hot sex, you have to take your clothes off in the right way. Here's how: Take your girl's shirt off first. Gently put your hands under her shirt and slip it off over her head. If it's a button-down shirt, slowly unbutton it and throw it aside. Next, take off your own shirt. Do not take off all of your clothes first. This may freak a girl out and will make her think you're being too aggressive. Take your time. Once your shirts are off, continue kissing, but take off the girl's bra after a while. Note if the clasp is in the front or the back, and try to be smooth about taking it off. Don't be awkward and make jokes about how you haven't done this in a while, or how impossible it is to take off her bra. This will just turn her off and will make you look inexperienced. Gently touch the girl over her underwear. This will make her want you to take off her skirt or pants. If she's wearing pants, slowly pull them down. If it's a skirt, slide it down over her legs. Take off your pants, or wait for her to take them off if she's comfortable with it. Now that you're both down to your underwear, if you're both willing, it's time to start preparing for sex."

Here's how to get a feel for your sexual style with your new partner: Try different positions. Start by being on top and see if she likes being on top or even having sex in a more adventurous way. Don't try anything too crazy at first—get a good rhythm going before you get creative. See if she likes to be gentle or aggressive. Try some light biting or some intense touches to see if she reciprocates. Some women like to be fun and aggressive but are waiting for you to make the move. But if she likes to be gentle, then take your time, and hold her lightly. Try dirty talk. Dirty talk is not for everyone, but if your lady is into it, it can go a long way in turning her on. Tell her what you're doing to her, what you'd like to do to her, and compliment her body. If she doesn't reciprocate, tone it down."
