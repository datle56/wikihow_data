      "content": "A blowout taper is a low taper with a large blown-out top. The sides and back of the hair below the temples are cut short and typically faded down to the nape of the neck. The hair tapers into a long, bulky top, often with a flicked-out fringe. The long hair on top is blown out with a hairdryer to force it upward from the taper to create volume, giving the style its name.

Line up the guideline with the halfway point of your ear and go all the way around the sides and back of your head.

[5] X Research source Use your comb to bring out any stray hairs, then cut them using your clippers to help the taper further blend into the bulk. This is the clipper-over-comb technique. If you prefer to use thinning shears , hair stylist Bianca Cox says to use them “towards the end of the hair versus the center or roots of the hair.” Do this to keep short hairs from randomly sticking out."

      "content": "Ask your barber for a low taper that blends into a blown out top. This style works best with a lot of bulk up top, as your barber will have an easier time blending.

      "content": "For short hair, use products that make your hair look thicker. A thick volume paste with a matte finish works well. Apply the paste to your hands and then work it into your hair, messing it up a bit and creating volume at the roots. The paste will help your short strands stand strong, creating the full look that the blowout taper is known for. [11] X Research source Make sure not to use a paste with a shiny finish, as that will make your hair look thin."

      "title": "A taper is soft and gradual, while a fade is sharp and full of contrast.",
      "content": "A taper is soft and gradual, while a fade is sharp and full of contrast. A taper only appears on your sides and neckline and gradually transitions from the sides to the top. A fade is all around your head, ends above your natural hairline around the top of your ears, and creates contrast between the top and bottom through a shorter cut. A taper is easier to maintain, as you’re working with less hair, and lasts longer than a fade. [12] X Research source Brush your hair to maintain the fade. Your fade will grow out quicker than a taper, so get frequent cuts to keep it fresh. It’s best to brush the taper to maintain it, as well. If you want your sides and back to dramatically blend into your hair up top, a fade is the best way to go. But, if you want a gradual rise from the sides to the top and prefer a less defined blend, go with a taper."

      "content": "Taper Fade Mullet For a tapered look with a wild top, go for a mullet with a taper fade . The mullet with a taper fade is a long mullet with chopped sides and a short fade that tapers into the temples. The taper fade and chopped sides work together to create a light contrast between the sides and long top. With a taper fade mullet, you can grow the back as long as you want, making for a look that’s more dynamic and off-the-wall than the blowout taper."

For shorter hair with an untamed look, rock the warrior cut. A high fade with a warrior cut creates a bold look with strong contrast. [13] X Research source"

A French crop has short, cropped sides with a tapered back and long, fringed top. You still get the versatility of a long top, but this look is a bit more polished than the blowout taper. Plus, the contrast is more striking than a taper."
