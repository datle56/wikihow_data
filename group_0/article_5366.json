      "content": "Find the relative atomic mass of the element. An element's relative atomic mass is the average mass, in atomic units, of a sample of all its isotopes. [4] X Research source This information can be found on the periodic table of elements. Locate the element and find the number underneath the symbol for the element. It will not be a whole number, but will have decimals. For example, for hydrogen, the relative atomic mass is 1.007; for carbon, it is 12.0107; for oxygen, it is 15.9994; and for chlorine, it is 35.453."

      "title": "Multiply the relative atomic mass by the molar mass constant.",
      "content": "Multiply the relative atomic mass by the molar mass constant. This is defined as 0.001 kilogram per mole, or 1 gram per mole. This converts atomic units to grams per mole, making the molar mass of hydrogen 1.007 grams per mole, of carbon 12.0107 grams per mole, of oxygen 15.9994 grams per mole, and of chlorine 35.453 grams per mole. [5] X Research source Some elements are only found in molecules of 2 atoms or more. This means that if you want to find the molar mass of elements that are composed of 2 atoms, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, then you'll have to find their relative atomic masses. Multiply them by the molar mass constant, and then multiply the result by 2. For H 2 : 1.007 x 2 = 2.014 grams per mole; for O 2 : 15.9994 x 2 = 31.9988 grams per mole; and for Cl 2 : 35.453 x 2 = 70.096 grams per mole. One mnemonic device for remembering diatomic elements (molecules of 2 atoms) is: Have No Fear Of Ice Cold Beverages (Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Fluorine, Oxygen, Iodine, Chlorine, Bromine)."

For example, the formula for hydrogen chloride (hydrochloric acid) is HCl; for glucose, it is C 6 H 12 O 6 . Using this formula, you can identify the number of atoms of each element that makes up the compound. [6] X Research source For HCl, there is one atom of hydrogen and one atom of chlorine. For C 6 H 12 O 6 , there are 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms."

[7] X Research source As we did in the first method of calculating the molar mass of an element, we will also multiply these masses by 1 gram/mole. The relative atomic masses of the elements in hydrochloric acid are: hydrogen, 1.007 g/mol and chlorine, 35.453 g/mol. The relative atomic masses of the elements in glucose are: carbon, 12.0107 g/mol; hydrogen, 1.007 g/mol; and oxygen, 15.9994 g/mol."
