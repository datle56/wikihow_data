Find a standard “stick” pen, usually the cheapest types of pens that have the ballpoint on one end, a small cap to cover the other end of the pen, and a separate cover that you put on the pen when not using it. [1] X Research source Make sure to use a cheap pen, as opposed to a more fancy kind. You need to find a pen that has an end cap that pops off, rather than one that screws off or can't be easily removed."

It should comfortably fit within the hole. [3] X Research source If the tube of the pen doesn't fit inside the keyhole, it won't work to open the lock.

You may have to do this anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes if it's your first time using this method. Twist the pen until you feel or hear the lock unlock. [4] X Research source If you are unsure of whether the lock has opened, pull at the bar of the U-lock to check. If you are applying pressure, you should feel the lock open."

U-locks are very difficult to open by hammering or using force, but they are weakened and become brittle when cooled by air spray, meaning that they can be smashed open. Buy compressed or canned air at home improvement stores or online.

If the U-lock is locked around a bicycle or a door handle, it will a little more difficult to open, but it will still be doable. Position the U-lock so that the bar of the U-lock is lying flat on the ground or is against a stable surface like a door or the bar of the bike rack."

Use your non-dominant hand to hold the U-lock by its loop against the ground or the surface that you positioned it against. Pick up the hammer in your dominant hand and begin to hammer against the keyhole. [8] X Research source Keep your fingers away from the place that you are hammering. Also try to keep the U-lock stable and in position as you hammer. Don't be alarmed as you see the white powder on the U-lock come off in a mist as you begin to hammer."

You may have to hammer for 30 seconds or so until a piece breaks off of the bar, after which breaking it will become much easier. Focus your hammering against the broken area of the lock. More sections will come off, until the bar breaks completely and separates from one or both sides of the U. [9] X Research source Be patient, as it may take several minutes of hammering to break the U-lock. Dispose of the remains of the lock when you are finished."

It's the most powerful and quick method of slicing though U-locks, but in order to handle it responsibly you need to take a few safety precautions. You practice and feel comfortable with your angle grinder before using it on your U-lock. [10] X Research source Put on work gloves to protect your hands, as well as goggles to stop any flyaway material from getting in your eyes. Don't wear any loose clothing or jewelry when you operate the angle grinder. Make sure that you are using the right sized disc for the grinder and that the grinder is able to go up to maximum speeds. If your U-lock is locked but not attached to anything, clamp it with a vice attached to a table. If the lock is fastened around a bicycle, adjust it so that when pressure is applied to it, it doesn't move but stays in relatively the same place."

Don't be alarmed when you see sparks fly; even if they touch you they won't hurt you. Hold the blade against the side of the U-lock until it cuts through. This can take anywhere from 15 seconds to a few minutes. [12] X Research source Be very slow and deliberate when you use the angle grinder. Don't push or exert force with the grinder. Just hold the blade against the lock and wait as it chips away. If exert force while you cut, you will cut through the U-lock and then push angle grinder past it to cut whatever is behind the U-lock."
