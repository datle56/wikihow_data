[1] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source The two columns you're combining must be next to each other to use Flash Fill. Don't use Flash Fill if any of the following is true for your data (use the ampersand symbol or the CONCAT function instead): The columns you want to combine aren’t consecutive (e.g., combining columns A and F). You want to be able to make changes to the original columns and have those change automatically update in the merged column."

For example, if column A contains area codes and column B contains phone numbers, you could type the area code and phone number into column C. You can even separate the contents of the columns with words or symbols, as long as you don't make the pattern too hard for Excel to understand. For example: A1 contains the area code 212 and B1 contains 555-1212 , you could type (212) 555-1212 into column C and Excel should sense the pattern."
