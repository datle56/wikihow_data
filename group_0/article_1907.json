      "content": "Every relationship is different and operates on its own timeline. Let go of your own expectations for when exactly a partnership should transition from casual to committed. Friends and family may have their own ideas. But the truth is, your feelings will tell you when it's in your best interest to initiate a conversation—so, take time to reflect. Does thinking about a committed relationship with this person excite you? Is not knowing where you stand with this person causing you stress or worry? Are you ready to receive an answer from him, whether or not it’s the answer you want?"

Or, if you want to keep things casual, don’t officially plan the conversation. Just make sure that when you open up the discussion, it's in person. [1] X Research source “Hey, I wanted to chat with you about something. Want to meet at mine tonight? I can make that spaghetti you love.” Or, wait until the two of you are casually hanging out together in a quiet, safe space. For instance, start the conversation when you're in the living room, hanging out on the couch. Reader Poll: We asked 193 wikiHow readers whether or not you should wait for 1-on-1 conversation to ask someone to be in a relationship, and 94% of them said yes, wait until you two are alone .

      "content": "You may feel more comfortable opening the conversation subtly. In that case, choose an excuse that allows you to ask him if you’re exclusive in an offhand way. Throw this opener into conversation casually. Depending on how clear you are, this may or may not lead to a full discussion—but either way, it can give you an idea about how he’s feeling. [2] X Research source “So funny, my mom asked if I was dating anyone exclusively last week. So hard to explain modern dating norms to a parent, haha.” “Hey, I was thinking. We should talk about whether or not we’re being safe. I don’t mean to pry, but are you having sex with anyone else? I need to know for my own health.”"

And while it's okay to be friendly, to have a successful exclusivity talk, try your best not to hide behind jokes. Set the right tone for an open discussion. Instead of joking when you feel uncomfortable, just be honest. [3] X Research source \"Honestly...I'm just going to say it. I'm feeling pretty nervous right now.\""
