You know your child better than anyone else, and if they seem to be acting out of character – even if you can't put your finger on why – take it seriously. Don't be afraid to ask them how they're feeling as well. Open-ended questions can get them to open up. [1] X Research source For example, if your child normally has good sleep habits, you should be alarmed if they seem to suddenly only need one or two hours (or less) per night. This could be a sign of a mood disorder. Ask other members of your household, such as your other children or spouse, if they have noticed strange behavior as well. They may be able to confirm your gut suspicion. Other people who have close daily interactions with your child, such as their coaches or teachers, may also be worth consulting."

      "content": "Contact several treatment programs. Once you and your child's doctor have created a preliminary list of treatment programs that make sense given the diagnosis, call them and ask questions. Find out what type of treatment the program provides, how long a typical stay lasts, and how much the program costs. It's also a good idea to find out what kind of aftercare each program provides. Inpatient settings often stabilize your child's current condition and prevent further decline. Aftercare is critical to addressing underlying problems and moving forward. Make a list of your questions before you call each treatment center. Then compare your information on all the programs to decide which one fits your child's needs best. It's also a good idea to contact your insurance company and find out whether they will cover your child's mental health treatment."

You might say, \"Josie, you're going to go and stay at the hospital for a few days. I know you have been really sad and we want to help you get better. I'm going to visit you as often as I can, okay? Do you have any questions?\" If your child has a doctor he or she trusts, it may be helpful to have the doctor reassure them that this is for their benefit."
