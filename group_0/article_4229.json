      "content": "Make other mouth noises to encourage your baby to mimic you. In addition to raspberries, you can stick your tongue out and keep blowing air to make other silly sounds. Try pressing out your lower lip and moving your index finger over top repetitively to vary the noises. [9] X Research source Most babies begin blowing raspberries around 6-8 months old. [10] X Research source When your baby mimics you, you can also replicate the noise they make to mimic them back. This keeps the \"dialogue\" going, which encourages them to make more sounds. Babies often repeat sounds as they are learning to communicate. This helps them regulate their voice and change volume and pitch."

      "content": "Continue doing this during playtime to encourage communication. Blow raspberries for a few minutes each time you play with your child. Over time, they may start to make more noises than before. [11] X Research source This, in turn, can improve their language development, which helps speed up the process of saying their first words. Once the baby can comfortably blow raspberries back at you, they likely will develop their language skills soon after."
