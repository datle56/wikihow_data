There is a wide array of glittery eye-shadows from which you can choose. One of the most important things to consider is which color of shadow you want. For example, if you are trying to create a more subtle look, try a shadow that closely matches your natural skin tone. This method will make your eyes appear to sparkle. Keep in mind that you will need 3 shades of the same color for a smoky eye look. For example, you could use a cream, a light brown, and glittery dark brown. If you want to highlight your eye color, glitter eye-shadow can help you do that. To make brown eyes pop, use a cream shade. To make green eyes glow, try a shadow with a reddish tint. If you have blue eyes, try a sparkling gold or copper color. Any of these color palettes can be used to create a smoky eye. Gray is also great for smoky eyes, and works well on many skin tones. For warm skin tones, opt for a brown eyeshadow. Glitter eye makeup comes in many different forms. You can buy eyeshadow pencils, powders, or gels. If this is your first time using glitter, try purchasing an eyeshadow palette. This will let you experiment with multiple shades."

Take a couple of minutes to make sure that you have everything you need. To start with, you'll need the shadow and a tool to help you apply it. [1] X Research source You can apply eye shadow using your finger, a sponge, a brush, or a cotton swab. Many people prefer using a silicone brush as it is sturdier and can better handle the weight of a glitter shadow. Have tissues nearby to help you clean up any stray glitter. Make sure that you have a gentle eye-makeup remover handy in case you need to remove the shadow and start over."

Next, you want to apply the darkest of your shadows, which is the same color you applied to your outer eyelid. Using a brush, apply a thin line of dark shadow across the crease of your eyelid. This will help create the smoky effect. Remember, it is easier to add more shadow than to take it away. Start with less than you think you might need. You can always apply more. Blend the colors. Blending the complimentary colors will help create a softer, yet still dramatic, look. For this step, you can use either your finger or a brush.
