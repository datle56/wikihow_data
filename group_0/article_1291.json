      "title": "Mimic his voice.",
      "content": "Mimic his voice. Any time your brother says anything, repeat what he said , but in a high-pitched voice. This has been driving little siblings crazy since the dawn of time. [1] X Research source This is especially effective when he's telling you, \"Stop doing that!\" or \"I'm telling!\" When your parents come in, quickly switch over to your regular voice so you don't get caught."

      "title": "Take bites off his plate.",
      "content": "Take bites off his plate. While you're eating dinner, wait until nobody is looking and start sneaking bites off his plate. Make sure it's his favorite food, too. Before he notices, make a comment like, \"Jeez, where's all your food going?\""

    {
      "title": "Boss him around like you're his parent.",
      "content": "Boss him around like you're his parent. Little brothers want to be older so badly that the more you draw attention to their youth, the more annoyed they'll be. Treat him like he's much younger than you all the time. If you have to do chores together, roast him about how he can't keep up with you because you're older: \"It's taking you, like, a million years to wash that dish. I guess it's 'cause you're still a baby, huh?\" Assign him chores, even if it's not your job to do chore-assignments. Try something like, \"As the eldest sibling, I command that you do all the laundry in the house. Chop chop!\""

    {
      "title": "Make stuff up and convince them it’s true.",
      "content": "Make stuff up and convince them it’s true. Little brothers are impressionable little goofs. One way to annoy them is to make up ridiculous lies about the world and get them to believe it. If you can even get them to repeat it like it's real? That's a total win. Tell your brother avocados are actually dinosaur eggs. And they're poisonous. Tell your brother he wasn't actually born, your parents grew him in a bucket from catfish heads. Tell your brother that you have the power to read minds. He's thinking, \"No you don't.\" Tell your brother that the dog speaks when he's not around. And says it wants to eat him. Tell your brother Star Wars is a documentary. It really happened. Tell your brother when he turns whatever age he turns next, his nipples will fall off, then grow back."

    {
      "title": "Embarrass him in front of his friends.",
      "content": "Embarrass him in front of his friends. If your brother has some friends coming over, it's a great time to mess with him and (gently) roast him in front of others. Bring out some of his baby pictures, or talk about something embarrassing he did the day before when his friends are over. [2] X Research source He'll get really annoyed. Nuclear warfare: Dump a glass of water on his bed, so it looks like he peed it the night before. Wait until his friends come over and let them find it. Be really careful about doing this. Playful embarrassment is fine, but more serious humiliation is likely to upset him and maybe even damage the bond between you both."

    {
      "title": "Use the silent treatment.",
      "content": "Use the silent treatment. If you really want payback for something, just ignoring your brother is sometimes the best option. He probably wants attention, and keeping that from him will drive him even more crazy than anything you can do. [3] X Research source Don't let him do stuff that you're doing. If you're going to watch a movie, say he can't, because it's only for older kids. Freeze him out of whatever you're doing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try to be his friend, too.",
      "content": "Try to be his friend , too. Younger brothers usually look up to older kids and want to spend time around them. In fact, annoying might be your younger bro's way of showing affection! Even though he might bug you sometimes, try to remember that you can be a good influence on him too. Instead of trying to annoy him, try to teach him to be cool and develop your friendship. Only use these methods to get back at your brother for doing something that's mean. Don't make this a regular habit. Keep your teasing light and try not let it turn into bullying ."

    {
      "title": "Go into his room.",
      "content": "Go into his room. Older brothers are pretty defensive about their rooms. If your brother has his own room, just keep going into it without being asked. Ask him a million questions and start messing with his stuff. Maybe even hide his things: his phone, keys, books for homework, or anything specific that he thinks is really important. [4] X Research source Do something weird in his room while he's out, like pull out all his clothes and put them in a pile, or take sticky notes and label everything. Put one on the window that says, \"Window.\" Put one on the computer that says, \"Computer.\" Find his change jar and label it \"143 cents.\" He'll be so confused. Play innocent. If he tries to chase you out, tell your parents you just tried to ask him a question and he got mad for no reason. Hold his belongings hostage. Say, \"Oh, you need your phone? I know where it is. Give me a ride to the comic book store and I'll tell you.\" [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Make annoying noises.",
      "content": "Make annoying noises. Wait until your brother is busy doing something, like playing a complicated game, talking to his crush, or doing his homework. Then, it's time to strike. Make stupid noises with your mouth, or with your armpit, or with your toys. Make a big racket. Go crazy: whistle, blow raspberries, make fart noises. The world is your oyster. Make sure your parents are in another room, so you can stop in enough time before you get into trouble."

      "title": "Shut off the internet when he's on it.",
      "content": "Shut off the internet when he's on it. Find the internet router in your house, if you have one, and find the \"reset\" button. When your brother's busy talking to his friends on the internet, keep hitting the reset so he'll get really annoyed. If you don't know where the router is, ask your parents to show you, because you're curious. Don't let on that you want to mess with it. Just say, \"How does the internet work? Can you show me?\" They'll be impressed. Just be sure to do this when he’s not in the middle of something really urgent that might get interrupted or ruined by resetting the router. Only mess with his internet access when you know he’s doing something trivial"

    {
      "title": "Wake him up really early.",
      "content": "Wake him up really early. If your brother went out really late the night before, wake him up by blasting some loud rock music, like Linkin Park or AC/DC, or playing a battle scene from The Lord of the Rings on full volume. Do it in his room at 6.00 a.m. on a Saturday. Instant annoyance. If he has an alarm, reset it for like 2 hours earlier than he would normally wake up. Nobody should have to wake up at 4 a.m. Except your older brother."

      "title": "Ease off sometimes.",
      "content": "Ease off sometimes. It might not always seem like it, but you're lucky to have a brother, and you'll probably get along a lot better when you're older. Annoying your brother, however annoying he may be to you, can be pretty immature and get you both into trouble. Try to get along as much as you can. You might even become friends and have fun together, rather than at each other's expense! Try to learn as much as you can from him. Older siblings usually know a lot more about their younger siblings than younger sibs do about them. Instead of annoying him, try to understand why he does what he does."
