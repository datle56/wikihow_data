So, learn the basics here. Use whitening toothpaste like Crest and Colgate, and a good toothbrush. Yellow teeth are not feminine on anyone. If you wear braces, don't let it stop you! Braces are not a bad thing. Eventually, they will make you look even better than you already do. You can get clear braces or braces behind your teeth. Clean your tongue, a clean tongue avoids bad breath. Tongue cleaners are easy to find at drugstores and supermarkets. Use mouthwash after brushing your teeth, Listerine and Act are both top brands that get the job done. Baking soda and mashed strawberry will both whiten teeth overtime, but use them sparingly as they can wear tooth enamel off. Take a shower. You need to wash your body everyday with a sweet smelling soap or shower gel. Use deodorant and perfume. Wear a vanilla or floral scented perfume and a sweet smelling deodorant."

This will make your hair look polished and clean. Wear sophisticated and stylish hairstyles. Comb your hair with a comb or a hairbrush. There are many different preppy hairstyles. The side bun, straight hair, loose barrel rolls, side braid, the fishtail braid, or a high-fashion ponytail. Add some finishing touches or hair accessories. Wear barrettes, bows, flower crowns, or headbands. These can help you to look cute and stylish. If you have short hair, you can do lots of different hairstyles and haircuts that fit you.

This doesn't mean rain boots, just boots such as ankle-high boots and knee-high boots. Boots look great with a nice skirt. Wear ballet flats to look elegant in school. If you want to look elegant while making a bold fashion statement at the same time, try wearing a pair of slippers. Again, they match well with a skirt. Avoid high heels. They hurt your feet and cause knee problems. Kitten heels or shoes with a slight heel are fine though. You can be creative by making your own pair of shoes."

Casual dresses with a bold belt (studded belt, neon belt etc.) can look really awesome if you put the look together properly. There are certain stores that cater to the \"girly girl\" image.

However, make sure you don't do anything that would get you in trouble for messing with the uniform! Wear a cute, girly scarf or put a jacket or a sweater on top. Don't make your uniforms look dull and baggy, make it look as lively as possible. If your school won't let you alter your uniform, just act more girly in general. By doing this, people will see the more girly you! Be polite and kind to others, always listen and get rid of any nasty vocabulary you might have been using. Don't overdo it. People won't like you if you start acting like a snob."

A simple charm bracelet (preferably gold in color) or sparkly headband should do the trick. Try to look simplistic, never gaudy. No need for 20 bracelets, necklaces, or piercings. This doesn't have to be limited to what you wear - try decorating your bag or school supplies, too! Wear simple jewellery. Always wear a pair of colourful earrings, a cute necklace, and sometimes a bracelet. However, don't go overboard; you don't want to jingle when you walk! Pearls, gold, sterling silver, and diamonds scream girly. Faux or legitimate, as long as they look real, you're fine. If your bag looks boring, decorate it. Put cute badges and key-chains on it or sew different fabric swatches on your bag to add a creative and artsy yet girly flair. If you have school supplies that belong to you, such as a binder or a notebook, don't be afraid to decorate it! Glue photos to it, put stickers on it, or do whatever you want. However, if you have something that belongs to the school, such as a textbook, don't decorate that. You don't want to get fined for vandalism."

If your school offers electives, choose preparatory vocational training classes (such as culinary, architecture, or agricultural science) rather than an \"easy A\" class. Taking student council or a physical education class is also good. Try to focus your high school career on getting good grades and participating in clubs, sports, and organizations. It's okay to have fun sometimes, but it's important to realize that school is important. Use your school's resources (pre-ACT/SAT classes, tutoring, library, etc.) and try your best to earn scholarships! Take a foreign language if your school offers it. Many universities require 2-3 years of a foreign language for admission, and you will look very educated. Preps take education very seriously, and can always hold up a conversation about any topic; be very well rounded."

They know how to speak, act, write, eat, and be at all times. And they do it all with poise and grace. Here are some simple things you can do. Real preps are always polite and kind. Preps are never rude, mean, or unpleasant. They are never bullies, and should always be able to make others feel good about themselves. Preps do little to no cursing. They treat adults with respect, and follow their rules. They surround themselves with positive, kind people, much like themselves. They are people you can go to with a problem, and they will help. Saying \"Thank you\", \"Excuse me\", \"I'm sorry\", and \"Please\" is basic etiquette. Don't blow up when someone does not display manners, simply ignore them and carry on as normally and politely as you can. Stand tall, shoulders back and chin up. When you sit, learn to keep your legs together. Love the dictionary and thesaurus! 'Don't type Or write Lykee This' on the internet, you should know how to type, write and speak correctly. Learn table manners. If you don't have time you can search it at Google. For the basic and most common table etiquette, you should keep your elbows off of the table, don't slouch, keep your mouth closed while chewing, don't smack and don't talk with your mouth full."
