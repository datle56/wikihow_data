Maybe one university offers study abroad and the other offers a major of interest. Try framing it negatively.

In some cases, you will not have the final say. You may make a decision, only to have it changed or overruled by someone in a higher position, like your boss. In this situation, you can speak to your boss about why you made the decision — calmly state all your reasons for why you think you made the best choice. Then listen to what your boss has to say. She may have more information than you do, or different priorities, or just outright disagree. If the decision ultimately lies in her hands, then take in her reasons for overruling you, and move on. Know that you made what you felt was the best decision based on the information you had, and it's okay that the other person disagreed. Try not to linger on the fact that your decision was overruled or badmouth the other person's decision, even if you think your decision was the right one. It can be frustrating, especially if, down the line, it turns out your decision would have been better, but it reflects badly on you if you complain or have an \"I told you so\" attitude."
