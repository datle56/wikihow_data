      "content": "Ask your butcher to cut lamb steaks from a leg of lamb. Many butchers don't sell pre-cut lamb steaks. However, your butcher will be happy to cut them for you from a whole leg of lamb. One leg of lamb will typically yield six steaks, each large enough for one serving size. [1] X Research source Ask for steaks cut about 2/3-inch thick. This allows for a quick cooking time and tender results. If your butcher doesn't have a leg of lamb, this method can also be used to cook lamb chops."

Allow the broiler or grill to fully heat up before proceeding. If you're using a grill, let the coals burn until the fire dies down and the coals glow bright red. The steaks must be grilled over very high heat. If you'd prefer to use a stovetop method, heat a cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Allow it to get very hot."
