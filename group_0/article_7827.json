      "content": "Remove the laces and soles from canvas Hey Dude Shoes. Untie 1 of the knots at the end of each shoelace and pull them out of the eyelets. Then, reach into each shoe and pull out the thin insoles. Set the laces and insoles aside while you wash the shoes. Hey Dude insoles are made of memory foam, so if you wash them in the machine, they'll lose their shape. You can wash the insoles by hand with soapy water, or purchase new insoles if you can't get them clean."

[1] X Research source If you see scuff marks on the suede, you can also use the suede brush on them. Brush vigorously to lift the scuff marks. You may see suede brushes that have rubber on one side—this is more for nubuck leather than for cleaning suede so you won't need this side of the brush. You can buy a suede brush from shoe stores, department stores, drugstores, or online."
