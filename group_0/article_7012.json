With Playground, users can adjust a language model's settings, such as output randomness, maximum length, frequency penalty, and more. This tool is more suited for experienced users and developers who want to experiment with varying options and settings to understand how each model behaves with certain prompts."

      "content": "Adjust the output settings. On the right panel, you'll see Temperature , Maximum length , Frequency penalty , and Presence penalty . Temperature refers to the randomness of the output. Lower the temperature to decrease random completions. Maximum length places a cap on how long the response can be. A lower maximum length will result in a shorter response. Frequency penalty will decrease the likelihood of repeated lines or phrases. Presence penalty increases the AI's likelihood to talk about new subjects."

      "content": "Playground is best for developers, while ChatGPT is best for the public. Playground is used to develop and understand how conversational AI behaves within certain parameters. This tool is highly customizable, and it takes some experience to understand how each setting affects the language model. ChatGPT is an optimized version of GPT-3 and 4 for chatbot interactions with the user. This tool has been refined to work seamlessly with the general public. While it can take user preferences into account, it is not as customizable as its Playground counterpart. If you're uninterested in tinkering with the AI model's behavior, ChatGPT is likely a better option to receive straightforward responses to prompts and questions."
