      "content": "Look in the right place. Your first impulse might be to look for a criminal record wherever the person you're researching lives. That's a good starting point, but courts file their records where the offense occurred . If you know where a specific crime took place, look for the record in that state or county. Many states don’t allow you to access juvenile records if they’re sealed."

      "title": "Look for a criminal court records database on your state or county court’s website.",
      "content": "Look for a criminal court records database on your state or county court’s website. While courts have begun going digital, the digital database may only include court records for recent cases. It will depend entirely on the county or state where you are conducting your research. Many courts have converted their paper records to digital, online records. Search your court's website for a database of criminal court records to find out if you can access a digital record."

    },
    {
      "title": "Provide the information you need to find your record.",
      "content": "Provide the information you need to find your record. Criminal record databases can be quite large, so have as much information as possible to find the record you need: The offender's full name. You may know the person by a nickname or by his middle name, but the courts know him by his full legal name. Even then, there may be several \"John Smith\"s in the database, so have more information if possible. A business name if a business was involved. Case number. This is the most reliable way to find a criminal record."

      "content": "View the record online. Once you locate a listing for the criminal record you want, click the link to see the record itself. Note that even if your state or county has digital records, they may still be in the middle of converting their files. The information in the database might be incomplete.

      "title": "Search the court archives yourself.",
      "content": "Search the court archives yourself. Visit the appropriate court (county, state, appellate, supreme, etc.) and ask an employee to show you to the court record archives. The archives might be organized by year, by case type, or by both. Ask the person who directs you to the archives how to find the record you need. You can view the record for free, but will need to pay a fee if you want to make copies. Depending on how much space they have, the court may have moved older records to a different location. If so, ask whether you should visit that location or submit a request for the clerk to have the file sent back to the court archives."

The website might ask you to download and print off a request form, or just to write a letter asking for a criminal record. Look first for a form, but if you’re writing a letter, include the following information: The defendant's full, legal name His or her date of birth The specific documents you would like to see. For example: A trial docket (all the materials filed during a trial) The minutes for a specific court date The sentencing document"

You can either fill out the request form there or deliver your request letter. Bring as much information as possible with you, so you don't have to come back for a second trip with more information. The benefit of submitting your request in person is that you can ask questions to the person helping you out. Don't be shy! If you have any questions, ask them before you leave the office."

If you are mailing your request, search the website for a \"fee schedule\" that tells you how much it costs to print each page. If you are submitting your request in person, ask the person at the desk to help you figure out how much you owe. Some offices only ask you to cover the costs up to a certain amount.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates a person's consumer report, which includes criminal records. If employers want to hire someone to access these records they do so through a Consumer Credit Reporting Agency or a CRA. If you’re an employer, you may need to register with the state agency before submitting a request. Know the rules about which types of convictions you're allowed to take into consideration. Many states allow consideration only for crimes related to the job in question. [5] X Research source For example, an accounting firm can refuse to hire a convicted embezzler.
