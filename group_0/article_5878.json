      "title": "Your vehicle is in anti-theft mode and may not start.",
      "content": "Your vehicle is in anti-theft mode and may not start. When something triggers the anti-theft system , your vehicle uses an immobilizer to prevent thieves from driving away. While the car and lock symbol on your dash normally turns on if someone tries getting into your vehicle without the key, it may activate due to another faulty component. [1] X Research source The anti-theft symbol on your vehicle may also look like the silhouette of a key inside of a car."

      "title": "Try turning your key in the ignition.",
      "content": "Try turning your key in the ignition. Put your key in the ignition and turn it to the On position without starting the engine. Leave your key in the vehicle for about 10 minutes so the anti-theft system resets and detects your key. After that, the light will turn off and your vehicle will start. [2] X Research source If that doesn’t work, check your key for any damage along the teeth or near the base. If you see nicks, dents, or damage, then replace your car keys at a local dealership or locksmith. If you have keyless ignition, use another one of the fixes listed below for your vehicle."

      "title": "Unlock your doors with the key or fob.",
      "content": "Unlock your doors with the key or fob. Roll all the windows up and close all the doors tightly. Use your key to manually lock all of the doors on your vehicle. Alternatively, press down on your key fob’s panic button for 5 seconds before pressing the lock button twice. Walk away for about 15 minutes before unlocking your vehicle again to check if the light reset. [3] X Research source If the anti-theft light starts blinking when you try starting the engine, then the system hasn’t reset. If you have a spare key for your vehicle, try using that instead. If the spare key works, then the old key may be damaged. Replace the key fob battery if it isn’t working properly since your car may not be able to sense it. If it still doesn’t work, then get a replacement fob ."

      "title": "Disconnect your battery for 10 minutes to reset the light.",
      "content": "Disconnect your battery for 10 minutes to reset the light. Loosen the nuts on the battery cables to disconnect them from your battery. Touch the ends of the cables together to drain the rest of the current from your vehicle and reset the electrical system. After 10 minutes, reconnect your car battery and try starting your vehicle again to see if the car and lock light turned off. [4] X Research source Disconnecting your battery also resets your vehicle’s clock and radio stations, so don’t forget to set them again. If your vehicle doesn’t turn on or start at all, then the battery may be completely dead. Check your car battery with a multimeter to ensure it has enough power."

      "title": "Install a new fuse for the anti-theft system.",
      "content": "Install a new fuse for the anti-theft system. Look for the fuse box on your vehicle, either behind a panel on the driver's side or under the hood. Check the back of the panel cover to locate the fuse for the anti-theft system. Test the fuse with a test light to see if it’s working properly. If the fuse is faulty, then replace it with a new one. [5] X Research source Look for a fuse diagram in your vehicle’s manual if you don’t see one on the panel cover. Replacement fuses only cost around $20 USD, so replacing them is an affordable repair to try before spending money at the mechanic."

      "content": "Replace the ignition cylinder if it’s damaged. The ignition cylinder is where you insert your key to start your vehicle. Inspect the cylinder for any scratches, pry marks, or separation between the components, which are signs someone attempted to start your vehicle without the key. Remove and replace the ignition to turn off the warning light. [6] X Research source Replacing your ignition cylinder may require taking panels off of your steering column to access the parts. [7] X Research source Alternatively, explain that there’s damage to your ignition cylinder to a mechanic to have it repaired for around $150–200 USD."

If you’re unable to solve the issue on your own, call your local mechanic and explain that the anti-theft system is activated on your vehicle. Let them know what you’ve already tried so they can check for problems with your electrical system or the actual immobilizer components in your vehicle. [8] X Research source"

Similarly, if you’ve cracked the key fob or if it doesn’t have enough battery, your vehicle won’t be able to recognize it and may go into anti-theft mode to stay protected."
