Even a universal bender may require attaching a shoe and/or follow bar designed for EMT. This article focuses on hand benders. If you are using a hydraulic or power bender (recommended for conduit with a nominal size over 2 inches), find instructions for your specific bender model. Hickey benders tend to crush or kink EMT conduit. Use a bender with a curved track for the conduit to slot into."

Without pulling, use one hand to steady the handle on your bender, and the other to steady the conduit end once it rises within reach. Apply firm, constant foot pressure, as a pause could create a kink in your conduit. Bend until the end of the conduit is vertical, or very slightly past vertical. A conduit bender will allow you to make any type of bend, from a few degrees up to 90°. [2] X Expert Source Jesse Kuhlman Master Electrician, Kuhlman Electric Expert Interview. 30 June 2020. You can also use a bender to make an offset, or hump. [3] X Expert Source Jesse Kuhlman Master Electrician, Kuhlman Electric Expert Interview. 30 June 2020.

An offset of a few inches can use a 10º or 22.5º angle, but an offset of several feet may call for 30º or 45º. [6] X Research source Smaller angles will \"use up\" less of your conduit, but may be more difficult to bend precisely. If your conduit layout requires precise measurements, calculate the amount of shrinkage, or additional length required for the bend: A 10º angle uses an additional 1/16\" of length per inch of offset depth. A 22.5º angle uses 3/16\" per inch of offset depth. A 30º angle uses ¼\" per inch. A 45º angle uses ⅜\" per inch. A 60º angle uses ½\" per inch. To find the total shrinkage, multiply the offset depth in inches by the shrinkage value above."

Add this number to the distance from the end of your conduit to the obstacle. Mark the conduit at this length. [7] X Research source Here's an example for a conduit you plan to bend at a 30º angle to overcome a 10\" step: The shrinkage for a 30º angle is ¼ inch per inch of rise. (See previous step.) Multiply ¼ by 10 inches of rise: ¼ x 10\" = 2.5 inches. This is the total shrinkage. Let's say the conduit will run from an electrical box 40 inches from the step. Add this distance to the shrinkage: 40 inches + 2.5 inches = 42.5 inches . Measure 42.5 inches from the end of the conduit and mark it with a marker or pencil."

For a 30º angle, multiply by 2. For a 45º angle, multiply by 1.4. For a 60º angle, multiply by 1.2. Some benders list the offset multipliers on one side of the head, directly opposite the corresponding angles on the other side. These may not match the numbers above perfectly due to rounding."

Multiply the offset depth (10\") by 2 to get 20\". Place the tape measure against your first mark, 42.5\" from the end (calculated in the steps above). Measure 20\" toward the end of the conduit and make another mark. This is the position of the other bend."

(This is the first mark you made.) Slot the bender onto the conduit, and apply steady foot pressure to bend the conduit. Watch the degree mark on the side of your bender that matches the angle you chose. Continue bending until this mark touches the horizontal portion of the conduit. Position the bender so the foot pedal is between the two marks. For example, if you plan to bend at a 30º angle, bend until the 30º mark touches the edge of the conduit. You can use any mark on your bender instead of the arrow, as long as you use the same mark to create the second bend. A different mark may be more convenient for bends near the end of the conduit.

The three-point saddle includes one bend to lift the conduit off the floor, a second bend to bend it down over the obstacle, and a third bend to make the conduit level with the floor again. Calculate the position of the center bend as though it were an offset. For example, conduct these calculations for a 30º–60º–30º saddle, the easiest setup to memorize: A 30º creates ¼\" shrinkage for each inch of rise. Multiply ¼\" by the height of the obstacles in inches to find the total shrinkage. Measure the distance from the desired position of the conduit end to the center of the obstacle. [12] X Research source Add these two values together. Measure this length from the end of the conduit and mark it. Note: Many benders only have a teardrop mark to show the position of a 45º saddle bend. In this case, a 22.5º–45º–22.5º saddle is the easiest type to bend."

Measure this distance twice, starting from the center mark and measuring in both directions. For example, since a 30º angle has an offset multiplier of 2, a 3\" high obstacle requires bends 2 x 3\" = 6\" apart. Draw a mark 6\" to the left of the center mark, and another mark 6\" to the right of the center. Instead of calculating this by hand, you can look up a Three-Point Saddle chart online to give you these values."

These three notches correspond to 30º, 45º, and 60º angles.
