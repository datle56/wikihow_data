    {
      "title": "Start with your actual name or nickname.",
      "content": "Start with your actual name or nickname. Your name is a good place to start, even if the final product doesn't resemble your name at all. Try making a play on your first name, last name, or nickname, such as a pun or a reference to a fictional character with a similar name. For example, if your name is Carl Benson, you could try something like CarliB (a play on Cardi B). If your name is John and you love Beyoncé, you could (and definitely should) be Be John ce. You could also add some stylized characters, such as X's or numbers, in or around your name. For example, XxIzzyxX or 10Danny01. Keep in mind that anyone you play on Xbox Live will be able to see your name. For security reasons, don't use your full real name in a way that could out your real-world identity."

    {
      "title": "Include your favorite Xbox game or character.",
      "content": "Include your favorite Xbox game or character. If there's a specific game you love, consider referring to it in your name. Obscure character references will also get you noticed by those in-the-know. You can also try something less on-the-nose like a place, weapon, or event. Examples: If you love the Halo series, you might try MstrChief3K, MrNeedler, CortanaLvr99, or 31337Hammer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reference your favorite hobby or interest.",
      "content": "Reference your favorite hobby or interest. Video games aren't the only things in the world that interest you, so they don't have to be the only things in your name. Draw on your wide range of skills, hobbies, and interests to think of an idea. You might reference a band you're a fan of, your dream car, a line from your favorite movie, or something else entirely. It's all up to you! Examples: If you're a musician, you might try names with music terminology like TrebleKill33, BassicInstct, Bad2Trombone, BFlattened, and so on."

    {
      "title": "Go for an intimidating name.",
      "content": "Go for an intimidating name. Intent on completely wrecking your competition online? Let other players know that you mean business with a name that calls attention to your lethal skill with a controller. Go for a name that sounds scary, deadly, or diabolical—just keep in mind that hate speech and offensive content are banned under the XBox Live terms of service. Examples: Obliter8r9, MsJennyDeath, NoobsBeware, KillerJoe, etc. Another way to give your competition the jitters is not to outright say that you plan to destroy them. Instead, suggest it. Names that imply some sort of mysterious or suspicious quality are quite popular as Gamertags. Sometimes, it's all about what you don't tell your enemy. Try names like InDaShadows, Ninjitsu765, UnseenDoom, or BehindYou."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a joke or pun.",
      "content": "Make a joke or pun. Your Gamertag doesn't have to be grim or serious. In fact, having a more light-hearted one can make you seem more approachable to other players. This can be good when you're working with teammates toward a shared objective. Names that make someone laugh at first sight are always a good bet. Since you're working with a limited number of characters, quick puns are often easiest. Examples: ChrisPBacon, CubaBaddngJR, TheOtherGuy, HeyYou (so that when people talk to you in-game, it's confusing.)"

      "title": "Try a name generator.",
      "content": "Try a name generator. If Post Malone can go platinum with a name he got from a rap name generator, you could definitely use a generator to create your Gamertag. Although Microsoft has a 12-character limit on Gamertags, you can usually shorten longer results by removing vowels or other characters. The Pun Generator comes up with puns based on a word you enter. Try entering your name, an actor, a game character, etc. My Mob Name gives you a new name straight out of a Mafia movie. Random Username Generator lets you create a totally random username if you'd like, but you can also specify other preferences, like topics and starting letters."

    {
      "title": "Include your clan membership.",
      "content": "Include your clan membership. In online games, clans are \"clubs\" that avid gamers can join to play with people they know. Often, players advertise their clan membership by putting the name of their clan at the beginning of their username. This can also help you get a name that's already taken — odds are, the version with the clan name at the front is free. For example, if you're in the \"Fyre\" clan and you want the name \"Lazr33\", you might advertise your membership like this: \"FyrexLazr33\" Clans will often have instructions on exactly how to format your Gamertag to advertise your membership. Be sure to follow the directions!"

      "title": "Use another language.",
      "content": "Use another language. All you need is a few words of a non-English language to give yourself a Gamertag that's unique in English-language games. You have a few options here. One is to translate a cool-sounding name that's already taken into another language. You can also try using the language's equivalent of your real name. You can even just find a word that you like the look of. Examples: If you're a fan of bears, you might try 77Urso77 (\"Urso\" is \"bear\" in Portuguese) or XAyiX (\"Ayi\" is \"bear\" in Turkish). Use Google Translate to translate other words into the language of your choice."

      "title": "Be random.",
      "content": "Be random. There's no rule that your name has to make sense. In fact, the more random your name, the less likely that it's already taken. Try combining two words that have no connection or using a random adjective to describe a word you happen to like. The more creative, the better! Examples: GrandmaFox, OceanPillar, PantsSale, Seven8Six."

      "content": "Check the availability of your new name. Before you go to the trouble of logging in and making a Gamertag for yourself, check to see if it's already taken. There are a few sites that allow you to do this online. A basic search engine query should reveal several, but here are a few to get you started: https://www.gamertag.net https://www.xboxgamertag.com"

      "content": "Don't make a Gamertag with offensive language. All players agree to follow the Xbox Code of Conduct when they sign up for Live. The Code contains certain rules about offensive language in Gamertags. If you choose a Gamertag that violates the Code, Microsoft will change it to an automatically-generated one. The Code's definition of \"offensive language\" includes: [1] X Research source Curse words Sexual topics Words like \"Gay,\" \"Bi,\" \"Lesbian,\" and \"Transgender\" are okay to use. Notorious people or organizations Hate speech (e.g., racist/sexist slurs) Controversial religious topics Controversial historical figures or events Sensitive current or past events"

      "content": "Don't try offensive \"sound-alike\" names. Even if your Gamertag isn't technically offensive, your account may still be probated or banned if your Gamertag tries to get around the rules with words that imply offensive concepts. It's usually obvious when a user is trying to \"cheat\" the Code of Conduct, so these sorts of names are almost always a waste of time. [2] X Research source For instance, the name \"Adolf Hitler\" would be prohibited under the rule against controversial historical figures. However, a name like \"Ad0fhtlr\" would also be prohibited, since it's clearly referencing the same person."

In these cases, both the seller and the buyer may be subject to penalties or bans. If someone already has a name you want, use the tricks in the section above to find a name that's close to it.

This extends to other players, moderators, game developers, and Microsoft staffers. Imitating authority figures like moderators and staff members is a tactic commonly used for scams. If you do this, even if you have the best intentions in mind, it can still earn you a ban or probation."
