Instead, draw a man's attention by changing your seated position every couple of minutes. This movement may help to catch his eye. Crossing and uncrossing your legs can be seen as a flirtatious action. However, don't make this movement too much, or you may look like you're anxious or something is wrong. It's also important to make sure your legs are crossed toward the guy in question. Be slow and purposeful in your movements, and use the narrowed space as an excuse to lean your legs closer to his. [7] X Research source Conversely, don't keep your legs tightly crossed and tucked directly underneath your body the whole time. That's often seen as a sign of disinterest. If you don't think you cross your legs comfortably in his direction, it would be better to keep them uncrossed than to cross them away from him. [8] X Research source"
