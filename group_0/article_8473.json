      "title": "Gather the required items.",
      "content": "Gather the required items. You will need sea salt, white vinegar and an old toothbrush. The acidity of the white vinegar will help to remove the rust from your razor blade. The sea salt will act as an abrasive ingredient that aids the vinegar in removing the rust. Regular table salt is fine to use, as well, but the sea salt provides a little more grit for the scrubbing. Have a few soft, clean towels on hand, along with rubbing alcohol and a few cotton balls for sterilization."

      "title": "Rinse the razor blade well with water.",
      "content": "Rinse the razor blade well with water. You don’t need to use soap, bleach or any other cleaners for this. Never use harsh chemicals. Simply rinse the razor blade with plain water straight from the tap. The temperature of the water doesn’t matter. If you’re cleaning a shaving razor, be sure to turn it upside down and allow the water to run through the slots between the blades."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill a small bowl with white vinegar.",
      "content": "Fill a small bowl with white vinegar. Drop the razor blade into the bowl and allow it to soak in the vinegar for at least 30 seconds. You can leave it in the vinegar several minutes if you like, especially if you are dealing with very stubborn rust. Make sure you’ve used enough vinegar so that the razor blade is completely submerged in it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a paste with the sea salt and vinegar.",
      "content": "Make a paste with the sea salt and vinegar. While the razor blade is soaking in the vinegar, dump a spoonful of sea salt into another small bowl. Pour a small amount of vinegar over it. Use a spoon to mix the two substances together until a thick paste forms."
    },
    {
      "title": "Load the toothbrush with the paste and scrub the blade well.",
      "content": "Load the toothbrush with the paste and scrub the blade well. Remove the razor blade from the bowl of vinegar. Dip the toothbrush into the paste, making sure to load the bristles with plenty of it. Scrub the blade thoroughly. Reload the brush with more paste if necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the blade clean with water.",
      "content": "Rinse the blade clean with water. Use a clean towel to gently blot away the bigger chunks of paste. Then run the blade under the tap, rinsing it clean of any remaining paste. Inspect the razor closely to make sure the rust is gone. Don’t leave any rust behind, since it can spread. Repeat the steps if any rust is stubbornly remaining behind."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blot the blade dry with a soft towel.",
      "content": "Blot the blade dry with a soft towel. Once your blade is rust-free, gently blot it on a towel to remove any moisture, which is one of the major causes of rust forming in the first place. Soak a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol and wipe the blade. This will accelerate the drying of any residual moisture and sterilize it for future use. Leave the blade to air dry on a clean towel. Store the blade away from moisture. If possible, store it somewhere other than the steam and humidity of the bathroom. Always blot the blade dry after using it."

    {
      "title": "Gather the necessary items.",
      "content": "Gather the necessary items. You will need sea salt, one lemon and an old toothbrush. You’ll want to have a few clean, soft towels on hand, along with some rubbing alcohol and a handful of cotton balls. You’ll use these items at the end to sterilize your blade."

      "title": "Rinse the razor blade with plain tap water.",
      "content": "Rinse the razor blade with plain tap water. There is no need to use soap or cleaning products for this. Running it under plain tap water is all you need to do. Make sure that you rinse the blade very well, getting into any nooks and crannies."

      "title": "Cut the lemon in half.",
      "content": "Cut the lemon in half. Take one of the lemon halves and squeeze its juice into a small bowl. Drop the razor blade into the bowl and allow it to soak for a minimum of 30 seconds. You can leave it in the juice for several minutes, if you like. Make sure there’s enough juice in the bowl so that the blade is totally submerged in it."

      "title": "Sprinkle sea salt liberally on the other lemon half.",
      "content": "Sprinkle sea salt liberally on the other lemon half. Make sure you sprinkle it on the fleshy side of the lemon, not the rind. After doing so, you can use the lemon half to scrub directly on the razor blade. The acid in the juice, coupled with the grit of the sea salt, will work to clean the rust from the blade."

    {
      "title": "Blot and rinse the blade with water.",
      "content": "Blot and rinse the blade with water. Use a clean towel to gently blot away most of the lemon pulp and sea salt. Run the blade under the tap to rinse it clean of any remaining pulp and salt. Examine the blade for any rust spots that haven’t been cleared up. Repeat the steps if any of the rust is stubbornly remaining behind. Rust can spread, so make sure to get it all."

      "content": "Use a soft towel to blot the blade dry. After you’ve removed all of the rust from the blade, gently blot it on a clean towel to get rid of any residual moisture, which is one of the main culprits of rust formation. Soak a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol and wipe the blade to sterilize it. Allow the blade to air dry on a towel. Once it’s completely dry, store the blade away from moisture, either outside the bathroom or in a small ziplock bag. Always blot the blade dry with a clean towel after you use it."

      "title": "Rinse your razor blade well after every use.",
      "content": "Rinse your razor blade well after every use. It’s best to rinse it under hot water after one or two swipes to keep the blades clear of clogged hair. After you’ve finished shaving, hold the blade underneath a stream of hot water for 5-10 seconds. If you still see clogged hair between the blades, turn it at a 45 degree angle and rinse it for a few more seconds."

      "title": "Dry your blade thoroughly.",
      "content": "Dry your blade thoroughly. Moisture left behind on the metal will oxidize, leading to rust formation. The corrosion will also make your blade dull, requiring you to replace it more quickly. Make sure you dry it very well after each use. You can use a soft towel to gently blot – not wipe – it dry. Take care not to cut yourself. You can also give your blade a quick blast with a blow dryer to remove moisture. [1] X Research source About 10 seconds under the blow dryer should do the trick."

      "title": "Use mineral oil and rubbing alcohol on the blade.",
      "content": "Use mineral oil and rubbing alcohol on the blade. After each use, dip the razor in rubbing alcohol. This will accelerate drying and sterilize the blade. If you are acne-prone, sterilization will help to prevent it. Then dip it in mineral oil, which will enhance the performance of your blade, protect it from the elements and make it last longer. [2] X Research source Alternatively, you can use disposable razors."
