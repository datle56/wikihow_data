      "content": "Make sure you know all of the rules. You can’t improve if you don’t know how to play first! If you’re just getting into chess, learn the basic rules. Memorize the move patterns for all of the pieces. Figure out how you take pieces or checkmate your opponent. Don’t forget the unique rules beginners often forget, such as: Castling : If you haven’t moved your king and rook, and there’s nothing in between them, you can move the king 2 squares in either direction and set the rook on the other side. En passant : When a pawn moves 2 squares in a turn, the very next move an adjacent pawn makes may be captured by moving at an angle in front of it. Material stalemate conditions: “Insufficient material” refers to a board state where it is physically impossible for either side to make a checkmate. In this event, the game ends in a draw. Repetitive move stalemate: If you and your opponent end up in the same exact board state (i.e. all the pieces are on the same squares) 3 times, the game automatically ends in a stalemate."

      "content": "Learn the key openings. Mastering the common openings will get you ahead of the game. Opening theory (also known as “book moves” or “theory”) refers to the predetermined sets of moves that players can make in the beginning of the game to get ahead. These openings have been studied and codified through centuries of research and practice, and learning the key openings will keep you from getting rolled over early in the game. Perhaps the most popular opening today for white is the London system. It’s a great opening for newer players because white can ignore a lot of black’s opening moves. [1] X Research source Popular offensive openings include the queen’s gambit, the Ruy Lopez (or just “Lopez”) opening, and the Scotch game. Key defensive openings include the French defense, the Sicilian defense, and the Caro Kann."

      "content": "Read chess books. Studying the game will take you from intermediate to expert. Chess is one of the few games out there where reading is more valuable than playing at a certain point. Here are a few good recommendations that are popular in the chess community: The Mammoth Book of Chess by Graham Burgess and John Nunn. Logical Chess: Move by Move by Irving Chernev. It teaches you how to attack the king in the king pawn openings and how to play positional chess with the queen pawn openings. Think Like a Grandmaster by Alexander Kotov. This book explains how to analyze variations so that you can play the middle game at a much higher level. [1] by Max Euwe. A classic book that explains how to judge a position based on space advantage, combinations, endgame advantages, king attack, and pawn structures. Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess by Bobby Fischer. A classic book that teaches chess tactics for the beginner."

      "content": "Develop your bishops and knights. Rookie players leave the bishops and knights in the backline early. Novice players move all of their pawns first, leaving their backline pieces underdeveloped. Once you’ve moved a few pawns, aim to develop your bishops and knights by advancing them. Bishops and knights are the workhorses when it comes to building a position in the mid-game. [2] X Research source “Development” is a term you’ll hear a lot in chess. It refers to whether a piece is meaningfully positioned and able to make dynamic moves. Think of each piece like a tool in your toolbox. Developing all of your pieces means you’re using every tool you have available! Moving too many pawns weakens the castled kingside and opens you up to attack. Moving too many pawns usually will also often weaken your endgame pawn structure."

      "content": "Build and identify strong pawn structures. Aim to develop pawns in a way where they can make an impact. “Pawn structure” refers to the overall shape of your pawns on the board (or a set of pawns on the board). Powerful pawn structures help you gain and maintain priority on the board, so move your pawns to support one another and put pressure on key squares. Strong pawn structures include: [3] X Research source An outside pawn lures the opponent’s king to the other side, enabling you to gobble the rest of his pawns or advance your pawns on the other side of the board. A passed pawn is not obstructed by any opposing pawns and should be pushed. As chess legend Nimzovitch said, \"Passed pawns must be pushed.\" A protected passed pawn is a passed pawn that is protected by another pawn. A protected passed pawn forces the opponent to constantly defend against an advance."

      "content": "Exploit your opponents’ weak pawn structures. As you build strong structures, look for your opponents’ weaknesses. If you understand the pawn structures to avoid, you can look for them on the other side of the board. A weak pawn structure may include pawns that are awkwardly stacked on top of one another, or pawns that are out in the open for taking. Weak pawn structures include: [4] X Research source Doubled-up pawns that cannot defend each other and are subject to attack. Isolated pawns with nothing protecting them are weak. Backward pawns on open files (columns on the board) are extremely weak and subject to attack by rooks."

      "title": "Master your end game skills.",
      "content": "Master your end game skills. A few endgame principles will help you dramatically improve. If you’re ahead in material, exchange pieces, not pawns. If you’re behind in material, exchange pawns and you can force a draw. [5] X Research source Without pawns, you must be up by at least a rook to force mate. The only exception to this is that two knights and a king cannot force mate against a lone king. The king is a powerful piece, so use it to block and attack pawns in the end game. Moving your king off of the back rank is known as “activating” your king. Bishops of opposite colors draw most of the time because neither side can advance pawns without losing them. A rook pawn and a bishop only draw against a black king if the bishop is the opposite color as the queening square. Pawns, rooks, and bishops become more valuable as the game proceeds so play to keep them. In queen endings, the player who moves the queen to the center first dominates play typically."

      "title": "Start scorekeeping to analyze games.",
      "content": "Start scorekeeping to analyze games. Learn the values of the pieces so you can assess your positions. Tracking the value of your pieces is a great way to evaluate when a trade is worth it, whether you’re winning or not, and where you’re getting an edge on board. A pawn is worth 1 point. Knights and bishops are worth 3 points each. A rook is worth 5 points. A queen is worth 9 points. Keep score while you play. For example, it is not advantageous to trade a bishop (worth 3) and a knight (worth 3) for a rook (worth 5). Don't give up material unnecessarily. While a well-planned sacrifice can sometimes put you well ahead in the game, losing pieces due to poor planning can do exactly the opposite. Points aren’t the end-all and be-all of chess. In some positions, a bishop or a knight is stronger than a rook."
