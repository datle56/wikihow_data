Make sure they form a creamy paste that doesn’t have any lumps. [6] X Research source Most bleach recipes call for a 1:1 ratio of developer and bleach powder, but you should double check just in case. The level of developer you use depends on how dark your hair is and how light you want to go. 10 volume developer is the least harsh, 40 volume developer is the most harsh, and 20 and 30 volume developers are in between."

Protect your hands with rubber, latex, or nitrile gloves the entire time that you are dealing with bleach. Cover the area with an old towel or table cloth in case you drip any bleach, and put on an old shirt that you don’t mind getting bleach on.

      "content": "Wipe the bleach onto the first section of hair with a dye brush. If you are bleaching the entire length of your hair, start at the ends and move up to the roots. If you are just touching up your roots, focus on that area and try not to get bleach on any already-dyed hair. Use a hair dye applicator brush for the most precision. [9] X Research source Your roots process faster than your ends do, so you should always save them until last. The back of your hair is usually darker than the front because it doesn’t get as much sun. It’s important to bleach the back of your head first because it will most likely take longer to lighten. Avoiding your already-dyed hair will damage your hair less since you won’t be bleaching it multiple times."

Make sure these roots get fully covered with bleach. [10] X Research source Doing this now will ensure that your roots get an even coverage so they won’t be splotchy."
