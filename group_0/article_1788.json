Adjust the hanging ends so they’re both even. [3] X Research source If you’re hanging more than one decorative towel over the same bar, you can space them out a bit for a more practical setup, or line the towels up to touch for a fancier feeling."

Then, reach underneath the top layer of the towel and grab the other loose corner. Fold the two pieces together to secure the backside of the towel. Place the towel over the towel bar. [8] X Research source This will keep your pocket from coming loose when it’s hanging up on the bar."

Lay the washcloth flat on a table and fold the sides lengthwise repeatedly to create pleats that overlap one another. Hold the washcloth tight in the center so it doesn’t come undone. Slide the small washcloth inside of the pocket you created on the hand towel. Fan out the washcloth to make it look like a ruffle in the pocket. [9] X Research source Instead of placing a washcloth inside of the pocket, you could alternatively add some fake flowers, a ribbon, or a normally-folded washcloth."
