      "title": "Purify yourself before any spell.",
      "content": "Purify yourself before any spell. Get into the right frame of both body and mind and cleanse away any doubts, demons, or spiritual impurities that might distract you or make the spell go awry. Ideally, purifying yourself should be a ritual in and of itself and should leave your body relaxed and your mind clear. Perform some or all of the following to cleanse yourself: Bathe. Take a long bath , getting your skin completely clean and soaking the tension out of your muscles. Dress for your ritual. If you have robes or other special garb for doing magic, put that on. Otherwise, pick simple but formal clothes that feel light, comfortable, and clean. You are asking the divine forces for a favor, so dress with reverence. If there won't be anyone around, some Wiccans swear by performing magic in the nude. [1] X Research source Meditate until your mind is clear. Do some basic deep breathing to improve your focus and discard distracting desires. Anoint yourself with the proper oils. Different essential oils can be used for different purposes, so if you like, find one or more that seem appropriate and dab a few drops on your forehead and perhaps your hands, hair, face, and chest as well. For example, lemon oil symbolizes health and happiness, while bergamot represents money and success. [2] X Research source If you choose to anoint yourself, dilute your essential oil in a carrier oil, like olive or jojoba, since pure essential oil can irritate your skin.

If you are going to be working inside, make sure you won't be disturbed and tidy up the location where you intend to perform your spell. [4] X Research source Visualize negative and distracting energies dispersing as you clean. When the space is clean physically, purify it spiritually by burning some incense , sprinkling some salt water or holy water, or playing a few clear notes on a musical instrument."

      "title": "Set up a circle or altar.",
      "content": "Set up a circle or altar. You need a consecrated space to perform your ritual. This can be either a circle to protect you from the interference of negative spirits and energies, an altar to focus your dedication to a specific deity or element, or some combination of these two. Perform your ritual within the circle or in front of the altar. Making a circle: Draw a circle big enough to sit in, or a 5-pointed star within a circle (called a pentacle). You can draw it physically or just trace it in the air with your finger or a wand. Visualize protective energy coming out of your arm as you draw, sealing off the circle in a bubble of light. Mark the cardinal points on the circle or the points of the star with candles, stones, or some other set of significant objects. Making an altar : Create a small raised platform on which to place a figurine of a deity or some other symbolic representation of the divine. It doesn't have to be complicated (for example, a stack of books will do, if you treat it reverently). Consider adding candles, crystals, an incense stand, or a couple objects close to you spiritually, such as a small heirloom or your book of spells . [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Invoke the divine.",
      "content": "Invoke the divine. Verbally call on a higher power to bless your spell. This can be a general prayer to call on the help of some deity or force, or something specific you wrote for this spell. Your invocation can also include meaningful gestures, music, dance, or ritually lighting candles or placing objects. In Wiccan rituals, for example, the God and Goddess are invited to join. Or, natural forces like the four directions (north, south, east, and west) or the elements (air, earth, fire, and water) are invoked. [6] X Research source Think of your invocation as an invitation. You’re not commanding deities to appear and serve you. Instead, you’re asking the divine to join and aid you in whichever way they deem best for you. Jump to the next section for more ways to invoke the forces of nature and the divine."

      "title": "Focus your energy on your desire.",
      "content": "Focus your energy on your desire. Visualize the object of your spell and imagine light flowing from you into it. Imagine and feel your wish coming true. The more vividly you can see these energies in your mind's eye, the realer they will be. When focusing on your desire, McVey adds, “You have to be clear and concise about what you want…Whatever you're creating, you want to be specific. Use positive, clear wording or simple sentences. [Make] it so rudimentary that you can't miss it…The more specific you are, the better it is.”"

      "title": "Recite an incantation.",
      "content": "Recite an incantation. For each spell, write a short verse describing your wish and asking it to be granted. It doesn't have to rhyme, but rhymes, alliteration, cadence, and other poetic structures help with focus and memorization. Speak the incantation clearly and confidently while you visualize. Think of your incantation as a verbal statement of your intention. Whether your ritual is for celebration, petitioning deities for help, or casting your own spell, your incantation declares the purpose of your work. [7] X Research source You’re welcome to recite prewritten incantations from other spellcasters or texts, but creating your own is the best way to personalize the spell and make sure it works for you and your needs."

      "title": "Perform a ritual act to put your intention into motion.",
      "content": "Perform a ritual act to put your intention into motion. A good spell will have some element of “casting off” an item to represent your will going out into the universe. There are many ways to do this, depending on the nature of your spell and the outcome you hope for. Some common ritual acts that may work for you include: Tearing or burning a piece of paper with your wish (or a symbol representing your wish) written on it. Throwing away a stone or another symbolic object. Snuffing out a candle or letting it burn down completely. Pouring out or drinking a potion. Reenacting or reading scenes from mythology or ancient poems. [8] X Research source Chanting, singing, dancing, or performing other special or meaningful gestures."

      "title": "Give thanks and clean up.",
      "content": "Give thanks and clean up. Say thank you to any specific deity you invoked. Ground your excess energy by visualizing it flowing into the earth. Undraw your circle, if necessary, and dismantle your altar if you aren't going to use it again. Gather up your tools and leave the space. Your spell is finished. Consider doing something mundane, like having something to eat, to center yourself. [9] X Research source If you have a dedicated ritual space in your home, feel free to leave your altar in place (although you may want to store your ceremonial items to show them reverence and keep them safe)."

      "title": "Calling on higher powers or deities",
      "content": "Calling on higher powers or deities Different occultists call on all sorts of different deities and religious figures to work their magic. Find a system of spiritual symbolism that works for you, and invoke those characters in your spells. Just be careful—some of these spirits have ideas of their own and can twist your intentions if you can't control them. For example, the Triple Goddess and the Horned God represent humankind’s connection to nature and are often invoked in Wiccan rituals. [10] X Research source Mythological deities like Zeus, Athena, or Ares may also be called on. Keep in mind that you don’t have to necessarily believe that the deity really exists. Some practitioners invoke them to channel their energy or to represent the universe as a whole."

      "title": "Consulting the heavens",
      "content": "Consulting the heavens Many magicians consider the phases of the moon, the time of day, and other astrological configurations to be of great significance in the effectiveness of any spell. For instance, McVey suggests that a spell seeking some kind of new beginning could be cast during a new moon so that your wish can come to fruition as the moon becomes full. Some occult research will help you figure out how to optimize the timing of your spells. The moon is very special in many magical practices, and many witches track its position and phase daily: [11] X Research source The moon spends 2 to 3 days in each zodiac sign, and its energy is impacted by the characteristics of each sign. The new moon is a time for renewal and starting new projects. A waxing (growing) moon is a time to build momentum and gather abundance or wealth. The full moon is a time of intense energy. A waning (shrinking) moon is a time to recharge and finish existing projects."

      "content": "Choosing important colors Colors have different meanings in different magical systems. Once you look up their significance, pick one or two colors that match your intention and use colored candles , crystals, or other important or sacred objects to involve them in your spells. Red symbolizes passion, courage, strength, and intense emotions. [12] X Research source Orange: represents energy, attraction, vitality, and stimulation. Yellow: encompasses intellect, inspiration, imagination, and knowledge. Green: symbolizes abundance, growth, wealth, renewal, and balance. Blue: resonates with peace, truth, wisdom, protection, and patience. Purple or violet: represents spirituality, wisdom, devotion, peace, and idealism. Pink: encompasses affection, friendship, companionship, and spiritual healing. White: symbolizes peace, innocence, illumination, and purity. Black: represents dignity, force, stability, and protection."

      "content": "Including natural objects in your ritual or altar Use items like herbs, oils, stones, and other meaningful objects you find in nature. For expert occultists, all these items have some sort of magical significance or ability to help you focus and channel your energy. Go to your local New Age store to pick up materials that will give power to your spells. Here are a few examples of natural ritual items you might use and what they symbolize, but their meaning to you is what’s ultimately important (and remember, you can use just about any object you find as long as you take it with gratitude and respect for nature): A stone, cup of water, candle, and feather to represent the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air, respectively). [13] X Research source Herbs for love (basil, cardamom), wealth (mandrake, vervain), happiness (lavender, orange peel), or protection (pine needles, sandalwood). [14] X Research source Wood or branches to symbolize life, vitality, or healing. Water to represent cleansing, life, or purity."

      "content": "Find a shell in shallow water. Take it, and dry it well. This is a simple magic spell to make a general good wish come true. Use it to put your intention out into the universe by calling on the power of the waters and the moon. [15] X Research source Sea shells are common ritual objects in spellcasting. They’re used for cleansing and protection, representing deities like the goddesses Aphrodite and Yemaya, attracting wealth and abundance, or even gaining insight into the future.

You can draw your own symbol, or you can look up different symbols that are related to your area of desire (love, family, health, success, and so on). Draw it on the surface of the shell with chalk, charcoal, or something else that will wash off in the water. For example, if you wish to attract love into your life, you might draw a heart, a swan, or Cupid’s arrow."

      "content": "Place the shell at the edge of the ocean or lake shore at night. Set it in a spot where the waves will eventually wash over the shell when the tide comes in. The symbol on the shell should be facing upwards—towards the moon. Note the phase of the moon when you do this. Use the waxing moon if you wish to gain something and the waning moon if you wish to get rid of or release something, like negative energy or a toxic connection to someone. McVey explains that if you’re releasing something negative, you need to “replace it with something positive. Now you have a big empty space in your head and in yourself. So, you want to have something good to fill it with.”"

      "content": "Draw a triangle in the sand. Your shell should be in the center of the triangle. Meaningful phrases and words may be drawn into the sand as well, as long as they are in the triangle. Alternatively, you can write these directly onto the shell. McVey explains that “You could write [what you want to release] in the sand, and then the waves will wash it away.”"

      "title": "Spells project your intention into the universe to achieve a certain result.",
      "content": "Spells project your intention into the universe to achieve a certain result. Casting a spell is all about directing your mental energies toward a goal—setting an intention and exerting effort to support it are the core components of the work. [17] X Research source Whether or not something supernatural occurs because of your spell, stating your goal clearly and in a ritualized way can help you focus, give you confidence, and make you work harder to make it happen. McVey emphasizes that the more you believe in the power of your spell, the more likely it is to have a positive effect on you. Technically speaking, religious rituals like prayer (which require an intention and focus) could also be considered spells."

      "title": "Spells “go wrong” when your intention manifests in unexpected ways.",
      "content": "Spells “go wrong” when your intention manifests in unexpected ways. Unlike magic in the movies, you won’t risk summoning evil monsters or cursing a friend if something doesn’t go right. Often, it just means your intention wasn’t specific enough or was worded in a strange way. McVey jokes that if you cast a spell “to ask for Mr. Right, you might get Mr. Wright. It’ll actually literally be the person’s name.” Other times, you may be limiting yourself by only envisioning certain paths forward to reach your goal. For example, if you’re casting a spell to find a new job but only have one specific job search site in mind, you’re not projecting all possible options into the universe."

      "content": "There are different ways to cast spells based on your desire or practice. Basically, any ritual that allows you to focus on your intention and symbolically put it into motion counts as a spell (for some, just meditating on a desire can be considered casting a spell). Here are some common ways practitioners cast their spells, but this is in no way an exhaustive list—anything you do that feels intentional and makes you believe in your personal power will work: [18] X Research source Invoke higher powers or deity (ceremonial magic). Use natural elements like plants, crystals, or the stars and moon (natural or lunar magic). Use symbols to represent your desire or outcome (sigil magic). Work with the properties of the four elements: air, fire, water, and earth (elemental magic). Use or work with amulets or cleansing rituals to ward off negativity (protection magic). Read tarot cards or runes to predict the future or find insight into the past (divination magic)."
