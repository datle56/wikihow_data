      "title": "Reflect on your past work experiences to give a specific example.",
      "content": "Reflect on your past work experiences to give a specific example. Think about the times when you failed or didn’t perform as well as you expected. Maybe you submitted a project late because you couldn’t manage your time efficiently or maybe you missed a small detail that created more work for your team. Make a list of the skills and qualities that you want to work on so you can develop a concrete example for your interview. [1] X Research source Employers are looking for honest answers that demonstrate self-awareness, so avoid mentioning clichés, such as saying you’re a workaholic or a perfectionist. [2] X Research source If you don’t have work experience, reflect on your personal or academic memories. Extracurricular activities, academic programs, and side projects are valuable experiences that can help you develop an answer. Think of areas where you’re just “average” if you can’t come up with a major weakness. For instance, you might mention that you can speak up during meetings, but you want to improve your communication skills further to lead a project."

      "title": "Mention an area of improvement that is easily correctable.",
      "content": "Mention an area of improvement that is easily correctable. To appear as qualified as possible, choose a skill or quality that isn’t core to the job’s responsibility. Employers know that certain skills can be fixed through training and commitment, but others are essential for performance success. Before crafting a response, reread the job description so you know which hard or soft skills to avoid mentioning. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, if you’re a copywriter, you might mention having some difficulty with data and analytics—instead of a weakness like brainstorming ideas or creating copy. Or, if you’re applying for a web designer role, you might mention having some trouble speaking up at meetings—instead of technical skills like HTML or JavaScript."

    {
      "title": "Explain the steps you’re taking to improve in those areas.",
      "content": "Explain the steps you’re taking to improve in those areas. After providing a specific area of improvement, quickly follow up by explaining how you’re trying to improve your skills. Mention any courses or certifications that you’re working on (or have completed) to demonstrate accountability and determination. Employers seek candidates who are self-starting, so mentioning these tangible steps may increase your chances of getting a job offer. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, if you’re trying to improve your leadership skills, you might mention that you’re enrolled in an online leadership program, attending seminars every month, and reading self-help books. If you’re not taking classes to improve your skills, state specific techniques or strategies that you’re implementing instead. For instance, you could say that you’re practicing active listening to improve your communication skills in the workplace."

      "title": "Keep your answer short and sweet.",
      "content": "Keep your answer short and sweet. As a general rule, keep your response under 2 minutes and hit the most relevant points to stay on track. If you tend to ramble, break up the question into 4 parts to help you manage your time: state the area of improvement, how it has affected you in the past, how you have learned to address it, and how you are currently working on it. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Try to tie your actions back to key performance indicators (KPIs), such as improving customer retention, boosting sales by a specific percentage, or increasing overall efficiency. For instance, you might say that you struggle with time management and that has previously caused you to turn in assignments late. Then, you could describe how you worked with your former supervisor to come up with a solution, and you now plan out your schedule every morning to manage your time efficiently. Set up a mock interview with a friend, family member, or career counselor to practice answering concisely and confidently."

      "title": "Maintain a positive tone when you answer.",
      "content": "Maintain a positive tone when you answer. While it might seem like the answer to this question has to be negative, it’s actually the perfect opportunity to highlight your potential. Interviewers are looking for a willingness to improve, so focus on transforming your “negative” trait into a positive. Highlight the steps you are taking to advance in your career, and express excitement about the results you hope to see (or have already seen). [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source If you haven’t seen any results from your efforts, express excitement for what you hope to learn in the position and try to tie it back to your personal career goals. For instance, you might say, “One of my career goals is to take a leadership position in my organization, so I want to improve my skills in this area. Although I haven’t gotten to lead large groups before, I am excited to learn effective ways to motivate people in my team with this position.”"

      "content": "Organization skills I believe I can improve my organization skills. When I’m handling multiple tasks at the same time, I find that I can get a little overwhelmed and scatter-brained, which can lead to other projects falling behind schedule. To address this, I have learned to organize my schedule by taking meticulous notes and constantly updating my agenda. I have also been working on setting more specific goals and working on them in order of importance."

      "title": "Public speaking",
      "content": "Public speaking One area I would like to improve on is my public speaking skills. In the past, my colleagues would do the majority of speaking during presentations, but they would sometimes forget to include details that were imperative to the project. Because of this, I am currently enrolled in a speech class at my local community college, and I am performing 2-3 speeches every week in front of a packed auditorium. I’ve already seen an improvement in the clarity of my speech, but I am hoping to improve my cadence and volume."

      "title": "Self-esteem",
      "content": "Self-esteem In the past, I have lacked confidence in my decision-making skills, so I would often ask multiple friends and co-workers for their opinions before making a decision. While I believe asking for a second opinion can give you a fresh perspective and spark creative ideas, my behavior did cause me to turn in some of my assignments late. As a result, I try to spend substantial time on research to make sure my work is supported, and I only ask 2 people for their advice when it comes to making super important decisions."

      "title": "Leadership",
      "content": "Leadership I would love to improve my leadership skills and formally lead a team. In my previous position, I received an opportunity to head a small project of interns, and I noticed my feedback was not helpful to the majority of the team. Since then, I have taken courses on how to give constructive criticism and approach problems with empathy. I have noticed improvements, but I believe I still have more I can work on before I’m ready to take on a larger team."

      "content": "Proofreading While I am confident in my writing ability, I do struggle with editing my own work sometimes, especially if there’s an upcoming deadline. Now, I ask a colleague to proofread before I submit anything to avoid mistakes, but I’m looking at taking writing classes to improve my editing skills and work more efficiently."

      "title": "Communication",
      "content": "Communication Although my career revolves around research, I believe it’s even more important to communicate my findings to the public. If I can’t explain what I’ve discovered in the lab to a general audience, my work provides very little purpose. A few months ago, I took a science communication course so I could learn how to express scientific concepts in simpler terms. Within weeks of completing the course, I raised double the amount of funding than prior years, so I am always looking for ways to improve my communication skills. Currently, I am focused on audience engagement, and I plan to attend a seminar for this skill next month."

      "content": "Employers ask this question to gauge your skills and personality. In job interviews, hiring managers want to know if you’re self-aware, accountable, and easy to train. Your answer to the question, “What areas need improvement?” is an easy way for them to see if you are a good fit for the company and if you can excel in the role. Hiring managers are often seeking responses that show a willingness in terms of professional growth to ensure success.
