      "content": "Their activity may boost your anxiety, but it's likely nothing to worry about. If you’re worried your partner will cheat on you, these feelings will likely be exacerbated by seeing them talk to other people online, reading comments others have left on their posts, or scrolling through the list of people they’re following. The only way not to read into their online interactions and who they’re following is by avoiding their social media. [1] X Research source This doesn’t mean not following your partner on social media or not keeping up with what they post; just try not to obsess over it, don’t check up on who they’re following, and when you find yourself in a particularly anxious or insecure headspace, log off and do something to help you calm down, like taking a walk."

      "content": "Reading their texts is unlikely to help you overcome your anxiety. If you don't find something suspicious, it’s likely you’ll invent something to be suspicious about, simply because you’re already in an anxious, insecure headspace. Trust and let the phone owner have the freedom of doing what they want to on their phone. Relationships are built on trust. If your partner doesn’t know or consent to your looking at their phone, checking their texts and calls may form more of a gulf between you. Realize there’s a difference between secrecy and privacy. Your partner is entitled to privacy—but the more you pry into their private life, the more secretive they may act about it. If your partner does consent to you looking at their phone, still practice avoiding the temptation. Trusting your partner isn’t about being able to invade their privacy whenever you want; it’s about not feeling the urge to invade their privacy. Work on resisting that urge, and it’ll fade."

      "content": "Feeling distant from your partner may increase insecurity. Emotional intimacy is essential to maintaining a strong connection with your partner. If one or both of you has been busy or distracted lately, your intimacy level may drop and you may begin to feel unsure about where your relationship is going. To improve intimacy , take time for regular date nights and check-ins, and tell your partner you care about them at least a few times a week. [2] X Research source Emotional intimacy is about ensuring you and your partner both feel loved, seen, and understood in the relationship. You can increase emotional intimacy by having weekly date nights, trying new things together (like a cooking class or vacationing), or taking time every evening to talk about your day. [3] X Expert Source Tara Vossenkemper, PhD, LPC Licensed Professional Counselor Expert Interview. 27 October 2021. For many—but not all—couples, sex is an important aspect of a relationship and it fosters emotional intimacy; if sex brings you and your partner closer together, having sex regularly may make you feel more secure about the relationship."

      "title": "Be intentional about your appearance—not just for them, but for you.",
      "content": "Be intentional about your appearance—not just for them, but for you. If you’re with someone long-term, it’s pretty much guaranteed you’ll both change a lot on the outside. But whether you’ve been together a week or a decade, feeling insecure about your appearance can leave you feeling unsure about your partner’s attraction to you. Taking time to be more intentional about your looks can make you feel more attractive —which will, ironically, make you more attractive to your partner as well. [4] X Research source “Maintaining attraction” doesn’t mean trying to change your appearance to look how you think your partner wants—it just means being well-groomed and clean, picking out your clothes with care, and looking ways that make you feel good about yourself. Take a shower every day, brush your teeth and floss multiple times a day, chew gum so you have fresh breath, etc."

      "title": "Make sure you and your partner define \"cheating\" the same way.",
      "content": "Make sure you and your partner define \"cheating\" the same way. Infidelity, broadly speaking, involves any behavior your partner would consider a betrayal to your relationship. Beyond that, everyone defines cheating differently: is it “liking” a friend’s thirst trap on social media? Is it texting an ex without your partner’s knowledge? Some people are perfectly comfortable with all of these behaviors, while others aren’t. Discuss your expectations so that you both know where “the line” is and are both comfortable with the boundaries you set in place. Realize that the conversation around boundaries is one that you’ll likely keep having as your relationship goes along, and your feelings about what’s considered “cheating” may change over time. What’s important is to keep communicating your feelings with your partner. Reader Poll: We asked 199 wikiHow readers if they consider their partner cheating on them a dealbreaker, and 70% said yes .

Remember that everyone has anxious thoughts from time to time, and you don’t need to act on them. Laughter is the best medicine: throw on your favorite comedy movie or watch a stand-up routine.

      "content": "Realize your worth, independent of the relationship. If you’re unable to shake your fears of being cheated on, remember that your worth doesn’t depend on your relationship status. Take time to do things that make you feel confident about yourself—things that you feel passionate about and that you loved before you ever even met your partner. This may help you feel more independent. [7] X Research source For some people, adultery is so scary because it feels like the end of the world. Thinking about how you would move forward after a betrayal may actually help the anxiety take up less space in your mind. It may be helpful to accept the reality that you could be hurt by your partner—and that you’ll still be OK. Remember that if your partner does cheat, it says more about them than about you. It’s not a failing on your part when someone you love betrays you."

      "content": "A professional counselor may help you address your anxieties. If you’re having trouble getting over your concerns about being cheated on, it may help to speak with a licensed therapist . They can help you unpack your fears and maybe pinpoint the root of your anxiety, whether it’s really founded in your partner’s behavior or in past experiences. Private therapy can help you address your feelings, but couples therapy may be beneficial as well: you won’t just get the opportunity to discuss and work on your insecurities, but to discuss them openly with your partner. They likely want to reassure you and help you overcome your fears."
