      "title": "Speak to an experienced breeder.",
      "content": "Speak to an experienced breeder. The best way to find out what you’re in for if you breed Shih Tzus is to interview an experienced Shih Tzu breeder, or another Shih Tzu expert. Breeders can tell you firsthand what to expect from the experience, what troubles might arise, and what mistakes you should avoid. The American Shih Tzu Club has several breeder referral volunteers who can be contacted for advice about the breed as well as contact information for Shih Tzu breeders."

      "content": "Make sure you can commit the time to breeding. Raising an average litter requires at least 130 hours of a breeder’s time, and may require days off work and sleepless nights. Make sure that you are ready to commit the time and personal effort required to care for both puppies and their mother throughout the process of breeding; remember that a mother can’t be left alone during the process of whelping (i.e. giving birth), and that newborn puppies require daily care and checking. Feeding and socializing the puppies, cleaning, paperwork, and interviewing buyers will all require long periods of your time as well."

      "title": "Budget properly.",
      "content": "Budget properly. Before going into dog breeding, you should know that it is not a money-making endeavor. Good breeders prioritize the good of the breed and the welfare of their puppies over profit - as such, the process may not offer a large return. Costs include food, health care and vaccinations, facilities, documents for proof of quality, advertising, and stud fees (if applicable)."

      "title": "Be prepared for the worst.",
      "content": "Be prepared for the worst. First time breeders don’t have established reputations or references and run the risk of not selling their puppies. Ask yourself what you will do if your puppies don’t sell, and if you are willing to care for them on a long-term basis if they don’t. While unscrupulous breeders often get rid of puppies that don’t sell, or sell them to laboratories or other undesirable buyers, good breeders will accept the liability. You should also be prepared, financially and mentally, for the possibility of having unhealthy puppies in your litter."

      "content": "Make sure that both Shih Tzus are healthy. You must make sure that both the female (dam) and male (sire) are healthy and genetically fit for breeding, and that their vaccinations are current. Testing should be done for conditions that the Shih Tzu breed is prone to, such as heritable eye diseases, Hip Dysplasia, Renal Dysplasia, thyroid disorders, and hearing loss. Once a dog is cleared of one of these conditions, it can be registered with the appropriate registry (e.g. once a dog is tested and cleared of heritable eye diseases, it can be registered with the local Canine Eye Registry).

      "content": "Make sure your female Shih Tzu is ready for breeding. Ideally, your Shih Tzu should have her first litter after her second heat cycle but before she's reached the age of 4. Because of health risks, dogs older than 7 should not be bred. Female Shih Tzus stay in heat (i.e. the period in a dog’s reproductive cycle when she is receptive to mating) for approximately 16 days, but are usually not receptive to males on the first day of this period. [3] X Research source If a female is not ready to mate, she will run from or avoid a male; if she is ready, she will stay and move her tail to the side to signal her readiness."

Remember that, as a general rule, a male should be smaller than the female Shih Tzu it breeds with by a pound or two. It should also complement your female Shih Tzu in terms of attributes and qualities, and offer genetic strengths that will result in strong, quality offspring (e.g. a good coat).

Stud fees can run between $250-$1000, depending on the quality of the male. but some contracts will outline other forms of payment to the stud's owner (e.g. the pick of the litter in lieu of cash payment).

Depending on the details of your agreement with the stud's owner, you can either go back for breeding visits as scheduled, or leave the female in the custody of the stud owner during the breeding period. Make sure that all such terms are outlined before the process begins. [6] X Research source"
