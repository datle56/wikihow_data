      "title": "Read up on the history of Juneteenth.",
      "content": "Read up on the history of Juneteenth. If you’re not familiar with Juneteenth, then take some time to learn more about why it’s important to Black Americans. After the Civil War ended in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation to free slaves in America. However, it wasn’t until 2 years later on June 19th, 1865 that Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas and enforced the new law. Since then, Black Americans have celebrated Juneteenth to commemorate the day. [1] X Research source Texas made Juneteenth into an official holiday in 1979, but it became a national holiday in 2021. Remember that American history as taught in schools tends to be highly whitewashed, ignoring crucial aspects of Black culture. Just because you've learned history doesn't mean your knowledge is complete."

      "content": "Attend a local Juneteenth celebration. If a friend invites you to a Juneteenth barbecue or get-together they’re having, then show up and let them lead the celebrations. Otherwise, many cities now host free Juneteenth events that are open to the public. Search the name of your city with “Juneteenth” to find events that are happening in your area. [2] X Research source If you can’t find any celebrations happening near you, then search online for virtual activities, such as livestreams of speeches, performances, and other Juneteenth festivities."

      "content": "Shop or eat at Black-owned businesses. Treat yourself with a shopping spree at independent Black-owned shops, or buy from brands that center around Black creators and designers. When you’re hungry, eat out and give money to a Black-owned restaurant to show them your support. [3] X Research source Use websites like The Black Directory , Black-Owned Association (BOA) , and EatOkra to find small businesses in your area. If you’re on a budget, then don’t worry! Just promote the businesses you find to your friends and family on social media to bring in customers."

      "title": "Consume Black media and art.",
      "content": "Consume Black media and art. Rather than watching or listening to the same things you normally would, show your support for Black creators and further educate yourself in the process. Look for Black voices when you’re listening to music or podcasts, watching movies and shows, and reading books. Check Spotify, Apple Music, or Tidal for curated Juneteenth playlists to listen to Black artists. Look for podcasts like 1619 , Historically Black , Code Switch , Justice in America , and The Breakdown with Shaun King . Movies and TV shows that center Black voices include Selma , Moonlight , Judas and the Black Messiah , 13th , Atlanta , Dear White People , and Black-ish . Some books on Black history you can read include Rooted by Brea Baker, Four Hundred Souls by Ibram X. Kendi and Keisha N. Blain, The Warmth of Other Suns by Isabel Wilkerson, and The 1619 Project by Nikole Hannah-Jones."

      "content": "Visit a Black museum or cultural institution. Use the BlackPast directory to find Black history museums in your area. Take your time walking through the exhibits to read about the history and culture of Black people in America. Many museums also offer interactive presentations, lectures, and performances on Juneteenth designed to educate audiences in a fun and interesting way. [4] X Research source If there are no museums specifically for Black history in your area, check if any other history museums have exhibits you could check out."

      "title": "Listen to and share perspectives from Black voices.",
      "content": "Listen to and share perspectives from Black voices. While Juneteenth is a federal holiday, remember that it doesn't belong to you as an ally. Take a step back and commit to listening more than you speak. Make space for Black voices, and ask your BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) friends what they need from you as you work to create change in society. [5] X Research source Instead of making your own Juneteenth social media post, look for pages or accounts run by members of the Black community to see their perspectives. Repost what they have to say on the holiday so that your friends or follower base can learn more. Be aware of the spaces you're taking up. Juneteenth is a holiday made by and for Black Americans. It’s important for all Americans to recognize it, but that doesn't mean you should start attaching new meanings or adding your own celebratory elements to the holiday."

      "content": "Donate your time or money to an organization supporting Black communities. Juneteenth is a great time to give back any extra resources you have to charities or organizations fighting for racial equality and support. If you're strapped for cash at the moment, search for volunteer opportunities at local organizations instead. Some organizations that are great to donate to include: [6] X Research source National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) United Negro College Fund (UNCF) National Black Child Development Institute (NBCDI) The Loveland Foundation Black Lives Matter (BLM) The Okra Project The Marsha P.

      "content": "Encourage Juneteenth celebrations within your community. Attend meetings for city hall, your neighborhood association, or school board and speak up about wanting Juneteenth celebrations. Urge the leaders in your community to recognize the holiday with informative displays or events to help other people learn more about the history of the holiday. [7] X Research source Try to attend meetings throughout the year so you can mention Juneteenth to your community before the actual holiday. That way, they are more likely to hold a celebration because they have time to prepare."

      "title": "Reflect on your own actions and beliefs.",
      "content": "Reflect on your own actions and beliefs. As you familiarize yourself with Juneteenth and learn more about America's long history of racism, it's important to examine your own behavior and mindset. Take a moment to acknowledge your role (both personally and as part of a larger ethnic group) in continuing racial prejudice in America. Take steps to identify and correct any racist or harmful practices in your daily life. [9] X Research source It's important to recognize that you were born into some biases about race as someone who isn't Black. It can be tough to unlearn them, but by keeping an open mind and listening to different perspectives, it’s possible to challenge any negative beliefs you have."

      "title": "Speak up when you hear racist or derogatory language.",
      "content": "Speak up when you hear racist or derogatory language. If your friends or family members have misinformed views or say hateful things, stand up for what you believe in. Don’t be afraid to speak up and challenge beliefs that other people have if it means doing the right thing. [10] X Research source Example : If you hear someone say a racist comment, you could say, “That’s extremely hurtful,” or “Those types of comments are not okay.” If you want to engage in a deeper conversation, ask the person “What are you basing that comment on?” or “Can you tell me more about that?” If you have relatives and friends who may be ignorant of Juneteenth and its importance, share your research materials with them and educate them in turn."

      "content": "Attend protests and encourage lawmakers to enact change. Take action and speak out against discrimination and oppression wherever you see it. Use your privilege as someone who is non-BIPOC to speak out for equality. Go to protests to fight for change with your community, or contact your representatives and voice your support for anti-racist laws. [11] X Research source When you’re voting, be sure to check the candidate’s stances on racism and vote for people who have anti-racist platforms. Attend school board meetings and urge them to teach Black history and inclusive curriculums."

      "title": "Be an active ally throughout the year.",
      "content": "Be an active ally throughout the year. Keep supporting the Black community and fight for social justice even after Juneteenth is over. Stay mindful about how you treat other people, what media you consume, and where you shop, and make it a point to elevate BIPOC voices around you. Continue learning and educating yourself on different perspectives of the world so you can be a genuine ally. If you aren’t acting like an ally throughout the year, then it may seem like you’re not being authentic. Showing support one day but not changing your long-term behavior could be seen as being performative or a form of virtue signaling."

      "title": "There’s debate whether or not you should say “Happy Juneteenth.”",
      "content": "There’s debate whether or not you should say “Happy Juneteenth.” On one hand, wishing a happy Juneteenth shows that you recognize the day’s importance and are there to support Black voices. However, some Black Americans have mentioned that it feels inappropriate for non-BIPOC people to wish them a happy Juneteenth due to the painful history behind it. [12] X Research source When in doubt, saying “Happy Juneteenth” to a good friend or acquaintance is usually OK, but it’s best to avoid saying it to a stranger or distant friend."
