      "title": "Submerge the latex in lukewarm soapy water.",
      "content": "Submerge the latex in lukewarm soapy water. Fill a deep sink or bathtub with lukewarm water, and add a small amount of a gentle soap, such as baby soap or mild shampoo. Swish your hands in the water until suds form, then place your latex clothes into it. Swirl the garments around until they're soaking wet. This helps remove talc, sweat, and any lubricant you might have used to slide the latex clothing on. Don’t put latex clothing in the washing machine or send it to the dry cleaner. Both of these cleaning processes can damage the material."

      "content": "Rinse the latex in clean water to remove the soap. Drain the soapy water out of the sink or tub and rinse out any leftover residue. Next, fill the sink or tub with fresh lukewarm water and swish the clothes around again to rinse off all the soap."

      "title": "Let your latex clothing air dry.",
      "content": "Let your latex clothing air dry. First, lift the item out of the water and squeeze it gently to remove some of the excess water. Next, hang the item up and allow it to drip dry, or lay it out to dry on a clean towel. [1] X Research source If you’re hanging the item to dry, place a bucket underneath it to catch the water that will drip, or hang it in the shower or tub. Wait until the latex is completely dry before storing it. Don’t tumble dry or iron latex clothing—the heat can damage and melt the latex, and it will weaken the material so it wears out faster.

      "title": "Rub silicone-based lubricant or latex polish on the item to get a great shine.",
      "content": "Rub silicone-based lubricant or latex polish on the item to get a great shine. If you're using a squeeze gel, squirt a coin-sized amount onto your fingers and rub the product into the latex. If you're using a spray, spritz the latex and then rub it in until the garment is shiny. [3] X Research source Wait to polish your latex clothes until you're ready to wear them. If you'll be storing them for a while, keep them coated with talcum powder. Don't use an oil-based lubricant to polish the silicone because it can break down the latex. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wipe a lint-free cloth over the latex if you want a buffed look.",
      "content": "Wipe a lint-free cloth over the latex if you want a buffed look. If you're not going for a super shiny look, rub a dry lint-free cloth over the polished latex to take off some of the shine. Keep rubbing in a circular motion until the latex is as matte as you like.

    {
      "title": "Rub cornstarch or talcum powder over the entire latex garment.",
      "content": "Rub cornstarch or talcum powder over the entire latex garment. Once your latex clothing is completely dry, lay it flat and sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder evenly across the entire surface to prevent it from sticking. [6] X Research source Use your dry hands to rub the powder over the garment. Then, flip it over and sprinkle the other side. Baking soda or tapioca starch should work, as well. Don't forget to sprinkle powder inside the garment, too! When you’re ready to wear the latex item, simply remove the powder with a damp cloth, then polish your latex as normal."

      "title": "Put latex clothes into a garment bag and store them in a dry place.",
      "content": "Put latex clothes into a garment bag and store them in a dry place. After letting your latex clothes dry completely and rubbing talcum powder or cornstarch onto them, place the clothing item into a clean plastic bag or a garment bag. Hang the garment bag in your closet, or store it in a drawer until you're ready to wear your latex. [7] X Research source Keep latex clothing away from heaters and damp spaces to avoid damage. Don't store latex in direct sunlight. UV rays can discolor the latex and cause it to break down faster. Don't hang colorful latex next to other colorful latex on the same hanger, as the colors can bleed together if they're too close."

      "title": "Keep latex clothing away from direct sunlight and heat.",
      "content": "Keep latex clothing away from direct sunlight and heat. Although you can wear latex clothes out on a hot, sunny day, you don't want to expose the latex to these conditions for a long period of time. This is because the latex can fade and start to break down. Since latex burns and melts really easily, you should also keep it away from open flames or fire. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid contact with oil or grease.",
      "content": "Avoid contact with oil or grease. These substances can break down and damage latex, causing your clothing to wear out faster. To keep your latex item looking as fresh and new as possible, take extra care not to get any oil from food, makeup, or cars onto it."

      "title": "Avoid contact with metals.",
      "content": "Avoid contact with metals. Copper, brass, and bronze can easily stain and discolor latex. [9] X Research source To avoid damage, keep your latex clothes far away from hangers, jewelry, and coins (such as pennies) that are made from these metals. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Handle your latex clothing gently, and avoid sharp objects. Latex can get punctured when it comes in context with sharp things like long fingernails, clasps, hooks, and zippers. To avoid poking a hole or ripping your latex clothing, try to avoid contact with sharp objects, and handle the garment with care while washing it or putting it on."
