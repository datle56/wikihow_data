      "content": "Take the right courses in high school. If you want to become a meteorologist, start preparing in high school. Take advanced math and science courses. Many schools offer AP courses that can transfer into college credit. Take calculus, physics, chemistry, and earth science. Hone your writing skills in English classes. Being a scientist means writing research papers and lab reports. If you become a meteorologist on a television station, you will have to communicate clearly. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Obtain a bachelor's degree in science.",
      "content": "Obtain a bachelor's degree in science. Meteorologists receive a bachelor's of science degree in meteorology or atmospheric sciences. In college, you will take math and science classes, such as calculus, physics, dynamics, synoptics, and some computer programming courses. [3] X Research source Some meteorologists receive degrees which combine meteorology with other scientific fields, such as chemistry, geology, oceanography, physics, or statistics. It may be beneficial to take computer science classes during your degrees, too. [4] X Research source If you want to be a TV meteorologist, take classes in journalism, speech, or other media-related fields. If you want to start working for the government right after your bachelor's degree, you will have to have completed courses which fall under strict guidelines. [5] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source You must have at least 24 credit hours of atmospheric science or meteorology."

      "title": "Get a graduate degree.",
      "content": "Get a graduate degree. Depending on the job you want, you may need to get a master's or Ph.D. Most meteorologists get degrees in related, interdisciplinary subjects. Some even get two master's in different sciences. Some graduate degree programs encourage bachelor's in a field like math or computer science instead of meteorology. Many higher level positions require at least a master's. If you want to do research, you will need a Ph.D. [6] X Research source There are about 100 undergraduate and graduate programs for meteorology."

      "title": "Get an internship.",
      "content": "Get an internship. A good way to get experience at any point during your schooling - whether it's in high school, your bachelor's, or your graduate work - is to become an intern. Look for internships with local meteorologists. This will give you valuable hands on experience that can be put on applications and CVs. [7] X Research source If you can't get an internship, see if you can shadow them."

      "title": "Determine the type of meteorology you're interested in pursuing.",
      "content": "Determine the type of meteorology you're interested in pursuing. In addition to forecasting the weather, meteorologists study the characteristics and processes of the atmosphere and how they affect the environment and evolve. They also study climate and climate changes. There are many different kinds of meteorologists. An operational meteorologist is responsible for forecasting the weather. A climatologist gathers and examines the seasonal changes that occur over time such as months or years. A physical meteorologist conducts research on the atmosphere and different physical properties. A synoptic meteorologist uses mathematical models and creates different tools such as software for forecasting weather. An environmental meteorologist studies problems like air pollution that affects the Earth's atmosphere. [8] X Research source Not sure what type of meteorologist you should be? Ask a former teacher, professor, employer, or adviser what they think youâ€™d excel in."

      "title": "Decide where you want to work.",
      "content": "Decide where you want to work. There are multiple places you can find jobs in meteorology. Each kind of work requires slightly different backgrounds, but graduate degrees can help you have a better chance getting jobs and receiving promotions. [9] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source You can work for government agencies, such as the Department of Defense, NASA, NOAA, or the National Weather Service. You can work for a television station, such as a local news network, a national network like CNN, Fox News, or MSNBC, or for The Weather Channel. You can also find work in the private sector. Many companies pay meteorologists to help figure out how climate and weather patterns will affect their business. Meteorologists can also get jobs dealing with agriculture or air pollution. [10] X Research source Airlines use weather forecasters to help them plan flights. Shipping and insurance companies may also hire meteorological consultants. [11] X Research source You may also be interested in being a forensic meteorologist. This job provides meteorological information, data, and consulting for legal cases."

      "title": "Get certified.",
      "content": "Get certified. The American Meteorological Society offers certification programs for certain specializations and areas of interest for meteorologists. Some of these programs include broadcasting and consulting. The American Meteorological Society offers Certified Broadcast Meteorologist credentials for meteorologists working in radio and television. The certification requires you to have a bachelor's degree in meteorology and you need to submit examples of your work to qualify. You must then pass an examination."

      "title": "Get any needed training.",
      "content": "Get any needed training. Some organizations require you to get training upon employment. For example, the National Weather Service requires employees to complete 200 hours of on-the-job training per year for 2 years. [12] X Research source Be prepared to receive more training and experience if you plan to obtain an entry-level position working for the federal government. The federal government typically places you in intern positions where you work in different offices learning about forecasting and weather systems. You're assigned to a duty station once the training is complete."
