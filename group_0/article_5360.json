You must multiply by 100 at the end to express the value as a percentage. [2] X Research source Write the equation at the beginning of every problem: mass percent = (mass of chemical/total mass of compound) x 100 . Both of the values should be in grams so that they cancel each other out once you solve the equation. The mass of the chemical you’re interested in is the mass given in the problem. If the mass isn’t given, refer to the following section about solving for mass percent when the mass is not given. The total mass of the compound is calculated by summing the masses of all of the chemicals used to make the compound or solution."

When you know the masses of all the elements or compounds being added together, you simply need to add them together to calculate the total mass of the final compound or solution. This will be the denominator in the mass percent calculation. [3] X Research source Example 1: What is the percent mass of 5g of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 100g of water? The total mass of the compound is the amount of sodium hydroxide plus the amount of water: 100g + 5g for a total mass of 105g. Example 2: What masses of sodium chloride and water are needed to make 175 g of a 15% solution? In this example, you are given the total mass and the percentage you want, but are asked to find the amount of solute to add to the solution. The total mass is 175 g."

[5] X Research source Example 1: (5/105) x 100 = 0.04761 x 100 = 4.761%. Thus, the mass percent of 5g of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 100g of water is 4.761%. Example 2: The rearranged equation to solve for mass of the chemical is (mass percent*total mass of the compound)/100: (15*175)/100 = (2625)/100 = 26.25 grams sodium chloride. The amount of water to be added is simply the total mass minus the mass of the chemical: 175 – 26.25 = 148.75 grams water."

The basic formula for mass percent of a compound is: mass percent = (molar mass of element/total molecular mass of compound) x 100. The molar mass of a compound is the amount of mass for one mole of an element while the molecular mass is the amount of mass for one mole of the entire compound. [6] X Research source You must multiply by 100 at the end to express the value as a percentage. [7] X Research source Write out the equation at the beginning of every problem: mass percent = (molar mass of element/total molecular mass of compound) x 100 . Both values have units of grams per mole (g/mol). This means the units will cancel each other out when you solve the equation. When you aren’t given masses, you can find the mass percent of an element within a compound using molar mass. Example 1: Find the mass percent of Hydrogen in a water molecule. Example 2: Find the mass percent of carbon in a glucose molecule."
