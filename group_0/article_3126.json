      "content": "Use simple, clear sentences to make your point. Good writers use clear, concise language. [1] X Research source They don't bog down sentences with extra words and long, winding sections. They cut to the chase and make their point in the simplest language possible. Sometimes it's best to break longer sentences into 2-3 smaller ones. Original Sentence: \"The philosophy of Existentialism resists descending into the lofty, theoretical arguments that plagued many early philosophies, and thus gains its power.\" \"Existentialism became powerful because, unlike earlier, more theoretical philosophies, it is grounded and practical.\" Original Sentence: \"Was the bomb not to ever come to being, America might never have overcome the long, drawn out war in the Pacific.\" \"Who knows how long the US would have had to fight in the Pacific without the bomb.\" Original Sentence: \"Wandering in the desolate wilderness, Dave sat on a dusty, crepuscular rock and thought about his past while drinking from his almost empty canteen.\" \"Tired of aimless wandering, Dave sat on a dusty boulder to rest. He opened his canteen, but there were only a few drops left. Tired and thirsty, his mind drifted to his past.\""

      "title": "Be as specific as possible.",
      "content": "Be as specific as possible. People are visual animals - we see things when we read and orient ourselves with images. Give your reader enough specifics to visualize your writing whether you're writing stories, scripts, or speeches. Use 1-2 powerful images or senses to put the reader in your scene, paragraph, or shoes. [2] X Research source I felt tired → \"My arms and muscles trembled, and my eyelids fluttered shut no matter how hard I tried to stay awake.\" Gina is a nice woman. → \"Gina was the kind of woman who baked you a plate of cookies (hot, gooey, smelling like home), just because you said you had a rough day.\" To him, the city was terrible. → \"He couldn't stand the city - the endless lights, the clatter of cars and pavement, the way all eyes turned downward when you looked at them as if you were the ugliest man in Manhattan and not just another stranger.\""

      "title": "Make connections to help your reader understand your ideas.",
      "content": "Make connections to help your reader understand your ideas. Comparing two things, either with a metaphor, simile, or direct comparison, helps your reader make connections and deepens your writing. It gives them something to hold onto that they already understand, which helps them understand your writing. You can even make connections to your own stories, like in the third example here: [3] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source \"In many ways he was like America itself, big and strong, full of good intentions, a roll of fat jiggling at his belly, slow of foot but always plodding along, always there when you needed him, a believer in the virtues of simplicity and directness and hard labor\" ( The Things They Carried, Tim O'Brien). \"Like the waters of the river, like the motorists on the highway, and like the yellow trains streaking down the Santa Fe tracks, drama, in the shape of exceptional happenings, had never stopped there\" ( In Cold Blood, Truman Capote). \"Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice\" ( One-Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez). “For poems are like rainbows; they escape you quickly\" ( The Big Sea, Langston Hughes)."

      "title": "Use adverbs and \"fillers\" sparingly.",
      "content": "Use adverbs and \"fillers\" sparingly. Adverbs, the words that end in -ly and modify actions, are the bane of many great writers. They give a sing-song feel to writing and bog down the meaning of a sentence in useless little modifications. Notice how, in most cases, the adverbs and filler words (like \"really\" or \"very\") don't add a lot to the sentences. [4] X Research source \"Jaime was really sorry, and ran quickly over to his friend's house just to apologize.\" \"What's up?\" She asked, happily. \"Nothing much,\" he answered tiredly. She picked her face absently and said, \"I wanted to talk about something.\" \"I don't have time,\" he responded curtly."

      "title": "Treat every paragraph, scene, and chapter like its own small argument.",
      "content": "Treat every paragraph, scene, and chapter like its own small argument. Great paragraphs should be self-contained. They have a beginning, middle, and end. Otherwise, they don't actually move the story or essay along. Thought of another way, every paragraph and scene should end in a different place than where it started. Ernest Hemingway was the master of economy. It is hard to find an extra paragraph or scene in any of his short stories or books. Great journalism is a good way to see how each smaller part pushes the story forward. Read your favorite newspaper, but stop after every paragraph -- what did it accomplish? Though not strictly a paragraph, Shakespearean monologues are a masterclass in growth and power in a short span. Listen to Hamlet's famous first monologue -- note how different he is in beginning and end."

      "title": "Break all of the previous rules when it feels right.",
      "content": "Break all of the previous rules when it feels right. Sometimes, the best way to get your point across is a long, winding sentence that packs in a multitude of meaning. Occasionally, you really do need adverbs and silly filler words to make a point perfectly. A direct point can be better than an indirect comparison. Sometimes a paragraph is there to provide tone, to slow down the pacing, or pause on a beautiful description, even if it \"accomplishes\" nothing."

      "title": "Write every day.",
      "content": "Write every day. Writing every day is the best way to improve your writing! You may prefer to write a new short scene every day, or work on a long-term, writing project. You might have a daily minimum of one paragraph, or an entire page. It doesn't matter what you write, just that you do it. When you're a beginner writer, it's best to establish a set time to write each day so you can get in the habit. As you become accustomed to writing every day, you might vary your writing schedule according to your needs. If you can't find room in your schedule, try getting up early or going to bed late, even if you can only spare fifteen minutes. It's wise to set writing goals early when starting a new piece and try your best to stick to them."

      "title": "Write your way through writer's block.",
      "content": "Write your way through writer's block. Don't be so afraid to write something \"bad\" that you end up staring at a blank document. Getting anything on the page at all can help you get started. Write about how you're stuck and can't think of something to write, or describe an object in the room in painfully exhaustive detail, or rant about something that irritates you. A few minutes of this will often put you in \"writing mode\" and lead you to another idea. Look online, in bookstores, or in libraries for collections of writing prompts. These are designed to give you a starting point to work from, and are often ridiculous to spark your imagination and get you started."

    {
      "title": "Challenge yourself.",
      "content": "Challenge yourself. If you've been writing for a while, chances are good that you keep getting drawn back to a particular style, topic, or format. Practicing a favorite type of writing is a great way to keep yourself motivated, but make an effort to vary your writing exercises once in a while. Deliberately tackling new and difficult challenges is vital for improvement in any field. Try these challenges as exercises, whether or not you're interested in polishing the end result: [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If your writing projects or your narrators all sound similar, try a different style. Imitate another author, or combine the styles of two authors. If most of your writing is for a blog, or for one long project, take a break from it. Think of a topic that could never fit into your usual writing project, and write about it. (For a followup challenge, rewrite the piece so it could fit into your project.)"

      "content": "Trade feedback with a group of supportive writers. Invite feedback on your writing, and offer to read other writers' drafts. Welcome honest criticism offered as advice for improvement, but keep your writing away from friends who act dismissive or negative. There's a big difference between useful critique, and disheartening negativity. [6] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source Look for online communities such as Scribophile or WritersCafe, or search for a more niche community on a specific type of writing. Check your local library and community centers for information on local writing clubs. You could even practice writing on a wiki, such as wikiHow or Wikipedia. This lets you help people as you practice, and might be one of the largest communal writing projects you ever undertake."

      "content": "Commit yourself to a writing schedule with other people. If you have trouble getting around to your writing projects, make a commitment to other people to give yourself external motivation. Get a pen pal to write letters to on a regular schedule, or start a blog with weekly updates. Find a writing contest a few weeks in the future, and promise to submit an entry. Join a writing challenge, whether that's a single writing session with a group of friends, or NaNoWriMo 's annual \"novel in a month\" extravaganza."

      "title": "Rewrite the pieces you care about.",
      "content": "Rewrite the pieces you care about. The first draft of a story always has room for improvement, and often ends up looking quite different after a few revisions. [7] X Research source Once you've written a piece that attracts your attention, go through the \"finished\" piece of writing and find sentences, paragraphs, or whole pages you're dissatisfied with. Rewrite a scene from a different character's perspective, try out alternative plot developments, or change the order of events. If you're not sure why you dislike a passage, rewrite it without referring to the original, then see what you like best in each version. Scrapping a beloved passage and starting again can be incredibly tough, so much so that writers have been phrasing this advice as \"murder your darlings\" for over a century."

What is more unique than your own personality and your life! Stand in front of the mirror and stare at your reflection. What do you look like? What about your personality? You will have better ideas when you include a character similar to yourself in your writing unless you're writing a biography and have no relationship to the person you are writing about. Also, make sure to look at the lives of the people who are close to you and be inspired by them."

      "title": "Read as much as you can.",
      "content": "Read as much as you can. Writers have a passion for the written word, and there's no better way to stoke that passion than to read. Read as widely as possible, from magazines to young adult novels to history dissertations, although you don't need to feel pressure to finish everything you pick up. [9] X Research source Reading builds vocabulary, teaches grammar, provides inspiration, and shows you what can be done with language. For the beginning writer, reading may be just as important as the actual writing. [10] X Research source As you read, pay attention to how the writer constructs their sentences and paragraphs, particularly in sections you really like. Additionally, observe how they craft their opening line, as well as the openings and closings of each chapter. If you're not sure what to read, ask for recommendations from friends, or visit a library and pick a couple books from each section."

      "content": "Expand your vocabulary . While you're reading, keep a dictionary and thesaurus on hand, or write down unfamiliar words to look up later. World class writers have argued over whether to use simple words, or employ sesquipedalian verbiage. That's something for you to decide in your own writing, but not before you learn which tools are available. [11] X Research source Dictionary definitions often don't provide an intuitive sense of how to use a word. Search for the word online and read it in context to get a better understanding."

      "content": "Learn the rules of grammar . Sure, there are plenty of famous, excellent books written in non-standard grammar, but learning grammar isn't just about memorizing a set of rules. Studying how a sentence is put together, and how punctuation is used to structure it, gives you the knowledge you need to express yourself the way you intend. If you think this may be a weak point for you, study an English textbook, or find a writing tutor. Learn how to write without informal grammar if you are not used to formal, written English. If you have a question about grammar, refer to a grammar book, such as The American Heritage Book of English Usage or Strunk and White's The Elements of Style ."

      "content": "Tailor your writing to your purpose and your audience. Just as you change your clothing for the weather and the occasion, you should also change your writing for your audience and your message. Flowery writing, for example, might fit better in a poem than in a status report. Make sure that your word choice and sentence length is not too difficult (or too simplistic) for your audience, if you are addressing a specific group. [12] X Research source Avoid specialized jargon when speaking to someone unfamiliar with the topic. [13] X Research source You can learn how to do this by reading good examples by established writers. Pay attention to how they use the specific register, format, and purpose of that type of writing so you can do it yourself."

      "content": "Write down ideas. Keep a notebook for writing down observations, overheard conversations, and sudden ideas encountered in your daily life. When you read or hear something that makes you laugh, think, or want to repeat it to someone else, write it down and think about what makes it effective. You may prefer to keep your ideas in a digital file, such as a Word document or Google Doc. This makes it easier to develop your ideas or insert them into other documents. If you use Google Docs, you can also access your work from several devices. You may use this notebook or file to collect unfamiliar words as well."

You can make an outline , put a collection of notes on cards and arrange them until they are in order, or draw a tree or map. Your outline may have nothing but a rough order of the events or topics covered, or it may be a more detailed scene-by-scene summary. Building some kind of structure in advance can help keep you going on days when you're feeling low on creativity. [15] X Research source There are many types of organizational software for writers, such as Scrivener or TheSage. You could also use a simple Word document or Google Docs. With Google Docs, you can access your writing from any device. It's fine to deviate from your plan, but if you abandon it entirely, stop and consider the reasons behind the chance.

      "content": "Research your subject. While a work of nonfiction requires you to know your subject, even a fiction book will benefit from research. If your main character is a glassblower, read a book on glassblowing and use the right terminology. If you are writing a book set before you were born, interview people who lived during that time, or who spoke to parents and grandparents who did. In the case of fiction writing, you may be able to dive in to the first draft before you start your research."

      "title": "Rewrite.",
      "content": "Rewrite. Once you have a first draft, reread it and rewrite it. You are looking for errors in grammar and spelling as well as style, content, organization, and coherence. If there are any passages you dislike, get rid of them and write them again from scratch. Critiquing your own work is an important skill, and it takes plenty of practice, just like writing itself. [16] X Research source Give yourself time between writing and editing, if at all possible. It is better to wait a good length of time, but even a short break can give you some of the necessary distance and detachment to edit well."

Continue the cycle of feedback and editing as you explore how to perfect your work. If it feels like running in place, remember you are practicing skills that will help you in all your future writing. You can always take a break to write something fun and ridiculous, just to remind yourself that writing can be a blast."
