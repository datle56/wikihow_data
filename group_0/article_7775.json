      "title": "Spray a general window cleaner on the whole surface of the window.",
      "content": "Spray a general window cleaner on the whole surface of the window. These are alkaline- or ammonia-based cleaners that are designed to clean windows, such as Windex, even if they are frosted. Simply spray down the surface until the entire surface is dampened. You want enough cleaner on the window to break up the dirt and grime. [1] X Research source Avoid using citrus-based cleaners on windows. These cleaners are good at cleaning soap scum and minerals off of shower doors, but they don’t do as well at cleaning smudges and general dirt as basic window cleaners do. [2] X Research source Don't use an abrasive cleanser when cleaning frosted glass. The abrasiveness can leave behind scratches on the frosted surface of the glass."

      "title": "Wipe the surface with a paper towel.",
      "content": "Wipe the surface with a paper towel. Rub the entire surface in a circular motion. Give a lot of attention and some extra elbow grease to any areas that you know are extra dirty. [3] X Research source Paper towels will rub the surface enough to remove dirt and grime, but they will not leave behind fibers on the textured surface of the glass the way that terrycloth and other towels will."

      "title": "Dry the surface with a clean, dry microfiber cloth or paper towel.",
      "content": "Dry the surface with a clean, dry microfiber cloth or paper towel. Once the entire window has been scrubbed a bit, you just need to remove the remaining cleaner. Use a dry and clean towel in order to get the surface good as new. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Spray a 2 ft × 2 ft (0.61 m × 0.61 m) section with glass cleaner.",
      "content": "Spray a 2 ft × 2 ft (0.61 m × 0.61 m) section with glass cleaner. Soak the area evenly so that it all gets dampened. Wetting one small area at a time allows you to scrub that entire section while the surface remains wet. [5] X Research source Use any product that is labeled as solely a glass cleaner, not a combination cleaner or multi-surface cleaner. The most commonly available product like this is Windex. Don’t use abrasive cleaners. Cleaners that have small abrasives built into them are likely to scratch your frosted glass surface. Because of this, avoid any products that have the word “abrasive” on their label."
    },
    {
      "title": "Scrub the surface with newspaper or paper towels.",
      "content": "Scrub the surface with newspaper or paper towels. Ball up a piece of newspaper or grab a couple paper towels off your roll. Scrub the dampened surface in a circular motion in order to remove any mineral deposits, soap scum, or other dirt on the glass. [6] X Research source Do not use abrasive scrubbing tools on frosted glass. Abrasive cleaning tools, like steel wool, scouring pads, and pumice stones, will scratch your frosted glass. While it might be tempting to try and scrub the surface with these kinds of tools, it’s much better to use an effective cleaner and a smooth scrubber, like newspaper, paper towels, or a microfiber cloth."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the glass surface with clean water.",
      "content": "Rinse the glass surface with clean water. Rinsing will clean off the glass cleaner and the grime that you have dislodged with your scrubbing. For the inside of the shower, simply use a bucket or a cup to pour water down the surface of the glass. If you are cleaning the outside of the shower glass, a damp cloth that you rinse out several times while rinsing will do the job. You can use cold, warm, or hot water to rinse the surface."

    {
      "title": "Allow the surface to dry.",
      "content": "Allow the surface to dry. Frosted glass typically dries pretty quickly but the amount of time it takes depends on the humidity and your specific surface. In general, wait about 30 minutes and then look to see if the glass is dry and if you were successful at cleaning everything off the surface. While you can wipe the surface dry with a clean, microfiber towel, this can leave behind lint and fibers that get stuck on the textured surface of frosted glass."

      "title": "Use a baking-soda mixture to clean off tough grime.",
      "content": "Use a baking-soda mixture to clean off tough grime. If there is still scum residue on the glass after it dries, you will need to use a tougher cleaner. In a small dish, mix 1 tablespoon (14 g) of baking soda with 1 cup (240 ml) of water and a squirt of dish-washing soap or vinegar. Use a sponge or towel to apply the mixture to the entire surface of the glass. Let it sit for a few minutes and then scrub the area with newspaper or paper towels. [7] X Research source Once you are done scrubbing, rinse the surface with water, spray it down with glass cleaner, and then rinse it again. Use caution when using vinegar since it’s acidic and too much could be abrasive on your frosted glass. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the shade from the fixture. Unscrew any setscrews that are holding the shade on and then lift or twist the shade out of its housing. As you do this, be sure to hold onto it securely so that it doesn't fall when it becomes detached. [9] X Research source Taking the shade off instead of cleaning it in place will allow you to clean it more thoroughly. How you remove your shade will vary a lot depending on your specific fixture."

      "title": "Wash your shade with dish soap, warm water, and a lint-free rag or sponge.",
      "content": "Wash your shade with dish soap, warm water, and a lint-free rag or sponge. Fill your sink with warm water and a squirt of dish soap. Put the shade in your sink and let it soak for a few minutes to help release the dirt and grime. Then rub over the entire surface of the shade, making sure to scrub areas with a lot of dirt and build up. [10] X Research source It’s especially important to scrub shades that have been in dirty or greasy areas, like the kitchen. Follow manufactures instructions for cleaning decorative shades that have painted details or embellishments. In most cases, you will only want to use a mild glass cleaner so they don’t get damaged."

      "content": "Rinse off the shade with warm water. Drain the sink to get rid of the soapy, dirty water. Then rinse the shade under the faucet until all visible soap and dirt are gone. When handling the wet lampshade, be sure to hold on to it tightly. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Allow the glass to air dry completely before putting the shade back.",
      "content": "Allow the glass to air dry completely before putting the shade back. Set the shade on a clean counter or towel to dry. Drying times will vary, but typically it should be dry in less than an hour. Once it is completely dry, make sure it is clean and reattach it to your light fixture."
