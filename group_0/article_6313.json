Find the goat by checking hedges for hole, looking up in trees (yes, trees!), flower gardens, inside your house, down the road, over the river, etc. Goats naturally explore and can be very curious.

      "content": "Once you find the goat, approach them slowly with the bucket out. Go slow and walk towards the goat at an angle where the goat can see you and the grain bucket. Goats know where their escape routes are, and they are faster and more agile than you, so you don't want to startle it."

      "content": "As the goat goes for the food, calmly take hold of your goat. Figure out what to grab when the goat starts running. If the goat wears a collar or other such device, try that. Horns can be used as handles as well, but are not always as strong as they appear and can break. [2] X Research source If things go haywire, you may need to pin the goat. To pin them against a wall, place one knee in front of the shoulder blade and the other knee behind the ribs and lean into it. Ideally the head should be held up as well."

      "content": "This will keep the goat from wandering off again as you return them. Once caught, the goat should be tethered to a secure object by a chain or strong rope. No fence short of one designed for a federal prison will reliably hold a goat. Tethering in most cases is pretty much the only way to go. A good fence can hold a goat if they are happy. Tethering a goat can be dangerous because they can easily strangle themselves."
