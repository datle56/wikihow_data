You can train on your own, but you will become a better boxer if you are being formally trained. Formal training will also help you meet other boxers that you can train with. Do your research on the schools that are out there, and see if you can take a class at each facility you're interested in. Then you can determine whether the instructor, atmosphere, and structure are right for you and your own way of doing things.

For instance, some people prefer to train in a way where they want to get into a ring, and there are schools for those trying to be professional fighters. Other schools are more focused on winning tournaments. [2] X Expert Source Joseph Bautista Self-Defense Specialist, Martial Arts Instructor, & 1st Aid/CPR Instructor Expert Interview. 30 April 2020."

Always return to your fighting stance after each punch. Always protect yourself with your non-punching hand.

Hit the bag with your right hand twice and then hit the bag with your left hand twice. Use the front of your fist for your first hit and the bottom of your fist for your second hit. [4] X Research source Stand directly in front of the bag; not in your boxer's stance. You should also be eye level with the bag. Start by practicing a single punch. Complete 3 sets of 10 punches."

      "title": "Get in boxing stance.",
      "content": "Get in boxing stance. In the orthodox boxing stance, your left foot is in the lead. Keep your chin down with your rear hand (usually your right hand) guarding your chin. Your lead hand should be about 6 to 8 inches from your chin, and your elbows should be tucked in. Stand slightly sideways so your entire chest is not facing your opponent. Your knees should be slightly bent, and your feet should be a little wider than shoulder width. If you are left handed, you will lead with your right food instead. Your rear hand will be your left hand, and your lead hand will be your right hand. This is called the southpaw stance."

Keep your chin down and protect your chin with your rear hand as you punch. Extend your arm fully and quickly and then bring your arm back to the original stance position. You should never lean in or lunge to jab your opponent. If you feel the need to do this, you are not in a good position to throw a jab."

      "content": "Throw a cross. A cross is a punch thrown with your rear hand and is more powerful than a jab. Guard your chin with your lead hand and then fully extend your rear hand. As you throw your cross, pivot your rear foot so that your heel is up and your toes are still on the ground. Rotate your body counter clockwise as you extend your arm and lean forward just a little bit. Rotate your fist as you punch so that the palm of your hand is facing the floor. Bring your hand back to protect your chin after you throw the punch. Remember to keep your knees bent so you do not lose your balance."

Bend your arm to a 90 degree angle and rotate your body in the direction that your punch is going. Pivot your foot as you throw the punch as well and bend your knees.

Bend your knees as you throw and aim for your opponent's head. Pivot your back foot as you throw this punch as well.

The more you practice them, the faster and more efficient you will become. You can also begin to string together multiple combinations. The basic combinations are: [6] X Research source The 1-2 (jab -right cross) The 1-1-2 (jab-jab-cross) The 1-2-3 (jab-cross-left hook) The 1-2-3-2 (jab-cross-hook-cross) The 1-2-5-2 (jab-cross-left uppercut-cross) The 1-6-3-2 (jab-right uppercut-left hook-right hand)"

To prepare your body for this, train with 3 or 5 pound weights around your arms and ankles.To prepare for body shots, have someone drop a medicine ball on your stomach while you are doing crunches.

Spar with people who are a different size than you and that have different abilities (e.g. faster, more advanced, better jab, slower than you, etc.) Remember that sparring is about practicing and getting better, not beating up your partner.

Use small wrist rotations instead of your entire arm to swing the rope around. Jump high enough so the rope slides right under your feet. You do not want to jump too high. Your landing is one of the most important parts of your jump roping. Stay on the balls of your feet and keep your knees slightly bent as you land. [13] X Research source Once you can have mastered basic jump roping, you can try more advanced techniques like jump roping side-to-side and crossing your arms. Get a jump rope that is long enough for your body. You should be able to step in the middle of the rope and pull the handles to your shoulder. Start by jumping rope for 20 seconds without tripping. Build up your endurance until you can jump rope for 1, 2, or 3 minutes (rounds) without stopping. Take a 30-60 second break between each round."

[14] X Research source If you are unable to run for 60 minutes without stopping, run for shorter periods of time and work your way up. If you have not been jogging regularly, work your way up to 5 times a week as well. If you are a beginner, start with running for 10 or 20 minutes, 3 times a week.

Try to stretch for at least 15 minutes every time you stretch. Never stretch cold muscles. You can stretch after you warm up (e.g. jump rope or light jog) or after your workout.

Back squats, clean and jerks, dead lifts, and snatches are all great exercises. Lifting should not be done on the same days that you are doing your boxing training. For example, if you are in the boxing ring Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, then you would lift weights on Tuesday and Thursday. If you do not want to do Olympic style weightlifting, you can do more traditional exercises. Do exercises for your hips and legs (e.g. lunges, squats, mountain climbers), core (e.g. planks, back extension, etc.), and upper body (e.g. pull ups, push ups, chest press, shoulder press, etc.) Avoid strength training the week before your boxing match."

For example, do intervals on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday instead of Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Adjust the amount of intervals you are doing based on the length of your fight. If you are training for a 5 round fight, run 6 intervals to prepare."
