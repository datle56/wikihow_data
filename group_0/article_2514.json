As you're new to the group, you won't understand everything. There will be inside jokes you will not understand and certain group traditions that do not involve you. Do not get offended if you're pushed slightly to the sidelines during group outings. Instead, embrace the fact the night does not revolve around you. [3] X Research source Try to keep a low profile if there is a conversation or joke occurring that you can't follow. Your boyfriend may, for example, talk about drama in the friends group that you don't fully understand. He may also reminisce about memories that do not involve you. During these times, take a back seat. Smile and nod without trying to follow everything. It's okay to, at times, give your boyfriend some space in a social setting. In fact, this is likely to make your boyfriend's friends like you more. They will appreciate you allowing your boyfriend to have his own social life."
