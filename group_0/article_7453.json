      "title": "Put on a comfortable, well-fitting, non-padded bra.",
      "content": "Put on a comfortable, well-fitting, non-padded bra. Choose the bra you feel most comfortable in--it should be snug but not dig into your sides. [1] X Research source Your nipples should be about halfway between your elbow and shoulder. If they are lower, tighten the straps to lift. You can also measure without a bra, but it may be slightly more challenging when things can move around."

      "title": "Find your band size.",
      "content": "Find your band size. Standing in front of a mirror, use a soft tape measurer to measure around your ribs right under your breasts. This is also where the band of your bra wraps around your torso. Pull the tape tight. Write down this measurement. [2] X Research source Use the mirror to make sure the tape is exactly parallel to the floor. If the measuring tape is not in a straight line around your body and at an angle, you will not get an accurate measurement. [3] X Research source Don't pull the tape so tight it's like you are wearing a corset. Just make sure it is squeezing your body snugly. If your measurement is a fraction (like 33 1/2 inches), round up to the nearest whole number (34 inches). Band sizes are measured in even numbers, so if your measurement was odd, you may want to try one size up and one size down (if you measure 35 inches, try both the 34 and the 36 size bra), but round up for now."

    {
      "title": "Find your bust size.",
      "content": "Find your bust size. Wrap the measuring tape around your back and measure your breasts at their fullest point, usually at the nipple. [4] X Research source Write down this measurement. Because your cup size can fluctuate based on hormones and bloating, try to measure on a day when your breasts feel relatively normal. [5] X Research source If you are concerned about your posture (maybe you slouch), try bending forward at the hips to a 90 degree angle, or until your body forms an L shape. Then measure your bust from that position. [6] X Research source Don't pull the tape tight like you did with your band measurement. As with the band measurement, round up to the nearest whole number if your measurement is a fraction. Again, be certain the tape is straight across your back. The measuring tape should not angle up from your back toward your nipples. All women have one breast that is larger than the other, so be sure you are measuring to the fuller breast."

      "title": "Subtract your band size from your bust size.",
      "content": "Subtract your band size from your bust size. The difference between these two numbers is your key to finding your cup size. A 1 inch (2.5 cm) difference = A cup. 2 inch (5.1 cm) = B cup. 3 inch = C cup. 4 inch (10.2 cm) = D cup. 5 inch = DD cup. [7] X Research source Once you go above 5 inches (12.7 cm), cup sizes will differ with each company. There should be a sizing chart on the company's website and you can use your band and bust measurement to find which cup you want."

      "title": "Combine the cup size with your band measurement, and you have your final bra size.",
      "content": "Combine the cup size with your band measurement, and you have your final bra size. So, a 34C means you have a 34 inch (86.4 cm) band and a C cup."

    {
      "title": "Remember that the cup size is not the same for each band size.",
      "content": "Remember that the cup size is not the same for each band size. A 34B cup will be smaller than a 36B cup. When trying on bras, if you change band sizes you, will also have to change cup sizes. If you need a larger band size, go down a cup size. So instead of 34B, you'll want 36A. If you need a smaller band size, go up a cup size. Instead of 34B, go for 32C. It is more important to have an accurate band measurement than cup measurement. Going up or down a band size is a more significant change than going up or down a cup size. Get a comfortable band first and then fine tune with the cup size. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Get help from a professional if you need it. If you aren't sure you're doing it right, want a second opinion, or just don't feel like measuring yourself, stop into any bra or lingerie store or department and ask a sales associate for help. Helping customers find the best bra is part of their job, and they will know exactly what to do."

      "content": "Hook the bra so it is hanging around your waist. Make sure the straps are loose--you can tighten them later if you need to. If you have trouble hooking a bra behind your back, you can hook the bra at the front and then twist it around your waist so the hooks are at your spine."

    {
      "title": "Lean forward and pull the bra up from the front only, sliding your arms through the straps.",
      "content": "Lean forward and pull the bra up from the front only, sliding your arms through the straps. The cups may feel empty or a little too big at this point, but that's ok. The band should be snug and low on your back."

      "title": "Check the fit and tighten the straps.",
      "content": "Check the fit and tighten the straps. Straps shouldn't be so tight they dig into your shoulders, but there should be no slack. Does the bra pinch your breasts or make it look like you have four boobs? Then it's the wrong size. Your nipples should be about halfway between your shoulder and elbow. If your breasts are spilling out of the sides of your bra, you need a different size. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Remember your bra size is not permanent and will change along with your body. Just because you are a 34C now doesn't mean you will always have those same measurements. If you've gone through a major body change or your bra doesn't feel right, take your measurements again. Get refitted if your weight has fluctuated more than 10 pounds, you've had a baby, started exercising regularly, or have completed hormone therapy. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Get to know your breasts. The size and shape of your breasts may impact your bra size and influence which style is most flattering to your body. Breasts and bodies come in every shape and size. Instead of worrying that your breasts don't look like a Victoria Secret Model's, concentrate on dressing for your body and finding what looks best on you . Examine detailed fitting guides that recommend bras for many different shapes and types of breasts. They make suggestions for women with prominent breast bones, large areolas, distended stomachs, and more."

Maybe you can only afford one bra and need something with versatility? There are tons of possibilities for different styles, cuts, and fits. Check out a guide to the pros and cons of different bra styles, and on which bodies and breast shapes they work best. A seamless bra can be a great everyday bra to wear under T-shirt or with other form-fitting clothes, as it will be almost invisible underneath. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy a sports bra for exercising. If your breasts bounce or move too much during activity, the supportive ligaments begin to break down. [12] X Research source Bouncing can also become very painful, and the discomfort may eventually prevent you from participating in activities. Check the impact or intensity level when shopping for a sports bra. A low-impact bra works great for yoga or hiking. A high-impact bra is necessary for activities like running. [13] X Research source Smaller-breasted women are usually comfortable in compression bras (that give the appearance of a \"unibreast\") and look like a cropped tank top. For larger-breasted women, an bra that cups and encapsulates each breast may be more comfortable and inhibit bouncing. These bras have wide straps and clasps. [14] X Research source You may also find a bra that combines compression and encapsulation, which will give you the best support overall. [15] X Research source"

If you're relying on the shoulder straps to keep your breasts lifted, you may actually need a smaller band size. If your shoulders are sloping or narrow, try a bra with a leotard back, a racerback bra, or buy a special clip that will keep your straps from slipping off your shoulders. [18] X Research source"

If you can't slide your finger under the band, your bra may be hooked too tight or you need a larger band size. [20] X Research source If your bra becomes uncomfortable when you sit, try a larger band or a bra with and arched center panel. Your ribs expand when you are in a seated position. You want your bra to be comfortable whether you're on your feet or in a chair. [21] X Research source"
