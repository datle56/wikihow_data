Learn which items are safe to choose from. Clothes that are safe to pick from include: [1] X Research source Men : blazers; button-down shirts; t-shirts; nice jeans; chinos; tailored shorts; casual sneakers; boat shoes; loafers, brogues; boots; dress shoes.

      "content": "Develop a discerning eye. Aim to strike the perfect balance between casual and stylish. Imagine two extremes: a fancy ‘60s cocktail party and a rough-and-tumble day at the beach. When picking items to wear, imagine wearing them to both occasions. Aim for an outfit that would look slightly too relaxed and casual to fit in with the cast of Mad Men , but too nice to risk scuffing up outdoors. When in doubt, err on the side of fitting in more with the cocktail party folks than the beach bums. [3] X Research source"

Anderson Certified Image Consultant & International Branding Icon Expert Interview. 19 July 2021 Rest assured: you don’t need a whole collection of individually stunning garments to impress people visually. Instead, create a more interesting look by simply layering the clothes you do have. Make them work as a team for a “sum-is-greater-than-its-parts” effect. For instance, you can layer: A vest or sweater over dress shirts. A blazer or light jacket over a t-shirt. Tasteful bras and bralettes under any tops or dresses that offer a glimpse underneath. [8] X Research source Stockings, tights, or leggings under skirts and dresses."

      "content": "Use contrast to make your outfit pop. Catch people’s attention by avoiding a totally uniform appearance. Vary your look by adding one or two touches that will either stand out from the rest or juxtapose other elements. For example: If, say, you dress all in black, wear a pair of white shoes (or a belt, or a tie, or all three). Pair a skinny pair of pants with a loose-fitting top. Wear a tighter top or jacket with a billowy skirt or dress. [9] X Research source Pair dark bottoms with light tops, and/or dark tops with light bottoms. [10] X Research source"

Then perk your otherwise neutral outfits up with one of these articles, like wearing a bold red shirt with navy blue jeans and a black leather jacket. In addition to clothes, you can also accent your outfits with accessories like: [14] X Research source Ties Belts Jewelry Suspenders Purses and bags"

      "content": "Be sure to match colors that aren’t neutral. If you find neutrals too boring, go ahead and dress in something bolder. Just make sure one element of your outfit doesn’t clash with another. Be aware that even though you personally like two different colors, people are hardwired to look for harmony in colors. When you assemble an outfit, start with one article as your base color and pair other items that match."

      "content": "Stick to simple garments. If you need to make your clothes last, check out their construction before you buy them. Keep in mind that any extra little add-on (like unnecessary buttons, sequins, or silkscreens) is just one more thing that might fall off or fall apart. Don’t get stuck with, say, a t-shirt that looked stylish on the rack but now looks like a hand-me-down because the silkscreen flaked off! Put it back on the rack and pick out a simpler item instead. [15] X Research source ”Simple” doesn’t have to mean “plain.” Remember: a pair of black-and-white striped pants isn’t constructed any differently than a pair of solid black pants! If you want a little more jazz in your clothes, look for items made with different prints and materials."

      "content": "Avoid clothes that need to be dry-cleaned. If budget is an issue, check the care label for each item while shopping. Only buy clothes that say, “Machine Wash.” If the care label tells you that the item needs to be dry-cleaned, put it back. Bear in mind that dry-cleaning is often pricey, so get the most wear out of your purchases by sticking to items that you can afford to wash regularly. [16] X Research source Give your machine-wash clothes a longer life by only using cold water to wash them. Then dry them in a machine with low heat, or simply let them air-dry."

Don’t spoil your casual-chic look by holding up those stunning pants with a dinky-looking belt! Only buy pants that stay up just fine on their own, even if you already have a good, quality belt at home (just in case it gets lost or ruined). [17] X Research source If you do need a belt for pants, don’t worry about it. You’re aiming for stylish but casual, so keeping your shirt untucked is a perfect way to hide it. [18] X Research source If you like to wear loose dresses and draw attention to your waist at the same time, wear a more form-fitting top or jacket instead of a belt."

Get more for your money with a pair of shoes that is perfectly stylish and a bit more versatile. Instead of high heels, shop for an eye-catching pair of flats, low heels, or sneakers.
