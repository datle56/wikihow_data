      "content": "Confirm your eligibility to marry. You must be at least 16 years old to wed in Alaska. You also may not be legally married to any other individual at the time of application, and any prior divorces must be final. As of 2015, same sex marriage is legal in all 50 states.

      "title": "Get parental consent.",
      "content": "Get parental consent. Anyone between the ages of 16 and 18 planning to marry must receive parental consent. Those under 16 are not permitted to marry. Both parents will be required to sign a consent form, unless one parent is sole custodian. To verify that one parent is sole custodian you should bring to the court a death certificate or a divorce decree that lists custody rights. [2] X Research source A parental consent form can be acquired from the local court. A special exemption is granted to members of the armed forces, who are not required to get parental consent."

      "content": "Plan to apply for the license not less than three business days before the wedding. It takes three business days to process the application. Therefore, it is important that you apply in advance so that this waiting period will expire and you will still have enough time remaining before the ceremony to pick up the license from the same courthouse at which you submitted the application. You should not, however, apply for your license too far in advance, because it will expire within three months. [3] X Research source In some cases, where it is proven that undue hardship would be incurred if the issuance of the license is delayed until the end of the waiting period, a licensing officer might be willing to waive the requirement.

In addition to photo ID, you will also want to bring money to pay the $60 application fee and the application that you have filled out. Additional forms are necessary for minors and the recently divorced. [6] X Research source You can find a list of courts with licensing officers here . The state recommends that you visit the one closest to the site of the wedding or whichever would be most convenient for picking up the completed license directly prior to the wedding. You must pick up the license from the same location that you submitted the application. The courts in Anchorage and Juneau do not accept marriage applications. Applications should instead be submitted to the local office of the Bureau of Vital Statistics. Both parties must be present and sober. [7] X Research source If you are getting remarried and applying for a license less than sixty days after the termination of your last marriage, you should also bring a divorce decree to the licensing officer to confirm the completion of your divorce. Applicants under the age of 18 should bring a birth certificate certified within 30 days of the date of submission of the application."
