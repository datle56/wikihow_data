      "content": "Create silly nicknames for each other. Silly nicknames are great because they make you both laugh. Plus, they can be an inside joke. To pick the perfect nickname, think about your partner's favorite things, bad habits, and embarrassing relationship mishaps. Then, try to turn that into a nickname. [1] X Research source For instance, let's say your boyfriend tried to make you breakfast in bed but set off the smoke alarm. If you both laughed about it, you might call him “Smokey.” As another example, let's say your boyfriend hates sports but spent an hour playing a basketball arcade game to win you a teddy bear.
