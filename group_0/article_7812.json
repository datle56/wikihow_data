      "content": "Make a baking soda paste. Combine about two tablespoons of baking soda with about one tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water. The mixture should not be too thin. If it sloshes about in the bowl you mixed it in, add some more baking soda to help it achieve a more paste-like texture. It also shouldn't be too thick. If the mixture is thick and dry, and doesn't adhere well to the fork or spoon you use to mix it, add some water to thin it out. The more grout you have to clean, the more paste you'll need. [4] X Research source You can also use an oxidizing bleach powder instead of baking soda. [5] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 1 July 2020."
