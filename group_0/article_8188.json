      "title": "Use baby wipes.",
      "content": "Use baby wipes. Baby wipes are the easiest method of cleaning your rabbit without bathing it. Use baby wipes that are fragrance-free, alcohol-free and hypo-allergenic for best results. You want a wipe that is strong enough to clean your bunny without tearing, and which is soft so that it won't hurt your bunny's skin. Some wipes come fortified with vitamin E or aloe. These are fine to use on a rabbit."

      "title": "Put your rabbit in a comfortable position.",
      "content": "Put your rabbit in a comfortable position. You might find it easiest to do the spot-cleaning by holding the rabbit in your lap, or between your knees as you sit on the floor. You'll want to hold your bunny in a position that allows you to clean his dirty parts, which will usually mean he should be held belly-up. You can use a towel to help you hold the bunny in place. If the area that requires cleaning can be reached by keeping the bunny upright, you can simply place him on a towel on the floor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wipe the bunny on the soiled area.",
      "content": "Wipe the bunny on the soiled area. Using the baby wipes, gently rub away any debris, soil, or residue from the bunny's fur. If needed, clean around the bunny's bottom or privates, which might be stained with urine if your rabbit is having incontinence issues. Try to get the skin as clean as possible, but always be very gentle. The bunny's skin is very delicate. When you've cleaned away the debris, give the rabbit another quick rub with a clean wipe."
    },
    {
      "title": "Purchase baby cornstarch powder.",
      "content": "Purchase baby cornstarch powder. Baby cornstarch powder can be found in the baby supplies section of your grocery store. Only baby-safe cornstarch is safe to use on your rabbit. [1] X Research source Never use powder that contains talc, as talc causes respiratory irritation in bunnies. It may even be carcinogenic. Don't use commercial flea powders or pesticides."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put your bunny in bathing position.",
      "content": "Put your bunny in bathing position. Keep his belly turned up towards you. You may want to hold him in your lap on a towel for this bathing. Make sure he's well cushioned and comfortable. Stroke your bunny to reassure him that he's safe. You can keep him laying on the floor as long as he's in no danger of running away. You want him to remain still and calm while you bathe him."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply the cornstarch powder.",
      "content": "Apply the cornstarch powder. Focus especially on any areas that are soiled. If your bunny has a messy bottom, you'll want to make sure plenty of cornstarch is sprinkled around this area. [2] X Research source Gently work the powder through the thick hairs and down to the skin. Make sure that you're covering any soiled area well. This will likely feel good to your bunny, like petting. Talk to him reassuringly throughout the process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a fine-tooth comb if needed.",
      "content": "Use a fine-tooth comb if needed. Most of the debris should fall away as you work the cornstarch through the rabbit's fur, but occasionally you'll need to comb the fur to clean it. Be careful to do this very gently. [3] X Research source A flea comb will be best for this purpose, as its teeth are very fine. Don't tug at knotted masses or hairs. Instead, work gently from the outside, teasing loose any matted material."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pat the powdered areas when you're finished.",
      "content": "Pat the powdered areas when you're finished. Rubbing the bunny well should leave behind all excess cornstarch, soil, and loose fur. The cornstarch bath usually only takes a few minutes, and your bunny will be clean at the end. [4] X Research source You might want to have a small hand-held vacuum cleaner nearby so that you can immediately clean up the excess matter. Rabbits don't usually mind a dry bath and will remain quiet through the process."

      "title": "Take a good look at the cage.",
      "content": "Take a good look at the cage. If you have a stinky rabbit, chances are you need to give the cage a good cleaning. Because rabbits are known for their careful grooming habits, a bad-smelling bunny is often picking up those smells from a poorly kept cage. [5] X Research source Bunnies will do their best to keep themselves clean and well-groomed. Your bunny's cage should be washed out once a week, and droppings cleaned out daily. A rabbit's bedding can smell strongly of urine and feces if it hasn't been changed in a while."
    },
    {
      "title": "Throw away the old bedding.",
      "content": "Throw away the old bedding. You'll want to completely replace the bedding with fresh material. Pellet-shaped bedding will work best for a rabbit, with a newspaper base to prevent the bunny's feet from injury. [6] X Research source Never use pine or cedar shavings for bedding, as these shavings will alter a rabbit's ability to respond to medication. [7] X Research source Metal or plastic cages are best. Wood can degrade with time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Scrub the cage with a brush.",
      "content": "Scrub the cage with a brush. Don't use strong cleaning products, such as Lysol or another disinfectant, as these leave residue that may be toxic to your rabbit. Instead, use a mild vinegar-water mix. [8] X Research source For best results, place the cage in the sun to dry. Sunlight will naturally disinfect your rabbit's cage. Every few months, you may want to clean the cage with water in which a very small amount of bleach (1 part bleach to 5 parts water) has been dissolved."
