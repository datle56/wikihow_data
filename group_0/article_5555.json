      "content": "Find the number of the person you want to call. If you don't already know the number for where you need to call, you will need to find the number, either on a website, in a book, or from a family member or friend that you are trying to call."

      "title": "Make sure that the area code is included.",
      "content": "Make sure that the area code is included. The area codes are 2-5 digits long. A phone number without the area code is 3-9 digits long. Generally, numbers you would need to call would be about 9 digits, so if it is only 9 digits long then you will need to figure out the area code. One thing you can do is look up the area code for the region you are calling and see if it matches up with the first few numbers that you have."

      "title": "Confirm the desired phone number.",
      "content": "Confirm the desired phone number. International calling rates are usually quite steep, so a call to the wrong number would be a costly mistake. If the number can't be retrieved directly from the person or business being called, international phone directories, both residential and commercial, are available on the Internet."
