      "content": "Buy an eraser. A simple pencil eraser can remove most stains from white leather, including grass stains and scuffs. Using a small eraser, such as one on a pencil top, can help to clean up a small scuff or mark on a particular spot on the baseball. [1] X Research source You can also use it to rub away dirt from the whole surface. However, you might want to get a larger eraser for cleaning the entire ball. You can use any type of common eraser, including ones made of rubber, vinyl, or art gum. Try to find an eraser that is either white or free of any intense color. Erasers that are dyed bright colors like pink may rub off onto your ball, making an even worse mark. Don't use this method on an autographed baseball. The eraser is likely to remove ink just as readily as it will dirt. [2] X Research source Don't use this method on stains that are still wet, which can spread the stain. Blot away excess liquid with a moist paper towel and wait for it to dry. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Rub the eraser on the dirty spot on the ball. Press the eraser against the surface of the ball. Rub the eraser back and forth over the spot you wish to clean, just as you would erase a mark off of a piece of paper. Repeat this motion until the dirt or marks come away. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase a magic eraser. Magic erasers are a popular type of household cleaning product made from melamine foam. Although a fairly new cleaner, magic erasers have become quite common and can usually be found at your local grocery store. Use a magic eraser when you want to clean the whole surface of the ball quickly. Magic erasers are especially effective for removing all types of stains from white leather. However, keep in mind that also includes ink stains. Don't use a magic eraser on an autographed ball. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Wet the magic eraser.",
      "content": "Wet the magic eraser. Run your eraser under the tap and squeeze to remove excess water. While magic erasers can also be used dry, they are more effective with some moisture. Water makes it easier for dirt to cling to in the same way that a wet paper towel is a much more effective cleaning tool compared to a dry one. [7] X Research source You may also choose to cut your magic eraser into multiple pieces with a pair of scissors. You'll increase its surface area, getting more use for your money. The smaller size will also be easier to grip while working on a small object like a baseball. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Rub the surface of the ball with the magic eraser.",
      "content": "Rub the surface of the ball with the magic eraser. Melamine foam is a soft material with an extremely hard microstructure that works as an abrasive cleaner. In other words, magic erasers clean surfaces in a manner similar to a sander, directly scraping away dirt and grime with friction. Because magic erasers don't hold their shape, you will need to both grip yours securely and press down fairly hard. From there, make a few back-and-forth motions as you would erase pencil from paper. It should lift the stain fairly quickly, needing only a few passes to work its \"magic.\" [9] X Research source [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Rotate the ball as you clean. Turn the ball in your hand and continue to rub until the entire surface is clean. Avoid rubbing the stitching on the seams of the ball too much, as you don't want to damage or fray them. Frayed seams will ruin the look and durability of the ball. Remember that melamine foam cleans through abrasion. While it shouldn't harm the leather of the main part of your ball, the thinner cotton stitching can be more prone to damage.

      "content": "Make a solution of dilute bleach and dish detergent. Fill up a glass about halfway with warm water and then add the same amount of a gentle dish detergent. Then drop in about a capful of ordinary household bleach and stir. You can substitute a number of leather-safe solvents for this solution. Some choices include hairspray, rubbing alcohol, and white vinegar. [12] X Research source This method works best for removing autographs, scuff marks, and grass stains."

      "content": "Dampen a cotton swab with bleach. Dip the tip of the cotton swab into your bleach solution and squeeze the excess off with a paper towel or old rag. You just want enough to lightly moisten the surface of the ball. [13] X Research source You can also use an old tooth brush or any other type of scrubbing tool able to hold water."

      "content": "Wipe the damp cotton swab over the stain. Rub the end of the cotton swab with bleach on it back and forth over the surface of the ball. Do this a few times until you see the stain lift away. Be careful to avoid contact with the seams or any of the stamps. If the bleach touches the red stitches on the seams, it will discolor them. The solution will also remove any stamps you scrub over."

      "content": "Place the balls in the drum. Lift the latch and pour the baseballs into the container. Baseball cleaning machines are able to scrub dozens of balls clean in just a few hours. If you need to clean many balls on a frequent basis, an expensive baseball cleaning machine might be a worthwhile investment Choose baseballs that have roughly the same amount of dirt for each load. Cleaner balls will take less time than dirtier balls, so break the balls up into groups to get the best results. Read your machine's owner manual to determine the maximum number of baseballs you can safely load. These machines do not typically require a minimum number. This technique is best for cleaning well-used, very grimy baseballs."

    {
      "title": "Add the cleaning compound.",
      "content": "Add the cleaning compound. Commercial baseball cleaning machines use a dry rubber compound to clean the balls without using moisture. This helps to preserve the leather and won't waterlog the balls. This method is essentially a large-scale, extremely thorough, automated version of the pencil eraser method."

      "title": "Let the machine run for a length of time that matches the extent of your balls' grime.",
      "content": "Let the machine run for a length of time that matches the extent of your balls' grime. Place the drum back on the machine. Turn the machine on and set its timer. The base will rotate the drum full of balls along with the cleaning compound. If your baseballs are still not scrubbed white at the end of the run, you can always start the machine up again. Lightly-scuffed balls take roughly an hour to clean. Moderate grime can be removed in two to three hours. Baseballs caked in a serious amount of dirt may take as long as 12 hours to thoroughly clean. Feel free to leave these loads to run overnight."

      "content": "Retrieve your balls. When the cycle is complete, remove the drum from the machine. Open the lid and remove the balls. They should be a shiny, bright white. Leave the cleaning compound in the drum for the next load of balls. These rubber chips can be used until they've been entirely worn away, just like a pencil eraser."
