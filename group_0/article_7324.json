      "content": "Chirons in Taurus often struggle with security and the prospect of loss. Your Chiron sign refers to the placement of Chiron on your birth chart. Chiron is considered a minor planet in astrology; named after Chiron, a centaur healer in Greek mythology who suffers unhealable wounds from Hercules, the planet Chiron represents your deepest wounds and how they can be healed. Chiron in Taurus is called the “Wound of Loss.” Taurus is an earth sign ruled by Venus, the planet of love, beauty, and wealth. Since Taurus relates to material abundance and stability, Chiron in Taurus manifests as a fear of losing those things. You may fear losing money, possessions, security, or love—and constantly look for safety but never feel completely secure.

      "content": "Deep need for security and control. Chiron in Taurus is defined by a need for security and a subsequent fear of losing it—so, when you have a Chiron in Taurus placement, you may compensate for your fears by trying to control as much as possible. You might set strict guidelines for yourself, hoard things that make you feel more comfortable, or make demands of the people around you. [2] X Research source You may also try cultivating authority through material wealth or finances to feel like you have power over your life. Ultimately, any controlling tendencies from Chiron in Taurus really stem from your desire to feel safe. Extreme spending habits. If you have a Chiron in Taurus placement, you might go one of two ways with your spending habits. On one hand, you might be highly frugal and refuse to spend money or take financial risks to maintain your security. Conversely, you might go overboard on spending while trying to live in comfort and feel like you have everything you need. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source How you express your Chiron in Taurus wound often depends on your specific circumstances and other sign placements on your chart. Nonetheless, both habits come from the same wound and desire for comfort and security. Fear of vulnerability. Vulnerability feels like the opposite of security or comfort for Chiron in Taurus. You may see vulnerability as a sign of weakness, perhaps because it wasn't safe for you to be vulnerable as a child. It may be a challenge to show vulnerability —and you may compensate by trying to control everything or crafting a public persona for yourself. [4] X Research source Sometimes your Chiron in Taurus wound might be about how you want the world to see you. You may fear being seen as just another person and want everyone to envision a specific persona when they think of you: smart, wise, influential, beautiful, or something else. Judgmental of others. As a Chiron in Taurus, you may sometimes have harsh or overly critical opinions of people. However, the truth is that judging others may be a form of self-protection for you. Because you fear intimacy, you may focus on criticizing or judging those around you to stop them from getting too close.Additionally, Chiron in Taurus can make you just as critical of yourself as you are of others (if not more so). When you judge someone else, you're masking internal critiques and doubts."

      "content": "Neglect and lack of resources may cause this Chiron’s wounds. Basically, a wound forms when you experience a lack of something important as a Chiron in Taurus—but there are many different ways for that wound to form based on your personal experiences. You may have grown up without much money, lost someone important early on, or suffered emotional neglect from caregivers, for example. If you didn’t lose anything big and significant, consider the things you’re afraid of losing most. Odds are, those fears trace back to Chiron in Taurus. Regardless, finding out which house your Chiron placement is in often speaks to your specific wounds and fears, so check your birth chart for the answer!"
