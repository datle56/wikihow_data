      "content": "Preheat your oven to 350ºF/180ºC and prepare your pan. Get out a baking dish and line it with parchment paper so the cod do not stick to the bottom while cooking.

      "title": "Lightly season both sides of the fish with salt and pepper.",
      "content": "Lightly season both sides of the fish with salt and pepper. Mix 1-2 teaspoons of salt and pepper in a small bowl and apply this to both sides of the fish, sprinkling it on top. There is no \"right\" amount to use, but when in doubt go light -- you can always add more before serving. Place the fillets in the baking dish when you are done. If you have coarse or kosher salt, use this instead of table salt. The larger grains of salt will not dissolve as quickly, leading to a more even flavor in the fish."

      "content": "Mix together the soft butter or margarine, lemon juice. In a small bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon of butter and lemon juice and a dash of onion or garlic powder This is a good time to add any additional seasonings you enjoy. Try out a teaspoon of chili powder, paprika, and/or cayenne for a hotter fish, or oregano, rosemary, thyme, and/or basil for an Italian herb mixture. While you can substitute some olive oil for butter, the fat in butter is essential for keeping the fish moist and flaky."

      "content": "Spread the butter/margarine mixture over the tops of the fish fillets. Place small dollops of the mixture over the fish and use a rubber spatula to evenly coat the tops of the fish. As the fish cooks the butter will melt into the flakes of the fish, coating the inside for a moist, silky, and flaky texture at the end."

      "title": "Bake the fish 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Bake the fish 15 to 20 minutes. When the fish is done the white flesh will easily flake off when pulled with a fork. There should be big full flakes when the fish is cut, not a thin crumb-like texture.. Use a meat thermometer to ensure the inside of the fish is cooked to 165 °F (74 °C). If you'd like, you can remove the fish from the oven once it reaches 160 °F (71 °C)—the temperature will continue to climb for a few minutes, and it should reach 165 °F (74 °C).

You can quickly adapt this recipe to get surprising new flavors with your main dish: Cook the cod with chopped vegetables, such as 1 large tomato, 1 green bell pepper, 1 yellow squash or zucchini, 1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives, halved, and cloves garlic, all finely chopped, for a full one-pan meal. Toss the veggies with 1 tablespoon olive oil and place them around the fish, letting them cook simultaneously.

      "content": "Pre-heat your oven to 425 and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. The foil will prevent the fish from sticking to the bottom. In the event that you don't have foil, lightly brush the bottom of the pan with olive oil or cooking spray."

Toss the mixture so that the ingredients are mixed in evenly and set aside. This breadcrumb mixture is easily customized, as the only \"essential\" ingredients are the breadcrumbs and the salt. If you want new seasonings, you can't go wrong with a teaspoon of chili powder, paprika, and/or cayenne for a hotter fish. For an herb mixture, try 1 tsp dried oregano, rosemary, thyme, and/or basil."

This means you can customize the dish to your liking with a few easy tweaks. For a low-cal version, cut the butter and breadcrumb mixtures in half. Simply drizzle the butter on top of the fish and sprinkle your breadcrumbs only on the top of the fish. Toss 2-3 chopped tomatoes, 4 cloves of garlic, and one sliced onion with a tablespoon of olive oil and surround the fish with the vegetables when cooking for an easy side-dish to go with the fish. Substitute breadcrumbs for 1/2 cup of flour for a lighter coating on your cod. [6] X Research source"
