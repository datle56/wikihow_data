When addressing a business letter to multiple recipients, you will still need to include the header. [1] X Research source In the top right corner of the letter, you should write the recipient' names first. Write the names using formal titles if necessary (e.g., Dr. Nora Woods), and separate the names by a comma (e.g., Dr. Nora Woods, Dr. Mark Brook). Then, write the name of the company on the next line (i.e., Penbrook Medical Associates), and on the next line write the company's address. On the last line write the city, the state abbreviation, and the zip code."

      "content": "Include a carbon copy. However, you may be writing a letter to many, many recipients. In this case, you can include a carbon copy on the bottom of the letter. A carbon copy, or cc, lets others know who else is receiving the letter. You can include a carbon copy somewhere below your signature. [3] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source A carbon copy is usually marked by the words \"cc\" or \"copies to\", usually followed by a colon. Multiple recipients are listed using their full names and alphabetically. For example, \"cc: Dr. Mark Brook, Dr. Nora Woods.\" If the recipients are from a different business, it's important to include that business's name in parentheses after the names. For example, \"cc: Dr. Mark Brooks (Penbrook Medical Associates), Dr. Nora Woods (Shepherd Medical Hospital). Keep in mind, the term \"carbon copy\" means there will be copies of the letter circulating. You should make sure, if you're using a carbon copy, all parties listed receive their own copy of the letter. You should not use a carbon copy if you're only sending the letter to one person."

      "content": "Use an informal word only in certain cases. In rare cases, you may be sending a business letter out to an entire office or a very large group. In this case only, it is appropriate to use an informal word to address the letter. If you're sending a mass e-mail to your entire company, for example, you can write something like, \"Dear Associates\" or \"Dear Colleagues\" if your company consists of well over 10 people. Keep in mind it is always better to get a name, however."

      "title": "Consider formality.",
      "content": "Consider formality. Formality makes a big deal in how you address a letter. When sending out a formal invitation, like a wedding invitation , it's custom to use titles like \"Mr.\" and \"Mrs.\" This is also the case for sending out cover letters. However, if you're sending a casual letter to a close friend or family member, formality matters less. It's appropriate to simply use first names, which may actually be easier when addressing multiple recipients. For example, it's more cumbersome to write \"Dear Mr. Silas Kingsley and Mr. James Knight\" than it is to simply write, \"Dear Silas and James.\" [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Take special considerations with married couples . When addressing a letter to multiple recipients, you're often writing to a married couple. Do some research ahead of time. See whether or not the couple has the same last name, and make sure to address them by the appropriate title in a formal letter. [5] X Research source Whose name comes first is somewhat subjective, but some etiquette rules claim if someone has a high ranking title, like doctor, their name should come first. For example, if you're writing to a husband and wife, and the wife has a PhD, you would write, \"Dear Dr. Jacobs and Mr. Jacobs.\" You could also write, \"Dear Dr. and Mr. Jacobs.\" If no one has a formal title beyond \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\", you can simply write \"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jacobs\" or \"Dear Mr. Jacobs and Mrs. Jacobs.\" This really depends mostly on your preference. You can also try something like, \"Dear Oliver and Marie Jacobs.\" You can also switch up the order of the names. Formal rules of etiquette usually place the man's name first, but this is a largely outdated practice and some people may even take offense. If a couple has different last names, make sure you acknowledge this in your salutation. For example, \"Dear Mr. Jacobs and Ms. Elliot\" or \"Dear Mr. Oliver Jacobs and Ms. Marie Elliot.\" If this is an informal letter , keep things simple. You can just write \"Dear Marie and Oliver\" or \"Dear Oliver and Marie.\""

For example, you can try something like, \"Dear Donahue Family.\" This is a salutation often used in holiday cards. You can also try including a couple of names, but not all the names. If you know a couple with a lot of kids, for example, you can try something like, \"Dear Katie, James, and family.\" For smaller families, including the names of everyone can be a nice touch. If it's not too cumbersome, try to include everyone's name. For example, \"Dear Katie, James, Harper, and Brayden.\""

While it's always ideal to try and get a name, if it's not possible you can use informal words. If you're sending a cover letter to a large literary magazine, you can write \"Dear Editors\" if there are five or six editors that handle submissions. If you're a boss and sending a letter to all your employees, something like \"Dear employees\" is sometimes appropriate. [6] X Research source Keep in mind it's always best to get a name.

[8] X Research source For example, you could write something like \"Mr. Oliver Jacobs and Mrs. Marie Jacobs\" as the recipient's name. If you're limited on space, you can try something like, \"Mr. and Mrs. Jacobs.\" Make sure you get titles correct. For example, if Oliver Jacobs has his PhD, write something like \"Dr. Oliver Jacobs and Mrs. Marie Jacobs.\" Or \"Dr. and Mrs. Jacobs.\" For more informal letters, do not worry as much about titles. If you are writing to close relatives or friends, \"Mr.\" and \"Mrs.\" are no required. Simply write something like, \"Oliver and Marie Jacobs\" or \"Marie and Oliver Jacobs.\""

Many women find it sexist to have their names omitted in a letter. You should err on the side of caution and avoid omitting a woman's name when addressing a letter or envelope."

You can usually figure out a company's hiring manager by browsing their website.
