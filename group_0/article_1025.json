      "content": "Do not put all of your weight on your armpits. You have a multitude of nerves under your armpits, or brachial plexus. These nerves are responsible for sensation and movement for your arms and hands, and putting all of your weight on these nerves can cause nerve damage.

      "content": "Ask for help. More than likely people will be happy to help when they see you struggle. People might even offer to help you before you have to ask. If they offer, say yes. It will be hard doing all of the things you normally do by yourself, so enlisting the help of friends and family members will be a necessary evil for you during this time."

      "title": "Plan ahead.",
      "content": "Plan ahead. Many simple life tasks are exponentially more difficult while you are using crutches. Things like grocery shopping and preparing food become especially challenging while you are restricted in how you can use your hands. The key is to plan ahead for what you’ll need for the week and get some help obtaining those items. If you go grocery shopping, carrying food can throw off your balance. If you put the goods you want to purchase in a bag, it can look like you are trying to steal it. To avoid these potentially embarrassing situations, prepare a list of what you’ll need for the week and ask someone to go shopping for you. You can also use an online delivery service for these things if you can afford it. If you are in school, then avoid wearing a backpack with books in it while you are using crutches. The extra weight can create extra unnecessary pressure on your armpits. Ask a friend to carry your books for you while you are using crutches."

      "content": "Be prepared for the jokes. People can sometimes be cruel when they encounter someone with a disability or who appears different from them in some way. While you are using your crutches, you might get made fun of by someone like this because you are slower than usual, because you can’t do all the things you normally do, or simply because the crutches look different. If this happens to you, don’t take it personally. Just smile and keep moving forward."

      "title": "Decide which kind of crutches you want.",
      "content": "Decide which kind of crutches you want. There are two kinds of crutches: underarm crutches and forearm crutches. Perhaps your doctor will have a preference about which kind he or she prefers you to use, but if the choice is up to you, do a little research to decide which kind would most benefit you. Underarm crutches : These are easier to master and maneuver than forearm crutches, but can lead to more soreness and discomfort from the way they press against your body during use. Forearm crutches : These require more upper body strength than underarm crutches and can be more difficult to navigate initially, but they are better suited for long term use than underarm crutches."
