      "title": "Determine the mass",
      "content": "Determine the mass of an object. If you are solving a problem where the mass isn’t given, you will have to determine the mass yourself. This can be done by weighing the object on a balance and obtaining the mass in kilograms (kg). Tare the balance. Before you weigh your object, you must set it to zero. Zeroing out the scale is called taring. [6] X Research source Place your object in the balance. Gently, place the object on the balance and record its mass in kilograms. If necessary, convert grams to kilograms. For the final calculation, the mass must be in kilograms."

      "title": "Calculate the velocity",
      "content": "Calculate the velocity of the object. Oftentimes, the problem will give you the velocity of the object. If this is not the case, you can determine the velocity by using the distance an object travels and how long it takes to cover that distance. [7] X Research source The units for velocity are meters per second (m/s). Velocity is defined by the equation, displacement divided by time: V = d/t . Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both a magnitude and a direction. Magnitude is the number value that quantifies the speed, while the direction is the direction in which the speed takes place during motion. For example, an object’s velocity can be 80 m/s or -80 m/s depending on the direction of travel. To calculate velocity, simply divide the distance the object traveled by the time it took to travel that distance."

Since you know the mass and velocity of the woman, you can plug it into the equation: [9] X Research source KE = 0.5 x mv 2 KE = 0.5 x 55 x (3.87) 2"
