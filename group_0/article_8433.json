      "content": "Wipe down the controller with the mixture using a microfiber towel. Spray 2 to 3 spurts of your disinfectant onto a clean microfiber towel. Wipe down the entire surface of the controller. Once the clean side of the towel gets dirty, flip it to the other side. [2] X Research source You can also use a soft cloth or lint-free paper towel. However, microfiber towels are better at trapping dirt and reducing the risk of scratching glossy parts of the controller."

Continue doing this for each button, including those on the D-pad. Don't worry if rubbing alcohol gets stuck inside the button gap—it will eventually evaporate. [5] X Research source Use a toothpick to get dirt that your cotton swab can't reach. Just be careful not to jam it in too hard and damage the buttons. If you're having a hard time cleaning the button gaps, focus on the surfaces. Wipe the buttons down with a clean cloth or towel when you're finished."
