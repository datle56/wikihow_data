      "content": "This aesthetic is all about easy-breezy looks and a cozy beachside lifestyle. Picture this: a knit sweater, tea brewing, and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore just outside. With roots in the coastal grandmother TikTok trend from the Summer of 2023, this variation has inspired a younger generation of beachy trend-setters. The coastal grandmother aesthetic was based on Nancy Meyers movies, so think of Something’s Gotta Give , It’s Complicated , and The Parent Trap. [1] X Research source The coastal granddaughter vibe is more laid-back and promotes cozy living, with an emphasis on bucket hats, thrifted button-downs, and elegant, minimalist jewelry. It's the old money aesthetic meets beach babe. The coastal granddaughter is likely to enjoy listening to pop-rock, journaling, riding her bike along the boardwalk, and having sunset beach picnics."

      "content": "Tops The coastal granddaughter dresses for beachside success, meaning airy, flowy button-downs over bikinis, breezy linen fabrics, and cozy knits for those chillier evenings. Try draping a blue striped button-down over a white bikini for an effortless nautical look. If you envision the coastal granddaughter as more of an indoor gal, try a knit sweater, a fisherman's sweater, or a neutral cardigan. The buttons on the cardigan will give a similar vibe to a button-down shirt with the added touch of cozy elegance. [2] X Research source Button-down shirts: Button-down shirts come in all shapes and sizes, but for this specific coastal aesthetic, you want to pick out neutral tones as well as blue and seafoam green. Patterns, like stripes, are very trendy and nautically appropriate. You’ll also want a looser, oversized fit so you can really feel the ocean breeze! Sweaters and cardigans: The coastal grandchild loves a cozy night in as much as her grandmother counterpart, so get those cable-knit sweaters and beige cardigans ready! The coastal granddaughter can often be found making a mug of hot cocoa by the fireplace with an ambient playlist playing. After all, the coast can get cold, so a comfy sweater can really come in handy. Light linen top: For those warm summer days, a light linen top or cotton t-shirt or blouse are necessary closet staples. You can throw on an airy top to ride your bike into town, pick fresh produce at the farmer’s market, or simply take a leisurely stroll by the shoreline. Whatever her summer pastime of choice is, the coastal granddaughter wants to be both comfortable and chic."

      "title": "Bottoms",
      "content": "Bottoms Just like the tops, bottoms in the coastal granddaughter aesthetic have range. When spending a preppy summer in Martha’s Vineyard, khakis are key, as are linen pants and long, flowy skirts. You can also bring in denim for that nautical pop of blue. Depending on the season, mix and match them with any of the tops for the ultimate elevated beach look that Ina Garten’s granddaughter would be proud of. Probably. [3] X Research source Khakis: These will help you fit right into the East Coast fashion world, as these preppy pants are iconic. Not only do khakis go with almost everything, but they really dress up a simple outfit. Try wearing them with a sweater or cardigan to find that perfect medium between a wealthy scholar and a cozy coastal princess. Linen pants: These breezy bottoms work perfectly as a swimsuit cover-up! Throw them on over your bikini and walk into town for the best white sangria you’ve ever had. Or, casually lounge in them at home for a laid-back fit. No matter what, you can’t go wrong with linen pants in the summer. Long flowy skirts: Flowy skirts can be midi or maxi, as long as they keep the coastal granddaughter looking and feeling cool. A white linen skirt is perfect for more romantic beachside activity, like walking hand in hand on the sand with a coastal grandson type or laying down a blanket for a sunset picnic. Jeans: Denim will never go out of style, so feel free to invest in a few pairs of jeans to add to your coastal granddaughter look. The pop of blue will pair perfectly with a neutral button-down or cardigan, and you can dress this outfit up or down, depending on the occasion. The coastal granddaughter is nothing if not versatile!"

If you’re planning on going to the beach, sandals or even high-end flip-flops would work. If you’re planning on a date night out to the cute Italian restaurant on the boardwalk, a pair of beige espadrilles would surely compliment a flowy white dress. For everything else beachy and cozy– there are sneakers! Sandals: If you want your feet to be free in order to feel the breeze and sand, a pair of nice sandals is an excellent addition to any outfit. They can be strappy or simple, as long as the pedicure shines. Espadrilles: Fun fact: these rope-heeled shoes have roots dating back to 13th century Spain, along the French border. [4] X Research source However, they can be found in your coastal cottage in no time! Espadrilles with high heels offer a great approach to spicing up an outfit, especially if you’re wearing shorts or a dress! Sneakers: A pair of clean white sneakers will add comfort and lightness to the coastal granddaughter vibe. You can wear them to go on a sunrise walk or to ride your bike on cooler or more active days along the coast. Clogs: A trendy lounge shoe for the home, these neutral-toned slip-ons are a coastal granddaughter’s dream. Pair your clogs with thick socks for a cozy and coastal experience."

      "content": "Food and Drink If the coastal grandmother was inspired by the culinary queen herself, Ina Garten, then the coastal grandchild has got to have a similar affinity for the finer things in life. This coastal gal loves burrata from the farmer’s market on a piece of homemade focaccia with a drizzle of organic olive oil and balsamic vinegar. There’s also a huge emphasis on fresh seafood since she’s a coastal cutie, so white wine pasta with mussels, grilled shrimp, and oysters are all part of a balanced coastal girl diet. For dessert, she’ll want some fruit and cheese or an artisanal, hand-churned ice cream cone from the shop down the boardwalk. Hint: she’s going through a pistachio phase."

Try starting small with an herb garden: basil for pasta, mint for mojitos, and rosemary to bake into bread! If an outdoor open flame isn’t your thing, the coastal granddaughter can easily translate her talents indoors in the kitchen. Baking, cooking, and entertaining— those are a few of her favorite things!"

      "content": "This aesthetic features neutrals, natural textures, and cozy charm. That’s right—cozy comfy coastal chic can now be used to describe your home, adding all the cute, nautical touches you didn’t even know were missing. If you’ve never considered neutral tones, pops of blue, or lacey cream curtains —it’s time. Here are some tips and tricks on how to turn your apartment into a trendy beach shack. [6] X Research source Keep a muted color palette. Since the coastal grandchild aesthetic is inspired by the beach, the colors should reflect that as well. White, cream, and beige decor are all on theme, but don’t be afraid to include blues and pale greens as well. After all, the beach is not monochromatic, so your home shouldn’t be either. Set a light and breezy atmosphere. You can do this by incorporating more white into everything—from linen bed sheets to lacey curtains to fluffy throw pillows . The white not only matches the beautiful ocean foam but also helps create a clean, elegant, and relaxed aesthetic. Introduce organic textures. Wood adds to the funky beachside feel, and distressed rugs , along with other woven pieces, create a natural, organic environment, making you feel like you’re right there on the sand! Bring in pops of blue decor. There are many different ways to do this. You can apply blue-patterned wallpaper to your living room, or adorn your coffee table with a bouquet of hydrangeas. You can also include nautical motifs, like a blue-striped throw pillow or a mason jar full of colorful seashells."
