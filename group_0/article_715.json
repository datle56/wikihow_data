If the cells you're adding together use formulas that contain non-numeric characters, then you'll need to add =VALUE at the start of those formulas in order to use the SUM function. [2] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source If either of the cells you're adding contains anything other than the standard =SUM() formula, you'll have to enclose that whole formula within the parentheses of the =VALUE() function to avoid errors. Do the following in each of the cell you're adding: Double-click the cell containing the formula. If the formula is standard, such as =SUM(A1:A15) , you don't have to make any changes.

Go to source If the cell contains other functions (such as IF or AVERAGE ), letters, or quotes, enclose the formula within the parentheses of the =VALUE() function. For example, =SUM(AVERAGE(A1:A15),AVERAGE(B1:B15)) would become =VALUE(SUM(AVERAGE(A1:A15),AVERAGE(B1:B15) )) ."
