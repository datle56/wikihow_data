      "content": "Choose a compact \"point-and-shoot\" camera for portability and ease of use. Digital cameras can be simple, point-and-shoot devices about the size of a cellphone, or they can have multiple parts and provide more detailed photos. Point-and-shoot cameras are the smallest models you'll find. They tend to have fewer buttons on the back, and consequently, also offer fewer customized settings like photo-cropping or zoom capabilities. However, this may not be a bad thing since auto-modes require less fuss and technical expertise. There are always trade-offs when choosing a camera. [1] X Research source If you want the best image possible, you'll need expensive, specialized, bulky equipment. However, cameras which offer more settings (like different levels of zoom, interchangeable lenses, wide angle shot capabilities) also require the most effort and \"know-how.\" A relatively cheap and highly recommended point-and-shoot camera is the Canon PowerShot Elph 330 HS, which can go for around $180.

      "title": "Opt for a digital \"SLR\" camera for better shooting control and image quality.",
      "content": "Opt for a digital \"SLR\" camera for better shooting control and image quality. SLR stands for \"single lens reflex\" and simply means that the camera uses one lens to capture photos rather two lenses, which is characteristic of most smaller cameras. [3] X Research source A camera which requires two hands to steady it is likely a DSLR. These cameras are bigger, heavier, and more expensive than others. However, they also offer the largest image sensors (for higher resolutions), fastest focus speeds (for \"action\" shots), and a wide variety of lenses for controlling zoom and light exposure. When you look through a DSLR lens, you are seeing exactly what will be captured. On two lens cameras, the lens you look through is different than the actual lens used to take the picture. Since DSLRs provide the most accurate picture with little margin of error, they are generally preferred among professional photographers. [4] X Research source Another benefit of single lens cameras is that they capture photos almost instantly with no lag time. This is optimal for capturing moving objects, like children playing sports. [5] X Research source DSLRs are the most optimal for professional use such as taking wedding photos or pictures for magazines."

      "title": "Buy a mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera for higher quality and portability.",
      "content": "Buy a mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera for higher quality and portability. Mirrorless cameras lack a mirror to reflect the light from the image. Instead, the light passes right through the lens and directly onto the image sensor. This model of camera is touted as a less bulkier version of the DSLR camera. While they usually require detachable lenses for zoom and light exposure control, they also tend to be more portable and easier to use than DSLR cameras. Because these models lack a mirror system, they tend to be smaller and simpler to use, but they still yield resolutions which rival those of DSLRs. [6] X Research source Unfortunately, mirrorless models also tend to be quite pricey (reaching costs of up to $6800). The most reasonable priced mirrorless camera may be the Alpha 3000 (priced at about $350). Though this is considered an \"entry-level\" model, it will still yield high quality without putting significant strain on your back or wallet."

      "title": "Pick a camera with more megapixels for higher resolutions.",
      "content": "Pick a camera with more megapixels for higher resolutions. Megapixels are typically the most highly advertised feature of a camera and relate to how clear an image is. Specifically, a megapixel is a unit of measurement which represents one million pixels of an image. Pixels are those tiny dots of color which make up an image. Thus, more megapixels equals higher resolution photos. Be wary of megapixel marketing ploys. Like all features, more megapixels means more money. In order to keep consumers buying their products, most companies advertise higher megapixels as a \"big upgrade\" from their previous models. While this may have been important to consider in the past, most point-and-shoot cameras today are packed with enough megapixels for making large prints. [7] X Research source High quality point-and-shoot cameras have 12-18 megapixels and will give you relatively high resolutions. If you're only transferring photos to your computer, 1-3 megapixels will suffice since that is the average amount on a standard computer. [8] X Research source For making prints on 6x4 paper, 2 megapixels are adequate. For printing pictures on 10x8 paper or larger, 5-7 megapixels should do."

      "title": "Select higher zoom capabilities if you intend on capturing far-away objects.",
      "content": "Select higher zoom capabilities if you intend on capturing far-away objects. If you plan on capturing large structures like mountains or the sky, or snapping pictures of elusive animals, variable zooms will come in handy. Most point-and-shoot cameras have different zoom qualities, labeled things like \"5x\" or \"7x.\" This simply refers to how many times a photo becomes enlarged compared to its original distance. For smaller cameras with a zoom function, a 28 mm wide lens is recommended. The reason is because the wider lens won't distort pictures which are far away, making wide-angle shots like group photos or family portraits clear and precise. [9] X Research source To get even closer to the action, \"superzoom\" cameras are available. These offer zoom functions up to 50x and can resemble larger DSLR cameras. This is a nice balance between point-and-shoot and DSLR cameras, since the built-in zoom provides higher resolution without the need for detachable lenses. An affordable superzoom camera is the Fujifilm FinePix SL1000 (average cost of $280)."

      "title": "Choose a \"no-zoom\" camera for taking up-close photos.",
      "content": "Choose a \"no-zoom\" camera for taking up-close photos. No-zoom cameras tend to have big image sensors, allowing for wider-angle shots and yielding resolutions comparable to DSLrs. A no zoom camera is best if you tend to take closer photos. You won't have to spend extra money for higher zoom functions and you can also avoid the complexities of detachable lenses. While they provide high quality photos, no zoom cameras also offer the compactness of point-and-shoot cameras. Because of these benefits, however, no zoom cameras tend to be very expensive ($800-$2000 range). A cheaper no-zoom camera is the Ricoh GR, which typically costs around $670. This camera has an optimal 28 mm wide lens while still being slim enough to fit in the pockets of your jeans. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick a camera with auto-focus if you have less experience with cameras.",
      "content": "Pick a camera with auto-focus if you have less experience with cameras. Auto-focus means exactly as its name states, and will automatically adjust the camera lens to obtain focus on the subject. DSLRs tend to be manual focus, meaning that for each detachable lens, you have to rotate the tube of the lens until a photo comes into focus. While this may yield a better quality photo, it may also mean that you miss that perfect opportunity to snap something rare, like your son's soccer goal or your daughter's graduation handshake. [11] X Research source One benefit of point-and-shoot cameras is not only autofocus, but features like \"face recognition.\" This feature intelligently detects faces of people and places colored boxes around them to help you take the most precise portrait possible."

      "content": "Select a camera with higher shutter speeds if you plan on taking \"action\" shots. Shutter speed refers to how long the camera spends collecting light. Faster times mean less blurry, accurate photos. For example, a camera with a shutter speed of 1/125 spends 125th of a second collecting light. The higher the denominator in the fraction, the quicker the camera snaps the photo. [12] X Research source Lower shutter speeds allow more light into the photo, which may be optimal if you are shooting at night or in dark areas. However, if you're trying to snap sports shots during the day, lower shutter speeds may result in blurring around the moving object. [13] X Research source"

CNET.com and Overstock.com specialize in deals for a wide range of products, including digital cameras. Overstock.com isn't just an online supplier, it is specifically aimed at providing deals to customers. [16] X Research source Other online or in-person vendors will use marketing tricks like \"marking down an item 50%\" from a sometimes imaginary, absurdly high price that isn't stated. Instead, Overstock lists prices plainly and will sometimes tell you its original price and the real amount you'll be saving (for example, 34% savings). CNET advertises price ranges, for example $150-$170. Instead of deciding on a single, standalone price, you can compare prices for one model or across different ones. Online vendors like CNET, Overstock, and Amazon offer credible user ratings and reviews which you can also read to inform your decision. For instance, if you notice a camera is only $200 but has a 1-star rating from 800 different users, you can probably surmise that it isn't worth your troubles."

      "title": "Consider buying a used camera from reputable vendors like Amazon or eBay.",
      "content": "Consider buying a used camera from reputable vendors like Amazon or eBay. Unlike microphones and headphones, which tend to be more delicate electronics, cameras tend to be more durable and will still be usable provided that the lens is in good shape. [17] X Research source Amazon.com will specify the exact condition the used product is in. For example, it it will classify items as \"Good,\" \"Very Good,\" or \"Like New.\" These are the qualities you want. If you can, buy a \"Like New\" item, as this will most likely be a new item that is technically classified as \"used\" because it has been opened. Online vendors may also provide further details of the used product. For instance, \"This camera is only 7 days out of the box. I am selling it because I found a cheaper deal on a better model.\" Or, \"This camera is still relatively new. I've only had it for a week. There is some light scratching around the shutter button but the lens is scratch-free.\" Avoid buying used items from disreputable vendors or from users with no ratings. People with high user ratings typically sell their items exactly as described and will be less likely to scam you with a damaged product. Craigslist is only slightly reputable, as scams have commonly occurred between users. If you do choose to buy from Craigslist, be sure that images of the camera are displayed on the ad, that you talk to the vendor over the phone first, and that you make your transaction in a public place.

      "title": "Test-drive your camera in-store before actually buying it.",
      "content": "Test-drive your camera in-store before actually buying it. The benefit of buying offline is that many electronics stores will let you use the product to determine if it is to your liking. Cameras are often tethered to a display in-store to prevent stealing. However, if you ask to use the camera, some salespeople will un-tether the camera and let you snap pictures freely. Holding the camera in your hands is a small but invaluable feature that online stores simply can't offer. Knowing how comfortable the camera is in your hands, seeing the actual picture quality, and listening to the salesperson highlight its benefits/disadvantages will help you make the best decision possible. Electronics stores also tend to offer warranties and return periods that online vendors don't. If you buy a camera online and decide it's not to your liking, you might have to pay a shipping and re-stocking fee just to get your refund. For the best of both worlds, test a specific camera model in-store to see if you like it. If you do, try to find a better online deal for that same model."

Some stores like Target, Best Buy, and Fry's Electronics will match deals from certain online websites. Your deals may be limited to specific websites such as Amazon or B&H Photo Video. Also, other stipulations may be in place, such as only matching one item per customer, or only matching items which are currently in-stock on the rival website. [19] X Research source Regardless of the stipulations, this is your best chance to find a good deal while also testing the camera in person. Don't be afraid of haggling or trying to bargain with the salesperson for an even better price."

      "content": "Remember that point-and-shoot and no-zoom cameras are a one-time cost. Since the features are already built into these cameras, you'll most likely only end up paying for nonessential accessories like camera straps or carrying cases. DSLRs and mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras require you to purchase detachable lenses for different zooms and for controlling how much light is allowed into a photo. While lenses are technically optional, some experts suggest that you need 3 different lenses for the best DSLR experience. [20] X Research source The most basic detachable lens can still cost about $200 dollars, which is the total amount of some point-and-shoot cameras. Quality lenses can cost up to $1,000 and sometimes even reach $11,000, costing more than some of the more affordable DSLR cameras themselves. In addition to lenses, DSLR cameras insist on using other \"essential\" items like light reflectors, tripods, or camera filters. [21] X Research source For experienced photographers, you'll be able to easily discern which accessories are needed and which are optional. The average camera user, however, may feel overwhelmed and obliged to buy attachments they won't use."

      "title": "Only buy attachments you will absolutely need.",
      "content": "Only buy attachments you will absolutely need. Maybe you are a indeed a professional photographer who requires a DSLR camera. In this case, think of exactly the type of photos you'll be capturing and buy your accessories accordingly. For example, if you're snapping football pictures for a sports publication, you probably won't have to worry about shadows in the picture. Photographers who snap models typically suffer the most from unwanted shadows and will probably purchase something like a mini softbox to eliminate harsh shadows. [22] X Research source If you're lugging around a heavy camera all day, you'll probably want a neck strap to rest your arms in between shots. Though they make a camera look more \"official,\" a neck strap won't be necessary for lighter DSLRs or mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras. Some items will be very necessary for maintaining your camera. For example, a camera carrying case will snugly and safely fit your camera when you transport it. Also, a cleaning cloth will keep your lens free of blemishes and won't be as abrasive as other, non-specialized cleaning tools. [23] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy from a popular brand if you're still uncertain about quality.",
      "content": "Buy from a popular brand if you're still uncertain about quality. Chances are that Canon, Sony, and Nikon will provide better quality cameras than unknown, obscure brands. Off-brand digital cameras are usually inexpensive because they don't deliver the same speed, power, and image quality as proven brands. Though this isn't always the case, just remember that the popular brands are popular because they tend to produce consistent results. Just because you buy from a known vendor doesn't mean you have to buy the most expensive model. Buying a cheaper Nikon will probably be safer than buying a similar Insignia model at the same price."

The Nokia Lumia 1020 offers an astounding 41 megapixels, which is significantly greater than your average point-and-shoot camera. In addition, this phone has a 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) image sensor, rivaling a Nikon DSLRs 1.69 inches (4.3 cm).

While cellphone resolutions are rivaling and surpassing their digital camera counterparts, they also lack certain features that will improve the overall quality. While convenient all-in-one devices, smartphones also lack high quality optics and sensors. This means that poorly lit photos won't be as detailed on your phone as they are on digital cameras. [28] X Research source You also won't be able to control your smartphone's shutter speed, which can yield blurry action photos. Smartphone cameras are best used as alternatives for point-and-shoot cameras. Since point-and-shoot models are aimed at casual photographers, chances are the few extra features that are available will end up being unused anyway.
