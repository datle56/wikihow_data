Make sure you're on a government website—most of them use the extension “.gov.” Scan the page for the link to the information you need. Each state’s website is different, but it’s safe to assume you’ll need to enter your vehicle’s VIN number (and perhaps other vehicle or driver/owner info) in order to access the current registration status. In Florida, for example, you need either the VIN number or the vehicle’s title number, while in Ohio you need the license plate number, last 4 digits of the VIN, and your email address. Here are the links to the appropriate sites for each of the 10 largest U.S. states (by population): California ; Texas ; Florida ; New York ; Pennsylvania ; Illinois; Ohio ; Georgia ; North Carolina ; Michigan ."

While most people find it easier to get their registration information online, you also have the option of calling your state's department of motor vehicles. Look for the toll-free number on the website, your registration card, or your driver’s license. Have as much information about your vehicle, license, and registration on hand as possible before calling. When you do call, calmly and clearly explain to the customer service representative what information you need from them.

Before heading out, collect any documents you think could possibly be relevant—your driver’s license, most recent registration card, insurance card, vehicle title, and so on. Be thorough so you don’t have to end up making a second trip!

Insurance lapses and traffic citations are the most common causes of registration suspensions, but you might have a suspension due to unpaid tolls or traffic tickets, among other possibilities. If you get official notification (nearly always by mail) of a registration suspension, and want to restore your registration, contact your DMV (online, by phone, or in person) and be prepared to provide documentation to support your case for restoration. [4] X Trustworthy Source State of Pennsylvania Official website for the State of Pennsylvania Go to source For example, if your registration was suspended due to lapsed vehicle insurance, get proof of insurance documentation from your insurance company. Or, if it was suspended for unpaid tolls, gather documentation showing that you have paid all overdue tolls (and any fines). Don’t be surprised if you have to pay some sort of fine or fee in order to restore your registration. If you believe your registration was wrongly suspended, gather whatever documentation you have to support your case, and consider consulting an attorney with relevant experience."

      "content": "This varies by state, but the card contains basic vehicle and owner info. When you registered (or renewed the registration for) your vehicle, you almost certainly received an official registration card to keep in the vehicle. This card contains general information about the person the car is registered to (likely you), such as name, address, and driver’s license number. It also displays basic info for the vehicle, such as the make, model year, and VIN number, and the expiration date for your current registration. The size, shape, and layout of the registration card varies by state, but it’s typically small enough to easily fit into your vehicle’s glovebox—because this is the recommended place to keep it! (Most states require you to keep your registration card in your vehicle, and to show it to law enforcement if requested.) Some states also require you to affix registration stickers to your license plate(s). These should arrive by mail along with your new/renewed registration card. If your registration has been suspended, your card won't reveal this information. You’ll have to check online, by phone, or in person."
