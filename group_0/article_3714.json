      "content": "Choose 3 to 4 niches and create UGC social media accounts. Include a username that matches your niches, a bio with your experience and interests, and an email for brands to contact you with. [1] X Research source Example niches include skincare or make-up, organization, pets, health, wellness, or fitness, food, parenting, gaming, travel, crafting, photography, décor, tech, books, cooking, or fashion. Posting videos on social media and gaining followers isn’t required, but it can allow you to get feedback from viewers, attract attention from brands, and show brands your content is proven to work. TikTok and Instagram are typically the best sites to post UGC, but use Twitter and LinkedIn to network with brands and get bookings. When posting, try not to use tags like #UGC or #UGCcreator. Instead, use industry and product-related hashtags."

For each niche, include an unboxing video, a review or testimonial, and a product demonstration.

Review or testimonial videos are where you share your opinion or feedback about a product and make you want to buy that product after watching it. [3] X Research source Product demonstrations might be where you present a problem and use the product as a solution or show how the product works in a creative way. [4] X Research source You can also include a lifestyle video where you film your daily routine using the product. [5] X Research source Incorporate TikTok or Instagram trends into your videos to make them more engaging. Look at the content the brands you’re interested in are already posting or sharing to tailor the UGC in your portfolio to their industry and target audience. [6] X Research source To start, target your videos and photos to startups and small businesses that are starting to establish a social media presence and are more likely to need UGC."

Page 1: Include your name, a professional photo, your email and/or phone number, and links to your social media. [8] X Research source Page 2: Insert 5 to 10 of your best videos directly onto the slide. Add at least 1 of every niche and 1 of each video type (an unboxing, a review, and a product demonstration). [9] X Research source Turn off autoplay on your videos and make sure that the very first video includes you talking.

[13] X Research source Page 6: Include a breakdown of the services you offer and (optionally) your rates. [14] X Research source For example, you might offer 10- to 60-second short-form videos in vertical format including editing, sounds, text to screen, and voiceovers. If you write your rates, say that your “starting rate” is $150 per video and make it clear that this number is negotiable. [15] X Research source As you gain more experience in the industry and upgrade your setup, you may be able to raise your rates.

[18] X Research source Contact official brand accounts or the company’s head of marketing using their listed email. If they don’t have an email, message them directly on the site. You can also look for brands doing callouts for UGC creators on these sites and follow the instructions they provide to apply. Once you start posting more content and connecting with other UGC creators, you might not have to do so much outreach. On these platforms, you can also follow UGC creators who post behind-the-scenes details on how to negotiate brand deals and how much they get paid."

To increase content quality, try using golden hour lighting or ring lights, using backdrops, telling engaging stories, or showing more energetic and genuine reactions to the product.

[36] X Research source With UGC, brands only pay for the content itself, which is often the same quality or better, and they have complete control over the content’s distribution. The more reach and engagement an influencer has, the more the brand pays. UGC creators are everyday people, while influencers and content creators are professionals who build a brand and influence culture. [37] X Research source UGC also acts as social proof, showing that real people are buying and using a product, which can drive more sales. [38] X Research source"
