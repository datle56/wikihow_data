      "content": "Choose the most practical wall for your headboard to rest up against. As is often the case with small bedrooms, there may only be 1 wall in your room that makes sense for the placement of the headboard or the head of the bed. [1] X Research source Locate the wall that works best for this purpose and build your layout around it. This may be the wall across from the door, the wall with electrical outlets on either side, or the wall that positions your bed directly under the ceiling fan. With other placement options, you might not be able to access your closet or close your door without shimmying around it. Don’t be afraid to put the head of your bed beneath a window if this seems like the best option for your room. Try not to overcomplicate the placement of your bed. Avoid setting it on an angle unless you’re following an angled wall, since this will just eat up precious floorspace."

      "content": "Center your headboard along the wall for symmetry. If you want to be able to walk around all the sides of your bed, centering the bed along the wall with space left on either side may be the best choice. If you choose this option, try to keep the rest of your layout relatively symmetrical and balanced. This can be useful for 2 people who wake up at different times, since each person can comfortably roll out on their own side. It’s also a good choice if you like being able to comfortably make the bed and change the sheets. [2] X Research source A symmetrical layout works best for rooms with symmetry. If you have an offset closet door or an angled wall, consider an asymmetrical approach instead. Take into account how big the bed can be. For instance, a queen vs a full bed isn't a huge difference, but that can determine whether you have room for two nightstands or just one.

      "content": "Align the bed toward 1 side of the room to accommodate large furniture. Pick the most practical wall to press your headboard against, but instead of centering the bed along the wall, slide it over to one side. This may leave some extra space in front of your closet door, or it might allow you to squeeze a larger piece of furniture along the opposite wall. If you’re worried about fitting in a heavy dresser into your space with a centered bed frame, or if your room is full of quirky angles, doors, or permanent fixtures, opt for asymmetry. Maintain floor space on either side of the bed for easier access. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Push the bed into a corner to open up the floor space. This arrangement can be perfect for long, narrow spaces. [5] X Research source Place your bed in the corner of your choice, with the headboard and 1 side of your bed touching the walls. This will leave the rest of the room open for other furniture items. You may want to choose the corner furthest from your bedroom door or any closet doors. Feel free to place your bed along a wall with a window. If there’s any space left at the foot of your bed, take advantage of it! This could be a perfect spot for a few storage bins or your laundry hamper."

      "title": "Situate the head of the bed beneath the lowest part of a sloped ceiling.",
      "content": "Situate the head of the bed beneath the lowest part of a sloped ceiling. Sloped ceilings can make small rooms feel even more compressed, but proper placement of your bed will alleviate this issue. Push the head of the bed along the wall beneath the low point of the slope. In most cases, this is practical because you’ll be lying down and won’t miss the lost headspace. Leave as much open floor space as possible beneath the higher parts of the ceiling so you can walk around without bumping your head. If you have an A-frame ceiling, try a symmetrical layout instead. Position the headboard beneath the highest point and 2 low nightstands on either side of the bed. Just keep in mind that you’ll have less space for other furniture pieces."

      "title": "Downsize your bed, if possible.",
      "content": "Downsize your bed, if possible. A king-sized bed will usually overwhelm a small bedroom. Even a queen-sized bed might make your space feel cramped. If you can, choose a smaller mattress and bed frame, such as a full-sized bed (also known as a double bed) or a twin bed , for your small bedroom. In a guest bedroom, consider using a sleeper sofa or a narrow daybed. These take up a smaller footprint and will make the room functional when you don’t have guests. If you’re really committed to maximizing the space in your room, mount a Murphy bed on your wall to keep the floor space open during the day. This type of bed rests on a hinge. It can be folded away to lay vertically against the wall or brought down to lay flat at night."

      "content": "Measure all of your furniture pieces to ensure they’ll fit in your space. A small bedroom will usually fit your bed, but it might not be able to accommodate all of your bedroom furniture. Before you bring large, heavy pieces into the space, measure them with a tape measure and check the dimensions within the space itself. Create a floorplan of your bedroom to experiment with different layouts before you commit to one. Measurements are essential! You can go online and find places where you can easily make a floor plan and drag furniture on it to scale, so you'll know exactly what works in the space.

      "title": "Try using 2 nightstands for storage and symmetry.",
      "content": "Try using 2 nightstands for storage and symmetry. If you have 2 matching nightstands or bedside tables, place 1 on either side of the head of your bed. This might fill up the entire wall, but it will yield a balanced and minimalistic layout. [7] X Research source Opt for functional nightstands with drawers or shelf storage to get the most out of this layout. Instead of using your nightstands for storing useless trinkets or memorabilia, convert them to functional storage units and store clothes inside."

      "title": "Use just 1 nightstand to free up some floor space.",
      "content": "Use just 1 nightstand to free up some floor space. Abandon the idea of a matching pair of nightstands and place 1 on the side of the bed with the most space. Or, maximize your use of vertical space by swapping out a second nightstand for a more functional chest of drawers that takes up the same footprint. [8] X Research source If you’ve offset your bed or positioned it in a corner, you’ll probably only be able to fit 1 nightstand next to your bed. This strategy can also be used with a centered bed if you don’t mind the asymmetry. A tall dresser on 1 side and a low nightstand on the other can be balanced out if you place a tall table lamp on the shorter table or hang a tall framed picture above it."

      "content": "Get rid of the nightstands altogether to make room for larger items. If you have an especially tight room, you might not have enough space for 1 or 2 tables. Or, you may have the physical space but may feel that nightstands are a waste of this space. In either case, don’t use any! [9] X Research source You can free up some floor space for larger, more functional pieces like dressers or wardrobes. Try using floor lamps or wall-mounted sconces to bring some lighting into your space, now that bedside table lamps aren’t possible. Use a nearby windowsill for small storage, or utilize the top of your dresser for the typical nightstand contents. Consider storing things you’d like to have at arm’s reach in an under-bed storage basket that you can easily slide out and tuck away."

      "content": "Opt for fewer full-sized furniture pieces instead of more miniature pieces. Don’t panic and buy a bunch of tiny tables for your small bedroom! Skinny nightstands and narrow bookshelves can actually be dwarfed by a larger bed or heavier dresser, making your space look more cramped and off-balance. [10] X Research source Stick with full-sized furniture and use only the necessary pieces. If you’re downsizing from a bigger space, know that you can’t keep everything in your smaller bedroom. Be selective in what pieces you choose to include, keeping the ones that provide the most storage or add the most visual impact. However, stay away from bulky furniture like sofas that can bring the room down, unless you have really high ceilings. [11] X Expert Source Kanika Khurana Interior Designer Expert Interview. 9 October 2020. Try moving extra pieces into other parts of your home. For instance, your dresser can probably stay in your bedroom while your shoe cabinet might be relocated to your entryway."

      "content": "Prioritize taller dressers over low ones. When floor space is scarce, a long and low dresser might be impractical. Taller pieces tend to have deeper drawers and just enough space on top for a lamp and a picture frame or a storage basket. Don’t be afraid to use a piece of furniture that’s not technically a dresser. A living room chest of drawers or a bathroom shelving unit might be perfect for your small bedroom.

      "content": "Design your layout around how you actually use the space. As they say in the design world, form follows function. This means you should create the form or layout of your room based on the functionality you need. Think about how you typically interact with your bedroom space and try to make these activities easier. If you sit up in bed and watch TV every night, mount your TV on the wall across from your bed so you don’t have to strain your neck. [13] X Research source If your bed functions as a second office, you may want to incorporate lots of lighting and keep a nightstand open for your coffee, notebook, and charging phone. If you make your bed every day, leave enough space around all sides of the mattress so this task doesn’t become even more of a chore."

      "content": "Provide ample storage to help you keep your small space tidy. Cluttered rooms always look smaller and more visually overwhelming. Focus on giving yourself easy-to-access storage spots and catchall spaces to help you maintain a clean and orderly room. Think about your messier habits as well, and provide solutions ahead of time. [14] X Research source Give each type of item a “home” within your room. This way you’ll be able to easily put things back in the correct spot and out of sight. Your belongings should fit comfortably in their designated spaces. There’s no point in assigning a tiny drawer to your bulky sweaters. You won’t be able to stuff them all in and the drawer will overflow. Pick 1 or 2 deep drawers instead. If you have the space, add a small chair or bench as a catchall for your stuff.

      "content": "Take advantage of the room’s height with vertical storage. Try placing an overhead shelf above your bed, whether it’s part of your headboard or freely mounted on the wall above. Consider hanging 1 large shelf or a series of smaller shelves over a dresser to make the most use of the available wall space. Or, if you have room for a desk, opt for a desk with a hutch. [16] X Research source Organize your belongings in baskets and bins so they’re easier to get off of taller shelves. Use these hard-to-reach spots for off-season clothes and accessories, memorabilia, and things you only need to access once in a while. Don’t store your favorite socks in a basket that you can only reach with a stepladder!"

      "content": "Loft your bed and make use of under-bed storage. Depending on the type of bed frame you have, you may be able to raise it up on risers, or you can purchase a bed frame with sufficient height and open space below. Pick out a series of under-bed storage containers such as plastic bins on wheels or woven baskets for extra storage. [17] X Research source If you’re looking for a new bed frame for your small room, consider a platform bed with built-in storage spaces. Just make sure the bins you choose come with lids. This will protect your belongings from dust bunnies."

      "content": "Opt for a monochromatic color scheme to reduce visual clutter. You don’t just need to stick with shades of white to make your tiny bedroom feel larger. Whatever palette you’ve chosen, select a wall color, bed coverings, flooring, and curtains in similar color values. This can be just as effective as all-white minimalism in terms of being easy on the eyes and reducing visual clutter. If you’ve picked a slate gray wall paint, try a comforter in another shade of gray. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose light, airy colors to open up your space.",
      "content": "Choose light, airy colors to open up your space. Start with a light paint color on the walls, such as creamy white or dove gray. Play up the airiness with soft cotton bedding and light, breezy curtains in neutral or pastel hues. Opt for white or blonde wood furniture pieces and ground the space with a light-colored rug. This can be a great strategy if you’re renting a space with plain white walls. This bright, airy color palette works well for rooms that get plenty of natural light. If your room doesn’t get a lot of natural light, add lighting fixtures throughout the room. Without sufficient light, an all-white room may feel dingy and claustrophobic."

      "content": "Use dark colors to add warmth and depth to your small bedroom. Instead of light, breezy colors, play up the cocoon-like atmosphere of your small space with dark tones. Go for a color scheme of rich, deep tones on the walls, floors, and textiles to make the edges of your room recede. The dark color palette will be enveloping and cozy. [19] X Research source Jewel-tones can be especially effective in small bedrooms. Try a warmer color palette of reds, purples, and warm neutrals to create a sultry effect, or consider a more soothing color palette with cool shades like navy blue or emerald green. Be sure to incorporate sufficient lighting to prevent your room from looking drab. Mix in metallic details to add some eye-catching bright spots to your space."

      "content": "Add floor-to-ceiling window treatments on the sides of your window(s). This trick is all about creating the illusion of extra space and height. [20] X Research source Mount the curtain rod well above the top of the window frame – get it as close to the ceiling as possible to draw the eye upward. Keep it wide enough so that your curtains don’t cover up the window and block out the light. Choose curtains in color similar to the wall to add just enough texture without overwhelming the space."
