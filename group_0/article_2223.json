      "content": "Select an illness to fake carefully. When you want to avoid school, faking an illness is an effective way to stay out of the classroom. The success of your scheme depends largely on the illness you decide to fake. Choose an illness that has to “run its course” and has relatively easy symptoms to feign, like the flu or a headache. Don’t fake an illness that will require a doctor’s visit, like strep throat or mono—the doctor could blow your cover! [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Fake a headache.",
      "content": "Fake a headache. A headache is an exceptionally easy and safe illness to fake because the symptoms are not visible. Choose a specific part of your head that hurts, such as your forehead or at the base of your skull. Pretend that you are sensitive to sounds and light. Lay on a couch or in your bed—avoid excessive activity. This also works when you are at school, for example, you have a big math test that you didn't study for, simply just put your hand over your eyes and say something along the lines of “Man my head is killing me, and my vision is blurry” this works about 75% of the time.

      "content": "Fake a fever. Pretending to have a fever requires careful planning and constant vigilance.
