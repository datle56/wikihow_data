      "title": "Gather your supplies.",
      "content": "Gather your supplies. You will need a Phillips screwdriver, compressed air (either in a can or via a compressor), a small vacuum that can fit in narrow crevices, a toothbrush, and 99% isopropyl alcohol. Do not use an old vacuum with a metal tip, as these are usually poorly grounded and can damage your components. The best option is a newer handheld vacuum with an extendable plastic hose. The toothbrush should be new and have very soft bristles."

      "title": "Setup an area where you can blow dust.",
      "content": "Setup an area where you can blow dust. You will be using compressed air and a vacuum to remove most of the dust from the inside of your computer, so set up an area that you can blow dust out without worrying about getting other things dirty. A garage or workbench is a good choice, or you can go outside if it's a dry day. Try to set up a table so that you can easily access the computer without having to bend over or set it on the ground."

      "content": "Power down the computer and unplug all of the peripherals. Shut down your computer and disconnect all of the cables on the back. Make sure that the monitor is unplugged, and that any USB cables, Ethernet cables, speaker cables, or anything else is unplugged as well. Flip the switch on the power supply and then remove the power cable."

      "content": "Set the computer on its side. Place the computer on its side on your table or workbench. Make sure that the connectors on the back are laying closest to the surface. These connectors are attached to the motherboard, and can help you ensure that you remove the correct side panel."

      "title": "Remove the side panel.",
      "content": "Remove the side panel. Remove the screws that hold the side panel in place. These screws can be found along the back of the computer. Most modern cases have thumbscrews that you can remove without tools, though you may need to use the screwdriver for older cases or thumbscrews that are too tight. Set the screws aside so that you don't lose them."

      "title": "Do an initial vacuum.",
      "content": "Do an initial vacuum. Depending on how long it's been and your environment, you could be greeted by a pretty gruesome sight. Dust has a tendency to collect and cake on your components, and the entire inside may be covered in a fine layer of gray. Use your vacuum cleaner to do a pass over the interior, sucking up the large bits of dust from the components and crevices. [1] X Research source Be careful not to strike any of the components with the vacuum tip as you move it across the interior. Many components inside are very fragile, and bent pins and connectors can make your hardware useless."

      "title": "Use the compressed air to blow dust out of crevices.",
      "content": "Use the compressed air to blow dust out of crevices. Take the can of compressed air or air compressor and blow out the hard-to-reach crevices. Use the vacuum to help reduce the amount of dust that scatters in puffs. Avoid long, sustained blasts, as this will make your can of compressed air too cold to hold. Don't blow compressed air on your fans , as this could break them."

      "title": "Clean the fans with the vacuum and alcohol.",
      "content": "Clean the fans with the vacuum and alcohol. Use the vacuum to remove the large amounts of dust on the fan blades. Dip your toothbrush into the alcohol, and gently scrub the dust that remains off of the blades. You may be able to access the fans easier if you remove them first. You will need to remove the screws that secure the fan to the chassis, and then disconnect the cable that connects the fan to the motherboard. Make sure that you note where the fan was plugged in so that you can easily reconnect it when you're finished cleaning. Make sure to reattach the fan in the same direction that it was originally installed. Fans blow in one direction, and reversing the direction of air flow can significantly impact the cooling of your machine. Most fans have an arrow printed on the top of the housing that indicates which way it blows."

      "title": "Remove components for deep cleaning.",
      "content": "Remove components for deep cleaning. While a general vacuum and dusting is usually sufficient for basic cleaning, you'll want to remove individual components to really get them sparkling again. Make sure that you are properly grounded before touching any of the internal components. When you remove the components, set them on an antistatic surface, such as wood or rubber. [2] X Research source You can remove the graphics card by removing the screws that secure it to the case, releasing the tab underneath, and then gently pulling it straight out. You may have to disconnect power cables in order to fully remove it. Set the graphics card on your cleaning surface and use the brush and alcohol to remove stubborn dust. Removing the hard drive and any optical drives can make it easier to clean them, since they are often tucked away in hard-to-reach bays. Removing these drives typically involves opening both sides of the case so that you can reach the screws securing each side of the drive. Most optical drives are pulled out of the front of the case after the screws have been removed. Removing the CPU cooler will allow you to clean out the cracks in the heat sink, as well as brush the dust out of the fans. Heat sinks attach in a variety of different ways, so make sure to consult your documentation before trying to remove it. Some require you to remove a bracket from the backside of the motherboard. If you remove the CPU cooler, you will need to apply a new layer of thermal paste to the CPU before reattaching it."

You can purchase specialized cleaning solutions, but you can quickly and cheaply make one at home by mixing distilled water and white vinegar in a 50/50 solution. Dab or spray this onto your cloth, and then gently run the cloth across the screen. [4] X Research source Never spray cleaning solution directly onto the screen, as this could seep inside and damage the components. Avoid cleaning solutions with ammonia, like Windex, or ethyl alcohol."

Removing keys is a little tedious, but can save you from needing to replace your keyboard when it gets bad. To remove a key, press the key in front of it down. Insert a flat object such as a car key or flathead screwdriver under the key you want to remove. Gently pry the key up until it pops off. Repeat this process until all of the keys have been removed. Space bars can be tricky, so you might want to leave the space bar attached. Take a photo of your keyboard before removing the keys so that you have an easy reference for where they're supposed to go back to."

Anything that is just plastic can go through the dishwasher or be hand-washed. The keys can be washed individually by hand, or you can put them in an enclosed dishwasher basket. Most keyboards will have a rubber contact mat that gives the keys their spring. This is completely non-electronic and can be run through dishwasher or cleaned with hot water and soap. Don't wash anything that has a logic board or circuitry, and don't wash any cables. You can hand clean around these things using rubbing alcohol and a brush."

Rebuild your keyboard, ensuring that all of the components go back together the same way the came apart. Refer to the picture of your keyboard when reattaching the keys. You can reattach the keys by simply pressing them directly into their spot on the keyboard. Make sure that everything is completely dry and cool before putting everything back together. Any moisture can ruin the keyboard when it is plugged back in."
