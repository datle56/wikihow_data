      "title": "This can be a solid match if the pair learns to compromise.",
      "content": "This can be a solid match if the pair learns to compromise. Pisces is a giving and sensitive water sign, while Aries is a bold and passionate fire sign. It's possible an Aries' dominant energy might overpower a Pisces. If the two set boundaries and respect each others' needs, they can make it work and even inspire each other. [1] X Research source Pisces' sensitive nature may encourage an Aries to be more in touch with their emotions (and the emotions of others), An Aries' bold and exuberant spirit may inspire a Pisces to be more confident and sure of themselves."

      "content": "Pisces and Aries handle their emotions pretty differently. Pisces is ruled by Neptune, which represents the subconscious and the imagination. [2] X Research source This sign is very in tune with their feelings and is often lost in their inner world. Aries is ruled by Mars. It is the planet of action and drive. [3] X Research source They feel things very intensely and may react without taking a moment to think things through. This may clash with Pisces' sensitive nature, and the two may be prone to misunderstandings. [4] X Research source An Aries will need to practice patience and understand that a Pisces needs time to think over their feelings before they act upon them. A Pisces can learn from Aries's go-getter attitude, as it will inspire them to take a break from their thoughts and simply enjoy the moment with their Aries partner."

      "content": "These signs complement each other well in the bedroom. People born in the sign of Aries usually possess a pretty strong sexual side (ruling planet Mars represents the sex drive, too). Pisces, on the other hand, is very in touch with their emotional side in the bedroom. Together, they'll forge an intense emotional and physical connection. [5] X Research source An Aries' dominant sexual energy may inspire a Pisces to be more confident and sure of their own sexuality, too.

      "title": "Pisces and Aries have different communication styles.",
      "content": "Pisces and Aries have different communication styles. As a cardinal sign, Aries is confident and sure of themselves. They're not afraid to say what's on their mind (especially when they're upset). Pisces is a mutable sign, which makes them a little more easygoing and prone to changing their mind. To avoid conflict, they might go along with anything their Aries partner wants without sticking up for themselves. For these two to work, they'll have to communicate openly (and often). [6] X Research source An Aries' fiery temper might hurt a Pisces' feelings if they aren't careful. This sign will have to learn to calm down before expressing their stormier emotions. A Pisces may need to learn to speak up for themselves. This sign will benefit from realizing that conflict can actually be healthy and productive in a relationship. Reader Poll: We asked 707 wikiHow readers what their biggest dealbreaker is as a Pisces and 62% of them said someone who lies. [Take Poll] Itâ€™s important for these signs to be direct about their feelings to avoid miscommunication."

      "title": "The pair might need to work on their boundaries.",
      "content": "The pair might need to work on their boundaries. Pisces is a very generous sign, and they sometimes put their partners' needs before their own. To make an Aries/Pisces relationship work, a Pisces will have to be upfront about their own needs so that Aries doesn't overpower them. Conversely, an Aries will need to learn to respect a Pisces' boundaries and compromise sometimes. [7] X Research source Aries is ruled by the First House of the Self, which can sometimes make them prone to prioritizing their needs above others. Pisces is ruled by the Twelfth House of the Unconscious. This makes them very in tune with others' emotions and explains why they sometimes put the emotional needs of others before their own."
