      "content": "Determine which button is the input button. Most LG TV models feature six buttons: a power button, a volume-up button, a volume-down button, a channel-up button, a channel-down button, and a menu button. On newer models, the power button doubles as the input button. [2] X Research source Older LG TV models also have an input button. It is likely to be either the leftmost or rightmost button. If your TV has one, using it to switch inputs is the simplest method of doing so without a remote. A few models feature a joystick that allows you to toggle between inputs, although this is less common. You can find your TV's exact settings and button alignment by consulting [its manual| https://www.lg.com/us/support/manuals-documents ]."
