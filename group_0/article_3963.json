      "content": "Review the details of the item. Check and double-check the price, condition, and overall product description so that you know exactly what you are bidding on. Do not simply make your decision by looking at the photo, since some sellers purposefully post deceiving photographs on their listings. Check the seller's rating. Previous ratings and reviews left by other buyers allow you to gauge if the purchase will be worth your effort and money. A good seller will have a rating between about 94 and 100 percent. The number of ratings a seller has is also indicative of popularity, and a seller with many high ratings is an even better option than a seller with only a few high ratings."

      "title": "Click on the \"Place Bid\" button.",
      "content": "Click on the \"Place Bid\" button. This initiates the bidding process. If you are not already signed in, eBay may ask you to sign in now. If you do not have an eBay account, you may need to create one. An account is free to create, and having one allows you to monitor your ongoing bids and orders. Type in your maximum bid. Your maximum bid is the highest amount of money you are willing to pay for an item. Type the amount in the box and click “Continue.” Understand how incremental bidding works. In order to ensure that buyers get the item for the lowest possible amount, eBay uses a system referred to as automatic incremental bidding. Your opening bid will be the same as the seller's minimum bid amount. If your maximum bid is higher than this minimum, eBay will automatically increase your bid in pre-determined increments. This process will continue until your maximum bid has been reached. [1] X Research source Only bid on an item you are willing to pay for. According to eBay, every bid you make is considered to be a binding contract. [2] X Research source For that reason, it is vital that you only bid on an item you fully intend to purchase. Only bid an amount you are willing to pay. While you may receive the item at a lower price than your maximum bid, you should always be prepared to pay your maximum amount. Again, placing a bid serves as a binding contract, and you will be obligated to pay the full maximum bid if that price is reached during the bidding process. Do not bid on two of the same item at the same time. If you win both bids, you will be obligated to pay both. Unless you want two of the same item, you should only bid on one listing for a particular item and wait for the auction to end before trying a new listing for the same item. Raise your maximum bid, if desired. If you decide to pay a little more for an item, you can raise your maximum bid by simply placing another bid at a higher amount. Know the limits on retracting bids. [3] X Research source There are only a few rare instances in which you will be allowed to retract your original bid. If you accidentally entered the wrong amount, you can reenter the correct amount immediately to fix the error. If the item's description changed significantly after your bid was placed and you cannot reach the seller, you may also retract your bid then."

The mobile version of the website is free, works on any smart phone, and can be found at http://m.ebay.com The process of locating and bidding on an item is essentially the same on your mobile device as it is on your desktop. The only difference is that mobile versions of eBay are visually formatted in a way that makes them more accessible on a mobile device. Alternatively, access eBay by downloading a mobile app. You can download a free mobile app for eBay for all major smart phone brands. The appearance of eBay may look different through the app than it does when accessed via the website, but you can still use the app to search and bid on items as usual."

If using a mobile app, the same basic technique still applies. The search bar will be positioned toward the top of the app's initial start-up screen, usually in the upper right corner or the upper center depending on the version of the app you have.

Touch the bid box with your finger to highlight it and use the on-screen keyboard to type in the number. Your maximum bid is the absolute highest amount of money you are willing to pay. Select \"Continue\" after you finish typing. Your bid will start off at the lowest amount possible. Due to eBay's incremental bidding system, your bid will continue to increase as other buyers place bids until your maximum amount has been reached. Only place bids you are willing to see through. A bid is a binding contract. As a result, you should only bid on items you absolutely want and your maximum bid amount should only be an amount that you are willing to pay. You can always raise your maximum bid, if desired, simply by placing another bid on the item at a higher amount. Don't plan on retracting your bid. The only time eBay will allow you to retract your bid is if you accidentally entered the wrong amount and reenter the correct amount immediately, or if the item's description has dramatically changed since your original bid was placed."
