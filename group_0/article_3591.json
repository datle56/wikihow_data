      "content": "Share your Microsoft expertise, passion, and knowledge widely. The criteria for becoming a Microsoft MVP is intentionally vague—there isn’t a specific checklist of qualifications you should aim for. Generally speaking, however, you need to possess the following 3 attributes in order to be a legitimate candidate for an MVP award: [1] X Research source 1) You are not a current Microsoft employee. 2) You’re an expert on some aspect of Microsoft products, tech, research, etc. 3) You have a proven passion for sharing your Microsoft expertise widely. Basically, if you don’t work for Microsoft but lots of people look to you for Microsoft-related advice, you might have what it takes to be an MVP."

      "content": "Target your expertise toward current MVP award categories. MVP awards are category-based, but the list of categories is extensive. The category list also changes from time to time, so check out the most recent listing at https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/mvp-award-update . There are currently 11 award categories, including “Windows Development,” “AI,” and “Developer Technologies.” Each category has 5-15+ “contribution areas” within it, which means that you can target your expertise very specifically. The “Microsoft Azure” category has contribution areas like “Azure Backup & Recovery” and “Enterprise Integration.”"

      "content": "Answer tech message board questions in your area of expertise. This is one of the easiest ways to show your passion for helping others with their Microsoft-related questions. It’s also one of the best ways to get your name out there as a trusted resource for large numbers of Microsoft users. [2] X Research source Since MVP awards are category-based, focus your energies on your areas of expertise. It can’t hurt to provide helpful answers in areas that are outside of your main field, however—this shows your passion!"

      "title": "Speak or take part in panels at tech conferences.",
      "content": "Speak or take part in panels at tech conferences. This is a great way to put your expertise out there for consumption by the Microsoft community. You can reach dozens or even hundreds of people at once, and it's easy to document your role as a conference speaker or panelist for the awards committee. [3] X Research source Keep records of the conferences you've spoken at, including the location, date, topic, and estimated audience."

    {
      "title": "Write blogs, journal articles, or books in your area of expertise.",
      "content": "Write blogs, journal articles, or books in your area of expertise. Taking the time to share your passion and knowledge in writing is another great way to impress both potential nominators and the awards committee. As with any conference activities, keep detailed records of all your written content. [4] X Research source Being able to say, for example, that you literally \"wrote the book\" on OneDrive will certainly help your case! Don't discount publishing blog posts in comparison to traditional publication routes, though. It's a great way to reach a big audience."

      "content": "Post videos for tech consumers on platforms like YouTube. If you have a knack for explaining Office 365 to your co-workers, for instance, why not share your talents more widely? Posting tutorials, reviews, or other videos in your area of expertise can help you build a big following that will get you noticed. [5] X Research source Connecting with the community in a variety of ways looks good on your candidacy profile, but the sheer number of people you connect with is probably even more vital. If, for instance, you get large numbers of views on your YouTube videos, focus more of your energies there."

      "content": "Network with current MVPs and Microsoft employees. To be considered for a Microsoft MVP award, you must first be nominated by either a current MVP or a current Microsoft employee. Therefore, the more connections you make with people in these categories, the more likely it is that you’ll be noticed—and, hopefully, nominated—by one or more of them. [6] X Research source If you attend tech conferences, you’re sure to run into people who fit into one of these categories. Don't be shy about introducing yourself and giving an \"elevator pitch\" that lays out your MVP-worthy credentials. You can search a list of all current MVPs (which number 3223 as of June 2019) at https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/MvpSearch ."

If you manage to sufficiently impress a current MVP or Microsoft employee, they may choose to submit your name as a nominee to the awards committee. This is an achievement in itself, but it's also only the first step toward the coveted MVP award. [7] X Research source There's nothing inherently wrong with asking to be nominated, but use your own best judgment about whether this is a good idea. Some potential nominators may be fine with this tactic, while others may take offense. Most people in these categories will know how to go about nominating you. If not, direct them to the nominating portal at https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/Nomination/nominate-an-mvp . Be sure to thank your nominator personally and profusely. After all, they've done you a great service!"

If you pass an initial screening after being nominated, you’ll receive a request for supporting documentation from the awards committee. They’re looking for tangible evidence that you deserve an MVP award, so be sure to make a great case for yourself! [8] X Research source The initial screening, along with the entire decision-making process for MVP awards, is intentionally cloaked in secrecy by Microsoft. They simply don't want potential recipients to know exactly how the process works. You might do the following to support your case: list the conferences you’ve spoken at, and estimate the number of people in attendance at your sessions; tally up your YouTube tutorials and the number of views; identify your written work in your contribution areas; and point out several of your best-received message board answers."

After your supporting documentation has been reviewed, it’s possible that a member of the awards committee will contact you with follow-up questions. Answer fully and truthfully, while also showing the confidence to tout your achievements and your passion for sharing your expertise. [9] X Research source They may, for example, want further clarification on the topics of some of your conference panels, or they may want to know more about your views on a particular Microsoft product in your area of expertise. The awards committee frequently deals with a backlog of nominations, so you should expect the entire process (from nomination to final decision) to take 90 days or more. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Follow the MVP Code of Conduct. Becoming a Microsoft MVP doesn’t technically mean you’ve joined a club; rather, it means you’ve earned an award. And, like most awards, this one can be rescinded if you don’t conduct yourself in a professional manner. In reality, though, there aren’t any big surprises in the code of conduct, which can be found at https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/mvp-code-of-conduct . [11] X Research source Grounds for having your award rescinded include, for example: harassing, abusing, or discriminating against others; libeling or slandering Microsoft or any of its employees; violating confidentiality agreements; plagiarizing the work of others; posing as a Microsoft employee."

These include, but are not limited to, the following: [12] X Research source Early access to Microsoft products. Direct access to Microsoft product teams in your field. An invitation to the Global MVP summit, held annually at Microsoft HQ in Redmond, Washington, USA."

      "content": "Treat the MVP as a 1-year award that you can earn annually. Microsoft MVP awards last for 1 year, unless you do one of the following: give back the award; have the award rescinded for misconduct; or take a job with Microsoft. You can’t renew an existing MVP award, but you can be nominated year after year continuously. [13] X Research source For example, you’ll see people in the field who style themselves as an “8-year Microsoft MVP.” This means that they’ve held 1-year MVP awards 8 different times (consecutively or not), not that they’ve held a single MVP award for 8 years."

Each year, your nomination will be evaluated over again, with the expectation that you’ve continued to share your passion, knowledge, and expertise. [14] X Research source This means that someone who has held MVP awards for 10 consecutive years has consistently worked to earn that recognition the entire time."

      "content": "Transition to the MVP Reconnect program if you’re a former MVP. Microsoft MVPs often form both professional relationships and personal friendships during their terms. To help facilitate continued networking among former MVPs, Microsoft has created the “MVP Reconnect” program. It’s essentially an online forum that makes it easier for former MVPs to keep in touch. [15] X Research source You’re eligible if: you’re a former MVP who left the program in good standing (that is, didn’t have your award rescinded); you still meet the conditions of the MVP Code of conduct; and you don’t work for Microsoft. If you take a job with Microsoft or earn another MVP award, you’ll have to quit the MVP Reconnect program. You can join again if your circumstances change once more."
