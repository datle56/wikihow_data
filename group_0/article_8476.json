      "content": "Check your pressure gauges. The pressure gauge (or gauges) on your filter will let you know it's time for a cleaning. If your sand filter has both an \"inlet pressure gauge\" and an \"outlet pressure gauge,\" a pressure differential of 16 and 20 psi means it is time to clean your filter. However, if your sand filter has just an inlet pressure gauge, a rise in pressure of 8 to 10 psi indicates that it is time for a cleaning. [1] X Research source Most sand filters will need to be cleaned every 2-4 weeks. You can also clean your sand filter anytime your pool seems cloudy, or after a period of very heavy use (such as a party)."
