[1] X Research source If you don’t already know what species you’d like your fursona to be, do a little research to figure out which bat you like best. You could even combine bat species—or combine a bat with another animal entirely, if you want! It’s all part of the fun. Some of the most popular bat species include: Fruit bats Vampire bats Brown bats Flying foxes"

      "content": "Choose your bat fursona's colors. Bats come in a variety of colors, including black, brown, gray, tan, red, and white. Whatever species of bat you claim for your fursona , consider incorporating its color(s) into your wardrobe, bat fursuit, and illustrations of your fursona . Many fursonas also include an aesthetic color in addition to the animal's natural colors; consider adding a splash of a pastel or highlighter-bright hue! For instance, Honduran white bats are typically fluffy and white with yellow noses and ears, while the little brown bat may be brown, red, or gold. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider adding any defining physical characteristics to your fursona.",
      "content": "Consider adding any defining physical characteristics to your fursona. For a bat, this would usually involve big, pointy bat ears and bat wings—a bat’s 2 most iconic features. You might also include birthmarks, hair, nails, a specific eye color, or any other defining characteristic you want. What your ears and wings look like may depend on the species of bat you aim for. You can be ultra-specific and incorporate wings and ears that match your species exactly, or be a little looser and more creative with it. It’s up to you! For a bat fursuit, you can purchase bat wings or ears , or make your own wings and ears. Remember that bats have fur on their ears and bodies, but not on their wings. If you opt to include fur in your costume, don’t add it to your wings! [3] X Research source"

Remember, your fursona doesn’t have to match your personality or physical appearance at all—it can, but it can also be someone completely different! Consider what personality traits you want your fursona to have: will they be outgoing? Shy? Fun? Friendly? Standoffish? Gloomy? You might consider using your fursona’s species to guide their personality: for instance, if you’re a bumblebee bat , a.k.a. the world’s smallest bat, your personality might be cute, babyish, high-energy, or feisty.

      "content": "Consider acting like a bat. If you want your bat fursona to have a batty personality, incorporate some bat-like behavior into your act. You could be literal about it and screech like a bat, or embody behavior that's evocative of bats, like being a night owl, since bats are nocturnal. If you want to go the literal route, consider eating lots of fruit or maybe even (edible) bugs! Screech, fly about, and groom your loved ones (with their consent, of course)."

You can give them your name if you want, or you can choose a name that you like or that you feel matches their unique personality and look. You can pick a name that sounds nice or that you’ve always liked, or do some research online to find a name that means something about your fursona. For example, if your fursona is very dark and gloomy, you might search “names that mean ‘dark” for ideas."

As bats are creatures of the night, it makes sense that a bat fursona would be the type of dreamy, artsy person who stays up all night, staring at the moon.

The ref sheet (also called a character sheet ) usually includes an illustration of the fursona from all angles. The sheet also often includes the character's name, age, species, gender, height, weight, appearance, personality, and traits. Your ref sheet can be more or less detailed according to your preferences and how much you know about your character while you're making the ref sheet. You might choose to include more details such as the character's sexuality, any nicknames, marital status, fetishes, and a biography."

If you're making your ref sheet and don't know where to start, there are loads of templates out there: check out Not sure where to commission an artist? Try Etsy or My Furry Art .
