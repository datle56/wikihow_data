      "content": "Inspect the tripe for cleanliness. Because tripe is made from the stomach of the cow, it can contain remnants of the cow's last meal, which you do not want to eat. Tripe is sold at butchers' shops in multiple varieties - \"green,\" \"cleaned,\" and, most commonly in North America, \"bleached.\" [1] X Research source Each variety of tripe requires different cleaning procedures, so it's important to know which of the following types of tripe you are working with before you start: Green tripe is the stomach lining basically unchanged from the way it came out of the cow. As its name implies, it has a greenish or grayish color. It needs to be thoroughly emptied and cleaned before cooking (see below). Cleaned tripe is tripe that has been rinsed and cleaned to remove the stomach contents. It's lighter in color and requires less preparation on your part in terms of cleaning and rinsing. Bleached (or \"Blanched\") tripe is tripe that has been cleaned, then soaked in chlorine to kill germs, giving it a very pale color. It's the cleanest type of tripe you can buy, but, unfortunately, it must be rinsed several times to remove the strong chlorine odor and taste."

      "title": "Clean if necessary.",
      "content": "Clean if necessary. Depending on the condition of your tripe (see above), the precise cleaning process of your tripe will vary. Tripe from most butcher's shops should already be cleaned, but if yours isn’t or you've opted for organic, untouched tripe, you can clean the tripe in your kitchen with a few household ingredients: Rub the tripe with rock salt, loosening any small undigested bits (or \"grit\"). Rinse thoroughly with cold water. If necessary, use a clean toothbrush for hard-to-reach places. By doing this, you empty the stomach lining of any remnant pieces of partially-digested food. Repeat until you see no more grit. Soak the tripe for one hour in a dilute solution made by mixing a tablespoon or two of hydrogen peroxide with enough water to cover the tripe (turning and squeezing the tripe occasionally). Hydrogen peroxide is a disinfectant and a bleaching agent. [2] X Research source Discard the hydrogen peroxide solution and rinse the tripe thoroughly several times with water (squeezing as you do so). Trim edges that still appear unclean. The resulting tripe should be free from any obnoxious odor. After soaking, scrape the interior of the tripe with a knife to remove the inner membrane. Stomach lining is a complex tissue - parts of it are good to eat, but other parts aren't. The interior membrane should be removed if it hasn't."

      "content": "Cut the tripe into a uniform thickness. Raw tripe can vary significantly in thickness across its length. Unfortunately, varying thickness in a piece of tripe can cause it to cook unevenly. Lay your piece of tripe flat and carefully look it over - if you see any sections that are particularly thick, use a sharp knife to make a \"butterfly\" cut, halving the thickness."

      "title": "Cut tripe into strips and parboil.",
      "content": "Cut tripe into strips and parboil. Parboiling is process where a food is first boiled by itself to prepare it for cooking in another dish. Use a sharp knife to divide the tripe into thin strips or squares. Gather the strips and toss them into a pot of boiling salted water (2 Tbsp / 34g of salt per litre of water). Boil for 15-30 minutes. When you’re done, discard the water and rinse the tripe. After boiling, tripe should be noticeably softer - it's now ready to cook in a variety of dishes. Read on for standard instructions on flavoring. Be sure to wash your hands after handling raw tripe, even if you've already cleaned it meticulously."

      "title": "Prepare a broth.",
      "content": "Prepare a broth. Place the tripe in a pot and add herbs and vegetables to season (e.g. onion, carrot, celery, bay leaf, parsley, cloves, peppercorns). Cover with water and add a generous amount of salt. Bring the broth to a boil. Here's your chance - let your creativity shine! The final flavor of your tripe depends on the contents of the broth you cook it in. Spice things up however you see fit - a few added peppers, for instance, can give your tripe a real \"kick,\" while some slices of ginger will give the dish an Asian influence. Note that as long as there are enough ingredients to impart a substantial flavor, the proportions of stock are very flexible; feel free to add, modify, and remove ingredients to suit your own taste."

      "title": "Simmer one to three hours or until the tripe is tender.",
      "content": "Simmer one to three hours or until the tripe is tender. When the broth reaches a boil, reduce the heat to a slow simmer. As the tripe cooks in its broth, it will gradually soften and absorb the broth's flavor. After about 90 minutes, start checking the consistency of your tripe every 10-15 minutes. Your tripe is \"done\" when it reaches your desired consistency. Individual tastes vary on tripe's ideal consistency - some recipes will, for instance, recommend cooking for over four hours to give the tripe a very mushy consistency. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Save the stock.",
      "content": "Save the stock. The flavorful, aromatic stock leftover from simmering the tripe is perfect for adding that distinctive tripe flavor to another recipe. Alternatively, it can be used as a companion soup for your tripe dish. The two dishes will have similar flavors, so the soup will complement the tripe nicely. If the tripe is tender but the stock is still thin, you can either continue cooking them together or remove the tripe and allow the stock to continue simmering on its own. By continuing to boil the stock, the water will slowly leave, concentrating the flavorful ingredients."

To make a delicious pasta dish, prepare a big pot of richly seasoned tomato-based pasta sauce , then add your prepared tripe and simmer for several hours.

Possible dishes include tripe soup (made from the tripe stock you saved), tripe stew, as well as other dishes that veer away from the \"soupier\" recipes for tripe we've discussed, like breaded and fried tripe, and even tripe stir fry. Experiment to your heart's content!"
