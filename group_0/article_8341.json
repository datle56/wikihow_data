      "title": "Wet a small area of a microfiber cloth.",
      "content": "Wet a small area of a microfiber cloth . Use regular tap water to wet a small area of the cloth, and then squeeze it out to remove excess water. If you don’t have a microfiber cloth, an old cotton T-shirt or lint-free cloth will work in a pinch. Avoid using household cleaning products, like Windex or benzine cleaner, because they can ruin your disc."

      "title": "Hold the game disc by its rim.",
      "content": "Hold the game disc by its rim. Avoid placing your fingers on the surface of the disc so you don’t leave fingerprints. Turn the game disc over so the non-labeled, reflective side faces you. [1] X Research source You can clean the labeled side of the disc as well, but be extremely careful because doing it too vigorously can destroy the data on some game discs."

      "title": "Wipe the disc surface outward from the center using the wet cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe the disc surface outward from the center using the wet cloth. Start at the disc’s center hole and move the wet cloth in a short, straight line toward the rim. Reposition the cloth at the center and continue wiping until you clean the entire disc. [2] X Research source Avoid moving the cloth in circles around the disc because you’re more likely to cause damage or leave behind scratches."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry the disc with a clean cloth.",
      "content": "Dry the disc with a clean cloth. Use the dry portion of the cloth to remove moisture. Make the same straight, short strokes from the center of the disc toward the rim. Be extra gentle because you’re more likely to scratch the disc with a dry towel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait 2 minutes for the disc to dry before testing.",
      "content": "Wait 2 minutes for the disc to dry before testing. Put the disc down with the reflective side face-up. Wait at least 2 minutes to allow the remaining moisture to completely evaporate before putting the disc into the disc drive of your game console or computer. If there are still problems, you may need to use a stronger cleaning method or clean your disc drive ."

      "title": "Wipe the disc with rubbing alcohol to remove fingerprints.",
      "content": "Wipe the disc with rubbing alcohol to remove fingerprints. Any rubbing alcohol will work to clean your disc. Apply a dab of alcohol to a clean cloth or cotton ball, and rub the disc from the center to the rim. Carefully wipe off excess moisture with a dry cloth, and then let the disc sit for 2 minutes so it completely dries. [3] X Research source Alternatively, make a solution that’s equal parts water and rubbing alcohol to help remove stubborn smudges."

      "title": "Clean the disc with baby wipes for a gentle cleaner.",
      "content": "Clean the disc with baby wipes for a gentle cleaner. Hold the disc by the rim so the reflective side is face-up. Take a wipe out from the package, and gently move it from the center of the disc toward the outer edge. Be sure to focus on any areas with visible smudges or marks. [4] X Research source You may also use cleaning wipes specifically made for game discs and CDs."

      "title": "Apply a commercial disc cleaning spray to keep your disc safe.",
      "content": "Apply a commercial disc cleaning spray to keep your disc safe. Disc cleaning sprays are specifically made for removing smudges, and some of them even help repair minor scratches on the surface. The directions can vary between products, so follow the instructions on the packaging. Typically, all you have to do is apply the cleaning spray to a soft microfiber cloth and gently wipe the disc from the center toward the edge."

      "title": "Use plain white toothpaste to remove mild scratches.",
      "content": "Use plain white toothpaste to remove mild scratches. Toothpaste is slightly abrasive, so some gamers use it to polish off scratches without creating any more. Apply a dab of toothpaste to the corner of a cloth and gently rub it into the disc using straight motions from the center to the edge. Then, wipe the toothpaste off with a damp cloth and let it dry completely. [5] X Research source Avoid using gel or powdered toothpaste because they aren’t as effective at cleaning."

      "title": "Try furniture polish to clean and get rid of scratches.",
      "content": "Try furniture polish to clean and get rid of scratches. Polish has a slightly stronger abrasive than toothpaste, so it can help get rid of surface scratches. Apply the polish to a corner of a microfiber cloth and gently rub it into the game disc. Use short and straight motions starting from the center and working toward the edge. Then, clean the polish off with a damp cloth. [6] X Research source Steer clear of polish that contains petroleum because it could eat through your game disc. Avoid applying a lot of pressure while you’re cleaning because you could create new scratches."

      "title": "Buff the disc with clear wax to fill in deep scratches.",
      "content": "Buff the disc with clear wax to fill in deep scratches. While clear wax doesn’t remove scratches, it helps fill in the space and could make your game disc work better. Choose a clear wax, like 100% carnauba, for your disc. Apply the wax with the corner of a microfiber towel, moving from the center toward the edge of the disc. After you apply the wax, use a dry cloth to buff the wax so it has a clear finish."

      "title": "Go to a game store or use a mail-in service to buff damaged discs.",
      "content": "Go to a game store or use a mail-in service to buff damaged discs. Many video game and video rental stores have buffing machines that remove a layer of scratches from the surface. Contact shops in your area to see if they have buffing machines. Alternatively, some stores outside your area may offer mail-in services to clean your game discs. Disc cleaning usually only costs a few dollars, but ask about prices before taking your games in. While you can get a disc buffing machine to use at home, they’re usually lower quality and not as effective as the ones that stores use."

      "content": "Blow out dust with an air bulb duster . Open the disc drive of your console if you’re able to. Then, point the nozzle of the duster at the drive, and squeeze the bulb to blow air. Keep squeezing the bulb until you don’t see any more dust lift up from the surface. While you may also use a can of compressed air, it’s more likely to cause damage to delicate drives."

      "content": "Insert a laser lens cleaner into the disc drive. Laser lens cleaners look like a game disc, but they have small brushes that clean the laser reader inside your console. Place the disc inside of the disc drive and leave it for a few minutes. As the disc rotates, the brush will break apart dust and gunk on the lens. [7] X Research source Some laser lens cleaners come with a liquid cleaner to apply on the disc before inserting it. Follow the specific directions for the cleaner you purchase."

      "content": "Have your console professionally repaired. If other cleaners don’t work and your console doesn’t work with a new, unscratched disc, then it may need repairs. If your device is still under warranty, then you may be able to have it serviced for free from the manufacturer. Otherwise, look for a game repair service in your area that can clean the lens in the disc drive. Use the Xbox service site to send your console in and have it repaired. Contact Playstation support to browse through fixes and talk to support staff."

      "content": "Put the game disc in its case when you aren’t using it. Rather than leaving your game discs out in the open when you’re done playing them, just place them back in their original cases. The case keeps the disc from getting scratched, smudged, or covered in dust. If you don’t have the original case for your game, then use a CD case with protective sleeves."

      "content": "Hold the disc by the rim whenever you handle it. Avoid touching the reflective side of the disc with your fingers so you don’t leave behind any smudges or fingerprints. Grip the disc’s rim in your fingertips and gently lift it out of the case or from your console’s disc drive. [8] X Research source While you may be tempted to put your finger through the disc’s center hole to pick it up, it can easily tip or slip and leave smudges on the surface."
