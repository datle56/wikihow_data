      "content": "Choose your sand dollars carefully. Don't collect living sand dollars. It's considered inhumane and illegal in some places, to kill sand dollars for the express purpose of drying them out and using them as decoration. [1] X Research source Always be conscious of the amount of shells you take, and do your part to preserve the sand dollar species by leaving living creatures in the ocean, or tossing them back if they have mistakenly washed up on shore. Sand dollars that have washed up on shore and are whitish or pale in color are most likely dead. These are the ones you want to collect. Never dig sand dollars from the ocean floor. Sand dollars burrow beneath the sand of the sea floor to protect themselves from predators and debris. If you dig up a sand dollar underwater, there's a good chance that it's alive. Check them before you take them. Gently turn the sand dollar over and look for tiny, centipede-like feet or hairs on its bottom side. Brush the hairs with your hand. If the hairs move, the sand dollar is alive. Place it gently back into the ocean. If the hairs don't move, feel free to take the sand dollar home. [2] X Research source If a sand dollar is moist or solid in your hand, there's a good chance that it's alive or recently deceased, even if you found it washed up on the beach. Exercise your best judgment, and consider returning a sand dollar to the sea if you aren't sure. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Collect the dried-out exoskeletons that wash up on the beach. These empty shells called \"tests\" may be difficult to find, which makes them even more precious and meaningful. In many states, it's illegal to collect living sand dollars, and you may face a fine if you're caught in the act. If you're not sure about the law, or if you care about preserving fragile littoral ecosystems, don't take sand dollars directly from the ocean. Many beaches and coastal authorities restrict the number of sand dollars that you can collect in one day. Research local beach-combing rules and restrictions before you set out for the day. Before you take a shell from the ocean, make sure no organism is still living inside it. The ocean is a delicate ecosystem and can be dramatically disturbed by over picking, even if you only take \"a few\" shells. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Soak the sand dollars in fresh water.",
      "content": "Soak the sand dollars in fresh water. Your freshly collected sand dollar shells might have a slight marine odor, which can be caused by small organisms and algae living on the shell. Fill a bucket with clean fresh water and submerge your sand dollar shells inside. Allow them to soak. The water in the bucket may become discolored or start to smell bad. If this happens, retrieve your shells from the bucket, dump out the water and fill the bucket with clean fresh water. Replace your shells and soak them again. Continue to soak the shells until they no longer cause the water to discolor. Soaking your shells in fresh water after collecting them helps to prevent decay."

      "content": "Gently brush the shells (optional). During the soaking process, you may see small pieces of debris stuck in the crevices of the shells. In this case, use a soft toothbrush to gently dislodge and debris. Avoid brushing the shells aggressively. These shells are very delicate and vigorous brushing can cause them to crack. You can also use a toothpick to gently pick at spots of debris. Soaking your shell for a longer period will help loosen pieces of debris."

      "title": "Soak your shells in bleach.",
      "content": "Soak your shells in bleach. Once your shells are completely clean, take them out of the fresh water and lay them on a towel to dry while you prepare a solution of half fresh water and half bleach. Soak your sand dollars in the solution. Set a timer and only allow your sand dollars to soak in the bleach for 10 minutes or less. Soaking your shells for longer can cause the shells to disintegrate. [5] X Research source If you're cleaning a number of sand dollars, fill a baking tray with the bleach-and-water solution. This will allow you to spread a number of sand dollars evenly over a broad surface. Make sure that there's enough solution in the tray to cover the entire sand dollar. You can also use a bowl, a bucket, or a Tupperware container. If you're only cleaning one sand dollar, find a small bowl, lid, or another container. You won't need much bleach to get the intended effect."

      "content": "Paint glue on your sand dollar. Use a soft paintbrush to paint the rounded top side of your shells first. Try to avoid touching the shell with your fingers, this can leave smudges in the glue. Allow the glue to completely dry before flipping the shells over and painting the underside. Painting your shells with this glue mixture will harden the shells, which will help them last longer. Maintain a clean work area to ensure dirt and debris donâ€™t get stuck to the sand dollars. This method will create a dull natural finish for your sand dollars."

Use a permanent marker to write the year the ornament was made and the name of the creator for future reference."
