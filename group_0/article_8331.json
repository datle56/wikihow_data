While you’re waiting, you can gather your cleaning supplies and gloves that you’ll need to start.

      "content": "Distilled water will clean your screen gently without leaving streaks. Grab a new, clean microfiber cloth and spritz some distilled water directly onto the cloth (not your TV screen). Gently wipe the damp cloth along your screen, going up and down slowly. If your cloth dries out, spray a few more spritzes of water onto the cloth before continuing. [5] X Research source Always spray your cleaning solution onto your cloth, not directly onto the screen. Spraying liquid onto your TV can cause it to drip into unexpected places, which could lead to damage. Distilled water is completely pure (it doesn’t even contain any minerals). It’s best to use distilled water because you know there’s nothing extra in it that might hurt your TV."

Fill up a spray bottle with distilled water, then add in 1 to 2 drops of dish soap and mix thoroughly. Spray the mixture onto a microfiber cloth, then gently scrub the area with your solution.
