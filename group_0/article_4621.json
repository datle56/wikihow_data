      "title": "Apply pink, purple, silver, or gold for brown eyes.",
      "content": "Apply pink, purple, silver, or gold for brown eyes. In particular, pinks, purples, and silvers tend to accentuate the warmth of the brown tones. Gold or bronze shades increase color clarity, and green shades lighten brown eyes. For brown eyes, the possibilities are nearly endless. Since brown is a neutral, nearly every color goes with it."

      "content": "Apply violet and plum shades to accentuate green and hazel eyes. Pink and purple will create the best contrast, since red is the contrasting color to green, and the purple will accentuate any gold strands in the eye."

      "title": "Apply rich brown shades and metallic neutrals for blue eyes.",
      "content": "Apply rich brown shades and metallic neutrals for blue eyes. Orange is the opposite of blue, so the more bronze, the better for creating contrast. A matte gray may also allow a bright blue shade to “pop” against the neutral."

      "title": "Define the eye with liner and mascara.",
      "content": "Define the eye with liner and mascara. Once the color is applied to the eyelid, lining the eyes will give dimension and definition to eyes. There are many options for both these products and for techniques of application, such as the winged liner, the smokey eye, and the graphic line. Choose a technique that makes your eyes seem bigger and more alert so the color can be most noticeable. With the right color choice and with these finishing touches, the eyes will have the perfect frame to present your unique hue to the world. Brown eyes are also defined best with black liner since there is already a depth of color saturation present on the face. Green and hazel eyes will benefit from a less intense liner color, like a purple, charcoal, or silver. Blue eyes look best with a bronze or brown liner since black may prove to harsh against a light colored eye."

      "content": "Wear orange, bronze, red, or gold to give emphasis to blue eyes. If your eyes are a lighter blue, intensify the redness in your clothing to bring out the hue.

      "title": "Wear red or more subtle mauve and burgundy to contrast a green eye.",
      "content": "Wear red or more subtle mauve and burgundy to contrast a green eye. A lighter green eye may be better contrasted by a purplish shade of red. If you’ve got a hazel eye that leans more green, choose these colors as well to accent those shades."

    {
      "title": "Wear brown purple and pink if your brown eyes are more golden than warm in hue.",
      "content": "Wear brown purple and pink if your brown eyes are more golden than warm in hue. If your brown eyes are warmer, green would oppose the redder shades on the eye. For complementary colors to brown, true gold is a safe choice. If you’ve got hazel eyes that lean more brown, wear these colors to create contrast."
