      "content": "Start small with light lip-to-lip contact. It’s okay for your first kiss to be brief and simple. There’s no need to set high expectations of a lingering embrace. A long, heavy kiss can be intimidating. Sharing a quick moment of intimacy can still tell you a lot about your compatibility. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Don’t over analyze the moment. Dissecting every part of the kiss will lead to more nervousness. Remember that a first kiss is just a first attempt.

Use mint gum to freshen your breath before hand. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Approach one another slowly.",
      "content": "Approach one another slowly. Don’t lunge abruptly or lurch without warning. Quick movements are likely to result in an awkward moment of bumped foreheads, bruised lips, or banged teeth. Eye contact can help you negotiate the approach for the kiss. If you move toward one another carefully, the initial lip-to-lip contact will be smooth and natural. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep movement to a minimum. There’s no need to move your mouth, head, or body a great deal. Too much movement can be distracting.

      "content": "Make eye contact afterward. Although this might feel awkward, the moment after is a good time to gauge your partner’s feelings about the kiss. Look at them, and see if they look like they enjoyed it. If you can’t tell from simply looking, you can talk about it. Try starting with: [12] X Research source “I really like kissing you.” “You’re a good kisser.” “I liked when you…” “That was nice.”"
