Gently turn the beans with your fingers to ensure that they are clean. Dried beans may contain dust and dirt that should be removed before cooking."

      "content": "Soak dried beans in water overnight. Pour your dried fava beans in a large pot or bowl. For each 1 pound (0.45 kg) of beans, add 10 cups (2.4 L) of water. Let the beans soak overnight for approximately 8 hours. [1] X Research source Once the beans have soaked enough, you will notice that they have expanded in size."

Place the pot on the stove and bring it to a boil for 3 minutes. Let the beans soak for 1 hour to fully rehydrate. [2] X Research source The dried beans will need at least 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) of water above them as they will expand as they soak."

      "content": "Drain the beans over the sink. After doing a quick or overnight soak of your fava beans, bring them to the side of your sink. Position a large colander in the sink and pour the beans out into it. Lift the colander and shake it back and forth slowly to remove excess water. [3] X Research source The water used to soak the beans contains residue released by the beans that can cause digestive upset if consumed."

The skin should slip off easily. Discard the skins. [4] X Research source Avoid cooking fava beans with the skin on as it is very tough and leathery."
