Turn it off when the jets are covered by 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) of water. [1] X Research source Clean your jetted tub every 1-3 months if you use your tub daily or several times a week. Clean it at least once every 6 months if you only use it a few times a month."

This forces the water to circulate only in the internal plumbing of the tub to concentrate the flow and clean deeper. Leave them open if the manufacturer of your tub states to do so in the owner’s manual. [2] X Research source Always refer to manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning your specific model of tub."

Cold water is fine for the second cycle because you are just going to give the jets a final rinse. Don’t add any cleaning products to the water this time.

Biofilm removal liquids are designed specifically to clean away all the gunk that accumulates inside the plumbing of a jetted tub. [6] X Research source Biofilm is a natural film that is created by the buildup of bacteria, mold, mildew, and other biological materials. Cleaning your jetted tub with biofilm removal liquid is a method of cleaning to be used on its own, instead of cleaning your jetted tub with detergent and vinegar or bleach. You can use either method to regularly clean your tub effectively."

It’s important that the jets are completely covered with water so that, when you turn them on, the motor doesn’t get damaged and so they don’t spray water up into the air."

[8] X Research source Some manufacturers recommend doing this rinsing process after each use of the jetted tub to help get rid of soap scum, oils, dead skin, and other gunk that builds up after each use. Keep your jetted tub clean by repeating this whole cleaning process approximately every 5 uses, regardless of how often you use it."
