      "title": "Apply white toothpaste to the surface of your ivory keys.",
      "content": "Apply white toothpaste to the surface of your ivory keys. Squeeze a pea-sized amount of plain white toothpaste on a soft cloth. Rub the toothpaste gently into the ivory surface, focusing on 1 key at a time. [2] X Research source Only use white toothpaste for this—gel toothpaste can hurt your ivory keys in the long run. [3] X Research source Try not to leave the toothpaste on the ivory piano keys for more than 30 seconds."

      "title": "Wipe away the toothpaste with a cloth dampened with milk.",
      "content": "Wipe away the toothpaste with a cloth dampened with milk. Grab another clean cloth and dampen it with a few drops of whole milk. Wipe down the key with milk to clean off the instrument and really polish the surface. Once each key is clean, dry it off with another soft, lint-free cloth. [4] X Research source Some sources recommend cleaning ivory with lemon juice. However, lemon juice can eventually break down the ivory, which isn’t ideal. Milk, on the other hand, helps protect the ivory with calcium and other fatty acids."

      "content": "Rub the keys with a white vinyl eraser for a simpler solution. Move the eraser down each key, dragging it in slow, careful motions. Don’t move too quickly—otherwise, tiny eraser chunks might fall into the cracks of your piano keys. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Polish away the yellow stains with a fine steel wool pad.",
      "content": "Polish away the yellow stains with a fine steel wool pad. Look for steel wool marked as #0000, or labeled as “very fine.” Rub the wool gently over the ivory to buff away any unwanted yellow stains on the keys. [6] X Research source Scrub down 1 key at a time, moving the wool pad in smooth, vertical motions. [7] X Research source Only do this once in a while. Although this can clear away pesky stains, it may also wear down the ivory."

      "title": "Wipe down each key with a mayonnaise-yogurt mixture.",
      "content": "Wipe down each key with a mayonnaise-yogurt mixture. Mix a spoonful of plain yogurt and mayonnaise together in a bowl. It may seem strange, but dip a clean cloth into the mixture and rub down each key individually. Then, dry off your clean ivory keys with a new cloth. [8] X Research source The bacteria in the mayonnaise and yogurt actually help whiten the keys."

      "title": "Clear away stubborn stains with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Clear away stubborn stains with rubbing alcohol. Pour a couple drops of rubbing alcohol onto a soft cloth. Wipe down each individual key, which will help freshen up your instrument. Then, take a clean cloth and wipe away any leftover alcohol. [9] X Research source You only need a few drops for this—if you use too much alcohol, it’ll drip down the cracks of the instrument."

    {
      "title": "Place your keys in direct sunlight to whiten the keys.",
      "content": "Place your keys in direct sunlight to whiten the keys. Over time, sunlight can actually whiten ivory. If possible, see if you can move your piano into a sunnier part of your home, so your keys can lighten naturally over time. [10] X Research source This remedy only works with ivory keys. If you have plastic keys, the sun will end up yellowing them."

      "title": "Whiten your ivory keys with diluted vinegar.",
      "content": "Whiten your ivory keys with diluted vinegar. Mix four spoonfuls of tap water with a spoonful of white vinegar. Dip a piece of flannel or cheesecloth into the water and wipe down each individual key to get rid of any yellow staining. [11] X Research source Don’t use pure vinegar for this—acid can wear down the ivory over time. You can also wipe down your keys with an old T-shirt."

    {
      "title": "Go over each key with a few drops of dish soap.",
      "content": "Go over each key with a few drops of dish soap. Pour a couple drops of dish soap onto a clean, slightly damp cloth and wipe down each individual key. [12] X Research source Pick out a soft white cloth to get the job done; unfortunately, colored washcloths may transfer their dye to the piano keys. [13] X Research source To be safe, wipe off each individual key with a dry cloth once you’re done cleaning them. The washcloth should be damp, but not dripping wet. If it’s too wet, then water may drip in between the keys."

      "title": "Wipe down electric piano keys with a melamine foam sponge.",
      "content": "Wipe down electric piano keys with a melamine foam sponge. Move a slightly damp sponge up and down each individual key, which may help whiten the instrument. Don’t use a wet rag or washcloth to clean your electric piano, or you may damage your instrument. [14] X Research source Electric or digital pianos are created with a lot of electrical components, so water isn’t a great cleaning option."

      "content": "Get rid of stubborn stains with a diluted vinegar mixture. Mix 4 spoonfuls of warm water with 1 spoonful of white vinegar together as your cleaning mixture. Dip a clean cloth into this mixture so it’s slightly damp, then clean off each individual key. Dry off the clean piano keys completely once you’re done. [15] X Research source Soft cloths, like cheesecloth or flannel, are good options for this. [16] X Research source"
