      "content": "Wipe down the door with a dry cloth to remove any dust. Take a clean, dry cloth or a durable paper towel and wipe down the entire surface of the door. Especially focus on any crevices or trim on the door. This will help remove any dust or pollen that has built up over time. If you leave it in place, you might just spread this dust around when you actually wash the door. [1] X Research source If the door is very dirty, it may be easier to vacuum it to remove dirt and cobwebs."

      "content": "Fill a bucket with warm water and add dish soap. It might seem simple, but often, all you'll need to get your metal door clean is some soapy water. Start by filling a large bucket with warm or hot water. Then, squeeze in a large squirt of liquid dish soap—you don't have to measure precisely, but about 1 US tbsp (15 ml) should be enough. Warm water will dissolve dirt and dust more effectively than cold water. Just make sure it's not hot enough to scald you! You can also use liquid laundry detergent, if you prefer."

      "title": "Dip a cloth or sponge into the soapy water and wring it out.",
      "content": "Dip a cloth or sponge into the soapy water and wring it out. Take your cleaning cloth or sponge and saturate it in the soapy water. Then, squeeze the sponge or twist the cloth to get rid of most of the water. That way, it won't drip all over when you start cleaning. [2] X Research source If your door isn't super dirty, use a microfiber cloth to clean it gently. However, if you think you'll need to give the door a more vigorous scrubbing, opt for a sponge with a soft side and a scrubby side, instead."

      "title": "Wipe down the door, working from top to bottom.",
      "content": "Wipe down the door, working from top to bottom. Starting at one of the top corners, scrub the surface of the door in a circular motion. As you work, rinse out the cloth or sponge in the soapy water whenever it starts to get dirty, wringing out the excess water each time. [3] X Research source If you start cleaning from the bottom, dirty water will drip down onto the areas you've already cleaned, which is why it's best to start at the top of the door."

      "title": "Rinse away any soap by wiping the door with a clean, damp cloth.",
      "content": "Rinse away any soap by wiping the door with a clean, damp cloth. After you've washed away all of the dirt on the door, empty the soapy water out of your bucket and refill it with clean water. Wet a clean cloth in the water and wring it out, then wipe down the door, working from top to bottom once again. This will remove any soapy residue that's left on the door. [4] X Research source If you leave the soap, it might attract dirt after it's dry, giving the door a streaky look."

Then, dip a cloth in mineral spirits and rub the surface of the door in a circular motion to remove layers of dirt.
