To open Command Prompt as an admin , click the Start menu, type cmd , right-click Command Prompt , and select Run as administrator . If you're just editing the user PATH and not the system PATH, you don't need to open Command Prompt as an administrator. Important: Editing the PATH environment variable from the Command Prompt using the setx command is not typically recommended–setx merges the system and user PATHs and truncates the PATH to 1024 characters. If the directories in your PATH amount to more characters than that, you'll likely break things. When possible, use Advanced System Settings instead. If you're on a school or work computer and don't have permission to edit the PATH environment variable, ask your system administrator if there's a utility installed to do this, such as pathman or pathed ."
