      "title": "Heat up the almond oil.",
      "content": "Heat up the almond oil. Put a small bowl of the almond oil in the microwave and heat it up in 10 second increments until it's warm but not too hot. You want it to be warm to the touch so that the heat will open the outer cuticles of your hair. This will make it easier for moisture to penetrate into your strands. Make sure to test the warmth of the oil by holding the back of your hand an inch or so away from the oil so that you don't get burned. Don't have any almond oil handy but you do have some almonds? If so, the easiest way to make almond oil is by blending a cup of raw almonds with 2 Tbsp. of olive oil. If the paste is too thick, simply add more olive oil. Blend well. Store the mixture in the fridge for two weeks and then filter it into a new glass container for storage, ready for use."
