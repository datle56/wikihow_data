      "content": "Wake up between 6:00 and 6:30 AM. According to Dr. Huberman, one of the most important ways to wake up well-rested is to stick to a consistent sleep schedule. Try to go to sleep within about an hour of the same time every night—he says it’s okay to be a little flexible—and wake up around the same time every morning. [1] X Research source Why this helps: Going to bed and getting up at the same time every day helps regulate your sleeping schedule, so it’s easier to fall asleep at night. Work up to it: If you’re not used to getting up early, life coach Sandra Possing says it’s a good idea to “start really small, like waking up 10 minutes earlier than you did before, then 15 or 20 minutes.” Find your ideal bedtime: Dr. Huberman says that the best time to go to bed is about 7 hours after your natural afternoon energy dip. So if you normally feel sleepy around 2:30 PM, your ideal bedtime would be around 9:30."

      "title": "Try non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) if you’re still tired.",
      "content": "Try non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) if you’re still tired. Instead of hitting the snooze button, Dr. Huberman recommends non-sleep deep rest practices like progressive muscle relaxation or Yoga Nidra if you don’t feel rested when you first wake up. Dr. Huberman recommends spending about 10–30 minutes doing this on days you wake up groggy. [2] X Research source Why this helps: Dr. Huberman says that doing NSDR before you get out of bed can help you feel more relaxed and recharged as you start your day. To do Yoga Nidra : Sit or lie comfortably and focus on your goals, intentions, and what your body is telling you. The easiest way to do this is to listen to a guided meditation like the 10-minute #NDSR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest) with Andrew Huberman . Other good options include Yoga Nidra: Journey Through the Chakras led by Kamini Desai and 10 Minute Yoga Nidra for Morning . To do progressive muscle relaxation : Get into a comfortable position. Breathe in and tense a specific part of your body, like your fingers or toes. Breathe out and relax that part of your body. Wait 10 seconds, then repeat the process with another body part. Keep going until you’ve tensed and relaxed your whole body. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Go outside for 5–20 minutes for sunlight exposure.",
      "content": "Go outside for 5–20 minutes for sunlight exposure. Dr. Huberman emphasizes the importance of getting outside in the sunlight every morning, ideally within an hour of waking up. Don’t wear sunglasses, but corrective lenses are fine. Face the direction the sun is coming from so it gets into your eyes, but to protect your vision, blink normally and don’t stare right at the sun. [4] X Research source Possing agrees, saying, “It can be really helpful to just step outside first thing in the morning so you can take some deep breaths of fresh air and get some sunlight into your eyes.” Why this helps: Going outside triggers light-sensitive neurons in your brain that help regulate your sleep and wakefulness. Adjust your schedule based on how much sun you’re getting: Dr. Huberman says to spend about 5–10 minutes outside if it’s sunny out. If it’s overcast, spend 15 or 20 minutes outside. Also, Dr. Huberman says that you won’t get the same effect from standing near a window or riding in a car. Turn on indoor lights if you get up before the sun rises. Artificial light can be helpful if you’re up before the sun, but Dr. Huberman still recommends getting outside as soon as the sun is up."

      "title": "Drink water, not caffeine, when you first wake up.",
      "content": "Drink water, not caffeine, when you first wake up. Dr. Huberman recommends waiting 90–120 minutes after waking up before you have caffeine. Instead, drink water or an electrolyte drink (Dr. Huberman likes LMNT ) after you wake up to start the day hydrated. [5] X Research source Why this helps: Dr. Huberman says that delaying your caffeine intake gives your body a chance to naturally purge the sleep-promoting neurotransmitter adenosine, which helps you avoid a mid-afternoon energy crash. Drink the water mindfully and with intention: “As soon as you wake up, make some lemon water,” says certified life coach Rachel Clissold. “Imagine placing your intention for the day into that water, then drink it mindfully to increase your cellular vibration.” Dr. Huberman also sometimes drinks a supplement smoothie—his favorite brand is AG1 greens powder ."

      "title": "Take a cold bath or shower shortly after waking.",
      "content": "Take a cold bath or shower shortly after waking. Spend 1–3 minutes in cold water. Either a cold shower or bath will work. After that, it’s okay to switch to warm water, if you’d like. [6] X Research source Why this helps: Plunging yourself into cold water might not seem like the best way to start your morning, but Dr. Huberman says that this is a science-backed way to naturally elevate your dopamine levels, improving your alertness and overall mood for the whole day."

      "title": "Exercise for about an hour, but not to exhaustion.",
      "content": "Exercise for about an hour, but not to exhaustion. Dr. Huberman starts his day with some form of physical activity—sometimes a full workout, or at least some cardio or stretches. He usually drinks caffeine (coffee or yerba mate) before working out in the mornings. But he recommends against pushing yourself too hard, since it’s important to leave some energy for the rest of the day. [7] X Research source Why this helps: Morning exercise boosts your metabolism and promotes mental clarity and an improved attention span. [8] X Research source Try following a set weekly schedule. Dr. Huberman’s workout routine looks something like this: [9] X Research source Monday: Leg day Tuesday: Rest day—Alternating sauna and cold exposure Wednesday: Interval workouts, running, or sprints Thursday: Cardio Friday: Max heart rate cardio, HIIT Saturday: Chest & arms Sunday: Outdoor hike"

      "title": "Block off some time for deep-focus work.",
      "content": "Block off some time for deep-focus work. After he’s worked out and had a shower, Dr. Huberman spends about 90 minutes working. He says that because his morning routine creates a lot of dopamine, adrenaline, and cortisol in the system, it’s best to work on linear work first thing—something where there’s a structure or “right” answer—instead of creative work. [10] X Research source For Dr. Huberman, “liner work” might look like organizing podcasts or doing research. He saves things like emails and social media for after lunch. Why this helps: When you’re undistracted and focused, you can concentrate solely on the task at hand. Creative ideas tend to come when you’re not actively working and your mind can wander.

      "title": "Eat a healthy breakfast late in the morning.",
      "content": "Eat a healthy breakfast late in the morning. As a proponent of intermittent fasting , Dr. Huberman typically waits until around 11:00 AM to eat his first meal. His meals are usually protein-heavy, including eggs, meat, or fish—or whey protein if those aren’t available—along with a salad or fruit. [12] X Research source How does intermittent fasting work? According to Clissold, “If you stop eating around 7:00 or 8:00 at night, and then you eat again around mid-day, it allows your body to process and release toxins.” Adjust your meals based on your needs: It’s okay to eat earlier in the day, especially if you work out. For instance, on days that Dr. Huberman works out with resistance training, he’ll usually have oatmeal with whey protein right after the workout to replenish his energy. Why this helps: Intermittent fasting may support sharper thinking and memory, heart health, and physical performance.

      "content": "Yes, but adapt Dr. Huberman’s routine to fit your own needs. Dr. Huberman’s morning routine is science-based, so there’s a lot about it to like. But remember—your morning routine is yours , and it’s important to find what works for you. “Start small with a morning routine that only has two or three elements,” recommends Possing. “Then, experiment with that. Try out different things and see what you like.” Do something you love first thing. Possing recommends making your morning habits feel like “rewards, not work. If you love reading, you might start your day by reading something positive.” Gradually build up your routine: “Set yourself up to win,” life coach Jennifer Butler agrees. “Start by drinking a glass of water and writing down something you’re grateful for. After two weeks, add in a walk or meditation. And stick with it until it’s a habit.”"

      "content": "Dr. Huberman turns on red lights in the evening. Once the sun goes down, Dr. Huberman turns off his regular household lights and turns on red party lights. He says that this helps block nighttime cortisol, which helps him fall asleep more easily. [14] X Research source Dr. Huberman also recommends dropping the temperature in your bedroom to around 65 °F (18 °C) at night, which helps mimic your body’s natural temperature drop while you’re sleeping, improving the quality of your sleep. Having a warm bath first can help boost the effect of the cool air even more. [15] X Research source Dr. Huberman also tries to keep a consistent bedtime, which helps regulate sleep."

This is the opposite of most of the advice you’ll hear, but Dr. Huberman says he sleeps better if he has protein early and carbs later. [16] X Research source Dr. Huberman also recommends avoiding caffeine or alcohol in the hours before bed, as both can decrease the quality of your sleep. [17] X Research source"
