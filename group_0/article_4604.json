    {
      "title": "Look back to where you last saw her.",
      "content": "Look back to where you last saw her. Sometimes NPCs may get stuck in particularly rough terrain while following you. Or, she might have been killed (Lydia’s body does not disappear from the place where she died). She might have also been preoccupied with hostile NPCs or enemies, which she may have attacked. Try to go back on the same route that you took. She might just be slow while running after you, so you might even bump into her when going back to find her! She will keep fighting even if you run away from enemies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about whether you told her to stay somewhere or not.",
      "content": "Think about whether you told her to stay somewhere or not. If you tell her to stay in a certain spot, she will stay in that same spot for a few in-game days and won’t move for that time period. It’s easy to forget if you told a follower to stay, so check if you did this."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look in Whiterun’s Dragonsreach or Breezehome.",
      "content": "Look in Whiterun’s Dragonsreach or Breezehome. If you wait for more than a few in-game days after telling Lydia to stay in the same spot, she will walk back to Whiterun. She will usually hang around where you found her or she may be near Breezehome, so check those places. Make sure she follows you once you meet up with her. If there is a dialogue option of “Follow me. I need your help,\" then click on that. Otherwise, she won’t follow you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the Detect Life spell.",
      "content": "Use the Detect Life spell. This Adept spell comes from the Alteration school of magic and can help distinguish and pinpoint enemies and friends if they are nearby. It even works through walls and rooms. Although the spell does not identify specifically what creature/NPC is nearby, blue dots indicate friends and red dots indicate foes. Use this spell to check if Lydia is around you (she will be indicated by a blue dot). You can get the spell tome as random loot in the first chamber of the Labyrinthian, from Stalleo after completing the quest “Infiltration”. You can also purchase it from Tolfdir in the College of Winterhold or Wylandriah at the Mistveil Keep."

      "title": "Try alternate console commands.",
      "content": "Try alternate console commands. Unfortunately, these commands will reset her inventory and armor, so if you gave her items in the past, make sure you won’t mind the losses. Here is a list of alternate commands (make sure to type them in exactly as they are, spaces and everything): a2c94.disable a2c94.enable a2c94.moveto player You have to close the console each time after you put in a command, so don’t put them in all at once. If she still doesn’t appear after the commands, she is dead and you'll have to revive her first."

This will make it easier for you to remove needed items from her inventory if you gave her any (her inventory might reset after resurrection), and make it easier to bring her back to life. This way, you won’t have to worry about console commands that will bring her to you (as explained in the previous part of this article). When dead, her body will not disappear or move, so go to where you last saw her alive. You cannot use console commands to bring her body to you, unfortunately."

To do this, type in this exact command: player.placeatme a2c8e Since it’s a new Lydia, her inventory will reset. If you can, take all the items you need from her before doing this. The new Lydia will automatically be placed next to you. This can work on other followers too. Replace \"a2c8e\" with the applicable NPC's Base ID. You can find NPCs' Base and Ref IDs here ."
