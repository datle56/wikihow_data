      "content": "Press down on the gun’s release tab and pull the pressure valve. The pressure valve is the long, metal plunger on the back of the silicone gun , usually underneath the release tab. Pulling it allows you to load the tube of silicone sealant into the gun. [1] X Research source You don’t necessarily need to use a silicone gun to apply sealant, but it makes the process easier. If you don’t have a gun, skip to the next section where we’ll show you how to apply sealant without a gun ."

      "title": "Prepare the surface you wish to seal.",
      "content": "Prepare the surface you wish to seal. Before you apply silicone sealant, make sure that the surface is completely free of any dust, dirt, or particles, as any debris can cause a weaker seal. Wipe down the surface with a sponge dipped in soapy water, then rinse out the sponge and wipe the area again. Dry the area with a towel, making sure to remove all water completely, as moisture can cause problems when applying sealant. [4] X Research source If you need to get rid of stubborn, old silicone, kitchen and bath designer Eric Shipe explains, “Use a hairdryer and straight razor. Start with a low setting on the hair dryer. Once [the silicone is] melted, use a razor blade to scrape it off. This only works when the caulk isn’t between pieces of plastic, or it will cause damage.” [5] X Expert Source Eric Shipe Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021."

      "title": "Cut a hole in the silicone tube.",
      "content": "Cut a hole in the silicone tube. Using scissors or a utility knife, snip the tube at a 45-degree angle. Cut as close to the tip as possible to ensure the hole is very small. This makes it easier for you to control the flow of sealant. [6] X Research source Test your silicone on a piece of scrap material. If it isn’t flowing to your liking, snip a little bit more off the tube. Gradually cut small bits off until the sealant flows at your desired pace."

      "content": "Squeeze the trigger to apply the sealant. Squeeze the trigger as evenly and steadily as possible, and drag the tube nozzle slowly along the seam of your project. Pull the gun away from where you started, as you don’t want to push the nozzle through silicone you’ve already spread. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Spread the sealant evenly to clean up the edges. Dip your finger into a container of water to dampen it, then run your finger along the line of sealant to spread it evenly. Rewet your finger as necessary until you finish cleaning up the edges. [8] X Research source When you’re done, immediately wipe your finger with a damp rag to prevent the silicone from drying on your skin. Silicone spreader tools are also available to help you clean up lines without getting a mess on your finger."

      "title": "Allow the sealant to dry.",
      "content": "Allow the sealant to dry. Check your silicone’s packaging to determine how long to let it dry. In general, wait at least 24 hours for the seal to dry before using your project. According to handyman Art Fricke, it’s difficult to speed up silicone drying times because “You don’t have vapor coming out of the silicone. Instead, it’s just exposure to oxygen that causes silicone to crystallize a little bit. It changes the chemical nature to solidify, so you can’t really speed that up.” [9] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 August 2020. In some cases, however, Fricke adds, “You can speed it up a little bit with some heat and blowing air on it, so a fan or a hair dryer on low helps. If you heat the silicone up [too much], that’s actually going to make it take longer to cure.” [10] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 August 2020. If you need something that dries more quickly, Fricke recommends buying a quick-curing silicone caulk: “That’s 100% silicone that’s fast cure and water-ready in 30 minutes. It’s not really any more expensive than any other silicone caulk.” [11] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 August 2020."

Then, use a cleaning brush and some paper towels to brush away all dirt and debris. Make sure your surface is absolutely clean so that the sealant will adhere properly. [12] X Research source In some cases, it may be necessary to scrub the surface with soapy water. If you do, make sure the surface is absolutely dry before continuing."

Cut the tip of the sealant off at a 45-degree angle using scissors or a utility knife. Test the sealant on a scrap surface, and if the hole isn’t big enough, cut a little more off.

      "content": "Apply pressure to the tube to apply the sealant. The way you do this depends on the type of silicone sealant you’re using. Some are hand-operated, meaning you simply squeeze them with your hand. Others, like cartridges designed for caulking guns, often require you to place a long, narrow object (like a dowel or rolling pin) into the base of the cartridge in order to apply even pressure. [14] X Research source Alternatively, opt for a silicone pressure can . These aerosol cans allow you to gently press the nozzle to apply a line of sealant to your project."

      "content": "Drag the tip of the sealant along the surface of the seam. Pull your silicone tube away from the line of sealant you’re applying so you aren’t pushing into the sealant. Once you’ve applied silicone to the entire surface of the seam, dampen your finger or a silicone spreader tool and run it along the line of sealant to evenly spread it. [15] X Research source If the silicone dries on your hands, remove it by scrubbing your hands with soap, water, and an abrasive, like pumice."

Some sealants may appear to be dry within an hour or so, but in general, it takes at least 24 hours for the seal to fully set. If you have sealant left over in the tube, handyman Ryaan Tuttle explains how you can prevent it from drying out : “The old school trick is to put a nail in the end of it and tape it off.” [16] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021."

There are many different kinds of sealants, so it’s important to choose the type that is most appropriate for your project. Silicone sealant is known for its waterproof properties, so it generally works best for areas that are exposed to moisture, like bathrooms and kitchens. Apply it along seams and in gaps to prevent water from seeping into the surface. [17] X Research source"
