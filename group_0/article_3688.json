      "content": "Visualizing activities increases the speed and success of your task completion. So, when you visualize your plan, you’re actually able to get more done each day. With this in mind, take time to plot out the course of each day. Instead of just list building, actually visualize the steps you will take to complete important projects and tasks. Below are suggested ways to harness visualization for success: Focus your mind on the personal attributes you'll need to be successful. Regardless of whether you are the president of a bank or a school's PTA, there are attributes that all successful people share. Listening, learning, communicating, delegating, organizing, just to name a few, and the kinds of skills that successful people possess. Imagine what success will look like. Are you striving to be a successful interior designer, or stay-at-home parent? In either case, it's important to visualize what success will look like for you, down to details like what you'll be wearing and who else will be present. Use affirmations. Vision corresponds with verbal and written affirmations. For example, if you want to be a successful golfer, close your eyes and repeat to yourself \"I can see myself on the green. I am comfortable and confident and prepared to swing. When I hit the ball, it goes exactly where I want it to. It lands on the green, 2 strokes ahead of par.\""

      "content": "Part of success is self-awareness. Part of self-awareness, then, is understanding the motives that drive your desires and behaviors. [8] X Research source It requires identifying your goals, what is gained by achieving them, and how those achievements positively impact your life. For example, if you want a promotion at work, ask yourself why. Is it for more money or greater personal achievement? Is it because you are trying to impress someone else? By thinking reflexively about your goal orientation, you may even find yourself re-assessing your needs and making smarter decisions. Thus, if you realize the reason you want a promotion doesn't actually correspond with the person you'll have to become to get it, re-consider your priorities and look for ways to maintain personal happiness while still achieving success."

Start by writing out a time budget that describes what you've done and how long it took for the past week. Then, take a hard look at where you are spending your time and effort. Ask yourself if what you get back from your time investment warrants the effort you've put it. For example, is staying awake at night talking to your girlfriend helping you be more productive at the job you enjoy? Is working 40 hours a week as a teacher's aide fulfilling your personal desire to help children and make the world better? Adjust expectations and how to fulfill them. Ask yourself what tasks and responsibilities offer you the greatest overall satisfaction and write them down. Now look at your list and ask yourself what obstacles will you encounter to reach your goals. Are these obstacles things you have created yourself or are they challenges that will make you a better person? Are any of these obstacles things you can remove from your path in order to bring yourself closer to success?"

This doesn't mean that you should act impulsively, but it does mean playing to your strengths and learning how to leverage your creativity and enthusiasm. [9] X Research source Good work yields good pay. Instead of aiming at jobs because they pay well, instead aim at jobs that you have enthusiasm for and that you can excel in. Excellence in any field will bring financial rewards. You are the product. When people invest in a company, it is rarely because the product they sell is indispensable. Rather, the person at the helm directing the project has vision and inspires confidence. When you embrace your passion, you highlight the key features of your character and skills that make you awesome. People respond to this, and will believe in you. Do it because you can't do it. Think about what makes you want to wake up in the morning. Is it your role at work, your role as a parent, the hobby you tend in the evenings? Look for ways to marry what inspires you to a marketable skill or product and invent your own success."

Instead, it means being aware of emotions you are having, but being strong enough to manage them in the face of unavoidable discomfort. [10] X Research source Be motivated. Do you have anxiety around new people? Are you bored with a current task that is key to the success of a larger project. Instead of saying \"I wish I didn't have to do [x],\" say, \"I can get through this\" or \"Just take it one day at a time.\" Start small. Today you are refusing to watching television until after doing the dishes. A year from now, you are refusing to quit running during mile 14 of a marathon. Training for success is not a finger-snap. It's about maintaining standards and good habits over time and in all aspects of life."

In the same way that it is important to have a plan, it is equally as important to take a step back and reflect on what you've accomplished and what still remains to be done. [11] X Research source Keep a journal. Some activities such as journaling, list keeping, or using a calendar or vision board help reflection and keeping track of out path to success. Remember that reflection isn't easy. The whole point of reflecting on your road to success is not to pat yourself on the back but to critically assess whether you are meeting your milestones. If not, this may require adjustments to your original plan, or an entire overhaul of what you originally thought you'd be doing. Starting over isn't a loss. If upon reflection, you realize you are on the wrong path, it's time to visualize a new direction. Take stock of what you learned and figure out how to transition yourself away from the path you are on to one that more closely allies with your ambitions and talents."

Spend time learning from them and collaborating when possible. Internships, seminars, and job-shadowing are other great ways to interact with successful people and to learn from them. Maybe your goal falls outside of the rat race and you are looking for ways to be successful as a parent, or teacher. The rule is still the same.

The following tactics can help you grow these relationships in productive ways: Grow your personal network. While every entrepreneur knows that a strong brand and social media presence is key to professional success, these do not take the place of personal encounters, which are the most common source of opportunity and growth. [19] X Research source Foster relationships outside your serious aspirations. Think about your personal life as practice for managing people in professional or employment-related contexts. When you don't listen to the needs of family or aren't a loyal friend, these relationships fail to thrive. It's also important to seek out opportunities to develop relationships with new friends as well, so consider joining a club or attending a hobby meet-up. [20] X Research source"
