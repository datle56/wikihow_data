      "content": "Research local laws. Each state and country has different laws pertaining to legal responsibilities and requirements that come with being a boxing promoter. Find out what the laws are in your area by visiting the website of the appropriate boxing commission. Most US states (and some cities) have their own commissions. The Association of Boxing Commissions provides a contact list of most of the boxing commissions in North America (and beyond). [1] X Research source In states that don't have a commission dedicated to combat sports, you'll need to do your research on the state government's website to find pertinent laws. Make sure to develop a complete understanding of laws in your area. Violating laws can leave you open to lawsuits and/or a revocation of your license."

      "content": "Apply for a promoters license. Complete the application, which includes information about your business affairs, experience in the area of boxing, and any personal associations with members of the boxing commission board, contestants, judges or other officials who may be involved in a boxing match. While state boxing promoter license applications vary, many require that the promoter provide information about their business entity and complete names and contact information for the business itself and its board members or partners. [2] X Research source Promoters may be asked about their business' financial history including recent bankruptcy filings and financial interest in any boxing contestants. A promoter's license application may also request information about the promoter's involvement in any investigations regarding event promotions or if the promoter has any history of criminal convictions."

      "title": "Pay the fees.",
      "content": "Pay the fees. In most states you will need to pay a small fee when you submit your initial application. This fee is for processing the application itself, and is usually about $50. If your application is granted, you may be required to pay a substantially larger fee for the license. In Nevada, this fee is $500. [3] X Research source In Minnesota, it's $700."

      "title": "Find an adequate venue.",
      "content": "Find an adequate venue. Once you are licensed as boxing promoter, it's time to start preparing for your first event. One of the first things you'll need to do is find a place to host it. Local bars, clubs, and community centers are often ideal choices. In choosing a venue consider it's capacity. You don't want to rent a place that's too small and will not be able to fit everyone who wants to attend your event. On the other hand, a smaller venue can create the illusion of a packed house with a smaller crowd. You will need adequate space for a regulation sized boxing ring. The size depends on nature of the event (e.g. amateur v. professional, weight class, and so on). Amateur rings are typically 16 to 20 square feet, while professional ones are 18 to 24 square feet. Your venue will also need to include dressing rooms for participants and medics, and ideally for officials as well. It will also need to include an area that the boxers can use to warm up."

Stools and spit buckets for each corner. A bell, a timer, and weigh scales."

      "content": "Find participants. The person who recruits participants for a match is called the \"matchmaker.\" Some promoters do this themselves, while others opt to hire a professional matchmaker. [5] X Research source If you opt to hire a matchmaker, you can visit the BoxRec website to find a database listing licensed professionals. [6] X Research source If you are playing this role yourself, contact a boxing club such as Golden Gloves to learn about boxers in your area who would be a good match."

      "title": "Obtain necessary insurance and bonds.",
      "content": "Obtain necessary insurance and bonds. There are also legal requirements you'll need to satisfy prior to the event. Most states will require that you have both insurance for the event and one or more surety bonds. An insurance policy will be required to cover your liability in case someone is seriously hurt or killed during the match. Depending on the state, it is not unusual for the law to require policies covering $10,000 in both medical expenses and life insurance. A surety bond is a bond you purchase to ensure that any payment you are required to make to the state (in the form of taxes) will be covered in the event that you default on your payment or violate state regulations. These bonds may be $10,000 or more, depending on the state. [7] X Research source"
