      "content": "Place a tiny cheat sheet inside a mechanical pencil. You will have to bring out a very small version of your cheat sheet for this to work. Type up a cheat sheet on a computer, using the smallest font possible. Most people can't read smaller than an 8 point font. Then, print out the paper and cut out the section that contains the text. [1] X Research source Roll the cheat sheet tightly enough that you can slip inside your mechanical pencil. When you're struggling during the exam, pretend that you need to reload your pencil with lead. Slip out your cheat sheet and quickly take a look. Be careful. You will have to glance at the sheet quickly. You should also hold your pencil slightly below your desk as you pretend to reload the lead. You do not want your teacher, or anyone else, to see you are using a cheat sheet."

You should also buy a keychain flashlight that gives off UV light. [2] X Research source Write your cheat sheet down in invisible ink. Bring it to class the day of the exam. Your teacher will probably not worry about a seemingly blank piece of paper out on your desk. Keep your keychain in your hand during the exam, or set it out on your desk. You can pretend you're fiddling with it out of nerves. When the exam begins, subtly shine your flashlight on the piece of paper when you're stumped. It's a good idea to sit in back, to minimize the risk of getting caught."

      "title": "Upload notes to your calculator.",
      "content": "Upload notes to your calculator. For a math class, especially an advanced math course, you're usually allowed a calculator. If you have a graphing calculator, there is usually a function you can use to save notes, graphs, and equations. This can work great on a math exam, as a teacher is unlikely to get suspicious of you using a calculator. He or she will assume you're simply typing in calculations. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source On a graphing calculator, you can usually press a button that says \"program\" and then press \"new.\" You will then be taken to a screen where you type in formulas. To access this information, press \"Edit.\" Scroll down and find the note that you made with the equations and select it. Every graphing calculator is different. The process on yours may vary. Refer to the instruction's manual for precise directions on adding notes to your calculator."

      "content": "Listen to an audio cheat sheet on wireless headphones. An audio cheat sheet can work as well as a pen and paper one. You can make a recording of yourself listing basic information. Then, upload that recording to a portable electronic device, like an iPhone or iPod. [7] X Research source If you do not already have one, stop by an electronics store and purchase small wireless headphones. You can synch these with your device and place the headphones in prior to your exam. Your teacher is unlikely to see them. You can play your recording on a loop. However, some devices come with a small microphone that takes commands. You may be able to make a noise, like a small cough, to signal your recording to play when you get confused."

      "title": "Photograph your cheat sheet with your smart phone.",
      "content": "Photograph your cheat sheet with your smart phone. This is a simple method, but can be effective. As long as you hold the phone still, and focus, a cheat sheet should be legible on a phone camera. You will probably have to zoom in to read some of the information, but this can be a simple way to sneak your cheat sheet into your exam. [8] X Research source Keep in mind, teachers usually do not allow phones out during an exam. A teacher will likely get very suspicious if he or she sees you using your phone. Therefore, sit in the back of class. Be very careful when checking your phone. You can pretend you're getting something from a purse or backpack and glance at your phone. You can also keep your phone under your desk, and subtly glance at it when necessary."

      "content": "Add notes to an iPod. Some iPods allow you to upload notes. You can type your cheat sheet into your iPod and look at the notes when necessary during the exam. A teacher may be less suspicious of an iPod than a smart phone, as a teacher may not think an iPod does anything other than play music. [9] X Research source You may be able to keep your iPod on your desk during the exam. You can walk into the exam listening to headphones and then casually set your iPod down on your desk. In the event your teacher asks you to move your iPod, keep it under your desk or balance it on your knee. Quickly glance down at your iPod when necessary during the exam. Sit in the back of the room to avoid being caught checking your iPod."

      "content": "Do not let cheating become a habit. Everyone slips up once in awhile, but cheating can be a real problem if it's habitual. The more often you cheat, the more likely you are to get caught. Cheating can also prevent you from learning valuable information. [10] X Research source It's a bad idea to cheat at all. However, if you feel the need to do so, try not to cheat on every test or exam. Avoid cheating unless there were specific, extenuating circumstances that prevented you from studying."

[11] X Research source You can start seeing a tutor. If your school offers free tutoring programs, make use of those. You can also ask your teacher for help. Most teachers do not want to see their students struggle. Tell your parents and friends if you're struggling with a class. They can help support you as you try to improve your performance."
