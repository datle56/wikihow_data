      "content": "Figure out what type of face skin you have. Your skin changes as you age, especially during puberty, and looking for products in the skincare aisle at the drugstore can be confusing. There are so many options! Which should you choose? To find the right cleanser for your skin, it is important to first determine your current skin type: Normal skin is not too oily and not too dry, with minimal blemishes and no severe sensitivity to products or weather. Oily skin often appears shiny or greasy, even if you recently washed your face. Oily skin is also prone to blemishes and larger pores. Dry skin is often flaky, with more visible lines and some reddish patches of skin. Sensitive skin is often mistaken for dry skin because it typically appears dry and red; however, the difference is that sensitive skin is often a result of a particular ingredient in a skin care product. Combination skin is when you have patches of skin that are oily in some areas and dry or normal in others. Combination skin is typically oily around the T-zone (the T-shaped area created by your forehead, nose, and chin) and normal to dry on the rest of the face."

[2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Even if your skin looks clean, it's probably not. It is very important to cleanse your face every morning and every night before bed, especially if you wear makeup or are prone to breakouts. Keep in mind: [3] X Research source Don't use water that is extremely hot or extremely cold since this can damage your skin and trap grease and dirt inside your pores. Gently massage your face with slow, circular motions. Don't scrub! Scrubbing will cause skin irritation, redness, or breakouts. Treat the skin around your eyes extra gently, as it is the most delicate, sensitive skin on your face. Plus you don't want to end up with cleanser in your eyes! Don't over-wash your face! Even if you have oily skin, over-washing can cause dryness, and your skin will produce more oil to compensate, which means you could end up with oilier, more blemished skin.

However, for other skin types, such as those with cystic acne, exfoliating can damage your skin. Check with a dermatologist to be sure if exfoliating is right for you. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Choose a scrub that's designed for your skin type and that is not too harsh. Some varieties include: Mild scrubs containing beads, sugar, salt or other types of natural exfoliators. Soft skincare brushes. These can be manual or oscillating brushes that you squeeze your cleanser or a mild scrub into before gently rubbing the brush on your face. Treatment masks that include mild acids like alpha-hydroxy acid or beta-hydroxy acid to slough off dead skin. Be very careful with this option and be sure to read the directions!"
