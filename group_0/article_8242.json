      "title": "Decide on your cleaning solution.",
      "content": "Decide on your cleaning solution. Use a cleanser for dogs, a saline solution, or a simple mix of water and dog shampoo. The only requirement is that the dog shampoo should be mild and ideally fragrance-free so that it won’t dry out or irritate your bulldog’s skin. [1] X Research source If your bulldog is not that dirty or prone to infections, you can simply use water. If you’re mixing your own solution, combine one part water with one part dog shampoo. Mild, hypoallergenic dog shampoos work best."

      "title": "Get a clean, thin towel.",
      "content": "Get a clean, thin towel. You will need a thin towel or cloth to dry out your dog’s folds after you wash them. It should be as clean as possible since you don’t want to rub any dirt or bacteria back into your bulldog’s wrinkles after cleaning them. Make sure to dry your bulldog’s skin folds well to avoid leaving any residual moisture that may lead to bacterial growth. Avoid using any powders on your bulldog’s folds because this may lead to an infection."

      "title": "Ask your dog to sit and stay.",
      "content": "Ask your dog to sit and stay . The process will go much faster if you have a still and obedient pet. Be sure they’re settled down and sitting before you attempt to clean them. Your bulldog is more likely to accept this process and behave while you’re performing it if you start doing it while they’re still a puppy. Once it’s a familiar part of their routine, it won’t seem like a distressing experience."

    {
      "title": "Add your cleaning solution to your applicator.",

      "title": "Wipe your bulldog’s folds gently.",
      "content": "Wipe your bulldog’s folds gently. Glide your cleaning tool through and around the crevices of your bulldog’s face and neck. Gently hold open the creases that are difficult to reach with your fingers so that you can clean inside them. Be sure to avoid their eyes to prevent irritation. Don’t scrub or apply much pressure since that can damage your bulldog’s skin or encourage infections by rubbing debris into it. If your dog also has folds around their tail, you should clean those, too."

      "content": "Dry your dog’s folds. You don’t want any moisture or soap residue tucked away in your dog’s facial folds since that can lead to discomfort and bacterial infections. Use a clean towel or cloth to wipe away any lingering moisture from your bulldog’s wrinkles. Alternately, you can use a blow dryer on a cool setting to dry out their folds. Hold the folds open, and gently apply the flow of air up and down them until they’re dry."

      "content": "Clean your bulldog’s folds at least twice a week. The frequency of cleaning will depend on your pet and the condition of their skin, but it’s best to do it more than once a week. Keep in mind that dogs who are prone to infection or have immune systems compromised by sickness or old age may require more frequent cleanings, such as daily or even twice daily. If your dog tends to be sloppy with their food and/or water, you might also want to clean them on a daily rather than weekly basis."

      "title": "Keep your bulldog at its ideal weight.",
      "content": "Keep your bulldog at its ideal weight. Obese and overweight dogs have a higher risk of skin infections because their folds are deeper. Monitor your dog’s weight, and consult with your vet about necessary dietary changes if you see any significant increases. Your pet's ideal weight will vary according to its age and sex, but the average adult bulldog should weigh between 22-25 kilograms. Consult with your vet about the ideal weight for your particular pet. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Adjust your cleaning routine. If your bulldog has infected folds, you will need to clean them twice a day rather than twice a week. Swap your cleaning solution for a mild cleanser that contains benzoyl peroxide. Dry their folds completely, and then apply any ointments or other topical treatments, such as diaper rash cream, that your vet recommended. You may also want to clip the fur around your dog’s infected folds so that the skin is easier to access and can stay cleaner. Be sure to consult with your vet about this routine first to see if it will be effective at treating your dog’s infection."
