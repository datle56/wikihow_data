If the flower stem is long enough, you may be able to just slip it behind your ear, but if you need to, use bobby pins to hold the flower in place. Real flowers are beautiful but may wilt quickly, so you may prefer artificial flowers if you'll be rocking your Glam Hippie look for more than a couple of hours."
