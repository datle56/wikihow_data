      "content": "Watch her phone and texting habits. When you are out together, does your girlfriend spend most of her time with her head buried in her phone instead of making eye contact with you? Does she seem overly preoccupied with talking to someone in particular? [2] X Research source Lots of texting could be a sign of a roving eye, or just that she's texting her mom. Try to remember who she talks to is her business. If you have to, say something like, \"I was hoping we could spend some time together now, not with our phones, unless there's some emergency. That ok? Is everything ok?\" Don't try to crack past her phone password and start digging around in her personal stuff. If you feel the need to spy on your partner, your relationship is already in bad shape, and you should end it."

If you suspect your girlfriend might be cheating online, you could even open up some fake dating site accounts of your own to check and see. [3] X Research source You've noticed she's posting a lot of comments on a male coworker's pictures? Don't freak out. She can post whatever she wants, on whoever's board she wants to post on. That doesn't mean she's cheating, but it does mean she might be losing some interest or engagement in your relationship. Never, under any circumstances, should you try to log into your girlfriend's email, Facebook page, or other password-secured information. Breaching trust because you're suspicious means you're in a bad relationship."

It's hard to say exactly what this might consist of, but keeping an eye out for anything that seems out of the ordinary for her to be doing. If you have plans together, and your girlfriend cancels or changes them abruptly, that might be a sign of something going on. If your girlfriend starts hanging out especially late with people she doesn't usually hang out with, you might want to talk about it."

If your girlfriend is having second thoughts about your relationship, or has even taken up with someone else, she'll likely want to talk about this with somebody. If you play your cards right, they'll likely feel sorry for the position she's put you in, and they might come clean. Don't come in with accusations, come in with upset questions. Tell her friends that you've noticed that she's seemed really distant lately, and you're not sure why. Ask them if they know anything that could help you fix the relationship. If they say no, that doesn't mean they're \"in on it.\" It might just mean that your girlfriend is not cheating. Try to relax."

Lots of cheating evidence can be found on someone's cellphone or mobile, but checking out someone else's property needs to be done carefully and tactfully to avoid crossing the line. If you have to look, do it \"accidentally.\" When her phone's out, glance at it when a message comes in to see who it's from out of the corner of your eye. If there is a long string of texts from someone suspicious, you might have a good reason to talk. You'll break someone's trust entirely if you pick up their cellphone and start scrolling through the message history. And if you find nothing, you'll be the jerk. Reader Poll: We asked 836 wikiHow readers who've been cheated on over text, and 53% of them agreed that the best way to proceed is to break up immediately.

Have a good reason for popping in. Bring carry-out at lunch time if you usually grab lunch near your job or school. Or show up early when you're coming home, just for a surprise. If you don't live together, don't just show up at someone's door when you're not supposed to be there. That might come off creepier than anything else.
