      "content": "Consider buying an effective case and cover. The market is flooded with iPad cases; they're everywhere you look, making the decision of which one to buy even harder. Here are some general tips you can use when searching for an iPad case: Get something form-fitting that doesn't impede the use of the device. You want something that will act as a kind of second skin to the iPad, but a skin that doesn't make using the iPad hard or cumbersome. Unless the products fit extremely well, stay away from leather cases. Leather cases are pretty and make the iPad something to behold, but they aren't form-fitting, letting loose dust and grit get between the case or cover and the iPad itself."

      "content": "Never spray any liquids directly onto the iPad. Moisture + iPad opening = disaster. As a general rule, try not to use liquids when you clean the iPad to preserve its oleophobic coating. If you feel like you must use a liquid to clean the iPad, go for something like the iKlenz Cleaner Solution. This kind of solution repels dust and kills bacteria as well. If used properly, this cleaning liquid should also give a streak-free shine."
