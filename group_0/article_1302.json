    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "This phrase compares your work to ropes, implying that you can’t do other things because you’re “tied up” until your work is finished. Thus, it’s a creative yet professional way to say you’re busy. [1] X Research source Example : “I won’t be home on time today—I’m tied up at work.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "Saying you’re “occupied” is another professional way of saying you’re busy and already doing things (so you can’t take anything else on). You can also say you’re “preoccupied” if someone tries to talk to you while you’re in the middle of something (like a phone call or meeting). [2] X Research source Example : “I’m otherwise occupied today. Can you get someone else on that task?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "There’s no room for more food on a full plate! Thus, this phrase compares your work to a plate of food, implying you already have enough on it and can’t do anything else. You can also use different qualifiers depending on how busy you are; you could say “a lot on my plate,” when you’re busy or “too much on my plate” when you’re so busy you feel overwhelmed. [3] X Research source Example : “I don’t think I can do lunch tomorrow, I have a lot on my plate.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "The more bowling pins or balls you juggle, the more focus and concentration is required. The same is true of work—so you can use this phrase to explain that you’re “juggling” (or handling) a lot of tasks at the moment and can’t drop any of them. You can use the phrase with coworkers or casually with friends. Example : “I’m really juggling quite a bit of work right now. Can we meet next week?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "“Overloaded” is like saying too much work has been piled on your desk, and you’re just trying to deal with it all. It works professionally or casually and definitely makes it clear that you’re busy with work. Example : “I’m a bit overloaded with work today, so I’m definitely taking a late lunch!” There are also a few synonyms you can use in place of “overloaded,” like “I’m overextended” and “I’m overstretched.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "“Swamped” is another way to say you’re extremely busy, to the point of being nearly overwhelmed. It’s a comparison to being stuck in a swamp, as though there’s so much work you can’t even get up from your desk. This phrase can be used casually or professionally. Example : “I’m absolutely swamped with work. How will I get this done by Friday?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "Being “slammed” means you’re super busy or overwhelmed (similar to “swamped”). You can use it casually or among colleagues to tell them how much work you have to do, and how busy you are. [4] X Research source Example : “Sorry, but I have to cancel drinks tonight. I’m really slammed at work.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "While this phrase doesn’t openly say you’re busy with work, “hectic” still communicates that there’s a lot going on (and that whatever’s happening might be tough to sort out). It’s a polite way of saying your schedule, workday, or a certain period of time is totally busy and crazy. Example : “Has work been hectic for you too? I feel like I haven’t been able to take a breath.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "Saying you “don’t have the bandwidth” for something basically means you don’t have the time or energy to get something done—presumably because you have other pressing things to get done at work. You can use it to tell a colleague or coworker that you’re busy and the work on your plate is sapping up all your energy. Example : “I’m sorry, but I don’t think I have the bandwidth to work on that project too. Is there someone else who can do it?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "Picture spreading jam or peanut butter on bread—the further you spread it, the thinner the layer, right? So, saying you’re “spread thin” is a professional way to say you’re spending your time on a lot of different tasks, and you’re already so busy that you can’t really afford to take on any more. Example : “I’m spread thin today. Do you think you could help me out with something?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "When a room or elevator is at “maximum capacity,” it can’t fit any more people inside of it. Similarly, when you say you’re at maximum capacity, it means you have as many tasks as you can handle, and can’t accept any more at the moment—which clearly indicates how busy you are. Example : “I’d love to help out, but I’m at maximum capacity right now. Can this wait until tomorrow?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "“Buried in work” means you have so much work to do, you might as well be totally covered in it! You can alternatively say you’re “drowning” in work—both phrases mean the same thing. While it’s a more casual phrase, you can still use it with colleagues or coworkers. [5] X Research source Example : “We’ve been buried in work since last week.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "This is another (more creative) way to say you’re buried in work—but instead of just saying “buried,” you’re illustrating the point by saying you’re “up to your ears” in it! “Up to my ears” is a more casual phrase, so reserve it for friends or colleagues you’re on good terms with. [6] X Research source Example : “It’s graduation week! I’m up to my ears in customers and sales.” There are other variations of this phrase, too. You can say “up to my eyeballs” or “up to my neck” instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "When a house or car gets “snowed under,” you have to dig it out. So, “I’m snowed under” means you’re extremely busy and need to focus on digging yourself out of your many tasks at work. It’s a lot like “I’m buried” or “I’m swamped.” Example : “The entire office is snowed under in paperwork. It’s unbelievable!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "Be careful how you phrase this—it may sound a little impolite in some circumstances, and it’s not something to use with a boss (since they usually determine your priorities). Still, it’s also very firm, so if you ever need to stand your ground and plainly tell someone you’re too busy for something, you can say you have other priorities. Example : “I’d love to lend a hand, but I’m afraid I have other priorities that are pressing right now.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "“Other fish to fry” basically means you’ve got more important things to handle and can’t do whatever you’re being asked to do. This phrase is definitely on the casual side, though—so if you use it, save it for friends and colleagues you’re on good terms with. Example : “Unfortunately, I can’t do lunch at the usual time. I have other fish to fry!”"
