      "content": "Reflect on what \"lazy\" means to you. Depending on your background and beliefs, the import of \"being lazy\" will likely differ, but ultimately, it's a term that tends to carry a negative implication about not pulling one's weight or not doing things when other people are doing a lot; it also tends to imply that a person does little to improve themselves or their living standards. However, what about seeing lazy in a different light? Here are some ways to do this: [2] X Research source How about seeing lazy as meaning that your mind and body want to rest? Many people would be far less stressed and a lot happier and attuned to their own real body pace if they gave in to heeding the body's and mind's cry for a \"bit of lazy\" now and then. Lazy means you're probably getting a bit tired of something that is mundane and routine. And who said we have to love the mundane and routine of life? Sure, we can be grateful for all we have and for those around us, but this doesn't need to extend to being grateful for dull routine! Lazy can mean you've got an internal struggle going on about what you think you should be doing and what you'd rather be doing. It’s possible that those \"shoulds\" are visited on you by external pressures. Lazy can mean that someone else is not doing what you want them to or vice versa. It's not necessarily lazy then; it could be tied up in control issues ( manipulating people into doing things) or in an inability to communicate clearly, and calling the behavior lazy is an easy excuse. Lazy means you've got something truly relaxing in mind. Like nothing, totally nothing at all, including leaving that unwashed pile of dishes... unwashed. Is that so bad when it's an irregular, spontaneous occurrence? What about the benefits like renewed vigor and a sense of well-being?"

      "title": "Reflect on how your lazy self can bring you to work out how to do less.",
      "content": "Reflect on how your lazy self can bring you to work out how to do less. Since when has getting the job done with less effort become a vice? Do you prefer to do things the hard way all the time? If so, whatever for? If the same result can be achieved with less effort, why not take that path and listen to your laziness? Think about this reality before leaping to a puritanical response: just about all of the advances in technology today are the result of laziness. Here are some things to think about: [3] X Research source We drive cars instead of walking because we're too lazy to walk. We use washing machines to wash our clothes because we're too lazy to be putting in that scrubbing effort. We use computers because we're too lazy to write it all out by hand (and besides which, typing is faster, so it's done sooner, so we can relax faster). The good side to laziness is that there isn't anything wrong with working out better ways to do things with less stress, less energy, and less time involved. Yet it is important to acknowledge the traditional challenges you're likely to feel about embracing the positives of being lazy now and then."

      "content": "Consider who or what benefits from the busy, ever-working you. Every time you complain that your job consumes your soul and runs your life by the timesheet, you're actually complaining that you don't have the time to really switch off. As a generalization, the idea of lazy people isn't good for business and judgmental terms such as \"bums\", \"good-for-nothings\", \"bludgers\", and \"time-wasters\", are given to those who are not thought pulling their weight enough. We worry incessantly that someone might label us this way, even as we dare to label others lazy whenever we feel overworked. And while a rested worker is actually a more productive and happy one, ironically many people work longer hours than they need to because the focus is on being seen to be busy rather than on being productive in a shorter space of time. Ultimately, a society that encourages work-life balance and a sense of knowing when enough is enough is likely to be more, not less, productive."

      "title": "Know that time spent away from work could renew your energy and spirit.",
      "content": "Know that time spent away from work could renew your energy and spirit. The \"virtue\" matched to the \"vice\" of sloth is \"diligence\". For some, the art of applying oneself to the task at hand with a zealous and unquestioning belief in the worth of working hard has become more about working longer hours to earn more money and to impress others. Yet, this isn't how everyone sees the world; indeed, the Danes work a 37 hour week, find most of their wages consumed by taxes (in return for excellent social benefits), and have an average of six weeks vacation, [4] X Research source yet they consistently score as one of the happiest nations on Earth. For many, that extra time away from work is spent doing other things they enjoy and is a recognition that all work and no play makes for a dull population. Maybe diligence could learn a little from sloth, in that allowing the mind and body rest ensures renewed strength and inspiration. Laziness is nuanced, just as diligence is — neither is wholly good nor bad and each has their place in moderation. Insisting that one is good and one is evil is too simplistic and denies your opportunity to give in to moments of sheer restfulness."

      "title": "Redefine productivity.",
      "content": "Redefine productivity. The how of being lazy is pretty straightforward (as it should be). At first, it may seem paradoxical to you that doing less (aka being lazy) can mean you're more productive. However, what's really going on here is a shift in your definition of \"productivity\". If you view being productive as \"doing more\", \"getting more done\", or perhaps the extreme of \"never being caught doing nothing\", then the idea of being lazy will probably freak you out. [5] X Research source On the other hand, if you define \"productivity\" as a means of making the most of what you do do, as a way of making the most of the time you do set aside for working (or for doing anything), and about being as effective as you can possibly be within the parameters of the time and energy you have allotted, then doing less or being lazy is actually the best way to be productive. Consider: you can work all day in a flurry of frenetic activity, only to achieve very little, especially when it's assessed in terms of a lasting achievement. Or, you can do just a few things in each hour but make them key actions that result in real achievement. In the second example, you did less, but the time you spent counted for more. At this point, take a long hard look at your work method and be honest as to whether or not half of what you do is about \"looking busy\" rather than \"being productive\"."

      "title": "Know to stop when you’re no longer being productive.",
      "content": "Know to stop when you’re no longer being productive. You may have the mindset that if you’re sitting at your desk, then it means you’re working, or if you’re scrubbing a counter that’s already pretty clean, that you’re doing housework. However, if you want to be lazy, then you have to be able to recognize when you’re just no longer getting anything done and to move on. This can help you save energy, to get done what you really need to get done, and to be more lazy in the process. [6] X Research source If you’ve already wrapped up a project at work and are just sitting around to look good, either ask for something productive to do or go home. Sitting at your desk checking email and trying to look busy isn’t doing you or anyone in the office any favors. Let’s say you’re trying to write a novel. You may have written some really good stuff for your first two hours in front of the computer, but you now find yourself drawing a blank. If you find that you just don’t really have the strength or motivation to keep going right now, stop staring at the screen and give yourself some time off before picking the work up again the next day."

      "content": "Know that it’s okay to just spend quality time with people. Not everything has to be about multi-tasking or doing as much work as possible. If your spouse, best friend, cousin, or new acquaintance wants to spend some time with you, give in to that feeling wholeheartedly. Don’t ask your friend if she wants to go grocery shopping with you or send work emails during family movie night; instead, learn to be okay with just enjoying the time you spend with people even if it means you won’t be doing a lick of work. Spending time with people and giving them your full attention will improve your relationships, make you happier, and will give you time to decompress from all the work that you do. Don’t feel disappointed in yourself for giving in to just having some fun; it’s good for you!"

      "content": "Stop all of the planning. Though it’s great to be organized and to have a sense of the work that you have to do, if you want to be lazier, then you can’t try to plan your entire life down to the minute. Sure, it’s great to schedule meetings, make a plan for meeting a work deadline, or even plan your social calendar a few weeks in advance, but if planning is actually making you more stressed out about any unknowns out there, then you may need to take a step back and let go of the need for control. If you find that obsessively planning is stressing you out, then it’s time to learn to be okay with having a few unknowns in your schedule. This can help you relax a bit and yes, it can even make it okay to be a bit lazy! Plus, if you don’t plan everything down to the minute, you can end up having some unexpected spontaneous fun, which can help you relax and get ready for any work you have ahead of you."

      "content": "Be smarter about doing less . If you're lazy, then the choice is simple. Do less. But do it smartly: the lazy person makes every second count when they're doing something. If the action isn't going to count, isn't going to shave time off and free you up sooner, then either don't do it, or work out how it can be done in a way that does lessen the time and pain of input to allow you to do less. Here are some ways to do it: Send fewer emails but make the ones you do send more important. As an added benefit to doing this, people will take notice when you do send them and treat them with more import than if you're always sending emails to a) cover your back and b) prove you're working. Stamp this message to your forehead (okay, just write it on a Post-It note and put it somewhere obvious): Laziness does not mean that less is more; laziness means that less is better."

If the answer is “When I was a kid” or even, “Never,” then your time in nature is long overdue. Even if you’re not the outdoorsy type, just spending a few hours hanging out by a pretty field, lake, beach, forest, garden, or mountain range can help you feel at ease and can rejuvenate your mind and body. Bring a friend, some reading material, a snack, or just something else that will help you relax. Don’t bring anything you have to do for work or try to multi-task. Just be content with not doing very much."

      "content": "Allow yourself weekend lie-ins. There is a lot of sleep research about that suggests regular sleep patterns are important to maintain, so sudden changes to your sleeping habits are not recommended. However, a lie-in is not about sleeping; it is about staying in bed and indulging yourself. Read a good book, eat breakfast in bed, draw in bed, or do anything you fancy while simply chilling out in bed. Invite the pets and the kids to loll about with you; first, pets are naturals at being lazy at all the right times, and second, you can never teach kids too young that chilling is an important part of being whole and healthy. Call up a few old friends and see how they’re doing. If being in bed all day is making you too lethargic, you can take a walk to get some fresh air. However, don’t do too much more than that."

      "title": "Shop less",
      "content": "Shop less . Less shopping gives you more time to be doing enjoyable things, like spending time with your friends, spouse, or kids, or hanging around the beach. Have a list, a plan, and do your shopping only when needed. And spending less means you acquire less, so then you own less, which means you have less to maintain and clean, and you're in better financial shape without the clutter. How's that for laziness? If you plan to take just one or two big grocery shopping trips per month, for example, then this will save you a lot of time and will give you more time to just be lazy. You can even ask other members of your family to do some shopping for you, or do it online."

      "content": "Shelve your inner busy-bee. Busyness is a habit (often unquestioned), not a pathway to success. Needing to look and be busy all the time will reduce your productiveness dramatically because your focus is on the busy, not the achievement. Instead of running around doing lots of things, slow down. Do less and live a calmer, more peaceful life. Be content to sit, to do nothing. Relax a little. Smile and be happy. Look at your “to do” list and ask how many of the things on the list really need to get done. Do a few things, but don’t stress out over it or let it take up all of your free time."

      "title": "Simplify your life.",
      "content": "Simplify your life. Own less clothes, less cars, less stuff, less anything that needs maintenance, time, attention and elbow grease. Make an effort to donate or give away the clothes you no longer wear, to clean out your kitchen cabinets, to make your social schedule less hectic, and just to make your life easier whenever you can. Though this will take more effort up front, it will leave you time for more laziness later on. Ask yourself if you’ve signed up for too many activities, volunteered to help out too many friends, said you would cook too many complicated meals, or just have spread yourself so thin that there’s no time for laziness. Look at what you can cut back to open up more time to just relax and do nothing."

      "title": "Let someone else do it.",
      "content": "Let someone else do it. This is not about manipulation; it's about letting the right person for the task do it. If they're willing, happy, and most competent at the task, leave them be and don't interfere . Many of us carry guilt about letting someone get on with something, even where that person has made it clear they're best doing it on their own, because we feel compelled to help; sometimes our help is nothing more than a hindrance, and at other times, it can be viewed as overbearing and unwelcome. For those in management positions, trust that your staff, child, or volunteer is capable and don't over-manage or over-parent them. Doing less managing gives employees, children, or volunteers the freedom, the chance to explore their creativity, the room to learn on their own, and the space to succeed and fail . The less you do, the more others figure out how to do things. You can guide and teach but don't interfere. It's best to share the cleaning, cooking , organizing , and garbage removal duties. Most people usually find them inherently tiresome, so share them for a sense of togetherness at least and prompt progress to something more enjoyable. It is quite possible that household duties are the original source of the wrath against laziness! Delegate and trust your delegation. Many hands make light work, for everyone. Give everyone the chance to go home earlier by sharing the burden as a team or group, whether it's work, the local church gala, or a big wiki meet-up."

      "content": "Hop off the communications bandwagon. Constant online interactions without putting boundaries on your input can end up being time-sucking work instead of being fun or productive. Communicate less and give yourself lazy space. Less talking, less convincing, less yelling, less arguing, less emails, less IM, less phone calling, less checking in. If you make an effort to do this, you’ll be surprised by how quickly you’ll feel more “lazy” and relaxed. We're living in a world where many don't know or don't want to know where to place limits on communicating anymore, so much so that if feels like a chore, an obligation, and if we don't keep it up, we feel bizarre guilt or even as if we're slighting people by withdrawing. Yet so much of this talk is nothing but jabbering at each other, with very little listening . It is noise. Let silence into your life. Let stillness pervade your mind. Let yourself be lazy about your online, social media, and texting \"obligations\". Make every email count. Only instant message when it's necessary. Spend less time on the phone, on Twitter , on the Blackberry, Android, and iPhone, and more time with... humans, with yourself, your favorite book, and in the present."

      "title": "Do things when they need doing.",
      "content": "Do things when they need doing. This sounds like work! The reality is that many things are best done immediately to save greater effort later. A true devotee of the doing less and being lazy crowd will have long ago realized that much of true work results from not doing something well at the start. Remember the saying, “A stitch in time saves nine.” Here are some ways to save time by getting work done correctly the first time around: Learn to write really good first drafts quickly. It can be done with practice. Fold your clothes after removing them from the dryer or taking them off the line. They're ready to be put away immediately and they'll crease far less than if they’re left to sit in the dryer or clothes basket for days on end. Paint the house right the first time. If you don't, you'll spend many hours fixing the botch job. Most renovation and building jobs have exactly the same principle underlying them; do it right to begin with and you'll have far less maintenance and fixing work later. Read your emails and then act on them as they arrive. When you leave them sitting around \"to deal with later\", invariably it turns into a Herculean task you don't want to face, you then resent, and you then feel mired in. If they're not worth your attention at all, delete them immediately; for those that can be replied to immediately, do so. Try to keep the emails you sit on down to a minimum of 5 percent of your in-box, and have a very good reason for doing so (such as finding out a correct answer, or sleeping on an angry response). Buy your seasonal or celebratory gifts well in advance of the day before. You'll be less rushed and you won't feel hassled; the lazy person has time to avoid rushes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Quit moaning.",
      "content": "Quit moaning. Lazy people don't complain ; first, it takes too much energy and second, complaining is sourced from a sense of unfairness, missing out, and feeling worn into-the-ground. Less complaining and criticizing frees up time and mental space for more creative thinking and more resourceful responses to situations, including finding more productive ways of solving your problems through less focus on blame and more focus on solutions. Everyone moans and criticizes now and then. Just don't let it be a habit and get used to catching yourself at it and reminding yourself of all the energy it's wasting and how you could be more productively using that time to relax and move on from whatever has bothered you. If you have a big reason for complaining, then you could be spending time doing something constructive rather than moaning, like writing a letter to your local representative or spray-painting your huge protest sign for a sit-in on a comfortable cushion. Cultivate compassion, acceptance, love and understanding. They are the antidote to complaining. Stop catastrophizing. It may never happen and even if it does, will your worrying make it any better? Perhaps it's just that you like being proven right so that you can shake your finger and say \"I told you so\" but there are better ways of dealing with the future than worrying and fussing about it. Learn to go with the flow, look for opportunities , find the natural path of things, and do what is needed in the moment. You can't control outcomes, but if you learn to work fluidly and have constructively readied yourself for events (such as putting your emergency kit into place), then you can modify the impact of the outcome's impact on you."

      "title": "Be spontaneously lazy.",
      "content": "Be spontaneously lazy. Once in a while, do things differently. Sleep on the couch in all of your clothes by choice (and not just because you're too exhausted to move). Create a tent from blankets with your kids and crawl in and just fall asleep in a heap together. Lie on the grass and count the clouds or stars until you can't be bothered, and just drift off. Don't get dressed all Sunday if you don't feel like it; don’t bother worrying about what the neighbors think. Go with the flow. Just let things happen. Step back and let things happen without you. Don't force things. Be like the water that finds the path of least resistance and smooths the way as it flows. Find life's pressure points and push those instead of pushing brick walls. Find where things give with the least amount of pressure. This takes smarts, not evasion of responsibility."

      "content": "Just put your feet up. If you’ve had a long day, or you just feel like sitting there doing nothing, do it with pride. Sit wherever you feel the most comfortable, put your feet up, lean back, and enjoy the sensation of doing absolutely nothing. Don’t think about all of the things you have to do later or worry about how much you’re being judged; think about something that makes you smile, or nothing at all. Before putting your feet up, take off your shoes and socks. Being barefoot always feels good, especially when you have had a hard day or week at school or work. Feel free to wiggle your toes or rub your feet if you like, for bare feet are happy, lazy feet! Laziness loves company. If you have a good friend who also wants to do nothing more than to sit around with his or her feet up, invite him or her over and you two can be lazy together. You can listen to your favorite music, pet your pet, eat, or do whatever it is you want to do while just sitting there."
