      "content": "Look at pictures of high, middle, and low fades to see what you like best. Get an idea of where you want the fade line to begin on your head, and look at different hair lengths to see what you like best. A traditional (middle) fade begins a few inches above the nape of your neck (and on the sides of your head), with the hair gradually getting longer up toward the ridge of your head. A high fade begins closer to where your head starts to curve (just above your temples). A low fade begins lower than a traditional fade (about 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so above the hairline)."

      "content": "Consider the specialty fades you can get. In addition to traditional, high, and low fades, there are other specialty fades that exist. These fades make a bit more of a statement than ordinary fades because of the fade line location and styling. Some common specialty fades include: High top fade: This look features a straight, blunt edge across the top, sharp corners, and a strong geometric shape. This style was popular in the 1980's. Temple fade: This resembles a low fade, except the hair disappears in a much more abrupt manner on the sides of the head. Scissor fade: This look is created only using scissors and leaves the person with longer hair than a traditional fade. Skin ( bald ) fade: The hair gradually shortens right down to the skin at any point you choose (high, middle, or low). Taper fade: This fade starts low on the neck, doesn’t expose much if any skin, and gradually elongates into the top for a more natural looking fade."

Say something like \"I work as a lawyer, so I'm looking for a fade that looks professional.

      "content": "Talk to the barber about how short you want your hair to be. If you've gotten a fade before, it's likely that you know the number for the buzzer or clippers that they typically use. If you have this information, let them know. Otherwise, just explain how short you want your hair to be on the sides, back, and top. [3] X Expert Source Arthur Sebastian Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 29 April 2019. For a very short fade, ask for #1 or #2 sized clippers on the back and sides (a #1 is 0.125 in (3.2 mm) long, while a #2 is 0.25 in (6.4 mm) long). If you want to keep your hair a bit longer on the sides and back, ask for a #4 (0.5 in (13 mm) or #5 (0.625 in (15.9 mm)). [4] X Research source Mention the length you want on top, too. Say, \"I'd like to be able to part my hair,\" or \"I want the front to fall over my forehead\" if you don’t have an exact measurement. When in doubt, ask for a slightly longer cut than you think you want. The barber can take more hair off, but they can’t add it back if it’s too short!"

Can you do a 2 on the sides and back and a 5 on top?\" Or try something like, \"I want my fade to look like Lupe Fiasco's old fade, but I want the fade to start higher on the sides.\""

Since a fade reveals the skin underneath your hair, go for a cut that makes your skin tone look consistent from neck to scalp. Try a traditional fade, a tapering fade with longer hair on the back and sides (like a #4), or a scissor fade. [6] X Research source If your skin tone is even across your scalp and neck, go for a high or low fade. They’ll look great!"

Thick, dense, curly hair can be faded more easily, but that doesn’t mean folks with thin or fine hair can’t get the look! Go for a middle fade that doesn’t rely on precise lines, like a scissor fade, or one with a more abrupt fade line, like a temple fade, that makes your top hair look thicker. [7] X Research source Know that you might be a little more limited on styles if you have thin hair. Low and high fades look good on people who have thick, dense hair."

If you’re self-conscious about the shape of your head, go for a traditional middle fade or ask to keep the back and sides a bit longer (like a #4 or #5) for more coverage. If you’re comfortable showing more of your head, consider these fades based on your face shape: [8] X Research source Choose a high fade if you have a round, square, or heart-shaped face. A higher fade elongates the face, especially when it’s paired with a pompadour or quaff on top. Go for a low fade if you’ve got an oval, rectangle, or diamond-shaped face."
