      "title": "Yes, absolutely!",
      "content": "Yes, absolutely! Because urine and period blood come out of different holes (urine comes out of your urethra, while period blood comes out of your vagina), a tampon will in no way hinder your ability to pee. With that said, the string at the end of your tampon can get in the way and end up soaked with pee, which can be kind of annoying. Fortunately, a wet string won't cause any health issues, and there are some ways you can avoid getting the string wet in the first place (more on that below!). [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Sit on the toilet seat, but don't pee yet. If you are using a public toilet, you may wish to squat above the toilet, without actually resting on the seat. Otherwise, you can use a seat-liner or tear several strips of toilet paper, lay them on the toilet seat, and sit. Make sure you have pulled down your pants and underwear or lifted your dress or skirt before sitting down. Squeeze the muscles around your urethra (the opening through which urine exits your body). You only have to do this for a moment, but squeeze tight so you don't start peeing as soon as you sit down."

Only do this if you aren't also going to defecate, and be sure the string doesn't actually touch your anus. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Change your tampon if the tampon itself gets wet. If the actual tampon gets wet, it means it wasn't inserted properly and should be changed. Your tampon should be inserted far enough into your vagina so no part of the tampon itself is showing (the absorbent part), only the string. [7] X Research source It is not necessary to change your tampon every time you urinate. Change your tampon based on how long you've had it in ( never over eight hours) or if your tampon is leaking or \"full.\" If your tampon isn't ready to be changed, you will meet some resistance when you pull on the string. Always try to match your tampon to your flow--don't wear a super-absorbent tampon on a day when your flow is light. This can make removing the tampon uncomfortable."

[8] X Research source If you do get feces on your tampon string, use a wad of toilet paper to remove the tampon and throw it away. Make sure your hands are clean before attempting to insert another tampon--if there is feces on your hands, you could spread an infection to your urinary tract or vagina."

This can keep them from using tampons, since they don't want to change it every time they pee, or somehow harm themselves or disrupt their periods. Your body has an opening specifically for urine--the urethra. Feces comes through the anus. Your menstrual blood comes out of your vagina, which is located between your urethra and anus.
