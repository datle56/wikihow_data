[1] X Expert Source Stefanie Safran Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 8 May 2020. You want her to know that you’re asking her out in a romantic sense, not just as friends. You don’t have to repeat a script word-for-word, but you’ll feel more comfortable if you have a general idea of what to say. Here are some examples of things you could plan to say: [2] X Research source “I got tickets to the Taylor Swift concert in August. Would you want to come with me as my date?” “Would you like to go to the new bookstore and grab a coffee together afterward?” “I’d love to take you out to dinner next weekend. How about the new Thai place?” If you’re really shy, use that to your advantage. You can even plan to say something like, “You know I’m a pretty shy person, so this is a little awkward for me, but I wanted to tell you that I think you’re really nice and have a great sense of humor. Would you want to go play mini-golf next weekend?” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Wait to ask her until you’re fairly certain she’ll be in a good mood.

[4] X Research source Asking a girl out in person can be nerve-wracking! To help ease your anxiety , set a deadline for yourself and commit to asking her before that date.

      "content": "Talk to her when you’re alone together. If a girl is with a group of friends when you try to ask her out, she may get embarrassed or not be able to talk openly because she might feel uncomfortable about how many people are watching your interaction. Plan out a way that you can comfortably talk to her one-on-one. [5] X Research source You could ask to walk her to her next class. You could ask her to wait up after a meeting because you have a question for her. You could even send her a text asking her to meet you somewhere."

Avoid slouching over, staring at the ground, or mumbling. Remember, you don’t need to say more than 2-3 sentences. If you’re nervous, practice what you’re going to say in front of a mirror several times. You could also record yourself asking her out. Play it back to yourself to see how you sound and make any adjustments that you need to. Do you say “umm” or pause a lot? Keep practicing until your question sounds natural."

      "title": "Ask her out!",
      "content": "Ask her out! Once you’ve gotten her attention and are talking to her, you just need to take a deep breath and calmly ask her on a date. Say something like, “Would you like to grab a drink at the new coffeehouse this Sunday?” or “I’d like to get to know you better. What do you think about taking our dogs out for a walk something this weekend?” Remember to be direct and confident. If you want to do something a little more romantic, consider something like having flowers delivered to her house. Then, follow up with her in person and say something like, “I hope you liked the flowers I sent. What do you think about going out this weekend?” You could also do something a little out of the box, like have a pizza delivered to her with a note attached that says something like, “This is a little cheesy, but I’d love to go out to dinner with you this weekend.”"

Do your best to not take it personally; try to view it as a “not the right time, not the right person” situation, and move on as best you can. [7] X Research source Definitely don’t try to convince her that she is making a mistake. She knows what she wants and trying to make her do something else will make her feel uncomfortable. Try saying something like, “No worries—I’m glad I at least asked and don’t have to wonder! I hope you have a great day.” Be sincere and try to smile and not sound sarcastic."

Want to go play arcade games and get something to eat this Friday?” Telling her you think she’s attractive clues her in that this is a romantic message and not just a friendly one. [10] X Research source Remember to ask about a specific activity. For example, “Would you like to go out on a date with me next Saturday? I thought we could get dinner and go see a movie,” sounds much more romantic than, “Want to hang out sometime next weekend?” The latter could be misinterpreted. Text isn’t the only option—you could use DMs in different social media apps or send a cool video through Instagram or Snapchat ."

Check out her social media to see if there are any clues there, too.
