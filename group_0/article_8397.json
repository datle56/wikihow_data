      "content": "Open your laptop and shake it gently over a trash can. [3] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 28 August 2019. Turning your laptop upside down and shaking it helps to remove any dirt, dust, or food crumbs that have fallen beneath the keyboard, dislodging any material that's stuck beneath the keys. Try tapping all of the keys on your keyboard repeatedly and then shake it over the trashcan again. Tapping the keys helps to dislodge dirt and other material that may have collected over the weeks, or years, since the last time you cleaned your keyboard. You may see some unwanted debris fall out as you gently shake the laptop, but don't be discouraged if you don't. Doing this will still help break up unwanted gunk that will be dealt with as you continue cleaning."

[5] X Expert Source Filip Boksa House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 20 August 2019. Hold your MacBook Pro at a 75-degree angle as you spray the compressed air. [6] X Research source This angle helps dirt, dust, and debris fall out, rather than pushing them deeper into your laptop. You'll want to move the compressed air from left to right, moving down the length of the keyboard and then back up to make sure you have reached every pocket. Be sure to keep the end of the straw about a half-inch away from the keyboard. Avoid inverting the can while you are spraying. You may want to get a friend to help you hold your computer at this angle while you spray. If you have a MacBook Pro that is older than the 2016 model you can skip the compressed air. Using compressed air on older models of the MacBook Pro can force dust deeper into the laptop, rather than blowing it out."

      "content": "Rotate the laptop and spray compressed air at the keyboard. Turn your laptop to the right and guide the compressed air through the keyboard from left to right, traveling up and down the keys. Maintain the same 75-degree angle to be sure that dust continues to fall out of your keyboard. [7] X Research source Rotating your computer in this way helps the compressed air continue to clean out all the nooks and crannies found beneath your keyboard. Don't forget to keep the end of the straw about half an inch away from the keyboard. The compressed air has enough force that it will be able to clean out the keys from that distance. Spraying it any closer could damage the keys."

      "content": "Rotate the laptop again, spraying compressed air at the keyboard. Turning your computer to the left will make your cleaning process complete and thorough by allowing the compressed air to reach beneath all of the keys at a few different angles. Continue to lead the compressed air from left to right, tracking up and down the keyboard in a zig-zag manner. This is a good time to do a final once-over with the can of compressed air. If you think you may have missed a spot, take the time now to access it. You may want to give your laptop one more gentle shake over the trashcan, for good measure."

Avoid abrasive cloths or paper towels that might scratch your keyboard. A soft microfiber cloth is the best choice here.

      "title": "Use disinfectant wipes to clean the surface of your keyboard.",
      "content": "Use disinfectant wipes to clean the surface of your keyboard. This deep-cleaning action can be the most rewarding part of cleaning your laptop keyboard. Cleaning with disinfectant gets rid of any spills, stains, and especially dirty crevices. This will also get rid of unseen germs and bacteria. It is not uncommon for a small amount of grime to accumulate on the surface of your keyboard, so take your time as you wipe the surface and apply extra attention to food spills or grimy corners. Be gentle with the keys by pressing lightly, although you can scrub harder on dirtier sections if you're careful. [9] X Research source Make sure your disinfectant wipes don't contain bleach. Apple suggests using a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe, 75% ethyl alcohol wipe, or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, [10] X Research source DO NOT spray liquid directly onto the keyboard. Apply the liquid to a lint-free, microfiber cloth, instead. [11] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 28 August 2019. Remember that liquid is not a friend to your keyboard. The last thing you want to do is damage your keyboard while you're trying to clean it. Less is more when it comes to using a cleaning solution. You can also use electronics cleaner and a microfiber cloth in place of the disinfectant wipes. Or, try making a cleaning solution yourself, using equal parts water and rubbing alcohol. Be really careful to avoid liquid pooling around your keyboard. Have a dry towel on-hand to mop up any spilled cleaning solution."

Just make sure you get the exact part for the exact key that is broken for your exact Macbook model. You can get them online from Amazon.

Since the keys have a lot of fragile parts that are easy to break, it's probably best that you don't remove all the keys and clean them, unless you really need to. Figure out which keys need to be cleaned. To do so, go along the keyboard and press each key. See which keys are sticking, feel crunchy, or are hard to press."

These include most of the square-shaped letter and number keys, the small, rectangle function keys along the top of the keyboard, as well as the Command, Control, Fn, and Option keys. To remove these, place a tiny flathead screwdriver under the bottom left corner of the key. Use your finger to apply light pressure to the top of the key. Move your screwdriver along the bottom of the key and pry the bottom loose from the clips. Once the key is detached from the clips along the bottom, pull the key towards you to detach the key from the top clips and then remove the key. Before removing the keys, you may want to take a picture of your keyboard so that you can remember which keys go where when you reassemble your keyboard. The Tab key and the delete key have a support bar that rotates attached to the key. Be aware of it and be careful when removing these keys so that you don't break any of the hooks the bar attaches to. If you don't have a tiny flathead screwdriver, you can use a thin piece of plastic or metal, or a playing card and a toothpick."

Apply pressure to the top of the key with your finger and go along the bottom of the key to detach the key from the bottom clips. Once the bottom clips have been released, use the screwdriver to detach the key from the two key clips on both sides of the key. Rotate the key up and pull the key towards you to remove it. The top support bar should still be attached to the key. The larger keys have two scissor clips that you need to detach. The Spacebar is the hardest key to remove."
