      "content": "Gather evidence. Before you confront your husband, you need to be sure he is cheating. Do what you can to obtain evidence without infringing too much on his privacy. Keep an eye out for ways to gather information. For example, if he is checking his phone right in front of you, peer over and see if you notice him texting with a woman. See if the texts seem flirty or inappropriate. Try to see whether he smells of different kinds of perfume after he comes home. See if he openly communicates around you or whether he slinks off to the corner of the house to make phone calls or send text messages. Keep track of his stories and look for inconsistencies. It takes him effort to keep track of lies and he may make mistakes upon repeating a story about his whereabouts. Write down what he says so you're sure you aren't fooling yourself if you think he is changing his story."

      "content": "Assess your evidence. Before you confront your husband, review your evidence and make sure that it is enough so that he cannot lie his way out of having an affair. Based on the evidence you have, think about what he might try to say to convince you he is not actually cheating. For example, if you find some emails that are about him getting a drink with a co-worker and it seems flirty but it is somewhat ambiguous as to whether he cheated, ask yourself whether this combined with what else you know about the situation is convincing enough or whether you should wait to find out more."

Neither of you will be thinking straight and this may give him the opportunity to slam the door and run away.

For example, you might say, \"I wouldn't throw this out there lightly, but I'm really worried that you've been showing behaviors that suggest to me that you may be having an affair and I want to talk about that with you.\" If you find yourself getting worked up, try taking a few deep breaths in and out. Try to remind yourself that although the pain may be near unbearable now, all emotional pain heals over time. [4] X Research source"
