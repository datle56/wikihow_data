      "content": "Wash your hair thoroughly using shampoo. Lather up your hair while you’re in the shower, using your favorite shampoo. Rinse the shampoo out thoroughly with clean water once you’re done. [1] X Research source Brush your hair before washing it if it has tangles. Washing your hair before applying the mask helps open up the cuticles in your hair."

      "content": "Use a towel to remove excess water from your hair. You want your hair to still be damp when you apply the hair mask, so don’t towel-dry your hair completely. Try squeezing out excess water by blotting sections of your hair with the towel. [2] X Research source Use a microfiber towel or a T-shirt for a gentler way of drying your hair. Avoid using terry cloth towels. Having too much excess water in your hair will dilute the mask once it’s applied."

      "content": "Part your hair down the middle to separate it into 2 sections. Try to make them equally-sized, but they don’t have to be exact. If you have short hair, use hair ties to pull together the hair on the left side and right side of your head. For longer hair, you can simply pull each section in front of your shoulders.

      "content": "Use the masks as frequently as you need to depending on your hair thickness. For example, if you have thin or very short hair, only apply Kerastase hair masks occasionally, such as once a week. If you have thick or long hair, you can use the hair masks after every shampoo."

      "content": "Gather a quarter-sized amount of hair mask using your fingers. Dip 2 or 3 fingers into the container, scooping out a small amount of hair mask. Rub the hair mask ingredients between your fingers so that you’re ready to spread it throughout your hair. [4] X Research source If you have long, thick hair, you can use double the amount of hair mask. Avoid using more than the recommended amount of mask—Kerastase hair masks have a high concentration of ingredients."

You can do this by simply placing your hands under running water and then massaging individual strands of your hair to help the hair mask work fully. [8] X Research source You don’t need to create a cup with your hands to hold water, you just want your hands damp. If you have a spray bottle, you can also add a few sprays of water to your hair to get it wet."

Continue doing this with other strands of hair until you’ve completed your whole head. [9] X Research source It’s best to do this over a sink or in the shower so that you don’t make a mess."
