[1] X Research source Note that you do not need to prepare a baking sheet for the corn. For this method, you'll need to place the ears of corn directly onto the oven rack. Do not cover the oven rack in aluminum foil, either."

      "title": "Rinse the corn.",
      "content": "Rinse the corn. Quickly clean the outer husks by rinsing them beneath cool, running water. Use your fingers to scrub away any visible dirt or debris. Do not remove the husks from the ears of corn. If there are any silks hanging out of the ends or leaves peeling away from the sides, use clean kitchen scissors to trim them away."

      "content": "Cook the corn for 30 minutes. Arrange the ears of corn in a single layer directly on the center rack. Cook the corn until it becomes tender. [2] X Research source If there's another oven rack above the center rack, you can let it remain in place as long as it does not come into contact with the corn. If it does, you should remove it completely or move it to a position beneath the center rack. Try to keep the corn in a single layer. If you need to stack it, you may need to increase the overall cooking time. You'll also need to make sure that the pile of corn does not touch the upper heating element of the oven. To check for doneness, gently squeeze the sides of the ear. It should be firm, yet soft enough to press through the husk."

      "content": "Peel down the husks. Remove the finished corn from the oven and let it cool for several minutes. When the husks are cool enough to touch, carefully peel them down from each ear. Consider holding the base of each ear with an oven mitt before peeling down the husks. Also note that the steam escaping from the corn will be very hot, so you should never point the ears directly at your face. You can wrap the husks around the base of each ear to serve as a handle or remove them completely. The choice is yours to make."

Meanwhile, prepare four sheets of aluminum foil, sizing each so that it is 1-1/2 times as large as any one ear of corn. [4] X Research source If there's another rack sitting above the center rack, you can leave it in place as long as it will not block or touch the ears of corn once they're in the oven. If this problem does occur, you'll need to remove the top rack or place it beneath the center rack."

Melting the butter beforehand may make it easier to spread evenly over the ear of corn, but doing so is not strictly necessary since the butter will melt over the corn as it roasts. Sprinkle any seasonings over all sides of each ear to distribute them evenly."

After the first 10 minutes, rotate the baking sheet to promote even cooking on all sides of the corn. Check the corn after 20 minutes by carefully squeezing the sides of the foil. Wear an oven mitt as you do this to protect your hands. When ready, the corn should give a little through the foil without breaking or feeling mushy."

The foil will likely release very hot steam as you unwrap it. To protect yourself against burns, do not hover your face or arms over the corn while removing the foil. After unwrapping the corn, poke one of the kernels with your fingernail or a fork. When ready, the juice should shoot out from the kernel when pierced. [5] X Research source If this doesn't happen, you may need to loosely wrap the corn and return it to the oven for another few minutes."

Some broilers only have on and off settings, while others also have high and low settings. If yours is the latter, switch the broiler onto high. Place the upper oven rack roughly 6 inches (15 cm) away from the upper heating element of the oven. This upper heating element is the only portion that turns on when you use the broiler."

Instead, use scissors to cut the husks down to a length of roughly 4 inches (10 cm), then wrap the hanging husks in aluminum foil. Pick away any hanging silks during this step, as well. Wrapping the husks with foil is a necessary step. If you don't do this, the husks will quickly burn under the intense heat of the broiler and may even catch on fire. If you don't wish to use the husks and stem as handles while serving the corn, you can remove them completely."

If desired, you may also season the corn with salt and pepper. You can cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil, if desired, but doing so is not necessary. Note that olive oil is a better choice than butter for this method since it has a higher smoking point and will be less likely to overheat in the broiler."

You'll need to rotate the after the first 3 to 5 minutes, then twice more every 3 to 5 minutes after that. When ready, the corn should be lightly and evenly charred, and tender throughout. Note that you can also remove the foil from around the husks during the last 2 minutes, if desired, so that they can char lightly without burning."

Make sure that the upper rack of the oven is about 6 inches (15 cm) away from the top heating element. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut each ear into four sections. Completely remove the husks and all visible threads from the ears of corn. Use a knife to chop each ear into four equal sections. Depending on the thickness of the corn, it may be possible to break the ears apart by hand instead of using a knife. Doing so will give you less control over the size of the sections, though, making it harder to keep the sections even."

Lightly brush each section with oil or melted butter, and sprinkle the corn with salt and pepper (if desired). Since olive oil has a higher smoking point than butter, it's usually the safer option for the broiler. Since the corn should cook quickly when sectioned, though, you should also be able to use butter without much trouble."

Cook the cob sections for 3 to 5 minutes, or until some of the kernels begin to char, then flip them over to their other sides. Continue cooking until the other sides char, as well. Consider brushing the other sides with additional oil and butter before returning them to the broiler. Note that doing so may result in more splatter inside your oven, though."
