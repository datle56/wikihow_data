If you want to accelerate your career, consider seeking either a bachelor’s or master’s of science in the field of electric engineering.

A tradesperson with a bachelor’s degree only needs to have around 5,000 hours (about 3½ years) of experience compared to one following a normal course. For those with master’s degrees, it’s even less—approximately 3,500 hours, or roughly 2½ years on the job. Degree-bridge opportunities may not be offered in every state or territory."
