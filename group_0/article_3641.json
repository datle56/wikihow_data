      "content": "Choose a boxing club to join. You want one that is affiliated with a national boxing organization and that also has a reputation for training fighters. If you are serious about this, do not go to a health club that happens to have boxing classes. You need a gym that's dedicated to boxing (and potentially other martial arts). Odds are if you do a bit of asking around, you'll find the place that has the reputation as the best of the best in your area. There will likely be no doubt about it which club you'd like to join."

      "content": "Talk to a trainer. He will explain their hours of operation, fees and methods of training. You can also find out his experience as a boxing coach and whether he was a fighter himself at one point. Meet the staff and get a feel for the place. If it fills you with a sense of excitement and anticipation, it's probably right for you. Do ask questions. Find out what they would recommend for you and what kind of training you should start. What's their schedule like? Who would you work with? How can you meet everyone? Make sure you know what you're getting into before you sign up."

      "title": "Check their membership.",
      "content": "Check their membership. You want a club that has a wide range of clients at different levels. As you begin to develop your skills, you will want to start sparring with other people. A club with fighters at all different levels mean that there will always be someone for you to work with and that you can go grow with the club. Think of it like walking into a restaurant: if there's no one there, you wouldn't eat there. And if there's only people in blue hats and you're not wearing a blue hat, you might not eat there. If there's only people who seem to be miserable, you probably wouldn't eat there. So take a look – do the clients seem A) fit and competent and B) happy with their training? If you can, find someone who doesn't work there about the establishment. Sometimes you need an unbiased party to get an honest opinion."

      "title": "Familiarize yourself with the basics.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the basics. Before you start working with a coach, it's probably a good idea to know at least the 101 of boxing and some of the terminology. You don't have to be good at it, you should just know a little of what your club peers are talking about. Here's a few starters: Jab. This is the busiest punch in boxing. It's a simple punch thrown to your opponent's chin with your leading hand (the hand of the forward foot). Cross. This punch is thrown with your dominant hand. It is a power punch. It involves a slight rotation of your torso, simulating a horizontal moment a cross your plane. Uppercut. This punch ends up in your opponent's chin or solar plexus. It's thrown at close range and can be quite the cincher. Hook. This is a short sideways punch delivered with your elbow out and to the side so your arm forms a hook. Southpaw. This is a left-handed fighter (either naturally or converted). To a \"normal\" fighter, they do everything in reverse. Because of their stance differences, they practically fight on top of each other. Outside and inside fighters. An outside fighter likes to keep his distance, stepping in for the jab. An inside fighter stays close, preferring moves like the uppercut."

Your instructor will show you the basic boxing moves like jabs, uppercuts and hooks and instead of just knowing the terminology, you'll be getting good at it. You will also be given pointers in footwork, positioning and defense moves. A good trainer will also work on your secondary skills, like endurance and agility. When he sends you running around the block, it's for good reason. And don't expect to be sparring just yet – he'll let you know when you're there."

      "content": "Start a complete physical training regimen. The number of ways a boxer can better his or her body is endless. A good program will include heavy and speed bag punching, circuit training and jumping rope. You should be training outside of the ring several times per week at a minimum. You should be doing cardio and weight training, in addition to brushing up secondary skills with dance, yoga, interval training, and core exercises. That being said, have a day or so a week where you take it a bit easier – you don't want to wear your body out without even getting into a fight."

      "content": "Start some pretty intense workouts. These workouts should last 90 minutes and be done three to four times per week. A good boxing based workout would be 20 minutes of sit-ups and push-ups, 20 minutes on a stationary bike and then 30 minutes of jogging. The session could finish with 10 minutes of jump roping and 10 minutes of sparring with a punching bag or, if possible, another person. A 3-mile run shouldn't really be a problem for you. Combine it with jumping rope, jumping jacks, sit-ups, push-ups, and bag work. [2] X Expert Source David Engel Muay Thai Instructor & Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 5 May 2020.

      "content": "Remember to stretch. You should be doing 20-30 minutes of dynamic stretching (rotating joints, working out any particularly stiff spots, no stretches held for a long time) before a workout and/or sparring. After any workouts spend a considerable amount of time doing some long static stretches (stretches that are held for a long time). This helps prevent injuries and reduce muscle stiffness. You may laugh, but taking up yoga isn't a bad idea. It'll help with your muscle tone, flexibility and reach, and get your entire body loosened up and ready for anything. That's not to mention the peace of mind and focus it can grant, too.

What's more, if you eat poorly, your performance won't be top notch. Your body is your moneymaker in this situation. What's a boxer's diet? It's high in healthy proteins – namely chicken, fish (like salmon and tuna), eggs, peanut butter and fruits and vegetables. It also includes sources of healthy fats, like olive oil, avocado, and nuts.

To be a great boxer, your legs are constantly moving. Sometimes in teeny, tiny moments, which can be even more difficult to make. After rounds and rounds of fighting, your legs will feel like cement. You can prolong your leg endurance by doing activities like jumping rope. [6] X Expert Source David Engel Muay Thai Instructor & Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. Shoulder endurance. When your shoulders are tired, say goodbye to your punches and your defense. You won't even be able to hold your hands in front of your face when your shoulders are down for the count. So work on that speed-bag and do arm endurance drills consistently."

      "content": "Train your mind, too. Boxing isn't just about boxing. Sure, that's the brunt of it, but you need other skills to make you well-rounded and ready for the future. Don't laugh just yet – consider a few of these ideas: Take a dance class or two. Plenty of athletes, not just boxers, take dance classes. Why? Dance is all about balance, agility, and flexibility – three very important skills in sports. Take an acting class. You want to do promotions, commercials, and get sponsorships, right? You also don't want to look like an idiot doing them. So brush up on your skills in the spotlight to emphasize your charm. Study business or sports management. This is good for two reasons: A) you don't want to pull a Mike Tyson and blow all your money nor do you want to be taken advantage of by people who say \"they deserve a cut\" and B) you want a future. Your body won't be able to box forever, so having a more practical but related background can help you transition into coaching or promoting."

Visit USAboxing.org (if you're based in the US, of course) to get a list of information by state. Once you do this, you'll be able to find open events that you can participate in."

This is done at the state level through the State Athletic Commission when it comes to the US. You will have to contact the necessary people to get your license to compete in events.

This is essential in the beginning stages of your fighting career in order to prevent potentially fatal injuries while you learn to protect yourself. Again, you will be placed according to your weight, age group and class, which will begin as \"novice\" if you're 17 or older.

      "content": "Don't just fill a vacant slot in a weight class. Some coaches are pretty sketchy. They'll encourage to fill a slot in a weight class just so you can get going and they can start profiting off of you. Don't do this – sometimes it's just not healthy and your body will take to injury much more easily. Only compete where you feel comfortable, not where your coach says you should go. Think about where your weight normally stays around (provided it's consistent and you're fit, of course). You may be able to compete at about 5 pounds more or less than that, but anything greater will likely put strain on your body and be unhealthy."

      "content": "Up your defense, speed, power, and sense of autonomy. Let's cover these four things separately: Defense. You'll be looking at anywhere from 60-150 punches per round. It doesn't matter how powerful your own punches are – you've gotta have that shoulder endurance and keep your defenses up and going at 100% at all times. Speed. You're fighting against opponents that are the speediest you've ever fought. It doesn't matter how powerful you are – if you can't get a punch in because you're too slow, you won't be getting anywhere. Power. This comes from good technique. Sure, throwing wild punches will catch your competition eventually, but you'll just wear yourself out. You've got to be able to concentrate your power and control it. Waste it and you've lost the match. Autonomy. By now, you need to be on autopilot. You don't have time to be thinking, \"Okay...now I should do a left uppercut...keep your hands up, kid...oh, time to duck,\" that sort of thing. Every move needs to be a gut reaction."

You will now be earning money, but keep in mind that at least 20% of your pay will go to the manager and the matchmaker. That being said, it's worth it – they're the ones working on beefing up your reputation. By now, you're probably pretty immersed in the boxing community. You'll know which managers are in your area and which ones are legitimate. If you have talent, they'll probably want to take you on. Just make sure it's someone you get along with and can trust."

Then there's a middle tier that can score some airtime on TV and can make a quick couple of thousands of dollars. But then there's everyone else. You won't be bathing in gold coins for a while, so keep your day job for now. It's kind of like Hollywood – you don't realize how many people are struggling to make it big. This is normal to start out. And keep in mind that up to 50% of your wages are going to the people below you, like your promoter or manager. Keep your income steady by having at least a part-time gig on the side."

      "title": "Get licensed.",
      "content": "Get licensed. You will have to join a professional boxing association (IBF, WBC, WBO, or WBA) and get a boxer's license from the boxing commission you will be fighting in. There's a term for this called \"alphabet soup.\" It's been coined because it seems like association after association is springing up like wildfire. If you don't like the sound of one, there's a dozen others you can consider. In the US, again, this is done at the state level. Each state has different requirements, ranging from experience as an amateur to having a manager. At the very least, have your birth certificate and social security card at the ready – there will be plenty of paperwork."

If you can hold belts in three out of the four associations, you will be classified as a \"Super Champion.\" Holding all four belts makes you the \"Undisputed Champion.\" This takes time and diligence, in addition to withstanding injury and defeat. Your skin will have to be thick in more ways than one. Boxing has a way of weeding out the weak of body and the weak of mind."

      "title": "Look to the pros for inspiration.",
      "content": "Look to the pros for inspiration. The media has a way of glorifying specific types of people. The most famous boxers are the ones that were charismatic and ate up the camera, like Jack Dempsey. But if you dig a little deeper, there's no real stereotype boxers fit into, apart from the fact that very few aren't exactly average. Keep in mind that talent and accomplishment don't necessarily mean glory. Gene Tunney outboxed Jack Dempsey twice , but his self-contained demeanor kept him from living in the limelight, unlike his gregarious, extroverted opponent. Boxers aren't all looking for fame. Take a cue from them that boxers come from all walks of life. Need inspiration that you can do it all? Turn to Calvin Brock, the \"boxing banker.\" He was a well-educated man with a legitimate career in banking when he turned pro. If you're already in college, don't sweat it. It's doable. On the other hand, you're never too young, either. Juan “Baby Bull” Diaz went pro at sixteen. Sure, he didn't last long, but he still did it. Now he has a law degree and is still doing well for himself. Whichever road you take, you'll likely be fine."
