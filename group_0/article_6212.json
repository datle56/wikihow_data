      "content": "Head to the Safari Zone. Dratini can only be caught in the Safari Zone. You don't need to worry about which Pokémon you will use to fight, as there are no battles in the Safari Zone. You can get to the Safari Zone from Fuchsia City. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Start fishing. Dratini can be caught in any of the four areas of the Safari Zone. Throw your line out into any body of water you see to start fishing. There is a 15% chance that the Pokémon you catch will be a Dratini. When you hook a Pokémon, you will need to press the A button to set the hook, otherwise the Pokémon will get away. There is a 1% chance that you will catch a Dragonair, Dratini's evolution."

      "title": "Throw a Rock.",
      "content": "Throw a Rock. You have four options when you start a Safari Zone battle: you can throw Bait, a Rock, or a Safari Ball, or you can Run. Throwing Bait will make it less likely to run away but decreases the catch chance. Throwing a Rock will make it easier to capture, but increases the chance it will run away. Throwing Bait followed by a Rock will cancel the effects of each. If you want to improve the catch chance, either throw one Rock, or a Bait followed by two rocks."

      "title": "Throw a Safari Ball.",
      "content": "Throw a Safari Ball. If the ball doesn't capture the Dratini, it will have a chance to run away. If it runs, you will need to fish again to catch another one. If it stays, you can try another Safari Ball on your next turn."

Dratini can be used in a variety of party builds, thanks to its speed and Dragon-type attacks.
