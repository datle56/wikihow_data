[9] X Research source If the wheels of your chair cannot be removed, use a hose to power wash the wheels and base of your chair. This may require moving your chair base outside or into the tub. The pressure of the hose may also help to loosen and remove debris. An alternate method to soaking the wheels is cleaning them with a cloth soaked in surface cleaner followed by a cotton pad soaked in rubbing alcohol. [10] X Research source Depending on the material of the wheels, soaking them on a regular basis can lead to rust buildup and decay."
