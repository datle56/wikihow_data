      "title": "Allow the mattress to deflate without help.",
      "content": "Allow the mattress to deflate without help. To deflate, you will typically need to pull the plug or twist a valve. Do not jump on the air mattress while it is deflating to speed up the process. You should not hit it or use anything to make the air release faster. Forcing the air out can damage the mattress, plug, and valve. With some thinner air mattresses, you can fold the mattress in half to force the air out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold carefully.",
      "content": "Fold carefully. Keep the air plug or valve open as you fold the mattress. Once the air is out, lay the mattress out flat and fold it lengthwise onto itself twice until you have a thin rectangle. Then, start from the opposite end of the plug or valve and use your palms to roll it tightly, as if you were rolling a sleeping bag. Use your knuckles and fingers as you roll to apply pressure to the mattress."

      "title": "Use a protectant cover.",
      "content": "Use a protectant cover. Using a cover can extend the life of your mattress, as well as protect it from bugs, spills, and mold. A vinyl zip cover will work to protect an air mattress. Put the cover on every time you use the mattress, and remove it when you are done using the mattress."

      "title": "Avoid storing the mattress in humid areas.",
      "content": "Avoid storing the mattress in humid areas. Storing the air mattress in an area with humidity or high temperatures can shorten the lifespan of your air mattress. High, fluctuating temperatures and humidity will put unnecessary stress on the materials. This is why garages and unfinished basements are not good areas to store air mattresses. Store your air mattress at room temperature."
