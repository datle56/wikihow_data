Make sure that the rabbit has a varied environment with lots of levels and room to move around, as well as easy access to hay and water. Give your furry friend plenty of space as they get used to their new home, and avoid lifting them up. As they are prey animals they find being held stressful. [1] X Research source Set up a large enclosure that your rabbit can comfortably hop around in without any risk of escaping."

      "content": "Sit near your rabbits so you can begin to bond with them . Let your rabbits hop around their enclosure and come over to you. Don’t try to pick them up at this point—just let your furry friend give you a good sniff before they go on their merry way. To encourage even more bonding, set out some treats next to you, like a small piece of parsley. [2] X Research source Don’t be discouraged if it takes a little while for your rabbit to adjust and warm up to you."

      "content": "Always keep rabbits in pairs or groups. Bunnies are social animals and need a friend of the same species as them otherwise they will get lonely. As much as they might like spending time with you they also need someone who can speak 'rabbit'! A pair or group of bunnies may sometimes nip one another or chase - this is normal. If fighting becomes more intense you may want to reach out to a reputable rescue for rabbit bonding advice. [3] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Dissolve fights by temporarily reducing their space – this will stop them establishing territories. However it is vital that they are slowly then introduced back to larger areas once behaviour normalises. If behaviour doesn’t improve seek advice from a reputable rabbit rescue.

      "title": "Introduce new rabbits",
      "content": "Introduce new rabbits to each other gradually. Start by switching your rabbits’ toys—this way, they can get used to each others’ scent. From there, keep the rabbits in separate areas but let them see one another. While they’re still separated, feed them so they can watch each other while they eat. At this point, find a “neutral” spot that neither rabbit is familiar with and let them meet there. [5] X Research source Make sure that your rabbits are neutered before they meet."

      "content": "Give your rabbit unlimited grass or hay. Grass or hay is the main component of a rabbit’s diet, so it’s important for it to be available at all times—put it out on a daily basis in a clean area of the rabbits' enclosure. Some great hays to consider include: [6] X Research source Timothy hay Orchard hay Brome hay Exception: If you’re caring for a baby rabbit (less than 7-8 months old), give them alfalfa hay and alfalfa pellets , which are both great sources of calcium."

      "content": "Offer rabbits a small portion of Timothy hay pellets . Give rabbits ⅛ to ¼ cup of Timothy pellets for every 5 lbs (2.25 kg) they weigh. Carefully measure out the hay pellets, making sure that you don’t give your bunny too much—otherwise, they might gain too much weight. [7] X Research source 5% of your rabbits’ diets should be pellets - high quality pellets are needed to fill the gaps in a diet, ensure all nutritional needs are met and to maintain a healthy weight. A very small amount of pellets should be fed so the rabbits are still hungry to graze on hay. Muesli style rabbit food is a big no as bunnies will pick out the tasty bits and leave the stuff that’s actually good for them! Pellets can offer certain nutrients that aren’t always accessible in hay and produce. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Give your bunny a small amount of fresh herbs.",
      "content": "Give your bunny a small amount of fresh herbs. As a treat you can set aside leafy, low-carb plants for your rabbit to snack on, like carrot tops and herbs like basil and mint. Non-leafy veggies like broccoli are okay as a rare treat but the more veg rabbits fill up on the less hay they will eat so it's vital you always feed hay first to keep to keep them happy and healthy. [9] X Research source Steer clear of dark leafy greens like kale, Swiss chard, and escarole; since they have a lot of calcium, they could eventually give your bunny bladder stones. Iceberg lettuce also isn’t a great option, since it doesn’t offer much in the way of nutrients. Instead of buying supermarket veg you can pick natural plants. There are many benefits to growing and foraging for your rabbits. Plants like brambles, clover, dandelions and common plantain are great healthy treats that you can gather for free. [10] X Research source Believe it or not, carrots aren’t good for rabbits, since they have a lot of carbs and can mess with your bunny’s internal bacterial ecosystem."

Rabbits tend to consume water and food at a 2:1 or even 3:1 ratio, so giving them a good supply of water in an easy to access bowl is essential. [11] X Research source Water is essential to a rabbit’s health and well-being. If they lose even 10% of their body’s total water content, they could pass away."

Aim to clean and replace your rabbit’s litter box very frequently (once every 2-3 days at the absolute latest).

[23] X Research source Some rabbits might need a more rigorous grooming routine, like an Angora and Lionhead breeds. These breeds will need regular trims to make sure their fur doesn’t become long and uncomfortable for them. Your bunny may need more frequent brushings when they’re shedding heavily, too.
