Caller IDs show the name and number associated with the information the carrier has for you, so it may not be exactly what you want to appear when you call people. To change it, get in contact with your cellular carrier, such as AT&T or T-Mobile. For example, if you go by your middle name at work, but your carrier only has your first and last name, it's likely that no one from work will answer your calls because they don't recognize the name. Your carrier may be able to help you make the change over the phone, or they might direct you to their app or website so you can update the information yourself."

Not every carrier has an app that you can use. Look for one in the App Store or check for information on your carrier’s website. If the carrier's website doesn't advertise a mobile app, they most likely don't have one. Instead, use the website or call them! To do this in the T-Mobile mobile app, open it and go to tap T-Mobile on the Home screen, then navigate to More > Profile Settings > Caller ID . Select the line you want to edit and change the first and last name as you'd like them to appear in your Caller ID. Finally, tap Save Caller ID name . [1] X Research source"
