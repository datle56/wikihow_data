      "content": "Insert a blank CD into your computer. Windows Media Player technically can't convert audio from one format to another. To do this, you'll need to burn audio files to an audio CD. You can then use Windows Media Player to rip the audio CD and save the audio files to WMA, MP3, WAV, ALAC, or FLAC formats. It's best to use a CD-RW for this step since you can burn, erase, and re-burn a CD-RW hundreds of times before needing to replace it. If your computer doesn't have a DVD drive built into it, you'll need to buy and attach a USB DVD drive."
