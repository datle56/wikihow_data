      "content": "Currently, there is no way to change the size of the Windows 11 taskbar. While there was once a registry hack that made it easy to adjust the taskbar size, that hack was fixed in a recent Windows Update. Fortunately, Microsoft is making changes to the Windows 11 taskbar to restore many Windows 10 taskbar features. Upcoming updates will reportedly restore the ability to ungroup taskbar apps and add labels to taskbar icons. [1] X Research source While there's no official word that the next update will include taskbar resizing, there's a pretty good chance this feature will appear in a future update. If you're a power-user who doesn't want to wait until new features are released for all users, consider joining Microsoft's Insider Program . Becoming an Insider allows you to test the newest Windows features while they're still in development."

      "content": "Consider adjusting the screen resolution and scale. Changing your resolution and scale will resize everything on the screen, not just your taskbar, so this workaround won't be right for everyone. But if you find a resolution that makes the taskbar the desired size but makes the text hard to read, you can adjust the text size independently in your Scale settings. To change your resolution, go to Settings > System > Display , then select an option under \"Display Resolution.\" The higher the resolution, the smaller the objects on your screen. Just keep in mind that your video card and monitor might not be able to handle all resolution options in the listâ€”the \"Recommended\" option is usually the best option for your screen. [2] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source If you find a resolution you like but want to make the text larger or smaller, select Scale above \"Display resolution,\" click Text size , and drag the slider to increase or decrease the font size. For example, if you set the resolution to 3072 x 1920 and it makes the text too small to read, you can increase the text size to make text larger."
