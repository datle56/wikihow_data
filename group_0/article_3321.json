Chinstraps may help to accentuate your jawline and make your facial features really stand out. [1] X Research source Who it works for: Chin straps look their best on oval-shaped faces with strong jawlines. How to style: Opt for a thinner chin strap if you have a narrow face or a wider chinstrap if you have a more square face. If you want to make your face look longer, grow your chinstrap out even more!"

Goatees can be shorter or longer, depending on what style you prefer to wear. While some goatees also include a mustache, they look just as good without one. [2] X Research source Who it works for: Goatees work well for any face shape. If you have a narrower face, then a small goatee on your lower chin also looks great. How to style: Woody Lovell, a barber, recommends a small, sharp razor for creating the sharp lines of a goatee. If you want to make your face look longer, then let your goatee grow out more."

      "content": "Trim or shave your mustache as you grow your beard out. Expert barber Juan Sabino advises to use a beard trimmer to “get [your mustache] as short as you can, to where it's almost like a five o'clock shadow,” which will make it easier to shave. “Use soap to wash your face,” continues Sabino, “and make sure you lather it all up…to cause the hair to soften up.” Then, just use a razor following the direction of your hair growth to get a clean shave. If you want your skin to look better when you finish shaving, barber Marlon Rivas instructs to “splash cold water back on your face to close up the pores and give you an even closer-looking shave.” As he goes on to explain, doing so will “close the pores back up and help the skin to constrict itself back to the regular look that it's supposed to have.”"

Rivas mentions that beard oil “gives the beard a little bit of a fuller, more uniform look, and it maintains the straggly hairs,” so it’s an important part of your routine. He advises to “start with just a drop or two and rub it into your hands. Then, apply the oil and massage it into the beard, and then stop by brushing it with a brush or a comb, and then just let it sit there throughout the day.”"

Trim around your neckline and cheeks to get rid of stray hairs and cut off any long or unruly hairs that stick out from your beard. [12] X Research source When you shave your neck, Rivas says it's best to start at the midpoint between your jaw and Adam’s apple. As you get closer to your ear, start to follow the jawline more closely for a neater appearance. Lovell warns, however, that “you do not want to make any unnatural facial expressions when you're trimming facial hair because if…you go back to a natural expression, it's in a different place.”"

      "content": "Does a beard without a mustache look good? A beard without a mustache can look good if it matches your face shape. As Rivas explains, “a person with a more rounded [face] shape should wear their beard a little bit tighter in the area where it grows by the ears. And in the cheekbone areas, trim it down with a slightly more of a blend, so the face doesn't look as round.” Then, you’d do the opposite “for a person with a slimmer face,” continues Rivas. “You might want to have it a little bit fuller in the cheek area so your face fills in a little bit more and gives you more of a fuller look.”"

They’ll be able to tell you what it’s called and if it will look good with your face shape."
