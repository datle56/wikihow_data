      "content": "Sitting in the waiting room might make you more anxious. Avoid arriving really early for your appointment since you might stress out waiting for the dentist to call you to their office. Instead, leave at the latest possible time. If you still get to your dentist early, try waiting outside or in your vehicle until it’s closer to your scheduled appointment time so you’re not in a higher-stress environment.

Let your loved one know that you get really nervous when you go to the dentist's office and ask if they’re available to come to your appointment. When you’re at the appointment, have a casual and relaxing conversation, hold their hand, or ask them to comfort you. That way, you don’t have to go through everything on your own.

      "content": "Your dentist wants to make you feel comfortable and safe. Right when you get to your appointment, let the receptionist and your dentist know that you’re a little bit nervous or afraid of the pain. Let them know if you’ve had bad experiences with other dentists and ask them questions about your procedure. They may have some suggestions or strategies to calm you down. [4] X Research source [5] X Expert Source Alina Lane, DDS Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020. If you haven’t seen your dentist before, stop by their office before your scheduled appointment to meet them and talk about what you’re afraid of. By the time your appointment arrives, they’ll be able to adapt to your specific needs. The dental staff will usually do everything they can to make you feel relaxed during your visit. If your dentist isn’t accommodating to your needs, then it may be time to find a new one. Look for someone who specializes or works with patients that have anxiety since they’ll be able to work around the things that make you nervous."

      "content": "You won’t feel as nervous if you know exactly what’s happening. Talk to your dentist and ask questions about exactly what they’re going to do during your appointment. Ask them to tell you about the procedure first so you can get a better understanding of it. If they have the time, see if they can demonstrate each step before actually working on your teeth. Seeing and hearing the steps takes a lot of the unknown stress off of you and builds trust between you and your dentist. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Ask questions about how painful your procedure will be. Typically, routine cleanings are relatively painless so you shouldn’t worry about them as much. During the procedure, ask them to say what they’re doing out loud so you can mentally prepare for it in the moment."

      "content": "Sedation helps you relax and makes your procedure pain-free. Ask your dentist if they offer nitrous oxide, or “laughing gas,” to help you calm down. They’ll fit a mask over your face and give you enough gas so you’re still able to respond to them. You may not remember everything that happens during the appointment, but you’ll feel relaxed and less anxious. [7] X Research source You’ll usually need someone else to take you to your appointment since sedation affects your ability to drive. If you have serious anxiety or are undergoing a larger procedure, you may be given a full anesthetic and be put to sleep while your dentist works.

Before your dentist starts working in your mouth, talk to them and agree on a signal, such as raising your hand or tapping on the chair 3 times.

[13] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you forgot your headphones, ask your dentist if they have any at the office you can use. Be careful not to bob your head or sing along to your music since it might disturb the work your dentist is doing.

For example, you can ask them to tap on your shoulder when you need to stop your music and listen to their instructions."

Take the medication an hour before your appointment, or whenever your dentist recommends, so you don’t feel as nervous during your procedure.

For one that’s 2–4 hours long, you may get 1–4 mg instead. You will need someone to take and pick you up from your appointment since you cannot safely drive after medication."
