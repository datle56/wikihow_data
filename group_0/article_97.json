      "content": "The number 33 symbolizes change and growth. If you’re seeing this number, it could be an alert from your guardian angels that you’re about to undergo some big growth, but it may also be a nudge that you need to take some steps yourself to change and become who the universe has destined you to be. Assess your life honesty: are you reaching your potential? Where might you have taken a wrong turn on the path of life? [2] X Research source Be upfront with yourself about aspects of your life that could use some improvement—maybe your job or your relationship has started to stagnate, but it’s too comfy and familiar to leave. Own up to any mistakes you may have made or times you may have acted out of fear or self-interest. It’s hard to address mistakes, but it’s necessary in order to fulfill the divine purpose the universe has ordained for you. Anyway, nobody is perfect! Even the holiest among us takes a wrong turn now and then. It’s getting back on track that counts."

Maybe you’ve been diving into your work too much lately and you’ve been taking your relationship for granted. If that sounds like you, consider the number 33 a nudge from your angels to take stock of your relationship and appreciate it for what it is. [3] X Research source This often means drawing closer to your partner—making time for date nights or showing them you care for them by asking how their day was or giving them more hugs than usual. However, it could also mean assessing the health of your relationship and determining if it’s right for you. The number 33 means not shying away from the truth: when you drop all of the distractions and assess your relationship head-on, it’s possible you’ll realize it has an expiration date."

      "content": "If you’re single, number 33 is a sign to be on the lookout for love. If you’ve been hung up on former relationships or too afraid to take a chance on someone new because you were hurt in the past, take heart, and be brave: the number 33 is a sign a deep and meaningful relationship is waiting for you, if only you stop and look for it. You may even find your soulmate . But you have to put yourself out there if you want love—you can’t keep potential partners at arm’s length. If the idea of putting yourself out there is overwhelming to you, take it in baby steps: try going to more events where you might meet new people and make a promise to yourself to have a friendly chat with one stranger, or ask friends if they know anyone who they could set you up with. If your wounds from previous relationships are standing in the way of meeting someone new, consider therapy: a licensed counselor may be able to help you unpack any baggage that could be holding you back from a new relationship."

      "content": "Number 33 means your bond with your twin flame will grow stronger. Just as the number 33 includes the number 3 repeated, so is your twin flame a mirror image of you: one soul split between two bodies. If you see 33, it’s a sign that your bond with your twin flame will intensify, the similarities between you both becoming unmistakable, almost as if you’re becoming one person. This connection can lead you both closer to your destinies—let it happen. [4] X Research source Remember, a twin soul and a soulmate are different . While twin souls share the same soul split in half, soulmates contain separate souls that complement one another."

      "content": "If you’ve yet to find your twin flame , 33 means they’re close at hand. 33 is all about fearlessly throwing yourself into your passions and purpose and really getting to know the real you. This is how you’ll attract your twin flame. As you grow more open and vulnerable and shamelessly you , your twin flame will see themselves reflected in you and be drawn to your side. [5] X Research source There’s no rhyme or reason to meeting your twin flame, unfortunately. There are no “twin flame” apps. So waiting for your twin flame will take a lot of patience and hope, as well as just diving into your passions and hobbies. The wait may get frustrating at times, but it’s worth it, we promise."

This might mean building new connections with people in your field, taking on new projects or finding new inspiration, or even looking for a new job . Who knows, it may even mean shifting your career trajectory entirely! Take stock of where you are in your job right now: is it where you want to be? If you’ve been at your job for a while, it might feel a little stagnant and in need of some spicing up. If you don’t take steps to breathe new life into your career, your angels may! You can make small movements to spice up your work life on your own, like befriending new coworkers or asking your boss if you can take on some different responsibilities—or it might mean uprooting yourself and seeking a job in another city."

No matter how much money you receive, remember to stay appreciative of the little things in life, the things money can’t buy.

Your angels want you to remember that you can make a difference in the world as long as you’re optimistic and believe in yourself. The best way to do this is by engaging in your passions and purpose: you’ll find meaning in the things that bring you joy, you’ll see what you’re capable of, and you’ll raise your spirits and self-esteem. Changing yourself is the first step to changing the world. Relish the little moments: that first sip of coffee, the first rays of daylight. A nuzzle from a stray cat. The smell of asphalt after a hard rain. Appreciate everything. Try to find a silver lining in everything. This doesn’t mean downplaying bad news, burying negative emotions, or pretending things are OK when they aren’t. It just means understanding that everything happens according to the universe’s divine will: it may not be OK now, but it will be. We promise. Reader Poll: We asked 216 wikiHow readers what they find most helpful for coping with setbacks, and 52% of them said reflecting on the lessons learned and moving forward.
