      "title": "Create a Ticketmaster account.",
      "content": "Create a Ticketmaster account. This will enable you to do more than just recovering passwords and order histories, etc. It helps you save personal information (such as credit/debit card information), as well as the ability to print out receipts and tickets as soon as they are purchased."
    },
    {
      "title": "Specify your city.",
      "content": "Specify your city. This will allow you to filter specific categories and events related to what is planned in the future."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find your event category.",
      "content": "Find your event category. Search and browse around from sports games to rock concerts or family friendly events. If you know of a future event but Ticketmaster does not show it in the search, please know that tickets are not going to be available until a later date."
    },
    {
      "title": "Study the seating chart.",
      "content": "Study the seating chart. This can not be expressed enough. Look up the name of the venue/area the event will take place on an alternative web site. Ticketmaster does not always show you specific seating so you need to do research elsewhere to know exact numbers or letters. Even if it's in the same arena/venue, the seating charts will not be the same as another show/event (for example, concert vs. basketball game). You need to know how close or how far you will be away from the main entertainment or stage, as well as different levels (if applicable), as there is a clear difference between a floor seat and balcony seat (bleeder or near the ceiling) Lots of venue websites, especially the ones located in metropolitan cities, have their own seating chart for different events."

      "content": "Click ‘Skip this step’ on the pop up page that appears asking how many tickets you want to buy. This pop up will waste your time and may result in you losing tickets!"

      "title": "Act quickly on the seating layout and available tickets screen.",
      "content": "Act quickly on the seating layout and available tickets screen. This screen will show you a non labeled layout of the venue and you will need to know exactly which seat number/section you want to be in. On the right hand side of the screen there will be different options of available tickets that you can purchase. Click on your option as quickly as possible! Tickets on this website will be sold out in the blink of an eye, especially for high demand artists."

    {
      "title": "Choose your delivery method.",
      "content": "Choose your delivery method. Shipping methods look exactly like as if you're purchasing any other item online. Depending on where you live, you might find ground shipping to be the most efficient. If the event date is closer than a month or you wish to have the tickets immediately, choose the option of printing your tickets out or picking them up at the local box office. When printing tickets out, they will be an actual ticket, just on a 8\"x11\" paper instead of regular ticket stubs - remember to bring the entire paper with you to the event!"

    {
      "title": "Continue on with purchasing.",
      "content": "Continue on with purchasing. You'll need to enter your credit card information or how you will be paying for the tickets. Having an account has it's perks, as you wouldn't need to worry about inputting information every time. This page also has its own unique timer, so please be sure that you have everything in front of you beforehand."
