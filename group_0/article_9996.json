A non-stick pan is best and will save you time cleaning. You can substitute oil in the place of butter if preferred. Olive oil goes well with plaice, and 2 tbsp (30 ml) is a good amount to cover the pan and fry to perfection. [1] X Research source"

Fry for 2 minutes and then carefully flip each fillet over, and cook for another 2 minutes, or until cooked through.

      "content": "Season the pan-fried fillets as desired. Plaice is a light, fresh fish that goes well with simple dressings. You can squeeze lemon juice, with salt and pepper to taste across the fillets for a simple seasoning. Lemon parsley butter also accompanies pan-fried plaice nicely. Combine 2 tbsp (25 g) of butter, the juice of ½ lemon, and a handful of chopped, flat-leaf parsley in a pan until hot. Drizzle over the pan-fried fillets for an easy dish. This is enough for 2 fillets. [5] X Research source"

When the fish is cooked through, remove from the oven and leave resting for 1 minute, before transferring onto a serving plate. [9] X Research source You can tell that the fillets are cooked through when you make an incision in the middle of the fish, it looks opaque, rather than translucent like when it’s raw. Cooked fish will also easily break into flakes when it’s done. [10] X Research source"

The incisions should be deep, but not go entirely through the fish. About 1 centimeter (0.4 in) deep works well. [20] X Research source"

This is because a heat too low won’t adequately cook the fish, but a heat too high will cause some parts to dry out and others to not cook fast enough. [24] X Research source"
