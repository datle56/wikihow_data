      "content": "Spray the solution and wipe your mirror from left to right. Spray a liberal amount of your vinegar solution onto the mirror’s surface, starting at the top. Then, take something like a microfiber cloth and wipe across the mirror horizontally from left to right. Repeat this pattern until you reach the bottom. If your mirror has a wooden frame, avoid spraying the vinegar-water solution on the frame since it can get damaged. Another option is to spray the solution directly onto your cloth and then use it to wipe down the mirror. While vinegar isn’t toxic, still make sure that the room is well-ventilated as you work by opening a door or window, or by turning on a fan."
