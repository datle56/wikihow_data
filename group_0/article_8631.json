      "content": "Put your reptile in a safe enclosure before you begin cleaning the sand. Make sure this secondary container is clean and secure enough that your pet won’t escape. It will only be in this enclosure for about 2 hours, so you should only worry about the bare necessities here. [1] X Research source For instance, you don’t have to worry about putting food and water or clean substrate in this holding container, since your reptile will only be there for a short while."

      "content": "Move the sand from your reptile’s habitat to a 5 US gal (19 L) bucket. Use a small scoop to transfer the sand over in small batches to avoid having to lift up your reptile’s terrarium. Pour the sand into the bucket through a sand sifter to remove some of the larger pieces of debris right away. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a sand sifter, you can also use a colander with tiny holes to strain the sand. You can buy a sand sifter at most mass retailers."

      "title": "Pour water and bleach into the bucket, then stir.",
      "content": "Pour water and bleach into the bucket, then stir. Fill the bucket with enough water so that it’s nearly full, but leave enough room at the top so that you can stir the water without spilling it. Then, add 1.75 fluid ounces (52 mL) of bleach to the water. Use a large wooden spoon to stir the sand at the bottom of the bucket and sift out the dirt and debris in the substrate. [3] X Research source When you stir the sand, feces, debris, molted skin, and food waste will all float to the top of the bucket, leaving much cleaner sand on the bottom. For best results, allow the sand to “soak” in the bleach water for 3 minutes before you stir it."

      "title": "Dump the bleach water out of the bucket and repeat this process twice.",
      "content": "Dump the bleach water out of the bucket and repeat this process twice. Pour all of the dirty water out of the bucket, then replace it with another mixture of water and 1.75 fluid ounces (52 mL) of bleach. Stir the sand in the bucket to clean it and repeat. [4] X Research source Overall, you should go through this stirring process at least 3 times."

Make sure whatever material you use is clean to avoid getting the sand dirty again. [5] X Research source Alternatively, you can also spread the wet sand out on a clean tarp to allow it to air dry if you don’t have a pillowcase or flour sack towel."

If the sand isn’t completely dry after 30 minutes, leave it in for an additional 15 minutes. [8] X Research source If the sand still isn’t dry, give it another 15 minutes. Although you can’t really “overcook” your sand, you shouldn’t have to bake it for more than an hour at most."

Then, place the terrarium liner in the bucket, making sure it’s completely submerged under the water. Since most reptile carpets are pretty flexible, use a bucket that is as tall as your liner is wide. That way, you can wrap the liner and soak it on its side."

Keep an eye on your reptile after you put it back in its tank to make sure it doesn’t have any negative reaction to the liner. [14] X Research source Be on the lookout for signs of illness in your reptile, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, or a darkening of the skin. These may all indicate that your reptile is having a negative reaction to the newly cleaned liner."
