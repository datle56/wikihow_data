[1] X Research source Is this the right place for putting on shades and slouching? Is it the right time to talk about the Chocolate Vomits show at which you stage dived last night? Acting cool at work may be a lot different than acting cool in middle school, but you can learn to identify the different cool and uncool crowds, and tailor your coolness accordingly. In a very large group, like a whole middle school or a whole company, try to find a smaller group of people to befriend and be cool with. Situate yourselves as the \"in\" group in opposition to the lamestream, er, the mainstream. In a smaller group, it might be more appropriate to remain aloof to play it cool. If you come out too strong, you'll likely just make everyone think you're a weirdo, not cool. Find another cool buddy to be cool with and position your small clique as the in group."

      "content": "Act like you've been there already. According to an analysis of \"cool kids\" [2] X Research source one of the traditional markers of coolness is that other people perceive that cool people are more experienced, mature, and knowledgeable than they are. That doesn't mean you need to have spent time under the bleachers, at underground rock clubs, or in foreign countries to give off a cool vibe, nor does it mean you need to start bragging about things you've never done. You can learn to put on a mysterious and experienced act that people will believe. Practice vague responses to specific questions about your experiences that will seem cool. If someone asks if you're a virgin, or have ever smoked a cigarette, say, \"What is this, a sewing circle?\" or \"That's a boring question\" and change the subject. Throw it back in their face. Never make stuff up. It won't make you seem cool to lie and say you've been to Europe, or that you've done illicit things in the back of a car when you haven't. The truth will come out eventually and you'll be exposed and embarrassed."

[3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source You're floating above the lame drudgery of the world in your super-cool cloud. You can't be a follower and act cool. Other people should want to be like you, because you're setting trends, surprising people with your fresh outlook and opinions, and bucking the common wisdom. Play devil's advocate in group discussions and casual conversations. Don't get attached to being right or wrong, just poke at people's expectations and dissent every now and then for the sake of coolness. All your friends ragging on a teacher? Stick up for her. Being different is cool. Alternatively, it may be \"cooler\" to join up with the crowd in some cases. In middle school, acting cool might mean embracing the newest Justin Bieber song, even if you're not crazy about Biebs. You can still listen to the good stuff when you're alone. But try to be true to yourself."

[4] X Research source Instead, just chill, kick back, and wait. Let other people talk first. Practice good listening skills, staying quiet until someone else wants to start the conversation. Acting cool means you're not desperate for chat. Just take 'er easy. Whatevs. Take long pauses before you speak, even if you're fairly sure of what you're going to say. Dramatic pause will give people the chance to contemplate your smarts and your seriousness. Be stoic, like Kathryn Hepburn, Clint Eastwood, and the titans of cool. Don't forget to slow your roll, too. Walk more slowly. Look around, scoping the sites. Smell the flowers. Walk with a cool lope, rather than an efficient bustle."

If you're going to join the ranks of the super-cool, and start acting like the cool, enviable person with the awesome life that you have, it's a given that you'll attract some haters. Learn to deal with them. Keep a close watch on your social networking, unfriending or ignoring anyone who hates on your awesomeness. You don't need to listen to it. Instead, surround yourself with people who'll lift you up and support you in your coolness. Prepare cool responses to haters. If someone tries to make fun of the super-hip style you're trying out at school, saying, \"What are you wearing?!\" have a cool response prepared just in case: \"Maybe I should let my mom dress me, like you do.\" Spread the coolness around and bestow it on others. The bigger your cool clique, the less chance haters will have of effecting you. Build a strong group of cool friends with similar interests so you won't have to be a lone wolf."

One common misconception is that \"cool\" kids are an exclusive group, like the Navy SEALs, and if one of your friends can't pass the cool test, they'll get cut. A cool person treats everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of whether or not they're really \"cool.\" Seek out a diverse group of friends. Befriend other kids at your school that aren't necessarily considered \"cool\" and speak up for them to your friends. Build good will rather than sewing resentment. Some recent studies show that kids considered \"cool\" in middle and high school end up experiencing functional difficulties in their early adult years, as a result of pretending to have more mature experienced early in life, alienating friends and close ones. [5] X Research source Don't make the same mistake as the ruthlessly cool. Keep your real friends around."

Unless you want to wrap yourself in space blankets and wear undertaker make-up, it'll be hard to break new ground in the fashion department. The better and quicker way to spice up your cool style is to pick a cool muse, icon, or idol to borrow tips from. Actors, musicians, and even older siblings or locals can all make great style icons. Some classics might include: Paul Newman in Cool Hand Luke . Sometimes nothing is a real cool hand. Work shirts and banjos never looked cooler than on Newman in this classic flick. Study his icy gaze and his witty come-backs as you cultivate your style. Bonus: being familiar with this oldie flick will make you stand out among the Transformers-obsessed. See also: Steve McQueen in Bullitt , Peter Fonda in Easy Rider , and live clips of Johnny Cash. Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's . Hepburn's bootleg brand of glamor made her a style icon in the 60s. Striking sophistication and manic weirdness can go hand-in-hand, she taught us. Also check out Brigitte Bardot in any film, Anna Karina in Band of Outsiders (obscure French film bonus points!), and Nancy Sinatra clips on YouTube. Vintage Fashion photography. Check out Mae West, Betty Page, and issues of Vogue from the mid-50s to the 70s. There's a whole wealth of cool going unnoticed at the local library. Need a fresh breath of style in your life?

It's not cool if it doesn't look good. Find something that you like to wear. Wear sunglasses for classic cool. There's one constant in the cool-fashion universe: sunglasses look awesome on everyone.

You want to give off the impression of feeling comfortable as you, as if you're at ease in the world you inhabit. Try not to tap your feet anxiously, or chew your fingernails, even when you're just sitting. Sit quietly and contemplatively. Anxiety makes everyone anxious. Quiet dignity? That's cool."

If you want to be athletic-cool, the first step is to get in shape and start putting your body to good use in sports, exercise, and other physical activities. You don't have to be a pro athlete to be athletic-cool, but you do have to be in shape. If you like sports, pick one and commit to a team or building a particular skill. Play soccer, football, basketball, golf, tennis, or whatever sport drives you wild with competitive energy. Get as good as you possibly can and get into shape by playing often and working out. If you don't like traditional ball-and-net sports, many people still cultivate an athletic-coolness by getting into yoga, long-distance running, weightlifting, cycling, or hiking.

Whether you're on a team or by yourself, do everything you can to win, whether you're playing a board game or starting in the Super Bowl, win at all costs. Take every opportunity for competition seriously. When Rafael Nadal was injured and recuperating, the loss of tennis competition drove him nuts, so he threw himself completely into competitive high-stakes poker to keep his competitive edge razor-sharp. That's cool. try to be a good winner and a good loser. Cool means you drive others and yourself to succeed at the highest level, but also realize that you're ultimately playing a game. If you lose, congratulate your opponent and have the dignity to appreciate their achievement. There's nothing cool about whining like a sore loser."

A quiet day indoors spend crafting and catching up on Battlestar Galactica ? Forget about it. The cool athlete wants to start the day with a 5-mile bike ride, fuel up with fruit and oatmeal, then shoot hoops until the last possible minute before leaving for work or school. Cool athletes take every opportunity to push their body to the limit. Go to public parks and gyms to meet other like-minded cool athletes. Play pick-up games in your area to make sporting friends and feed your competition monster. Be a beast on the field."

Some hot brands for the cool athlete include North Face, Patagonia, Under Armour, Nike, and Adidas. These companies make regular clothes as well as extreme-use gear for a variety of purposes. Pick gear appropriate for your interests. Every sport likewise has a specific range of task-specific stuff you can check out when you learn more about your sport.

The cool athlete is always checking into the Bleacher Report to see if Kobe's really going to retire, if Cristiano Ronaldo's knee has healed up properly, if RGIII can live up to the hype. Pick your favorite teams and rivalries, with extra bonus points for local and regional teams.

Maybe nothing can more instantly inject you with cool juice than a taste in hip music and a contemporary knowledge of what's cool. You don't want to be the guy at the party with outdated taste, asking everyone if they've ever heard of Radiohead. Check out cool archival record labels like Numero Group, Tompkins Square, and Light in the Attic, to learn about old obscurities. While the lame kids go gaga over Mumford and Sons, go deep into Laurel Canyon desert folk, Minneapolis soul comps, and weird ambient music from the 80s. Good and obscure equals cool. Go to local shows and learn about the local scene in your area. If you can get in on the ground level with the next hip band before they get big, you can tell all your friends you knew them back when they were playing in your basement. Cool points +1000. Collect vinyl records, both old and new. CDs are dead, and MP3s lack the cache of a sweet stack of vinyl. Most new records come with download codes anyway, meaning you can still check out the same record on your iPod. Bonus!"

Shrug your shoulders: \"Sounds cool, I guess.\" Your boyfriend just broke it off with you in front of all your friends? Laugh it off. He was a loser anyway. Alternatively, if you're at a party full of \"too cool for school\" types, who sneer and can't even be bothered to take off their leather jackets, it might be cooler to speak out. Be the one cracking jokes, cutting up, and being loud. Find the mainstream and act in opposition to it, if you want to act cool."

Bass guitar? Always cool. But you've also got to stay ahead of trends by keeping your ear to the underground and finding the \"next big thing,\" which might mean getting off the \"Harlem Shake\" train before it gets lame. It's cutthroat, the cool game. When you see Ninja Turtles novelty tees at K-Mart, the trend has probably crossed over into lame.

Hit up art openings, concerts, and poetry readings. You'll attract the other cool sorts. At your school, see if there's an art, guitar, or foreign language club you could join to hang out with other cool and worldly people. It's a good way to make cool friends.

Cool people shake up the norm and do surprising things that make other people want to learn from you and sap off your cool vibes. You can cultivate some quirks that'll make you stand out and get noticed. Maybe you could carry a cane with a rattlesnake on the handle for no reason. Maybe you develop a love of exotic butterflies, and decorate your room with your collection of specimens. The line between weirdo eccentricities and \"cool\" is sometimes blurry. Have fun with it and do something you really enjoy that's odd, unique, and cool. Try thinking of calling cards, cool quirks that'll make you different and cool.

Look cool by controlling the chaos of your hair, your clothes, and your make-up. Jeans and shirts should not be ironed, but not super-wrinkly or dirty. Holes in your jeans are cool, and so are paint-splattered boots and sneakers, as if you just came straight form the studio. Necklaces, bracelets, and piercings are usually cool, if they make you feel good. Use your judgment. Shark teeth necklaces look cool on Johnny Depp, but might make you look like a dork. Combined with other cool stylings, you can start to build a look for yourself. Wash your hair the night before school, rather than right before school. Going to bed with slightly-damp hair can give you rockstar body and frizz, giving it a controlled kind of wildness. You can always comb it out if it looks too crazy. Cool make-up is usually minimalist. Go for a light natural look, highlighting your features and your own natural coloring."

The newest Facebook privacy updates? Smart-cool people read about that three days ago, thank you very much. Always try to update your hardware as soon as possible. The newest start-up apps, devices, games, and trends are usually cooler than slightly dated varieties. The new iPhone is cooler than the old iPhone. Why are you reading a paperback?
