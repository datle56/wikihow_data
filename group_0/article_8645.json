      "content": "Beat your shoes together to loosen large clumps of dirt. Hold a shoe in each hand and bang the soles together forcefully a few times. This will help dislodge clumps of soil, dried mud, and similar substances that have become caked on the tread. [1] X Research source Be sure to take your shoes outside or hold them over the garbage can to avoid making a mess. If necessary, try scraping the soles of your shoes gently against the curb or sidewalk to wear down thick, persistent residue."

      "content": "Scrape away any remaining dirt with a plastic knife or similar tool. Stick the tip of the knife into the crevices in the tread and use it to dig out any dirt left behind after the initial beating. Focus on cracks, depressions, grooves, and other contours where dirt is likely to become trapped. [2] X Research source If you don’t happen to have any plastic cutlery available, you can also use one of the keys on your keyring. Work carefully and be patient. Scraping out stubborn clinging dirt by hand can be time-consuming, but it’s the best way to ensure that your shoes come out completely clean."

      "content": "Use a toothbrush to scrub hard-to-reach spots. Another type of stiff-bristled brush, such as a shoe brush, can also do the trick. Run the brush back and forth over the bottom surface of the shoe. The bristles will easily sweep out particles that are lodged too deep in the tread for you to reach with a knife or key. [3] X Research source An old toothbrush will be your best bet if the soles of your shoes have a complex tread pattern with lots of different textures, or if you’re having difficulty getting the majority of the dirt out with just your scraper. Consider investing in a durable nylon shoe brush that you can keep around for the purpose of cleaning your shoes.

Together, the ingredients will form a thin paste that you can slather onto the soles of your shoes using a brush or clean cloth. After 10-15 minutes, rinse the soles clean, or wipe the paste away with a separate, damp cloth or sponge. [19] X Research source You can also make a simplified baking soda paste using only equal parts baking soda and water. When combined, baking soda and vinegar undergo an instant chemical reaction and become fizzy, acidic, and slightly abrasive. This compound action is what makes them so effective for cutting through substances like grease and set-in stains that other cleaning products don’t even make a dent in. [20] X Research source"
