      "content": "Start off small. No matter how obvious it may sound, it's helpful to actually realize that outgoing people didn’t go straight from the womb to parties. They had years of practice in safer environments: speaking to their siblings, joking with their classmates, and so on. You can simulate the natural way of becoming outgoing – by starting off small and proceeding incrementally. What’s a small step you can take today to do something slightly more outgoing than you used to do? Start with people you know, or, if you are starting fresh, find a small group of people that you share an interest with. A book club, sports team or hobby group is a great place to start. Try something new with this group such as participating in a bar crawl or arranging a barbecue and let people bring friends."

      "content": "Say thank you in public. You might see some of the same people every day, but never acknowledge them. To become outgoing, it is important to start acknowledging the people around you more often. The next time you order a coffee or check out at the grocery store, smile at the person helping you. Make eye contact and say, \"thank you.\" This small gesture will help you become more comfortable interacting with others, and it will probably make the other person's day a little brighter. [1] X Research source A little compliment can also go a long way, especially in service situations. Remember that your grocery clerk or barista serves hundreds of people a day, many of whom probably either ignore them or are rude. Say something like, \"Wow, thanks for getting that to me so quickly\" to show your appreciation."

Once you've established eye contact, give the other person a friendly smile. If the other person holds your gaze, then go over to them and introduce yourself. If the person smiles back at you, then that is also a good sign. If the person does not respond, let them go their way. There's a difference between being \"outgoing\" and \"pushy.\" You don't want to force interaction on someone who isn't interested. Keep in mind that this approach doesn't work well in situations where people do not expect to be approached, such as while riding public transit. Part of being outgoing is knowing when and where to approach others and when to keep to yourself."

Maybe try introducing yourself by saying you’re new to the area, or offering a compliment to the other person. Look for other “wallflowers.” You may not be comfortable jumping straight from “shy” to “social butterfly.” If you’re at a social function, try looking for other people who appear to be shy or holding back. Chances are, they feel as uncomfortable as you do. They’ll probably be happy that you made the first move to say “hello.” Be friendly, but not pushy. Once you’ve introduced yourself and asked a question or two, move on if the other person seems disinterested."

These questions invite others to respond with more than a “yes” or “no.” It’s easier to start up a chat with someone new if you invite them to share about themselves. [2] X Research source If you've already exchanged eye contact and smiles with someone, and you're close by, start off with a question. Here are some ideas: How do you like that book/magazine?

In order to find out what you can talk about, you may have to probe for things you have in common. If you work together or have mutual friends or have anything that links you together, it should be a bit easier. Talking about work, your mutual friend, or your common interest will open up further topics of discussion. If this person is a stranger, you could use the situation to help you come up with something to talk about. For example, if you're in a bookstore, you could ask someone for a favorite reading recommendation. If you're both stuck in a long line, you could make a joke about it. Be careful to avoid comments that sound judgmental. For example, you could say you love the person's haircut and then ask where s/he got it done. Or you could say that you've been looking for a pair of sneakers like the ones the other person's wearing, and ask where s/he got them. Avoid things that are likely to seem offensive, such as comments on the person's size, skin color, or physical attractiveness."

If person A is dead set on talking about thermodynamics and person B is dead set on talking about Italian coffee, then the conversation isn't going to go anywhere. One of these people has to latch on to the other person's interests. Take the initiative and be that person. When you're making small talk, try to notice when the other person perks up. You'll be able to hear it and see it. Their face will be more expressive (and so will their voice) and you'll probably see movement in their body."

A common misconception is that people will like you more if you become \"better.\" A bigger home, a faster car or a well-paid job look like great investments when it comes to making friends. The truth is there is no correlation between success and making real friends. People don’t like hanging out with those they feel subordinate to. Instead of trying to hide or kill your flaws, know that a weak paycheck, a bit of a belly, or spending too many hours watching TV only makes you more human and likable. Take yourself less seriously. You don't have to get people to know about the new sound system you bought or that cool place you went to for a vacation. Instead, you could tell stories about funny shortcomings. You don't have to stop improving, just do it for yourself instead of others."

Instead, try engaging people by remarking on popular culture or sports. While people often have strong opinions about these subjects too, they’re a safer bet to keep it conversation-friendly. Being outgoing at work can be important. By being more outgoing, people will perceive you as more friendly and positive.

[4] X Research source For example, if you’ve been talking about your dogs together, ask about a good local dog park. If the other person responds positively, you could invite them to bring their dog to the park too: “Have you ever been to the dog park off Baxter Road? I haven't. What would you think of going together next Saturday?” Making a specific invitation is more effective than “let’s get together sometime” because it shows that you’re not just being polite. Once you’ve finished the conversation, wrap up by restating a main point you discussed. This will help the other person feel like you were listening to them. For example: “Good luck with that marathon on Sunday! I’d love to hear all about it next week.” End by affirming that you enjoyed the conversation. “It was really nice talking with you” or “It was so nice to meet you” help the other person feel valued."

Instead of telling yourself to be outgoing, set goals to have at least one conversation with a new person each day or to smile at five people every day. [5] X Research source Try to make small talk (or if that's too much, just smiling) with one stranger or acquaintance every day, say \"hi\" to someone on the street, or ask your barista’s name.

[6] X Research source Look for a club that encourages socializing, such as a book club or cooking class. You can ask questions and get into discussions, but the focus won’t be entirely on you. These situations can be great for shy people. Shared experiences can be a powerful bonding technique.

You could host a BYOB wine tasting, where everyone has to sip and compare notes.

Be careful not to let judgments slip into these compliments, such as \"That dress makes you look so thin!\" That type of comment focuses on social standards of beauty rather than the person you're talking with.

It can send a message that you don’t want to interact with others. On the other hand, you can express confidence and power by opening yourself up. You don’t have to take more room than you need or intrude on others’ space, but establish space for yourself. Plant your feet firmly when you stand or sit. Stand with your chest out and shoulders back. Avoid fidgeting, pointing, or shifting your weight. [13] X Research source Your body language also affects how you feel about yourself.

[19] X Research source Avoid looking over the person’s head or at another area of the room for more than a few seconds. This indicates that you’re bored or not paying attention. Repeat central ideas, or use them as part of your response. For example, if you’re talking with someone new at a bar who’s been telling you about her fly-fishing hobby, mention that when you respond: “Wow, I’ve never been fly-fishing. The way you describe it makes it sound like it would be fun, though.” This lets the other person know you really were listening, rather than mentally checking your shopping list or something else.

What did you do to support your chances of success? For example, if your goal was to \"socialize more,\" consider what actions you took. Did you go to a place where you knew a few people? Did you bring a buddy? Did you look for a place to hang out where you might find others who share interests with you? Did you expect to be a social butterfly immediately, or did you set your initial goals small and achievable? Scaffold for your success next time with the knowledge you have now.
