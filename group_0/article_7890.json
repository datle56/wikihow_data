Mold and mold spores can be dangerous if inhaled, so put on protective gear like gloves, goggles, an N-95 mask , and, if possible, a full-body protective suit . Depending on where the moldy area is, seal it off so the spores don’t spread. Cover clean areas with plastic sheeting to protect them. [1] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source In general, the same process is used to clean mold off both finished and unfinished wood. If you don’t have a full-body protective suit, wear long sleeves and pants to cover as much exposed skin as possible. Where does mold grow on wood? Mold is likely to grow on wooden surfaces and areas like decks, fences, and house siding that are often exposed to moisture or standing water or that are in shady areas that don’t dry well."

Test whichever solution you choose in an inconspicuous area to make sure it doesn’t damage the wood, then apply it to the mold—typically with a spray bottle or a clean cloth. Here are some common mold-killing options: [2] X Research source Vinegar: Vinegar is a natural, non-toxic solution that can kill most types of surface mold. Mix equal parts water and white vinegar and spray the solution on the moldy surface. Baking soda: Baking soda works well for mold in sensitive areas. Mix 1/4 tbsp (5 g) of baking soda in a spray bottle filled with water. Shake until it dissolves, then spray it on the affected area. Hydrogen peroxide: Hydrogen peroxide is a stronger option for stubborn mold stains. Spray 3% hydrogen peroxide on the mold or apply it with a cloth. Commercial mold removers: Some mold removers, like Woodrich’s Wood Cleaner & Mildew Stain Remover , are designed specifically for removing mold from unfinished wood. Check the label to make sure your commercial remover is safe to use on wood, then follow the instructions to apply it."

[4] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source Make sure the damp cloth isn’t overly wet to prevent excess moisture from soaking into the wood.

      "content": "Treat the wood with a mold-resistant finish. To prevent mold from growing in the future, apply a mold-resistant finish or sealant once the wood is completely dry and clean. This is especially important if the wood is in a humid area. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to apply the finish or sealant correctly. [6] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Kapur says it’s important to seal wood, especially things like decks, “so the mold doesn’t entrench itself into the substrate,” meaning it will sit on top of the sealant rather than in the wood itself. Kapur recommends Fiberlock paint : “It's a specific paint that basically seals the mold in and then it dies off.”"

Wearing your protective gear, dip a brush or sponge into the solution and gently scrub off all visible mold. Do not rinse the wood afterward, as this will only add more moisture, which could cause more mold to grow. Dry the wood as quickly as possible.

It may be necessary to sand the wood if any stains remain after you’ve removed the mold. Use the finest grit sandpaper available, and keep your protective gear (especially your N-95 mask) on while you work. If there’s a lot of mold, consider having the wood replaced instead."

[15] X Research source Kapur recommends setting your dehumidifier to 50% or 55%.

Wood has natural color variations that can sometimes resemble mold patches. The color and texture should be uniform if it’s a natural part of the wood. Water stains can also resemble mold growth, but they lack the fuzzy texture and musty odor common with mold. Water stains are often light brown or yellow and are confined to specific areas affected by water damage. If you aren’t sure if a discolored spot is mold, dab a small bit of household bleach on it. If it lightens quickly, it’s likely mold. If it doesn’t, it’s probably a natural part of the wood."
