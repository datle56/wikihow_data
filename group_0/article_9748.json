      "title": "Never blame them, judge them, or tell them how to feel.",
      "content": "Never blame them, judge them, or tell them how to feel. You likely have strong feelings about what’s going on and what your loved one should do about it, but it’s important that you avoid being judgmental, critical, or harsh. They’re experiencing pain that you cannot understand, and it is belittling to tell them what to do or how to feel. Listening to what they say without judgment will help them feel valued and respected, and it will show them you’re a safe person to talk to. \"You need to leave them\" or \"You should get help\" are examples of telling them what to do. Even if you mean well, this is usually unhelpful. It’s likely their abuser has eaten away at their confidence and sense of autonomy, and telling them what to do perpetuates the idea that they’re not in control of their own life. They may transition from obeying their abuser to obeying you."

      "content": "Reassuring and validating your loved one will comfort and empower them. Abuse stirs up many emotions, not all of which may make sense to you or seem \"right.\" It’s OK if you’re confused or don’t understand: many times, when people talk, they just want to feel that you care. Listen to your loved one actively, and be empathetic regarding whatever they might be experiencing. Here are some useful, validating phrases to practice: \"That sounds really difficult/frustrating/rough.\" \"I'm so sorry to hear that.\" \"I'm not surprised to hear that you feel that way, given everything you're going through.\" \"You're allowed to be upset.\""

      "content": "Gently talk them out of blaming themselves for their situation. They may feel that it's their fault their partner is abusing them or that they deserve to be mistreated. They may also feel at times as if they’re being ridiculous or irrational, and that it’s “not that bad.” Remind them that their feelings are normal and valid, and it isn't their fault.

      "title": "Your loved one may get defensive if you criticize their partner.",
      "content": "Your loved one may get defensive if you criticize their partner. Whether they know logically that they’re being abused or not, it’s common for a victim of abuse to side with their abuser when someone criticizes them. Hating on the abuser, while thoroughly justified, may make your loved one alienate themselves, which will make it harder to help them.

      "content": "The initiative to leave needs to come from the victim. It’s very hard to watch someone you love be mistreated. You may wish to sweep the victim away and keep them safe, but remember that you're not responsible for your loved one, and you can't force them to leave. Your loved one may feel powerless, and in order to make a lasting change, they need to empower themselves.

Let them move at their own pace without pressure. Work on taking care of yourself and being supportive. It probably feels frustrating watching your loved one struggle. You may feel responsible for their well-being and guilty about \"not doing anything,\" but you’re really doing them a lot of good simply by being there for them."

      "content": "Sharing your feelings may help them see things more objectively. Criticizing the abuser directly might alienate the victim, but framing it in terms of your feelings can make it more palatable. This helps your loved one consider the situation through your eyes. \"I'm worried about your safety.\" \"It scares me to leave you home alone. I remember the bruises she gave you and I worry you'll get hurt again.\" \"I've never seen you so upset, and it worries me.\""

      "content": "Resist intervening, no matter how much you want to. Once you know your loved one is being abused, you may feel the urge to get involved. Unfortunately, jumping into an abusive dynamic is likely to get you hurt, risks alienating the victim, and is unlikely to help your loved one in the long run. Only confront the abuser if the victim asks you to, and if you personally feel that you are able to do so safely. [5] X Trustworthy Source US Department of Health and Human Services Federal department responsible for improving the health and well-being of Americans Go to source If you tell off the abuser, it may anger them. Unfortunately, they may take their anger out on the victim in private later. As tempting as it is, it may endanger the victim. If the abuser perceives you as being against them, they’ll likely discourage or prevent your loved one from interacting with you as much."

An abuser may try to manipulate the situation to drive a wedge between the two of you.
