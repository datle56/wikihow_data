      "content": "Preheat the oven to 375 °F (191 °C) and put the hens in a roasting pan. Lay a wire rack in the bottom of a big roasting pan and place 6 Cornish game hens on it. If you don't have a wire rack that fits the pan, bunch up a few pieces of aluminum foil and place these on the bottom of the pan. [1] X Research source You can easily cut this recipe in half or a third if you only want to make 2 or 3 hens. Keep in mind that the cooking time won't change."

      "title": "Whisk the juice, butter, paprika, and some of the spices in a small bowl.",
      "content": "Whisk the juice, butter, paprika, and some of the spices in a small bowl. Pour 1 cup (240 ml) of lemon juice into a bowl and add 3/4 cup (170 g) of melted butter along with 1/2 teaspoon (2 g) of paprika. Then, whisk in 1 teaspoon (1 g) of the dried thyme, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of the seasoned salt, and 1 teaspoon (3 g) of the garlic powder to make a smooth sauce. [2] X Research source If you'd like to use fresh herbs, loosen the skin near the hens' breasts and push about 6 fresh sage leaves the skin of each hen."

      "title": "Pour half of the sauce over the hens.",
      "content": "Pour half of the sauce over the hens. The excess sauce will fall through the wire rack into the bottom of the pan. Set the remaining sauce that's in the bowl aside so you can baste the hens as they roast. [3] X Research source If you prefer, brush the hens with half of the sauce instead of pouring it over the hens. Brushing the hens will give you more control."

      "title": "Mix the rest of the spices in another bowl and scatter them over the hens.",
      "content": "Mix the rest of the spices in another bowl and scatter them over the hens. Get out a small bowl and put the remaining 1/2 teaspoon (0.5 g) of dried thyme, 1/4 teaspoon (1 g) of seasoned salt, 1/4 teaspoon (0.8 g) of garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 g) of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon (0.5 g) of ground black pepper into it. Stir the spices until they're combined and then sprinkle them evenly over the hens. [4] X Research source You can also fill the hens with your favorite bread or rice stuffing."

      "title": "Bake the hens for 1 hour and baste them at the halfway point.",
      "content": "Bake the hens for 1 hour and baste them at the halfway point. Put the roasting pan in the preheated oven and bake the hens for 30 minutes with the lid off. Then, dip a basting brush into the reserved sauce and brush it over the hens. Cook the hens for 30 more minutes. [5] X Research source The hens should become golden brown once they've finished cooking. For even crispier skin, brush the hens frequently during the last 30 minutes of roasting time."

      "content": "Remove the hens once they reach 165 °F (74 °C). Once you think the hens have finished cooking, insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the thickest part of a hen's thigh. The temperature should read at least 165 °F (74 °C) before you take the hens out of the oven. [6] X Research source Stuffed Cornish game hens may take an extra 20 to 30 minutes to roast. If you stuffed the hens, you'll also need to check the stuffing temperature to see if it's reached 165 °F (74 °C) as well."

The juices will redistribute within the meat and the hens will finish cooking. While you wait, consider dishing up sides to serve with the hens, such as roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or cornbread. [7] X Research source Store the leftover Cornish game hens in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 to 4 days."

Then, take a pair of kitchen shears or a sharp knife and cut through each hen's breast. Flip the hens over and cut along the backbones so you can remove them. [8] X Research source If you don't want to grill 4 hens, you can grill as many as you like. Keep in mind that the grilling time won't change although you may need to grill them in batches if you're making a lot. Discard or save the backbones to make stock."

Press down firmly on the breasts so the hen flattens and spreads out. Then, push a skewer horizontally through a thigh so it goes through the breasts and out through the other thigh. [9] X Research source To prevent the wings from burning on the grill, you can also tuck the wing tips behind the breasts."

Then, cover and cook them for another 15 to 25 minutes. [12] X Research source The hens should become crispy brown and lightly charred in spots."
