      "content": "“Bubblegum, bubblegum” is a rhyme and counting game for kids. It’s played at birthday parties or in school (kindergarten or preschool, usually) as a way for kids to practice counting and have fun, of course. And even though younger kids usually play it, older ones can also play it for fun, too. The rhyme’s lyrics are: [1] X Research source “ Bubblegum, bubblegum, in a dish. How many pieces do you wish? ” The “Bubblegum, bubblegum” game can also help kids practice rhythmic speech, and it’s an activity they can do independently!"

      "content": "Players stand in a circle and hold their fists out. It should be a tight circle, with the kids standing close together. Before holding both their firsts in the center of the circle, players must also pick one person to be the “counter” (who runs the game). [2] X Research source There’s an alternate version of the game where players stand in a circle, feet pointing inward, and point to their feet instead of holding their fists out. Either version will work—so use the “feet” version if you prefer!"

      "content": "Have the counter recite the “Bubblegum, bubblegum” rhyme. As they speak, the counter must use their first to tap everyone else’s (including their own) to the beat of the rhyme. That means they must say, “ Bubblegum, bubblegum, in a dish. How many pieces do you wish, ” tapping one fist per beat. [3] X Research source The rhyme’s beat isn’t the same as its syllables. There are 8 total beats in the rhyme: “Bubblegum (1) , bubblegum (2) , in a (3) dish (4) . How many (5) pieces (6) do you (7) wish (8) ?” The counter can go clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle—it’s their choice."

      "content": "The player whose fist gets tapped calls out a number. At the end of the rhyme (on “Wish”), the counter will land on one player’s fist last. When their fist is tapped, that player must choose a number between 1 and 20 (or 10, if you prefer to keep the game simple). [4] X Research source"

      "content": "The counter counts out the named number. Once a number is called, the counter must keep going around the circle in the same direction as before, this time counting up to the chosen number. This time, the player whose fit they tap last must remove that fist from the circle and hold it behind their back. Then, start a new round (reciting “Bubblegum, bubblegum…”) and repeat the steps until there’s one fist left. [5] X Research source Once both of a player’s fists get tapped, they’re out of the game. The last player with a fist in the circle is the winner! If you’re using feet instead, just move a tapped foot out of the circle (and the last player with a foot in the circle wins)."

      "content": "Clapping and jumping version Instead of tapping fists or pointing at feet, you can play a version of the game where players clap and jump instead (and where there are no winners or losers). Just have players clap their hands to the beat. Then, after “How many pieces do you wish,” the kids can call out a number—and must jump that number of times. After clapping and jumping, have players blow the same number of times. Finally, have them call out “ POP !” while clapping their hands together."

      "content": "Calling “it” for games Kids can also play “Bubblegum, bubblegum” to decide who’s going to be “it” for a different game (like tag, freeze tag, or hide and seek). It isn’t played any differently in this instance—it’s just used for a specific reason. In this version, the last player with a fist or foot in the circle is “it” at the start of the next game. [6] X Research source Another popular rhyme commonly used by kids to figure out who will be “it” is “Eenie Meenie Miney Mo.” [7] X Research source That rhyme goes: “ Eenie meenie miney mo, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go, eenie meenie miney mo. ”"

      "content": "The rhyme’s origins are unclear, but it’s probably from the US. That’s because Walter Diemer created classic pink bubblegum in the United States—in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It originated in 1928; gum existed before that, but it wasn’t meant to have bubbles blown into it! Still, there isn’t much concrete information on where “Bubblegum, bubblegum” comes from or when the game was first played. [8] X Research source Fun fact: did you know chewing gum originated in ancient Greece? Theirs was “mastic gum,” made from the resin of the mastic tree. Definitely not as tasty!"
