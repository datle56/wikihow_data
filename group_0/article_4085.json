      "title": "Highlights",
      "content": "Highlights Adding highlights to your hair helps lighten your natural color so your greys don’t stand out. Because the highlights break up the sections of color in your hair, the blend from dark to grey looks a lot smoother than if you dyed your whole head. [1] X Research source Try using ash grey and cool blonde tones for your highlights to help camouflage greys with your natural brown hair. If you want to enhance the look of your greys , get silver or ice blonde highlights. Add golden or honey highlights to give your hair some extra shine while blending your greys. Go with highlights that add a rose-tint to your hair since the pale colors will draw attention away from your greys."

      "title": "Babylights",
      "content": "Babylights Babylights are highlights on thinner sections of hair to lighten the natural color and hide your greys. Because the babylights are only small sections of hair and are close together, they create a seamless shift from your greys and your natural color. If you’re just starting to notice grey hairs, then this natural, sun-kissed look is perfect for you. [2] X Research source Silver babylights will blend in with the greys already growing in, so they’re the perfect color choice. If you have red or golden tones in your hair, stick with honey or chocolate-colored babylights to bring out the warm undertones. If you have a cool, pale skin tone, then try babylights with a subtle light brown or ash brown hue so they look more natural."

      "title": "Lowlights",
      "content": "Lowlights Rather than lightening your hair color, lowlights darken sections of your hair by 1–2 shades to give your hair more depth and dimension. If you’re not comfortable with the silver in your hair, then feel free to cover your greys with lowlights . Otherwise, leaving your greys against the darker color will help give your silver streaks a subtle pop. With the addition of highlights, your grey hairs will blend right in and create a more natural color transition. [3] X Research source Go for smokey brown lowlights to give your hair depth without looking like it’s done up too much. To embrace your greys, try out silver or grey lowlights to create a trendy and stylish look. For a really dark and dramatic style, accentuate your grey hairs with dark charcoal lowlights that make your silver streaks stand out."

      "title": "Balayage",
      "content": "Balayage Similar to highlights and babylights, balayage is a way to lighten your hair starting with fine strands from your scalp and widening to cover a larger section at the ends. Because you apply balayage without any foil, the lightened sections of hair blend in with your greys and make a natural transition to you your darker hair color. [4] X Research source Go with a classic blonde balayage to lighten streaks of hair and keep your grey hairs hidden. If you want a subtle shine in your hair, try going with a chocolate brown or chestnut balayage for added dimension. To add a pop of color to your hair, try mixing in red- or violet-tinted balayage with golden-brown highlights. For hair with cool undertones, stick with an ash brown or icy beige balayage to keep your greys camouflaged. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Silver streaks",
      "content": "Silver streaks Rather than trying to camouflage your greys, let them show through with long, defined streaks. Start by gathering a section of hair on top of your head and dyeing it your natural color. Leave all the grey hairs alone that are underneath that section. Once the dye sets and you drop your hair back down, your grey streaks will show through and create a trendy style. [6] X Research source Add grey streaks to your hair if you want to make your silver fox look stand out even more. As your dyed hair grows out, leave any greys that reappear. Since you have some natural grey hairs on lower layers of your hair, the new growth will blend in for a smoother shift in color. Try adding streaks of ash brown or rose-blonde if you want a more subtle transition between your hair colors."

      "content": "Grombre “Grombre” is short for “grey ombre,” which creates a smooth color transition from your roots to the ends of your hair. If your grey hairs are growing in prominently at your roots, try doing an ombre style that transitions from silver to dark brown for a natural grown-out look. If only a few silver strands are peppered through your hair, then try going from your dark natural color to grey at the ends. [7] X Research source If you want some additional color, transition from grey to a pop of red or pink at the ends of your hair. Frame your face with grey ombre streaks for a really striking style that accentuates your features. If you only have a few greys you’re trying to blend, choose a subtle silver color to use for your grombre style."

This style is perfect if you have a lot of grey roots coming in and want them to blend in with the darker tones at the ends of your hair. [8] X Research source Use the lightest white or grey colors around the hair that frames your face and transition to darker shades on the back of your head. Try a reverse ombre where your roots look white or light grey and the ends of your hair are your darker natural color.

Push the bristles down so the powder stays on your hair until you decide to wash it out.

Let your greys grow out about 2 inches (5.1 cm) so you have a good starting point for your hair. Then, try a bob cut or get a pixie cut for a fashionable and low-maintenance hairstyle that make your greys look great. Talk to your stylist to figure out what haircut works best with your face shape. Round and oval faces work great for pixie cuts while diamond and heart-shaped faces look amazing with a layered bob."

Grey hair tends to look dull or yellowed compared to your natural color, but a tint-correcting shampoo can help mask those unwanted colors. Once or twice a week, lather the shampoo into your hair working from your roots down to the ends. After you finish washing, just rinse the shampoo out so your greys look their best. If most of your hair has gone grey, then use shampoo made for grey hair since it will help rehydrate your hair and prevent your silver strands from looking dull."

Leave the mask in for around 10–30 minutes so the nutrients can soak in before rinsing it out. [20] X Research source"
