      "content": "Check the humidity levels for the day. If the air is very dry in your area, instead of pulling moisture from the air into your hair, glycerine may in fact do the opposite and release moisture from your hair into the air. If the air is too humid, your hair may swell and retain too much moisture, which can cause it to frizz. So, if the humidity levels are significantly above or below average, use less glycerine than you normally would. [5] X Research source"
