[5] X Research source The continental U.S. has 4 time zones that include Pacific Time (PT), Mountain Time (MT), Central Time (CT), and Eastern Time (ET). Figure out what time zone you’re calling from and calculate what time it is in Iceland before you dial their number. GMT is 8 hours ahead of PT. GMT is 7 hours ahead of MT.

      "content": "Consider daylight saving time. Iceland doesn't observe daylight saving time so adjust the time accordingly during the spring and summer. If it's spring or summer and your clocks are set forward, subtract an hour off of the typical time difference between the U.S. and Iceland. If it's fall or winter, you can calculate the time difference as you normally would. For instance, if you were calling Iceland from ET at 3 p.m., it would be 7 p.m. in Iceland because of daylight saving time."

      "content": "Understand that international calls will cost more. Most phone carriers will associate additional fees when dialing an international number. Make sure to read your plan or give the phone company a call so that you can get a good estimate for how much your call will cost. Some phone companies have plans that reduce the cost of international calling. Some cell phones, like those with pre-loaded minutes, may not be able to make international calls."
