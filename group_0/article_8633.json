      "content": "Brush the speakers with a soft-bristled toothbrush. If the sound from your iPhone is muffled or hard to hear, you can try gently brushing the speaker ports using a brush with very soft bristles. Make sure the brush is clean and dry, as you don't want to introduce any dampness to the speaker. [1] X Research source Make sure to brush away from the speaker so you can sweep dirt and dust out of it. Just scrubbing the brush across the speaker will allow the dust to fall right back into it."

      "content": "Use painter’s tape. Painter’s tape is a blue tape used when painting walls . It has a pressure-sensitive adhesive, which makes it perfect for cleaning iPhone speakers. Tear a short piece off and roll it into a cylinder with the sticky side facing out. The cylinder should have a diameter about the width of your index finger. Slip the tape over your index finger, then press it into your iPhone speaker. The tape should pick up all the grime and bits that have accumulated in the speakers. Check the surface of the tape after each application. If you see lint and grime stuck to it, remove and discard the used tape, roll another small cylinder, and repeat."

      "content": "Gently spray the speaker with an air blower. If done correctly, an air blower can help clear debris out of your speaker. You do not want to use a can of compressed air to clean your speakers, as it can lead to internal damage. An air blower, which is a small device you squeeze by hand, is much safer. Instead of blowing directly into the speaker, use the blower to gently blow air across the speaker. This will sweep away any dirt without pushing it further into the speaker itself. While compressed air isn't safe for cleaning iPhone speakers, you can use it to clean a dusty computer or a mechanical keyboard ."

      "content": "Use a cotton swab to clean a dirty charging or headphone port. If there's dirt or debris in your iPhone's charging port or headphone port, you can swab it out with a cotton swab. Do not dampen the end of the cotton swab with water or rubbing alcohol, as this could damage your iPhone. Remove the cotton from one end of the cotton swab by pinching one end with your thumb and forefinger, then pulling your hands apart to remove the balled cotton. Once removed, discard the cotton. Pinch the same end again, loosely this time. Roll the cotton swab along its axis to spool some of the loose cotton upon itself. Gently guide the narrow end of the cotton swab into the port. Turn the cotton swab around a few times, then remove it."
