      "content": "Comb out any tangles using your fingers or a wide-toothed comb. Start at the ends of your hair, and work your way up to the roots. Never run a comb down from the roots to the ends if your hair is tangled. Make sure to do this while your hair is still wet, not after it dries. Avoid using hairbrushes on wet hair, especially if you have curly hair. This can lead to frizz."

      "content": "Soak up any excess moisture with a towel. Do not rub the towel over your hair. Instead, use it to gently squeeze out any excess water from your hair. If you have curly or delicate hair, you might want to use a microfiber towel or an old, clean t-shirt instead. [1] X Research source The coarse fibers of a regular towel can snag and tear delicate hair."

      "content": "Consider letting your hair air dry part-way before you use a hairdryer. Depending on how thick or long your hair is, this can take anywhere between 20 to 30 minutes. You want your hair to be damp when you blow dry it, but not soaking wet. This can help reduce frizz."

      "content": "Hold the hairdryer about 12 inches (30 cm) away from your hair to rough dry. Rough drying is when you blow dry your hair without using a hairbrush. The only time when you can bring the hairdryer closer is when you are styling your hair. Holding the hairdryer too close to your hair can result in heat damage, and damaged hair is often frizzy."

      "content": "Point the nozzle downwards when you blow dry your hair. Divide your hair into sections and blow dry 1 section of hair at a time. Aim the air downwards from your scalp. Repeat this for each section. This way, the airflow will cause the hair cuticles to lay flat instead of curling upwards. It will make your hair appear shinier and smoother."

      "content": "Use your fingers to keep your hair smooth while your blow dry it. Avoid using a regular hairbrush, especially if your hair is still wet. The brush can damage your hair and make it look frizzy. Once your hair is about 80% dry, you can transition to a hairbrush, unless you have curly hair and want to keep it curly. If you have curly hair and want to keep it curly, wrap the curls around your fingers and blow dry these coils on a low setting. Don't use a nylon-bristle hairbrush because it will disrupt the natural curl pattern of your hair and lead to poof. To straighten curly hair, use a large, round, boar-bristle brush. To style straight hair, use a denman brush, nylon-bristle flat brush, or ceramic-core round brush."

      "content": "Consider using a vented round brush to make your hair straight. Do this only when your hair is almost all dry. Place the brush under a section of hair, close to the roots. Point the nozzle of the hairdryer over the hair section. Slowly bring the brush and hairdryer down towards the tips of your hair at the same time. Keep the hair sandwiched between the brush and the nozzle. You may have to repeat this a few times before the section is smooth. If you don't have a round hairbrush, you can try substituting a regular paddle hairbrush."

There is no real way to permanently fix split ends, and if you leave them untended, the damage will only creep further and further up the hair shaft. As such, you will want to trim the damaged ends off. There are serums and creams that can temporarily seal split ends together. Look for products that say they will mend or seal split ends."

A heat protection spray will help prevent this from happening. However, it is better to leave your hair natural, and give it a few days break between straightening and curling sessions. When blow drying, straightening, or curling your hair, try to use a lower heat setting. Avoid using a high heat setting. It will take longer, but it will be gentler on your hair."
