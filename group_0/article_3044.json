Drink 17 to 20 fluid ounces (500 to 590 mL) of water 2 to 3 hours before you start, then 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) 20 to 30 minutes before or during warm-up. While exercising, drink 7 to 10 fluid ounces (210 to 300 mL) every 10 to 20 minutes. After finishing, make sure to drink 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) no more than 30 minutes later. If the weather is particularly hot, or the workout especially intense, feel free to increase the amount of water slightly. When working out, sports drinks can be helpful to maintaining hydration and energy. Look for drinks that are high in carbohydrates and electrolytes, as these will help you maintain your energy.
