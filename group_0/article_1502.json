      "content": "Keep your skin moisturized . Dark skin tends to take on an \"ashy\" look when not properly moisturized. To keep from taking on an unhealthy-looking gray cast, always apply a moisturizer to your face after your daily shower. If you have dry skin, you may want to use a liquid or cream foundation. For added hydration, you can mix a few drops of moisturizer into your foundation before you apply. Just be aware that this will lessen the coverage. You can also use a tinted moisturizer or bb cream for a dewy finish and translucent coverage. If you have oily skin, apply a mattifying primer on your oily spots, like your T-zone.

      "content": "Match your foundation to your skin tone perfectly. If you choose to make foundation a part of your beauty routine, it's important to find a product that's as close as possible to your natural skin tone. When shopping for foundation, swatch it against your forehead or jawline. It's common for people with dark skin tones to be a little lighter at the face, so using your hand may not give you an accurate match. [3] X Research source In some cases, you'll need 2 foundation colorsâ€”one for the center of your face, and one for the outer edges. Color match the lighter foundation to the apples of your cheeks and match the dark foundation to your jawline or chest. You can also use these colors as your contour. [4] X Expert Source Stephanie Navarro Professional Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 10 June 2020. You can also go to a local beauty shop or the makeup counter at a department store and ask for help there. These businesses often employ skilled makeup artists who might be better able to find the perfect match. Many will also offer a free makeover with your potential new foundation to help you decide. You should make sure the foundation you're thinking about buying is perfect in all lights, not just under the ones in the store. Try shopping without foundation or concealer on your face when trying out new foundations. Go outside and use a hand mirror to make sure the product blends in perfectly in the sun."

      "content": "Use bold blushes . Many blushes that look too bright to be used in everyday makeup on lighter skin actually blend beautifully into dark skin. Bright oranges are especially great for adding a touch of color to your cheeks if you have warm undertones. More subdued colors like rose and coral also complement dark skin nicely. These are great choices for daytime looks. For nighttime makeup, consider using deep, rich colors like plum, wine, and bronze.

While tanning is the trend in Western cultures, skin \"bleaching\" treatments are incredibly popular in India, especially among women with dark skin.

Dark skin is beautiful in its natural state. Don't lighten your skin to conform to some beauty standard. Only do so if it's your own personal preference. [13] X Research source"
