You can use this tool on any platform, including your computer, Android, iPhone, or iPad. This method is great if you just want a quick way to convert a WebM file to MP4 without making changes to the resulting video. You can even use this tool on your Android, iPhone, or iPad. The Veed.io free plan allows users to convert videos no more than 250MB. The maximum export length is 10 minutes. Moreover, there will be a watermark attached in your video. So if you convert WebM to MP4 online with Veed.io, you may need to remove watermark manually. Or you can subscribe to Veed.io to get watermark-free online video conversion. While Veed.io allows you to convert much larger files than most other online converters, it might not be the best option if your WebM file is very large—uploading large files can take a lot of time. If your WebM file is very large, it's better to use a converter like VLC or Handbrake."

To reduce a higher-quality video to make the file size smaller, choose a lower resolution to downscale the video. [5] X Research source For example, if you have an 1080p 60 FPS HD video and want to make the file smaller without losing a ton of quality, you can choose one of the 720p30 presets. The General presets are designed to work on all devices, while the Web presets are mainly for sharing videos on the internet.
