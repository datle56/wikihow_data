Depending on your project, you will need to choose either the multi-project application PDF or the single-project application pdf. Each option includes instructions specific to the government agency administering the grant, along with application forms designed to be filled in offline. Mandatory fields to fill in are highlighted in yellow and include an asterisk. [1] X Research source Make sure that your version of Adobe Reader is compatible with the grants.gov web site. If you wish to print out the forms in an application package, you must open each form individually and print it out. There is currently no provision for batch printing the entire package. This may require you to register for an account. You will need to include the Funding Opportunity Number (or FON) of the grant you want to apply for. You can copy the FON number from the description of the grant, which is the upper right hand of the grant synopsis. Highlight the number and then right click on it. Select the \"copy\" option from the drop down men. Then go to the registration page. Right click again and select the \"paste\" option. This will put the FON number into the box and hit the \"Submit\" button. Fill out the registration page according to its instructions. You will then be prompted to create a username and password. Be sure to write these down in a place where you can access them again.

      "content": "Complete the application. The different components of the application will vary with each grant, but you will need to be prepared to write a proposal for your project or research idea. You will need to clearly explain how the funding will help you put your ideas into practice for the particular agency. [3] X Research source Complete the SF-424 form first. This form will automatically populate information on other areas of the application, so be sure to finish this first as it will save you time. This a Federal requirement, so it may not be a mandatory requirement for non-Federal applications. Be sure to save frequently. If you are filling out the application on a computer as opposed to manually, you will need to hit the \"save\" button frequently to preserve your work. Clearly convey your mission. Before you fill out the grant application, you should draft a practice section in which you explain 1) how you will use the grant and 2) how it will benefit the broader community (not just yourself). Write a clear \"thesis statement\" for your mission. What will this grant help you to achieve? Will you conduct important research with it, will you use it to enrich a local school, community center, or park? Try to write this in a sentence of 50 words of less. Revise and rewrite this sentence again and again until you make it crystal clear. [4] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source Structure your paragraphs properly. If you are writing multiple paragraphs, then make sure each one starts with a topic sentence that offers a new piece of information. For example, if your first paragraph talks about your interest in education generally, then your second paragraph should discuss your specific plan for using the grant to create an after-school program. Your third paragraph could start with a sentence that discusses the past successes of after school programs in your community (i.e. improved school attendance, better grades for participants, lower levels of bullying, etc.). Include visuals. If you have graphs, charts or other visual metrics that will help convey the necessity of your project, then you should prepare to include these as well. These visuals will give the committee an idea of how you plan to measure your results once you implement the grant."

When submitting, do the following: Keep an eye on the file size. There is a file size limit of 200mb on grants.gov. Individual attachments should also be less than 100mb. Find ways to concisely convey your mission and goals so your application can take up less space. Attachment file names are restricted to 50 characters in length and should not include the special characters &, -, *, /, #, or periods, accent marks or blank spaces. You may separate words in file names with underscores (example: Application_Attachment_File.pdf). To speed application processing, Grants.gov requires that no two files in an application package have the same name. If you have working files with the same name, you'll need to rename them before attaching them to your application. Video (.mpeg, .mov, .avi), graphic image (.gif, .jpg, .tif) and audio (.aif, .au, .wav) files should be compressed before being attached, according to the standards of the government agency administering the grant you're applying for.

      "content": "Review reasons for rejections. Grants.gov awards most of its grants to organizations; as an individual applicant, you may find the odds are stack against you. Your application may be rejected because it did not fulfill the technical requirements for submission. But it is more likely that you simply cannot complete the large task of the grant simply on your own. Many federal grants are awarded to fund projects that can become models for future research initiatives in government agencies. As a single applicant, your project might be too specialized or limited to become a representative model. You may be able to successfully reapply for the grant by adjusting content or making the changes necessary to correct deficiencies in a rejected application."

Grants can allow scientists to perform research, give charities the money to help others, and allow students to pursue higher education, among other things. You should apply for a grant when your current resources do not allow you to do something constructive that you desire to do. When deciding to apply for a grant, remember that locating, applying for, and winning a grant will be time-consuming and somewhat difficult. Ask yourself if you can realistically complete your goals without the grant money before applying. Consider the pros and cons of other sources of funding.

This government site contains easily-searchable listings for a multitude of federal grants. Look for scholarships with the Department of Labor.

Many agencies have fellowships that are available to applicants whose research interests match their general mission. For instance, if you are a writer, you might consider applying for an individual fellowship or research assistantship with the National Endowment for the Arts. [7] X Research source Look beyond government sources of funding. If you need a grant to fund a personal need, such as tuition, a home repair, or starting a business, then look to non-profit organizations and charitable organizations in your local area.

For example, you may have to be a student of a certain age to apply for one grant, but a research team with certain qualification to apply for another. Grants may be set up such that they can only be used for certain purposes as well. If you do not meet the qualifications, or are unable to convince the grant committee that you do, you will not be able to get the grant.
