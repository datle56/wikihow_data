    {
      "title": "Don’t post anything online you want to keep private.",
      "content": "Don’t post anything online you want to keep private. Private messages, pictures, texts, and other content aren't truly private. Once they're out there, a bully could get hold of a copy and use it to harm you. It’s best not to post anything inappropriate, embarrassing, or overly personal online. Try the “grandma test” as a rule of thumb: before sharing anything online, ask yourself if you would also show it to your grandmother. If not, it’s probably best to keep it private."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make use of privacy settings on social media.",
      "content": "Make use of privacy settings on social media. Most social networking sites and similar services allow you to control who sees what you post online. For instance, you can make your profile and posts private, so that only followers you accept can see your content. Making your accounts private will limit outsiders from accessing your information, but won’t keep it totally secure."
    },
    {
      "title": "Limit your online friends.",
      "content": "Limit your online friends. It’s easy to connect with lots of people online through social networking sites and in other ways. If you keep your online circles limited to people you know and trust, however, you are more likely to avoid being cyberbullied. You don’t have to accept friend requests, messages, invitations, etc. from people you don’t know or trust. If any of your online friends/followers begin to show bullying behavior online, you can defriend or stop following them right away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Protect your passwords.",
      "content": "Protect your passwords. If you make it easy for someone to hijack your information, social media accounts, or devices, this could lead to problems. If a bully is able to log in to your social media accounts, for instance, they could post mean things under your name or harass your friends. To prevent this, do things like: Don’t write passwords down, store them in your phone, or share them with anyone else. Change your passwords regularly. Choose passwords that are difficult to guess."
    },
    {
      "title": "Limit access to your devices and accounts.",
      "content": "Limit access to your devices and accounts. Be careful not to let a would-be bully get access to your files or accounts and use that information to harass you. For instance, log out completely whenever you use a public or shared computer. Likewise, don't let anyone you don’t know or trust use your personal devices."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ignore the bully if possible.",
      "content": "Ignore the bully if possible. Bullies thrive on making people upset. If you can ignore them, they won't get this satisfaction. This should be your first line of defense, and will prevent many cases of cyberbullying. Ignore the bully only if it's a first-time, mild comment or action online. If the bully’s actions are repeated or severe, respond."
    },
    {
      "title": "Resist the urge to fire back.",
      "content": "Resist the urge to fire back. If someone says something cruel online, it's tempting to say something mean about them. Trying to get even rarely works with a cyber bully, however. “Trolls” feed on people getting upset at their harassing comments and posts online. Don’t give them that satisfaction."
    },
    {
      "title": "Block whoever is harassing you.",
      "content": "Block whoever is harassing you. If you've had problems with someone, even if you don't consider it full-fledged bullying, you could just cut off all online contact with them. Social media platforms, email services, phone service providers, and other outlets all provide ways to block particular users."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep evidence of any bullying.",
      "content": "Keep evidence of any bullying. On the other hand, if a bully is bothering you, it's easy for you to keep a record of the harassment. Keep copies of any emails or texts, take screenshots of any messages, etc. That way, if you need to show that bullying took place, you'll have proof that can stop the bully. Do this secretly so the bully will not find out you have been gathering evidence. This just may lead to more bullying."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get the help of someone you trust.",
      "content": "Get the help of someone you trust. Whether you've been the target of bullying, feel you're at risk for being bullied, or just want to stop the problem in general, let someone else know what's going on. If you’re underage, talk to an adult, like a parent or school counselor. Otherwise, talk to a friend or mentor for support."
    },
    {
      "title": "Help others who are being bullied.",
      "content": "Help others who are being bullied. Stand up for others who are being harassed online, whether they are your friend or not. There are lots of ways to help out, from small-scale stuff to broad actions. For instance: Offer encouraging messages to anyone you see being harassed online. Be open about how you don’t support or accept bullying. Encourage someone you know has been bothered online by telling them hello, eating lunch with them, or just trying to be their friend."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t support inappropriate content.",
      "content": "Don’t support inappropriate content. If someone you know posts something mean, offensive, or harassing, don’t like, repost, or share it. The same goes for gossip--keep away from it. Drawing attention to inappropriate content contributes to the problem of cyberbullying and can even make you a target of bullying. Think twice before liking/sharing something, even if you think it’s funny. Ask yourself: would it seem funny if the inappropriate content was about you?"

      "content": "Spread positivity. You can be a role model for others and help prevent cyberbullying at the same time. When you comment on other people’s posts or respond online, aim to be encouraging, friendly, and supportive rather than aggressive or sarcastic. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Be part of the solution, not the problem.",
      "content": "Be part of the solution, not the problem. You can even take formal steps to stand against bullying. Talk to your school, neighborhood, or group about signing a pledge not to bully. You can then post this online to let others know your principles. When people see others reject bullying, it reduces its power."

      "title": "Mobilize your community to combat cyberbullying.",
      "content": "Mobilize your community to combat cyberbullying. Talk to others in your community if you think cyberbullying is a real problem. As a group, you can work together to raise awareness of the issue, create no-bullying pledges, and offer support to anyone who has been hurt online. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Teach youth about making good decisions online. If you are a parent or adult worried about a child being cyberbullied, talk with them about the problem and how to be safe online. You can also set limits on a child’s screen time or monitor their use of computers, phones, and other devices to reduce their risk of being bullied.
