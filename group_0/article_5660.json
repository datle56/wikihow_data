      "content": "Bring a tent that’s large enough for you and your things. Find a tent that has about 30 square feet (2.8 m 2 ) per person that’s staying in them. Pick a tent that’s lightweight and easy to transport so you don’t have any hassle setting it up later on. Look at an outdoors store for different types of tents to see how you fit in them and purchase the one that best suits your needs. [1] X Expert Source Britt Edelen Outdoor Educator Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. Get a tent with multiple “rooms” if you plan on camping with other people. If it’s supposed to rain at all while you’re camping, make sure your tent has a rain cover so you don’t get wet while you’re sleeping. Some campsites or outdoors stores may offer tent rentals if you don’t have a tent you can use."

      "title": "Choose a sleeping bag that matches the climate of the area you’re staying.",
      "content": "Choose a sleeping bag that matches the climate of the area you’re staying. Sleeping bags have different ratings to determine what temperature they can still keep you warm and comfortable. Check the weather at the campgrounds and determine what the lowest temperatures are so you know which sleeping bag to bring along. If you’re camping in the summer, you can use a thin sleeping bag, but you may need something thicker if you’re camping in cooler months. If you don’t want to lie directly on the floor of the tent, consider packing a sleeping pad or an air mattress as well so you have an extra layer of comfort. Don’t forget to bring a pillow for yourself so you can stay comfortable."

      "title": "Pack food that’s easy to cook over an open fire.",
      "content": "Pack food that’s easy to cook over an open fire. Many times, a campfire is your only heat source while you’re camping, so some foods may not cook as easily as others. Look for foods that you can cook on a skewer, such as hot dogs, cubed vegetables, and meats, since they’re the easiest to hold over a fire. Only bring as much food as you need so you don’t take up too much room while you’re packing. [2] X Research source Transfer food that’s in large containers into something small and compact so you can transport it easier. For example, you may crack multiple eggs into a plastic bag or container so you don’t break any eggshells while you’re packing. You may be able to use a portable grill rack that hangs over the fire to cook larger foods, like burgers and vegetables. Bring a cast iron skillet if you have one since you can hold it directly over the fire to cook things like eggs or soups."

      "content": "Use a cooler to help keep food and drinks cold. Pack an insulated cooler with ice and place any food or drinks you want to keep cold while you’re camping. Bring enough water to last through your entire trip so you don’t get dehydrated and so you can stay cool. Store foods in plastic containers and stack them in your cooler so you can use the space efficiently.

      "content": "Pack basic survival kits so you can set up your site easily. Basic survival kits include items like pocket knives, flashlights, first aid supplies, and multipurpose tools so you can stay safe while you’re camping. You can either buy prepackaged camping kits or you can make your own and carry it in a toolbox. Make sure you have a kit of materials with you in case there's an emergency or if you need to do maintenance on site. [4] X Expert Source Britt Edelen Outdoor Educator Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. Some basic things to include in your kit are knives, bandages, antiseptic wipes, lighters, and emergency flares."

      "title": "Check in with a park ranger or campground office if you need to.",
      "content": "Check in with a park ranger or campground office if you need to. Once you arrive at the campground, check in with a park ranger or at the camp offices to confirm your campsite. Let them know you arrived and tell them if you made a reservation before you came. Ask about any special rules or restrictions they have on the grounds so you know what you’re allowed to do. Once they check you in, they will help direct you to your campsite so you can start setting up. [5] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source Look at the office or ranger hours listed when you check in so you know when you’re able to contact them or get supplies if you need them."

      "title": "Place your tent",
      "content": "Place your tent on flat, dry ground. Once you arrive at your campsite, look for a level place that doesn’t have large rocks or tree roots to set up your tent. Make sure there aren’t any broken or dead tree limbs above the area since they could fall on your tent in severe weather. Clear the ground as much as you can from any sticks or small rocks so you don’t feel them while you’re sleeping. When you pitch your tent, make sure it’s stretched out completely so it’s open to its full size. [6] X Research source If you can’t find any level ground for your tent, make sure you sleep with your head elevated or else you can get headaches or feel uncomfortable. Make sure to always keep your tent zipped so bugs or animals can’t get inside."

      "content": "Store food in tightly sealed containers so animals don’t get into them. Animals have sensitive noses and they may smell your food while you’re camping. Make sure all of your food is sealed in odor-proof containers while you aren’t cooking to reduce the risk of animals coming onto your site. Place the food about 200 feet (61 m) from your sleeping area so animals don’t interfere with your tent while you’re asleep. [7] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source Animals are usually afraid of humans, so they may not come onto your site while you’re there. If you’re in a location that has bears, you can also hang your food from a tree so they cannot access it."

      "title": "Collect firewood from the campgrounds or nearby sellers.",
      "content": "Collect firewood from the campgrounds or nearby sellers. Check for wood around your campsite and collect large pieces to burn during your stay. If there isn’t any wood around you, you may be able to buy some from the campground offices for a small fee. Make sure to get enough firewood for your entire stay so you don’t have to keep buying more. Don’t transport foreign wood into the campsite since it could have invasive bugs or bacteria that could infect the local wildlife."

      "title": "Build a campfire",
      "content": "Build a campfire underneath tree cover if possible. Light tree cover helps protect your fire from wind and rain if the weather starts getting worse. Set up your logs inside the fire pit either in a cone or box shape to help maintain a consistent burn. Fill in any gaps with smaller pieces of wood or paper to use as kindling to make starting the fire easier. Light the kindling underneath the logs to start the fire and let it burn. [9] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source Only use a few logs at a time so your fire doesn’t get out of control while it’s burning. Make sure you start your fire inside of a pit so it doesn’t spread. Put out your fire completely when you’re finished using it so it doesn’t keep burning while it’s unattended."

      "content": "Look for campsites at national parks to get closer to nature. National parks offer a variety of campsites within the grounds that have different terrain and natural elements around them. Look for a site that has a little bit of tree cover if possible since you can stay protected from the sun or weather. Find a campsite large enough for the number of people you’re camping with so you can accommodate them. [10] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source Basic campsites usually come with a picnic table and a fire pit so you have somewhere to sit and cook. Many national park campsites don’t have electricity, so you need to bring extra phone batteries or a portable charger."

      "content": "Find a campground with electricity if you want to stay connected. Many larger campgrounds have electrical boxes on each site so you can plug in and use anything that needs power. Check if the campsites you’re looking at offer electricity if you still want to use some electronics, such as portable stoves or lights to decorate your site. However, campsites that offer electricity are usually more expensive than those without it. Campgrounds with electricity are great if you plan on staying in a trailer or RV since you’ll be able to use your gear inside."

Pick a location on the campgrounds map and the duration that you plan on staying. Once you choose your site, make any down payments for the site if you need to finish your reservation. Campsite reservations may cost anywhere between $10-50 per day you’re staying. Most campgrounds let you reserve sites a month or two in advance so you can easily plan the rest of your trip. You do not need to make a reservation if you don’t want to, but you may risk not getting a campsite if it’s busy."

When you go out for your hike, put on hiking boots so you can get around easily without hurting yourself. Take snacks and water along with you so you don’t get exhausted or dehydrated while you’re out. [14] X Research source If you plan on going hiking off of a known trail, then make sure you have a map and a compass so you don’t get lost.
