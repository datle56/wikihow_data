      "content": "Technologically savvy One of the defining characteristics of Gen Alpha is that they never knew a time before the internet. And, since they’re growing up in the digital age, it’s no surprise that they tend to be very comfortable with technology. Members of Gen Alpha are experts with their smartphones, tablets, and computers, and they adapt to technological advancements (like virtual assistants and AI) very easily. [1] X Research source In fact, in a 2020 report by the Pew Research Center, almost one in five parents of a child 11 or younger said their child had their own smartphone, and more than one third of parents reported that their child began interacting with a smartphone before the age of 5.

      "title": "Hyperconnected",
      "content": "Hyperconnected Gen Alpha are digital natives, so it makes sense that they’re great at staying connected through social media. [3] X Research source They uses platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat to keep in touch with friends, stay on top of current events, and access new information about the world. Gen Alpha’s comfort with virtual communication may also stem from their experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. The school closures and social distancing policies forced them to engage in a lot of online connection during a formative time in their lives. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Independent",
      "content": "Independent Gen Alpha grew up with unlimited access to information through the internet, which has shaped them into very independent and self-sufficient people. [5] X Research source When they’re confused about something, they seek out the answers for themselves, then make confident decisions based on what they found. They also aren’t afraid to speak their minds, so they’re seen as pretty assertive and opinionated. [6] X Research source Gen Alpha is also comfortable with self-directed/independent learning, as opposed to more traditional classroom settings. This likely also comes from their experience of online schooling during COVID school closures. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Adaptable & resilient",
      "content": "Adaptable & resilient Traumatic events can shape the way a generation lives and sees the world, and Gen Alpha grew up during a pretty traumatic event—the COVID-19 pandemic. [8] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source As a result of this experience, it seems like Gen Alpha became a very adaptable and resilient group of people. They were able to adjust and thrive in the face of unprecedented circumstances, like online schooling and social distancing, and they learned to cope with the general stress of the period. Gen Alpha’s adaptability is likely also related to their use of the internet, which is fast-moving and ever-evolving. To keep up with advancements, Gen Alpha has had to learn fast and get comfortable with new technological tools very quickly. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Visual",
      "content": "Visual Due to their frequent interactions with videos and photos on the internet and in learning settings, members of Gen Alpha tend to be pretty visually oriented. [10] X Research source Many of them are visual learners (as opposed to auditory, verbal, or reading learners), which means that they take in information best through visual elements like photographs, charts, graphs, diagrams, and maps. [11] X Research source Gen Alphas also tend to appreciate hands-on and interactive types of learning, rather than traditional things like reading textbooks or rote memorization."

      "title": "Family-oriented",
      "content": "Family-oriented Because they had to spend a lot of time at home with their families during the social distancing period of the COVID pandemic, many members of Gen Alpha have become very family-oriented. They value spending time with parents and siblings, and they seek out the feelings of comfort and security associated with home. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Confident online consumers",
      "content": "Confident online consumers While previous generations typically had to visit stores in-person to buy new items, Gen Alpha is growing up during an entirely different era of shopping. They tend to seek out product recommendations from social media and influencers, rather than traditional ads, and some of them even make their own purchases online. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Diverse & socially conscious",
      "content": "Diverse & socially conscious Gen Alpha is diverse in terms of their own demographics (ethnicities, financial and family situations, etc), but they’re also more accepting of diverse identities in others. This is likely because they’ve grown up during a more inclusive period in terms of representation in movies, TV shows, and social media, which has made them more open to different perspectives and more committed to inclusivity and social justice.

      "title": "Open to alternative career & education paths",
      "content": "Open to alternative career & education paths Since members of Gen Alpha are so open-minded, they tend to be interested in non-traditional career paths, and they place less value on traditional types of education (like college). Many of them dream of things like owning their own businesses, combining multiple “side-hustles,” or even being an influencer or entrepreneur. [15] X Research source And, since technology and the internet are always evolving, it’s also possible that many Gen Alphas will end up working in jobs that don’t even exist yet.

      "title": "Attention span & concentration issues",
      "content": "Attention span & concentration issues The fast-paced nature of the internet has made Gen Alpha adaptable and quick-thinking, but it may also be causing problems with their attention spans. There are some concerns regarding TikTok in particular—the short, bite-sized videos offer instant entertainment, and the endless “For You Page” makes it easy for kids to scroll for hours at a time. All of this can make it harder for them to maintain concentration during longer, less “exciting” activities. [17] X Research source This isn’t just the case for Gen Alpha kids—tech savvy Millennials and Gen Z-ers are just as susceptible to the negative effects of short-from social media content. Some research has also suggested that attention spans have been shrinking over the past several decades due to the rise of the internet.

      "content": "Issues with in-person socializing Since Gen Alpha was forced to do most of their socializing online during the COVID pandemic, they may prioritize in-person connection a bit less than previous generations. Some of them may even struggle with socializing in general. [20] X Research source Luckily, many Gen Alphas now seem to be spending more time with friends in-person as the world continues to move on from the pandemic."

      "content": "Gen Alphas are people born between 2010 and 2025. This generation is marked by two major factors: growing up in a world where the internet has been present since birth, and experiencing childhood years during the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors have made them technologically savvy, digitally connected, resilient, adaptable, and socially conscious. Most Gen Alpha children have parents who are part of the Millennial generation (born between 1981 and 1996). [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Gen Z and Gen Alpha have some key differences. Although both generations grew up with the internet, many members of Gen Z (born 1997-2012) remember a time before social media and smartphones, which isn’t the case for Gen Alphas. [22] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source As a result, Gen Alphas tend to be even more natural and comfortable with current technologies and social media platforms, even though both generations are known for being digital natives. On a less serious note, Gen Alpha and Gen Z also differ in their slang terms. You’ll likely hear Gen Z-ers using terms like “slay,” “pop off,” “shook,” and “vibing,” while Gen Alphas are more likely to use terms like “rizz,” “aura,” “skibidi,” and “sigma.” [23] X Research source"
