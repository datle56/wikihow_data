      "content": "Create a simple love spell. This is a basic spell that requires no exotic ingredients or astrological charts. This spell is meant to attract more friends and to enhance your sexual attraction if you're looking for more than friends. If you have a particular individual in mind, plan to focus on him or her during this ritual as a way to draw that person to you or to strengthen the bond that already exists between the two of you. Thoroughly clean your bathroom . We're not talking about a psychic cleansing here; do a true cleaning with cleanser and anti-bacterial products. Cover your mirrors with white or pink towels or sheets. Draw a bath and add a handful of sea salt or other salts to the water while saying: \"Negativity is washed away. I am renewed as of today! Many heads will turn my way, the ones I chose will wish to stay.\" If you don't have a bathtub, tie the salt up in a washcloth while saying the above words, and use it in the shower. Light 3 white votive candles or place 3 floating candles in the bathtub. Relax and focus on your body as you anticipate entering the water—think and feel how sensual it is and how beautiful you are. Focus on what you like about yourself. If you're casting this spell for a certain person, begin focusing on him or her now. Turn off the lights and turn on your favorite music if possible. Choose music that's in line with your desired end result. If you're looking for wild romance and hot love, pick something that makes you feel reckless and sexy. If you desire a soulmate and someone who makes you feel safe, choose music that makes you feel calm and peaceful. For general attraction, you may want a happy, mellow song. Enter the bath and relax. Make sure every part of your body is immersed in the water at least once. Shampoo and condition your hair; shave if appropriate. Cleansing is an important part of this ritual. When you're finished, repeat the words of the incantation you spoke before you entered the bath. This time, add the following line to close the spell: \"I am blessed, I am loving, I am loved and love myself! I am love!\" Follow your intuition and add any other elements that feel right to you. These could include incense , bath oils made with herbal extracts or essential oils , your favorite perfume or cologne, a cup of herbal tea , or a bath towel purchased specifically for this ritual."

      "content": "Cast a Lost Love Spell. If you had love but lost it through circumstances, personal difficulties, or outside interference, you can use this spell to try to reunite with your lost love. Purchase 6 candles. You'll need one candle in each of the following colors: red, green, yellow, and blue. You'll also need 2 pink candles. [1] X Research source Place the candles at the appropriate compass points. Place the red candle in the southern corner of your space, green in the northern, yellow in the eastern and blue in the western. Light all 6 candles. Hold the 2 pink candles in your hands and face the red candle. Chant the following until you feel satisfied: \"Beautiful Goddess, powerful God, hear my prayer! Lords of fire, burn my desire, times 3. If it is meant to be, Bring (insert name) back to me.\""

      "title": "Cast a Soul Mate Love Spell.",
      "content": "Cast a Soul Mate Love Spell. This spell is meant to draw to you a partner who's suited for you at this time in your life. Before you cast this spell, be sure you're ready for this level of commitment. You shouldn't undertake this if you're simply curious about the one who is \"meant\" for you. You must be prepared to take responsibility for any results and consequences. You'll need to do a little preparation before beginning this spell. Get some special paper, whatever that means to you—real parchment paper, paper made of cotton or hemp, or a sheet of decorative paper. You'll also need a ritual writing instrument. Again, you decide if that's a quill pen, fountain pen, favorite ballpoint, or calligraphy marker. It shouldn't be something you use daily to jot down the grocery list. Finally, pick up moon incense and charcoal and a small heart-shaped box or box decorated with hearts. Pick the perfect time. Ideally, this spell should be cast after dark; if you can do it during the waxing moon, all the better. A new moon is also an ideal time for casting a love spell, since it represents new beginnings. [2] X Research source You will have the power of the moon incense working for you, so you can be a little flexible with your time without diminished results. Reinforce your aura through meditation and/or cleansing. Using your ritual pen and paper, write words of power that will call the most perfect partner to you at this time. Do not include specific names and avoid thinking of a particular person. You may or may not have even met your soul mate yet, so leave everything open to possibilities. If you can't quite come up with what feel like the right words, use the following: \"If there be a perfect match, this work tonight will surely catch. The perfect one who is meant to be, shall find his/her way home to me. In perfect love and perfect trust, I send this out, but not from lust. This spell will guide us to unite, free will remains with us tonight.\" When you're finished, read over what you wrote and make sure you've said everything you wanted to say, and nothing's been left out. Then spend some time meditating on your goal while you light your ritual fire or the charcoal. Continue your meditation until you feel that everything is right, your will is focused, and your sense of certainty is secure. When the fire has become coals or the charcoal is glowing, read what you've written aloud 3 times. As you read or when you come to the end of each repetition, sprinkle about a tablespoon of the moon incense on the fire. If you have never used moon incense with a ritual fire, you should practice a few times. Flames will leap up along the dust trail of this incense powder, so you must be extremely careful. There will be sparks of incense outside of this trail of flames as well—also dangerous. Toss in the incense all at once; don't trail the dust or sprinkle it. Do not wear gauzy or loose clothing or sleeves that trail. Be very careful. Fold the paper and place it in your heart box; this is your spell box. Put it in a safe place with positive energy. Now forget about it. Let nature, fate, and the spirits do their work to bring your soulmate to you."

      "title": "Set your intention.",
      "content": "Set your intention. Are you hoping to get someone special to notice you? Draw a mysterious stranger into your life? Dispel negativity from a wounded relationship? Spice up a lackluster love life? Make your interactions with the universe at large more loving? This is the most important part of manifestation, so get a very clear picture in your mind of what you’d like to accomplish. Think very carefully about the potential drawbacks of your intention. If, for example, you intend to attract your ideal mate, think about whether or not you’re at a place in your life where you can enter into such a relationship. If you’d like to work your magic on someone you don’t know that well, brace yourself for the possibility that they won’t be as interesting or attractive in real life as they seem from afar. Remember the rule of 3. According to the Wiccan Rede, “All good that a person does to another returns threefold in this life; harm is also returned threefold.” Encourage love by sending it out freely. Stay away from intentions that involve dominating, manipulating, or in some way controlling another person. Spells that are meant to harm or control someone are considered black magic, and those kinds of intentions may leave you open to receiving the same in turn. For example, instead of manifesting a nurturing, mutually supportive, and satisfying relationship, you could draw to yourself someone who is wildly possessive and extremely jealous."

      "title": "Gather symbolically appropriate materials.",
      "content": "Gather symbolically appropriate materials. Exactly what you choose and in what combination should be based on the kind of love you want to attract. Start by emphasizing colors. Red, for example, is the color most closely associated with passion and lust. Pink is also a heart color but is considered to be more nurturing. White speaks of innocence and would be appropriate for a platonic relationship. Green's association is with nature and might be used to promote virility. Choose candles, clothes, papers, flowers, rose petals, or other objects in colors whose associations fit your needs. Integrate herbs into the spell. According to herb lore, balm and catnip can be used to attract love, and marjoram can be used to dispel negativity and promote love and happiness. Lavender is perhaps the best herb for attracting men. If your intention is more sexual in nature, try using vervain, which was used by the Druids to promote love, lust, and sexual fulfillment, or caraway, which promotes lust and fidelity, or cinnamon and fennel to promote vigor and libido. Use symbolic items. Do a little reading about the symbolism attached to common items. You're likely to find multiple interpretations for the same object, so go with your gut and choose what's meaningful for you. Use a mirror for healthy self-image, a piece of silk for sensuality, flowers for romance, lingerie for libido, or anything else that might have a special significance for you. If you're directing your spell at a specific person and you happen to have an item taken from that person (hair, a piece of clothing, a letter, something they've borrowed from you), be sure to include it. Beware of adding items with negative associations such as needles, knives, ropes, or other metaphorically aggressive objects; they might put an undesirable spin on your ritual."

      "content": "Cleanse your body. Take a ritual bath using herbs, flowers, or essential oils. Infuse the water with rose, jasmine, or any of the herbs listed above. If possible, bathe by candlelight. When you’re done, dress in clean clothes. If you've chosen a new outfit for your ritual, put that on."

      "title": "Choose your place.",
      "content": "Choose your place. Cast your spell somewhere you won’t be disturbed. It would be wonderful if you could choose a romantic location such as a forest or beach; however, your number one priority should be privacy and the ability to concentrate, so if that means staying indoors in a clean, cozy room, that's fine."

      "title": "Light candles",
      "content": "Light candles and concentrate. Focus on your intention. Visualize the scenario you'd like to experience in real life; make it as real as possible by imagining it with all your senses. If you feel comfortable doing so, chant your intention aloud; otherwise, repeat it in your head or write it on paper and burn it, allowing it to go out into the universe. Make a rhyming spell if desired. This can make your ritual more potent. You may even want to include the name of a relevant god or goddess in the spell if that fits with your personal philosophy. Don't stress about being a poet. Rhyming is nice if you can pull it off, but what's most important is the sincerity and good intentions of your words. Make a symbolic offering. Suitable offerings include flowers, an apple, wine, or anything else that has personal significance. Do not disturb your candles or blow them out prematurely. Allow them to burn down completely, then gather the wax and either place it in a sachet beneath your pillow or bury it in the garden to let it grow—preferably somewhere the dog won’t dig it up."

      "title": "Be open to possibility.",
      "content": "Be open to possibility. The results of your manifestation might be different—or even better—than what you imagined for yourself. Don’t become so focused on one narrow vision of love that you let a glorious opportunity pass you by. If you want to manifest something, focus on a goal. You can write it and give it a title. Use clear, concise, and positive wording. Write the date you want it by. Use present tense because it will happen depending on your mind and time frame."
