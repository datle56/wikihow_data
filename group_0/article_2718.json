      "content": "Read books about Kemetism. Look for books about ancient Egypt, particularly those on religion. While reading old texts can help you understand where the beliefs come from, you also want to read about how the ancient practices have been adapted for modern times. To learn more about ancient Egypt, read Ancient Egyptian Religion: An Interpretation by Henri Frankfort and The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt by Richard H. Wilkinson. Try the following books to learn how to adapt the beliefs for modern times: Eternal Egypt: Ancient Rituals for the Modern World by Richard J. Reidy, Red Land, Black Land by Barbara Mertz, or Temple of the Cosmos: The Ancient Egyptian Experience of the Sacred by Jeremy Naydler. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Open your mind about the concept of magic.",
      "content": "Open your mind about the concept of magic. Kemetism involves ritual magic as one of its components; however, it’s not like the magic depicted in movies. You won’t suddenly have powers that you can throw around, and you won’t be making pacts with any evil entities. Instead, it’s more of a spiritual manifestation, like with a miracle. Ask yourself what magic means to you. Say, “Why is this faith important to me? What do I hope to gain? How does this help my spiritual growth?” For example, a ritual might include ringing a bell, lighting incense, inviting your god or goddess to manifest, providing an offering of food, honoring your god or goddess, asking for their assistance, and then saying a closing prayer.

      "title": "Research online.",
      "content": "Research online. You can find several websites dedicated to Kemetism, and some even have interactive forums where you can talk to experienced individuals. You can find a lot of information about the modern forms of the religion by looking at websites and blogs. These sites will also provide you a great outlet for discussing your new faith, which might not be available where you live. Try sites like the following: http://www.kemet.org https://thetwistedrope.wordpress.com/kemeticism/kemetic-starter-guide/"

      "content": "Take online classes. Some Kemetic temples offer online classes to help you learn about and join the religion. If you like a more organized approach or prefer a traditional path, then that might be right for you. You can find these programs online. [3] X Research source Try a site like The Kemetic Orthodox Temple."

      "title": "Visit a local shrine or temple.",
      "content": "Visit a local shrine or temple. If you’re lucky enough to live near a Kemetic shrine or temple, meet with the local priest or a member of the community to talk about the faith and find out if you can attend a service. You may even be able to find a mentor in the community who is willing to share their faith with you. [4] X Research source Say, “Hi, I’m interested in being Kemetic. Would it be possible for me to attend a service at your temple?” Try, “You seem very knowledgeable about your faith. Do you think you would have time to share your experiences with me or answer a few questions?”"

      "content": "Live in harmony with creation, seeking the best life for everyone. Kemetics look beyond themselves to the needs of the community, so focus your thoughts and goals on achieving what’s best for all. Work to create an unselfish mindset and to be kind to others. Share your abundance with others. Wish yourself and others well. Cooperate with others and work for a common good. Seek to create positive changes in the community. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose the god(s) and goddess(es) you wish to honor. As part of Kemetism, you will honor the gods and goddesses. Since the Kemetic faith is polytheistic, it features more than one god and goddess, though they all work together. Most Kemetics choose a pair of gods or goddesses to focus on. [6] X Research source Reach out to the gods and goddesses. Light a candle and burn some incense, then talk to them. Over time, one or two should emerge as the ones you should choose to honor.

      "title": "Build your shrine.",
      "content": "Build your shrine. Choose a location in your home, such as in a cabinet, on a small table, or on a bookshelf, where you can build a small shrine. Place a statue, icon, or picture of the deity or deities you are honoring in the shrine, as well as an offering plate or bowl. Other items to consider include incense, flowers, herbs, oils, and gems. [8] X Research source Choose the incense, stones, flowers, herbs, oils, and gems that you are drawn to or that you feel your god or goddess is asking for."

      "title": "Give offerings to your god or goddess.",
      "content": "Give offerings to your god or goddess. As part of your religious practice, add offerings such as bread, water, milk, or rice to the plate or bowl on your altar. Most Kemetics do a daily offering, though it is not required. At the end of the ceremony, revert your offering by consuming it. Thank your god or goddess for the shared nourishment of the offering. If you don't want to eat the offerings, you don't have to use food. Instead, you can use liquids or symbolic offerings, like a stone or gem. What you offer depends on you, what you can afford, and what you feel called to give. Bread and water are traditional offerings, but you may prefer something else. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Perform a daily set of prayers.",
      "content": "Perform a daily set of prayers. As part of your practice, designate a time every day to perform prayers at your shrine. During this time, communicate with your gods and goddesses. Your daily prayers don’t have to be complicated, but they should be a regular part of your day. [10] X Research source Your prayers should invite, honor, and thank your god or goddess. You can also use this time to talk to your god or goddess and possibly ask for help. If you'd like, you can find pre-written Kemetic prayers to incorporate into your practice. Try lighting a candle or incense in your shrine to help you focus on your prayers. Choose a time of day that will be easy for you most days."

      "content": "Celebrate your family life. Family is important in the Kemetic faith, so take steps to improve your family life. Eat meals with your family, speak kindly to them, and plan time to spend with them. Remember those who have passed on as well, as your ancestors remain part of the family even after death.

      "content": "Be communal in your mindset. Kemetism is about groups rather than individuals. Seeking out a greater community can help you better practice your faith. [12] X Research source Bring your communal mindset to your everyday life. Be a good team member at work or school, and try to bring positive things to your community. Volunteer in your community, donate extra food to your local food bank, and provide help to those in need."

      "title": "Look for a group in your area.",
      "content": "Look for a group in your area. An established group should have a trained priest that is knowledgeable about the ancient practices, which have been well preserved in books and on temple walls. The priest will perform the ancient ceremonies at a community shrine or temple. [13] X Research source Use Google to look for temples or shrines in your area. Try sites like meetup.com or Facebook to look for smaller community groups that may still hold rituals or may travel as a group to a temple in a nearby area."

      "content": "Join an online group or forum. Depending on where you live, it may be difficult to locate other Kemetics.

      "content": "Work with other neopagans. If you can’t find another Kemetic group in your community, reach out to other neopagans to see if they’d be interested in collaborating with you. While your faiths may be different, they will have overlapping features. Having someone to talk to about your faith who is open will at least provide you an outlet to grow spiritually.

      "title": "Refer to your ancestors as Akhu, which means the blessed dead.",
      "content": "Refer to your ancestors as Akhu, which means the blessed dead. Because your ancestors have passed on, they are closer to the gods and goddesses than you are, which makes them blessed. [16] X Research source It does not matter if your ancestors were not Kemetic. They are still part of you and therefore part of your faith."

If you remember your ancestors, then they live forever. [17] X Research source Feature these items on a shelf or on your mantle. You may even designate a wall in your home for photos of your ancestors if you have them. It's up to you how many of your ancestors that you include in your shrine. When you think of your ancestors, include as many as you can in your thoughts. For example, you could send out a general thought of thanks to all of your ancestors, even those you don't know about."
