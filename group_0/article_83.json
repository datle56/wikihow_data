      "content": "The 369 method is a manifestation technique. It involves writing or reciting your goals 3 times in the morning, 6 times in the afternoon, and 9 times at night every day for 93 days to help attract and achieve what you want. You also visualize your goals during or after writing them down. It’s gone viral on TikTok and in YouTube videos. [1] X Research source Some claim the 369 method is inspired by a quote attributed to Nikola Tesla, which says, “If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6, and 9, then you would have the key to the universe.” However, there’s no concrete evidence that Tesla said or wrote this, and the inventor was not associated with manifestation in his lifetime. [2] X Research source One expert claims the 369 manifestation method draws from the ideas of the book The Secret and the Law of Attraction . [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide what you want to manifest. Reflect on what you really want in your life using a technique like meditation or journaling. Ask yourself what will bring you fulfillment and peace, and if it will be harmful or helpful to attract it. [4] X Research source Focus on one goal or desire at a time. Example manifestation topics: Getting good grades in school Receiving a raise at work Meeting a romantic partner Creating good artwork Manifesting the right goals and desires is key. You’ll be more likely to believe in them and have positive expectations about them if they are truly what you want. There is no scientific research supporting the 369 method. However, some general principles of manifestation have a basis in psychology, like having a growth mindset , being mindful of self-fulfilling prophecies, and avoiding negativity bias.

      "content": "Write or recite your desire 3, 6, and 9 times throughout the day. When you wake up in the morning, write what you want to manifest 3 times (or recite it aloud 3 times). During the day (in the afternoon, or on a lunch break) write or recite the desire 6 times. Finally, before you go to bed at night, write or recite the desire 9 times. Example 369 method manifestations: I feel happy and grateful for the people in my life. I received a job promotion and thrive in my new role. I’ve grown my TikTok account to one million followers. Write as though your desire is already here. For example, write “I have a fulfilling job that supports me financially and gives me purpose,” instead of “I have my dream job.” Or, write “I am in a loving, respectful romantic relationship,” instead of “I will get a boyfriend/girlfriend.” Some practitioners of the 369 method use their phone’s Notes app to write their manifestations. However, there are also journals designed specifically for practicing the 369 method."

      "content": "Visualize your desire while you write or recite it, or immediately after. To visualize , close your eyes and imagine what you’re manifesting as if it’s already real. Try to think of the visual details and the feelings associated with your goal or wish. Feeling your emotions is believed by some practitioners of the 369 method to help make your manifestation more powerful. [6] X Research source You may gain even more from the practice if you consider the purpose of visualizing beforehand. One 2017 study asked tennis players to imagine successfully completing a tennis task. Some players were told the purpose of the visualization exercise was to improve their tennis skills; these players were more successful in the subsequent tennis task than those who only visualized without a specific purpose.

      "content": "Practice the method consistently and patiently. Proponents of the 369 method say consistency is important for this manifestation technique to truly work. [8] X Research source If you need to, set alarms to remind you when it’s time to write or recite your desires. Be patient when waiting for results to appear—there’s no specific timeline for when your manifestations will come into being. On the first day of doing the 369 method, decide how many total days you’d like to manifest your goal. Many sources and manifestation journals recommend doing the method for 93 days, but others suggest 21, 33, or 45 days. [9] X Research source Go with what feels right for you—and try not to miss any days. If, after a while, you feel the 369 method is not bringing you your desired results, that’s okay. Consider attempting a different manifestation method , or rethinking what it is you desire to attract."

      "content": "Some people claim to have had success with the 369 method. Practitioners share about their positive experiences using the method on social media platforms like TikTok , as well as blogs about wellness. However, these results are anecdotal—keep in mind that there’s no proof the 369 method of manifestation makes wishes come true or causes events to happen. When combined with a positive outlook and concrete actions toward your goal, manifestation could be beneficial toward achieving goals or moving closer to what you want. [10] X Research source It never hurts to define and focus on your goals, and have a positive attitude toward your ability to achieve them."

      "title": "The 369 method lacks a scientific basis.",
      "content": "The 369 method lacks a scientific basis. Psychologists suggest the success of manifestation methods could be because of the placebo effect or the result of confirmation bias. The placebo effect is when we believe a treatment or practice will benefit us, but only improve as a result of this belief—the treatment or practice itself produces no benefits. Confirmation bias is when we tend to pay attention to and remember instances when something works and ignore instances when it doesn’t. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "The 369 manifestation method can take weeks or months to work. Some practitioners claim the method must be practiced for 93 days, but like any manifestation method, there’s no set timeline from beginning the practice to reaping the benefits. Various TikTokers and bloggers share results taking weeks and months, or never appearing at all. [12] X Research source If you feel you’re not experiencing results or doubting this method will work, consider trying another method of manifestation. What works for someone else may not work for you, and that’s okay! There are many options out there."

      "title": "The numbers 3, 6, and 9 each carry specific meaning.",
      "content": "The numbers 3, 6, and 9 each carry specific meaning. Numerologist Michelle Arbeau explains that 3 is “symbolic of the imagination, inspiration and memory.” 6, meanwhile is “the number of creativity and creative expression. It is the visionary number that can see the ‘eagle’s eye view’ and connect the dots, creating the bigger picture.” Finally, 9 “[symbolizes] change on every level of life—love, money, health, career. It is also the number representing the end of a cycle” in mathematics. Putting these numbers together via the 369 method of manifestation may help to focus or amplify what you are trying to manifest. Some fans of the 369 method claim that Nikola Tesla thought the numbers 3, 6, and 9 had significance because they were a fundamental part of our universe. For example, one source claims Tesla was inspired by circles having 360 degrees and 3 and 6 adding up to 9. [13] X Research source Another source suggests it is said that Tesla believed the numbers 3, 6, and 9 were the universal mathematical language. [14] X Research source These claims and connections to Tesla lack concrete sourcing and have not been verified through his writings or recorded quotes."
