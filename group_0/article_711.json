      "content": "Start your car, put it in park, and engage the handbrake. In order to get an accurate transmission fluid reading on most cars, you need to check the level while your transmission is running and the fluid is warm. So, start your car and keep it in park with the handbrake (parking brake) on while you check the transmission fluid. Note that some vehicles are checked in the neutral position. Reference your owner's manual for the proper position of your car's shifter. [1] X Research source If you've just finished driving your car for 30 minutes or longer, it's a good idea to let your engine idle a few minutes before you check the transmission fluid. [2] X Research source This will allow the temperature of the fluid to normalize. Note : Some cars may recommend a \"cold\" reading on the transmission dipstick. Even if this is the case in your vehicle, you should still start your engine and get the transmission fluid heated up in order to get an accurate reading."

      "content": "Cycle through each gear to warm up the transmission fluid. Without actually driving the car, depress the brake and cycle through all the gears in your car to help circulate the transmission fluid evenly (including Reverse and Overdrive). If you check the transmission fluid cold (i.e., not having driven anywhere and not having run through all the transmission gears), inspecting the transmission dipstick will give you an inaccurate reading. It will appear as if you have far too much transmission fluid in your car. [3] X Research source"

Parking your car on a flat surface and engaging the parking brake helps assure that you get an accurate reading and prevents the car from moving, keeping you safe. Then, Beery recommends checking your car’s owner’s manual to see if you need to keep the car running or turn it off. [4] X Expert Source Ed Beery Automotive Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2021. In general, most car manufacturers advise checking the transmission fluid while the vehicle is parked and running. Some car manufacturers, like Honda, advise that you turn off the car after you allow the engine to warm up. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Open the hood and locate your transmission dipstick.",
      "content": "Open the hood and locate your transmission dipstick. The transmission is located under the hood, so open it up to find the dipstick. Just remember to set the parking brake, especially if you're leaving the car in neutral. On some cars, it is easy to mistake the transmission dipstick for the crankcase oil dipstick. So, Beery advises that you make sure you are clear on the location of your transmission dipstick. [6] X Expert Source Ed Beery Automotive Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2021. Look towards the back of the engine, near the firewall. This is where the transmission is located on most cars with rear-wheel drive. On cars with front-wheel drive, the transmission dipstick is usually located near the front of the engine, connected to the transaxle. If you’re having trouble identifying or locating the transmission dipstick, consult your owner’s manual. Note : Beery says some cars, especially new cars, may have a closed transmission system without a transmission fluid dipstick. Check your owner’s manual to see if this is the case for you. If it is, take your car to a mechanic or dealership to get it serviced. [7] X Expert Source Ed Beery Automotive Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2021."

[9] X Expert Source Ed Beery Automotive Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2021. Then, check where the fluid line rests on the dipstick. On most dipsticks, there is an upper and lower mark. If the fluid line is between the marks, then the fluid level is fine. If the line is below the lower mark, you need to add more fluid. [10] X Research source Different cars may have different dipstick labels. For instance, some may have indicators saying “Full” or “Add.” Some dipsticks may have “Hot” and “Cold” reading indicators. If the fluid level isn’t between the proper indicators, it usually means the fluid level is low. [11] X Research source Check your owner’s manual if you’re having trouble reading the transmission dipstick. If your transmission fluid is low , Beery recommends taking your car to a mechanic or dealership, as low transmission fluid can be a sign that there’s a leak.

      "content": "Check the color and consistency of the fluid. Hold the dipstick against a white paper towel or cloth. If the fluid is in good condition, it should be a reddish-pink color and appear clear and smooth. If the fluid is a brownish red color and has a sludgy texture, you need to replace the fluid . [13] X Research source If the fluid is very dark brown or black or smells burnt, take your car to a mechanic or dealership for servicing. It’s possible that something is wrong with your transmission."

      "content": "Check the owner's manual for the correct fluid for your vehicle. Your car’s owner's manual will tell you what brand and type of transmission fluid to add to your vehicle. It’s very important that you only use the fluid indicated in the manual, as other types might damage your vehicle. The manual will also tell you if there are special instructions for adding fluid. [15] X Research source The transmission dipstick itself might also tell you what kind of transmission fluid the transmission takes. Note that there are several different kinds, each with specifications that make it favorable for that engine's transmission. Also, look for instructions on how frequently to change your transmission fluid. While you can add fluid when it gets low, many car manufacturers recommend a transmission fluid change every 30,000 to 100,000 miles (48,000 to 161,000 km), depending on the make and model of your car."

      "content": "Pour the correct fluid slowly into the funnel. Add a little bit of fluid at a time so you do not overfill—you can always add more, but it’s very difficult to take fluid out. How much transmission fluid do you add to your vehicle? It depends on what you're doing: [17] X Research source Are you topping off the fluid level? If you notice the transmission fluid is a little low on the dipstick, start with ½ to 1 quart (473-946 ml) of transmission fluid. Recheck the level and add ¼ quart (or less) at a time until the level is up to the full or max mark. Are you doing a transmission service where you drop the pan and replace the filter? This kind of service usually needs 4 to 5 quarts (3.8-4.7 L) of transmission fluid in order to replace what was lost in the pan. Are you replacing all the transmission fluid? It could take anywhere from 9 to 13 quarts (8.5-12.3 L) of transmission fluid to replace the old transmission fluid."
