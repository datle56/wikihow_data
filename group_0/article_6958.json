      "content": "Turn your earphones off. On the right control module (it looks like a box that's found along the cord), press the Power button. If the headphones are on, you'll see a light on the Power button that indicates how much battery charge is left. A white light means that more than an hour remains; a red light means there's less than an hour left; a blinking red light means that your Beats Flex needs to charge. Any lights on it should turn off to show that it's off."

      "content": "Plug the USB-C cable into the port on the other control module. This cable came with the earphones when you purchased it. But if you don't have the original cable, you can find a USB-C cable at any electronics retailer. If you have an Android phone or tablet, you should be able to use that USB-C cable to charge your earbuds."

      "content": "Connect the other end to a power source or adapter. You can connect the other side of the cable to your MacBook Pro if it also has a USB-C port for charging (you don't want to use your MacBook's 60w charger, but you can connect directly to your computer), or use a power adapter to plug directly into a power source. [1] X Research source You can purchase a USB-C adapter at any electronics retailer. It plugs into the wall on one end and allows you to connect via USB-C instead of only connecting USB ports. Keep these connected for about 90 minutes for a full charge. A quick 10-minute charge will get you about 1.5 hours of listening time. A full charge lasts for about 12 hours. While your Beats Flex headphones are charging, the LED will flash red. When they are done charging, the LED will turn white."
