      "content": "Use the pointy end of a comb to loosen the hair in the brush. Take a rat tail comb or pick and insert the pointed end under the hair near the base of the brush. Pull up to loosen the hair that's trapped between the bristles. If there's a lot of hair matted to the brush, you may be able to simply pull it up and off of the brush without loosening it first."

      "title": "Use scissors to cut through the loosened hair.",
      "content": "Use scissors to cut through the loosened hair. Take a sharp pair of scissors and carefully cut through the hair in the center of the brush, taking care not to cut the bristles. This will make it easier to remove, especially if the hair was twisted around the bristles. If you're removing the hair from a round brush, turn the brush around and also cut through the hair on the opposite side. Keep the blades of the scissors parallel to the rows of bristles on the brush as you cut. This will help ensure that you don’t accidentally cut through the bristles."

      "title": "Pull out the hair and throw it away.",
      "content": "Pull out the hair and throw it away. Use your fingers to pull the loosened hair out of the brush. Keep pulling until you've gotten all of the hair from the base of the brush. If you're using a round brush, turn it around and pull the hair out from all sides. [1] X Research source If your brush's bristles are made from natural fibers, take care not to yank them out with the hair. Pull the hair straight up and out from the base to avoid breaking or bending the bristles."

      "title": "Soak the brush in vinegar for 30 minutes to deep-clean it.",
      "content": "Soak the brush in vinegar for 30 minutes to deep-clean it. Put the hairbrush in a shallow dish and pour 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of vinegar and 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of warm water into the dish. Leave the brush to soak for 30 minutes and then drain it before you scrub the brush. If the hairbrush has a lot of skin cell buildup, soaking the brush will help loosen the grime. [2] X Research source Use apple cider or plain white vinegar. Do not use this solution for brushes with wooden handles, since it will damage the wood. You can also use rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. [3] X Expert Source Ndeye Anta Niang Hair Stylist & Master Braider Expert Interview. 10 January 2020."

      "title": "Make a cleansing solution with shampoo and baking soda.",
      "content": "Make a cleansing solution with shampoo and baking soda. Pour 1 cup (240 ml) of water into a bowl and add 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of your favorite shampoo along with 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda. Stir or whisk the mixture until the baking soda is dissolved. [4] X Research source Baking soda absorbs odors and is slightly abrasive, so it will remove built on grime. Avoid using conditioner or solid soap, since these will stick to the brush and may be hard to remove."

      "title": "Use the solution to clean the brush.",
      "content": "Use the solution to clean the brush. Take a clean washcloth and dip it in the cleansing solution. Wipe the cloth all over the brush to remove any surface grime. Then, dip an old toothbrush in the solution and use it to gently scrub the base of the brush and get in between the bristles. [5] X Research source If your brush has natural bristles, scrub gently and carefully so that you do not bend or break any of them."

      "title": "Rinse the hairbrush with water.",
      "content": "Rinse the hairbrush with water. If you cleaned a paddle or round hairbrush made of plastic or metal, run the hairbrush under water until the cleansing solution is rinsed off. You shouldn't see any suds on the bristles or hairbrush base when you’re done."

      "title": "Pat the hairbrush with a cloth and lay it down on a towel.",
      "content": "Pat the hairbrush with a cloth and lay it down on a towel. Take a clean cloth and wipe it over the hairbrush to remove the water on the surface of the brush. Then turn the hairbrush so the bristles point down and place it on a towel. [6] X Research source Don't use a hot hair dryer to dry the brush. This could damage the base of the brush and its bristles."

    {
      "title": "Leave the hairbrush to dry completely.",
      "content": "Leave the hairbrush to dry completely. Depending on the style and material of the hairbrush, you may need to let the brush dry overnight. Wait until the brush is completely dry before you use it to brush your hair. [7] X Research source Avoid using the brush when it's still wet, especially if it's made with natural bristles. This could cause the bristles to bend and break."

      "title": "Mix a cleansing solution with water and tea tree oil.",
      "content": "Mix a cleansing solution with water and tea tree oil. If your brush has a wooden base, you'll need to prevent the handle from getting too wet. To make a simple cleansing solution, mix 1 cup (240 ml) of water with 5 drops of tea tree oil. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Since this solution doesn't contain shampoo, you won't need to rinse it off and get the wooden handle wet. Research shows that tea tree oil has antimicrobial properties, which makes it a great cleaning product."

      "content": "Cleanse the brush with a washcloth and toothbrush. Dampen a clean cloth with the cleansing solution and rub it all over the surface of the brush. Then, dip a toothbrush in the solution and gently rub it on the base of the brush. Also make sure to carefully work between the bristles of the brush. [9] X Research source Scrub gently so that you do not bend or break any of the bristles."

      "title": "Wipe the brush with a clean, dry cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe the brush with a clean, dry cloth. Since you shouldn't get wooden hairbrushes very wet and you didn't use shampoo in the solution, don't rinse the hairbrush with water. Instead, take a dry washcloth and wipe the brush to remove any excess liquid. Since tea tree oil is not water soluble, spraying or rinsing the brush with water won’t help remove it. Exposing your brush to too much water could also damage the wooden handle."

      "title": "Leave your hairbrush to air dry.",
      "content": "Leave your hairbrush to air dry. After wiping and patting the brush dry with a clean cloth, place the brush bristle-side down on a towel. Wooden brushes take longer to dry than plastic or metal ones, so you may need to let the brush dry overnight before you can use it again. [10] X Research source Don’t use the brush until it has dried completely, especially if it has natural bristles. Using the brush while it is still wet could damage the bristles."
