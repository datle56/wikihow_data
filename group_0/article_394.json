      "content": "Think through your decisions so you don’t act impulsively. Whenever you’re given multiple choices, take a moment to consider each of the options. Make a mental list of the pros and cons of each choice and think about what you’re trying to achieve from your decision. Consider all of the actions you can take rather than settling for one that’s easier. Once you think over all of the choices you can make, choose the one that's most beneficial to the end goal you want to reach. [1] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source If you aren’t sure what option to choose, ask someone that you trust to see if they can offer any advice.

Be firm in your decisions so you seem more reliable and don’t fall victim to peer pressure."

      "content": "Work on controlling your anger or frustration so you don’t act out. When you feel angry or frustrated, try taking a few deep breaths to calm yourself down so you don’t yell or get argumentative. If you need to get some space, try walking away for a few minutes to clear your head and look at the situation with fresh eyes. When you need to address someone or something that makes you angry, talk through what you’re feeling without raising your voice. [2] X Research source Realize that it’s okay to feel angry or frustrated, but it’s not okay to act out because of it. State your feelings rather than bottling them up and keeping them to yourself."

      "title": "Stay positive and optimistic to help you through hard times.",
      "content": "Stay positive and optimistic to help you through hard times. Rather than focusing on the bad or negative qualities of something, try to focus on the positive aspects. Reframe bad experiences you’ve had to think about what you’ve learned from it and what you can apply it in the future. If you have trouble staying positive, try making a list of things that make you happy or events you’re looking forward to so you can cheer up. For example, if you fail a test, you may be upset because you didn’t do well. Instead, focus on what you can do to improve your score on the next, such as studying more or reading things more carefully. Having a negative attitude can make other people think you’re immature and not want to spend time with you. Failure is a regular part of life, so it’s okay for it to happen every so often."

Instead, break up the task into smaller, more manageable goals so it doesn’t seem as intimidating. Work hard towards finishing the task to the best of your ability without rushing through any steps. Take time to do a high-quality job so it looks like you’re more responsible and able to complete difficult tasks. [7] X Research source For example, if you have a big project due in 2 weeks, work on it for a little while each day rather than trying to rush it right before the due date.

Write a list of things that you need to get done and do your best to work through them on your own. Start working through your list as soon as you can so you don’t feel rushed trying to complete them later on. Make time to do each of the tasks so you can complete them with the highest quality. [8] X Research source It’s alright to ask someone for help if you don’t know how to do something or you physically can’t do it on your own. Don’t have the other person do the work for you, but ask them to teach you so you can do it on your own the next time. Don’t take advantage of people that offer to do things for you."

Avoid doing things just because it will make you look better or more mature, but do them because you want to help out. Start practicing by giving up 1 thing that you want to do each week so you can join someone else for what they’d like to do.

Be happy about the things that you do have and the positive aspects that come from them. Practice being grateful by thanking people and letting them know that you care about them.
