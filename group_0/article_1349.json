I understand if you or they are still mad at me after this.\" Example: \"I shouldn't have looked at Stacy the way I did.

I realize that you might change your opinion of me based on that, so I'm going to try to do everything in my power to make it up to you.\""

      "content": "Depending on the girl, try a public apology . Be careful, because some girls hate other people knowing all about their relationship. Use your discretion before a public apology. Consider this, too: she might feel like you are using public pressure to force her to forgive you, as in \"Oh, how could Sarah not take him back? Look how sweet he is to her!\" It might ultimately be better to keep these things between you as a couple. Go for the straightforward public apology. Just go up to her when she's with a group of friends, have something prepared, and bare your heart. Look her deeply in the eyes when you apologise, and focus your attention solely on her. If you're feeling really creative, try using a flash mob to apologize to her. Flash mobs require a lot of work and preparation, so be sure it will work if you do decide to pull it off."
