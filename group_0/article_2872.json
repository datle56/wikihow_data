      "content": "Schedule a movie night to see one of her favorite films. Grab the disc to your wife’s favorite film, or rent the movie if you don’t have it on hand. Choose a night during the week when you both have a free evening, and surprise her with an at-home night at the cinema. As you prepare for the movie night, get some of her favorite snacks and drinks together. [1] X Research source If your wife doesn’t like surprises, mention the movie night idea to her earlier in the week. If she’s in the loop, it might be easier to plan a time to watch a film together."

      "content": "Surprise her with a delicious meal. Pick a night when your wife is especially busy and plan to make one of her favorite meals. Get all of the necessary ingredients ahead of time, and try to time your cooking so the food is ready by the time she gets home. If you aren’t confident in your cooking skills, don’t worry about picking a complicated meal—after all, it’s the thought that counts! [2] X Research source If you’d rather not cook, consider ordering take-out from one of your wife’s favorite restaurants. Try and choose a meal that doesn’t require a lot of extensive prep time."

      "content": "Play mood music in the background when you’re together. Use a phone, speaker, or sound system to play romantic music in a place where you both spend a lot of time together.

[8] X Research source Depending on your plans for the evening, you might want to gear your music in a more seductive direction. For example, songs like “Love Me Tender,” “I Will Always Love You,” “Don’t Wanna Miss a Thing,” and “Careless Whisper” are great music choices for a romantic dinner at home."

On the weekends or during a morning where she doesn’t have to get out of bed right away, brew a cup of your wife’s favorite beverage, like tea or coffee.

      "content": "Buy her roses to show her that she’s in your thoughts. Pick up some flowers from your local florist or grocery store and give them to your wife as a surprise gift.
