Taking the time to count to 10 will give your mind some distance from what you’re feeling, and it will help you respond less emotionally. [1] X Research source If you still feel tense after counting to 10, try counting backwards from 10 to 1. Sometimes you’ll need even more time to calm down. In this case, try counting backwards from 100. You can do this counting exercise anywhere: at home, in the bathroom, in the elevator, or anywhere you are when you feel negative thoughts and frustrations come up."

Breathe deeply and evenly during this time in order to oxygenate your brain, slow your heart rate, and eventually gain control of your emotions. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Breathe while counting to 10. Inhale on the even numbers and exhale on the odd numbers. You can even add an easy visualization by imagining you are breathing in a color that relaxes you, like blue or green. When you exhale, imagine a grey plume of smoke that represents your negative thoughts or emotions leaving your body.

Sit comfortably with your hands on your belly. Breathe deeply into your belly and exhale fully from your belly. Allow your awareness to go to places in your body that feel tense. For example, many people hold tension in their necks, shoulders, knees, lower backs, or arms and hands. Breathe into the places in your body where you feel tension and allow the tension to melt away as you exhale. It might help to play some relaxing music while you do these exercises.

If it is a conflict that involves other people, take a few breaths, explain quickly that you are upset (without going into details), and walk away. The goal is to give yourself some space, so you can deal with your emotions. This approach also gives you more control over your situation because you’ll have time to decide how to respond. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Avoid storming off if you're upset since that can cause communication breakdown between you and others. Instead, say something like, \"I'm feeling really upset right now and need to take a break. I'm going to take a short walk.\" Try going for as long of a walk as you need. Imagine that with each step you're letting your frustrations flow right down through your feet. Try to find a park or green space to walk in.

Being physical and creative can also help you calm your body and connect with your feelings. This way, you're in a better position to deal with whatever's upsetting you. Look for music with about 60 beats per minute, which can help your brain synchronize your heartbeat with the beat of the music. This may induce a calm, relaxed state. Classical music, light jazz, \"easy listening,\" or New Age artists such as Enya may be particularly helpful. [10] X Research source You can find several websites that supply your mobile phone with calming music. This way, you can easily calm yourself down. [11] X Research source The most important thing is that you enjoy the music you play.

For example, if you are upset about having accidentally broken something, you may think things like: \"Nothing ever goes right for me.\" Or, \"Everything always gets messed up.\" These are examples of all-or-nothing thinking, a common \"thought trap.\" [14] X Research source Instead, try to reframe your thoughts to statements like, \"It was just an accident. Accidents happen all the time.\" Or, \"Everybody makes mistakes. It doesn’t mean I need to get upset.\" You may also become upset if you jump to conclusions about others or \"personalize\" situations, making them about you when they aren't. For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you may get angry and believe that person intentionally harmed you. This is personalization. [15] X Research source If this happens, reframe the situation: the driver probably didn’t see you or is new to driving. There are many explanations other than a personal attack.

When you encounter thoughts and feelings brought up by an experience, allow yourself to feel them. Too often, we try to repress our emotions, which can end up making us more stressed and upset. Acknowledge that your emotions exist, and that they are neither \"right\" nor \"wrong\" -- they simply are. I nvestigate the situation with kindness. Show yourself the same compassion you would show to a friend. For example, if you are feeling stressed out, you might feel that you are stupid or worthless. Investigate these thoughts. Would you say these things to a friend? Try showing yourself kindness instead by telling yourself something compassionate like \"I am worthy.\" N atural loving awareness will arise when you practice the first three steps. This will allow you to detach from those generalizations like \"I'm a loser\" or \"I'm stupid.\" You will realize that while those feelings may show up, they most likely appear because of a fear or insecurity."
