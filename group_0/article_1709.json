      "content": "Use “Islam” as a noun and “Muslim” as an adjective. Although these terms are related, they can’t be used in the same way. “Muslim” refers to a person, while “Islam” refers to a belief system. If you’re still a bit confused, try to remember that the former is a descriptor and the latter is what’s being described. Here are a few examples of how to use these words correctly: [2] X Research source “ Muslims don’t eat pork as it is forbidden by Islam. ” “ Muslims observe the holy month of Ramadan by fasting from dawn to sunset. Fasting is one of the main pillars of Islam. ” “My Muslim friend, Adnan, is doing his pilgrimage to Mecca this year– it’s a rite of passage in Islam! ” “ Muslim women can choose to dress modestly, which is encouraged by Islam. ” “In order to convert to Islam , all you have to do is recite the Shahada .

      "content": "Islam is a religion while Islamism is a political ideology. Despite how similar the two sound, there is one stark difference: Islam is a religion and Islamism is a political belief that stems from conservative— and often intolerant— Muslim ideals. Islamism is a radical approach to integrating politics and religion in every facet of life in the Islamic world, as they don’t believe in the separation of church and state, so to speak. Islamists are typically anti-Semitic, anti-Christian, and anti-Western culture. [5] X Research source It’s important to note that while all Islamists are Muslim, only a small subset of Muslims are thought to be Islamists."
