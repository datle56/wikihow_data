      "content": "Blot the stain and allow it to dry, if necessary. If the stain isn’t already dry, you can attempt to blot up some of the liquid. Be careful to lightly dab it, soaking up the liquid rather than pressing it deeper into the suede. [2] X Research source Once you think you’ve blotted up as much as you can, allow it to air dry. You can try other methods once it’s no longer wet."

      "content": "Brush the dry stain with a suede brush. You can buy these at Target, on Amazon, or even at your local pharmacy. Aside from cleaning up mishaps, a suede brush can be used regularly to help maintain the look of your suede clothing and accessories, so it’s a smart purchase. Before you do anything, you’ll need to brush the stain thoroughly with a suede brush. You’ll be removing the top, outer layer of dirt first. Brush in one direction as you remove these bigger particles. [3] X Research source Alternatively, you could use a nail brush, toothbrush, or a soft scrub brush, although a suede brush is best. Once you’ve gotten the surface dirt off, you’ll need to scrub with a bit more force. You can also start scrubbing in both directions to tackle the deeper, ground-in stains. Along with removing dirt, brushing the area of the stain will help you reach the deeper stains with your next methods. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Rub the stain with a white eraser.",
      "content": "Rub the stain with a white eraser. You can find an eraser specifically made for suede, but a large pencil eraser will also work. Use a white eraser to clean your suede, because you risk staining your suede with a colored eraser. Don’t begin this step until you’re confident you’ve brushed out any dirt or dried pieces with the suede brush. [5] X Research source Lightly begin to rub the stain with the eraser. After a little bit of rubbing, you should see the stain start to lift. Continue working the eraser on the suede until the stain has been removed. You could use fine-grain sandpaper as an alternative to an eraser, if desired. A piece of stale bread will even work in a pinch! Rub it over the stain until it begins to crumble."

      "content": "Brush the stained area again to blend out the suede. After rubbing a spot with an eraser, it’s likely that the suede will be a little matted down and uneven. To get your purse looking as good as new, rub your suede brush all over the surface. This will “re-fluff” the suede, and no one will know you ever had a stain! [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Test the vinegar or rubbing alcohol on a small, hidden part of the purse. Only try this method if using an eraser didn’t work. It's important to do a test run before applying the liquid all over the stain, just in case it reacts badly with the particular suede you are working with. Dab a bit of the liquid onto the spot you've chosen, and allow it to dry. Make sure that it doesn't leave any unsightly marks. Examples of unnoticeable spots on your purse might be the underside of the strap, or the bottom of the purse. While vinegar and rubbing alcohol both work well, they work best on different types of stains. For example, white vinegar works well on environmental stains like salt, dirt, and even food. Rubbing alcohol works best on the more \"intense\" stains, like ink. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Rub the white vinegar or rubbing alcohol into the stain with a white washcloth. Once you know the suede doesn't have a terrible reaction to the liquid, pour it onto a white washcloth. It’s important to use a white cloth to avoid any color transfer from a colored one. While water stains suede, rubbing alcohol and white vinegar do not. [8] X Research source You shouldn't rub violently, but rather press the cloth into the stain so that you are sure the liquid is soaking into it fully. Once you’ve thoroughly covered the surface of the stain with either rubbing alcohol or white vinegar, let it air dry. [9] X Research source You really won’t know how well it worked until it’s fully dry. The vinegar can leave an odor on the suede, but that will dissipate after a bit of time."

If necessary, you may also want to rub the stain down with the eraser as well. [10] X Research source Once you’re done, assess your handiwork and decide if you need to repeat the process."

      "content": "Grab some cornstarch if the stain is greasy or oily. Whether a lip gloss leaked or you got some butter on your purse at a restaurant, these greasy stains are stubborn. Cornstarch is your secret weapon. The cornstarch works by soaking the oil right out of the stain. [11] X Research source"

After 12 hours, gently shake the purse over a trash can so the cornstarch comes off. [12] X Research source As the cornstarch falls away, hopefully that pesky oil stain will too."
