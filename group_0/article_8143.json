      "content": "Mix a strong vinegar solution. If you’ve never cleaned your windows with vinegar before, you might want to mix up a slightly stronger vinegar solution for your first attempt. Mix two cups (480 mL) water, ¼ cup (60 mL) white vinegar (you can also use apple cider vinegar), and ½ teaspoon (2.5 mL) of dishwashing detergent. [1] X Research source You can also mix up and use this formula if you haven’t washed your windows in a while."

      "content": "Make a basic vinegar solution. If you clean your windows with vinegar pretty regularly, you can use a more basic solution for your cleaning needs. Mix 1 cup (240 mL) water with 1 cup (240 mL) vinegar. [2] X Research source This is a good solution to mix up ahead of time and have on hand just in case you decide to do some cleaning."

      "title": "Use straight vinegar.",
      "content": "Use straight vinegar. If you have really grimy windows, you’ll want to wash them with an extra strength solution. Simply warm 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar and apply it directly to glass (a spray bottle is best for this particular solution). [3] X Research source If your windows are extra dirty, you can leave this solution on your windows to soak for a minute or two before you rinse it off."

      "title": "Prepare the area for cleaning.",
      "content": "Prepare the area for cleaning. Before you apply a vinegar solution to the window, make sure you remove any dust from the window using a cloth or paper towel. Eliminating this layer of dust before you clean can help prevent you from simply moving dust around on the window. If there are small objects near the window, consider moving them to keep them from getting wet with vinegar. [4] X Research source You might also want to place a bath towel on your windowsill or the floor under your windows to catch any solution that drips. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill a small spray bottle with a mixture of vinegar and water. Select your solution strength based on the dirtiness of your windows and fill a small spray bottle with it. Using a spray bottle for small windows is particularly effective because it allows you to spray a small area that you can easily dry before moving on to the next window."

      "content": "Rub the window's entire surface with a cloth to work the vinegar in. The best tool for this is a lint-free towel, but paper towels also work well.

      "content": "Dry the window's entire surface. This is best done with a microfiber cloth, and should be done after most of the moisture has been collected by the lint-free towel. Dry the window vigorously and quickly, as this will prevent streaking. If you don’t have a microfiber cloth, paper towel will also work. Don’t use towels with lint in them – like regular hand and dish towels – to dry your windows because it will cause your window surfaces to streak."

[8] X Research source You can scrub particular problem areas, but make sure you're using a sponge or mop head, not steel wool or anything similarly abrasive. It can scratch your windows. After you’ve washed the windows, rinse again with the hose."

You can gently scrub at any stubborn spots if you need to. Load the sponge by dipping it in the bucket, and rub it across the entire surface of the window. As with smaller windows, working quickly will help prevent streaking. [9] X Research source You can also use a scrub brush attached to a multi-purpose extension pole that has a universal threaded end that brushes can screw into.This lets you reach upper story windows or the tops of tall first story windows.
