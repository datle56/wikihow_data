      "content": "Love yourself, no matter your gender. It may sound cheesy, but loving yourself and practicing self-care empowers you. When you love yourself, you are essentially saying “My humanity matters. [1] X Research source ” With this is loving your body, even (especially!) if it does not fit the media’s stereotype of perfection. Feminists often fight the misconception that an attractive female has one particular set of traits. This does not mean that you can’t spend time making yourself look pretty. You can wear makeup or high heels and be a feminist, but you don’t have to!"

      "content": "Share equal responsibilities in your relationship. It can be common for members of heterosexual relationships and marriages to slip into traditional gender roles. [2] X Research source If you want to stay home with your children while your husband works, that’s fine! You can still be a feminist! However, you and your partner should make mindful decisions about household responsibilities. If you do most of the cooking, perhaps your partner should clean the kitchen after dinner. If your partner does the laundry on the weekends, you can contribute in other ways, like vacuuming. As long as you’re making decisions about responsibilities based on choice and personal preference, and not on gender stereotypes, you’ll be incorporating feminism into your lifestyle."

      "content": "Raise your children to believe in gender equality. There are many ways to raise children to be feminists. A good start is encouraging them to embrace their interests and passions, regardless of gender. You can also teach them to question gender assumptions (such as why girls’ items are invariably pink and purple, but boys’ items are never pink). Help them make life goals that do not hinge upon their gender. [3] X Research source It is also important to emphasize both the mother’s and the father’s role as a parent. This will minimize the assumption that mothers parent while fathers work."

      "content": "Maintain positive equality in the workplace. Ideal workplaces would all be blind to gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and certain other life choices. In reality, this is not always the case. Maintain professionalism in the workplace and always perform your best; if you feel that you are being discriminated against, (ie: paid less for similar work or passed over for a promotion) due to your gender. Do not be afraid to speak out about the inequity. [4] X Research source If you have a managerial position, ensure fairness and equity in hiring, pay, and promotion policies."

      "title": "Empower women.",
      "content": "Empower women. There is an unfortunate modern tendency for women to judge and belittle the choices of other women, (particularly on social media). To be a feminist, support and empower other women instead of judging them. Realize that women who make decisions that differ from yours have likely put as much thought into those decisions as you have."

      "content": "Recognize systemic inequalities. An important part of being an informed feminist is cultivating an awareness of systemic prejudices against women worldwide. You cannot stop every individual from having a particular opinion about women, but you can expose systemic inequalities. [5] X Research source You can support organizations that provide suppressed women in other cultures with education and opportunities. You can notice trends such as the discrepancy between the percentage of politicians or world leaders who are females, versus the female population of the world. Realize that in systems that discriminate against women in the areas of education or employment, women’s economic lives become dependent on others in power, which takes power from them."

[6] X Research source Voting for politicians who advocate for women in the workplace and women’s healthcare rights can put your feminist beliefs into action. Additionally, you may want to find out if a candidate (male or female) has women working on his or her campaign staff. Advocating for women’s employment rights is less meaningful if a candidate doesn’t employ women."
