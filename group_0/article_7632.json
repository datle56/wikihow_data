Use freshly diluted bleach or a disinfectant that is registered with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar body and is labeled for use with potential blood-borne pathogens such as HIV, HBV, or HCV. If the spill occurs in a public facility, such as a school, prison, or hospital, consult and follow the facility’s procedures for cleaning up bodily fluids."
