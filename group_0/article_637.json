However, be aware that this comes with some caveats: RePear is confirmed to work with iPod photo 4G, iPod video 5G, iPod classic 6G, iPod nano 1G, iPod nano 2G, iPod nano 3G, iPod nano 4G, iPod shuffle 1G, and iPod shuffle 2G. It may work with iPod 1G, iPod 2G, iPod 3G, iPod 4G, iPod mini 1G, and iPod mini 2G. RePear will not work with iPod nano 5G, iPod nano 6G, iPod shuffle 3G, iPod shuffle 4G, and iPod touch. For all iPod models except for the touch, this is due to an incompatible file structure. For the iPod touch, it's due to fundamental iOS changes that inhibit RePear from working. If you don't know what model of iPod you have, it's usually engraved on the back. You can also find this info in Settings > General (if your iPod has a screen). RePear works with Windows, Mac, and Linux, but only has a GUI (graphical user interface) on Windows. On Mac and Linux, you will need to enter some commands to use RePear. It isn't difficult to use, but it'll be easier to use RePear if you have some tech knowledge to start with. If you're on Windows, be sure to download the .ZIP version of RePear. On Mac and Linux, download the .TAR.GZ version. On Mac and Linux (both Unix distributions), you'll also need a Python runtime for RePear to work. Most Unix distributions install Python by default, but if you don't have one, any Python version between 2.3 and 2.6 will work. [3] X Research source RePear only supports .MP3, .OGG, and .AAC music files. If you have a DRM-protected iTunes music file (.M4P) you cannot transfer it to your iPod with RePear as it's impossible to do with the protections on the file. [4] X Research source RePear does not support transferring photos, podcasts, and audiobooks."
