      "content": "Wait for the right time. If you've decided it's time to end your relationship, the first thing to figure out is when to do it. If you want things to end amicably, you'll want to choose a time when ending the relationship will result in as little disruption to the other person's life as possible. It may be tempting to try to get it over with right away, once you've decided to end a relationship. Instead, try to pick a time--soon--when you can have this difficult conversation that won't cause any more trauma than necessary. [1] X Research source If possible, avoid breaking the news on major holidays, right before the person has to go to some important meeting or function, or in conjunction with other major life setbacks like the loss of a job, parent, or pet. Be sensitive to these situations, and be willing to push the schedule back a few days if necessary."

      "content": "Choose the right moment. Pick a time that you won't be rushed, setting aside a couple of hours for the conversation. Having a time limit for the conversation in mind is a good idea, in case things get out of hand. [2] X Research source Decide in advance how much time you will spend, and if you can, make plans that require you to depart at the end of that time. By the same token, do make sure you have enough time to have an honest conversation about the topic and answer any reasonable questions the other person may have."

      "content": "Choose a good place to have the conversation. Choose a good place to have this conversation. The best option is usually a place that is neutral and semi-private. [3] X Research source You don't want to choose a place that is completely private, as this increases the possibility of the other person making a scene or giving emotional speeches that might persuade you to change your mind. [4] X Research source By the same token, you don't want to do this in front of people you know or somewhere that every word you say will be overheard. This can be embarrassing and humiliating for the other person."

      "title": "Do it in person.",
      "content": "Do it in person. Do not plan to end the relationship via text, email, a social networking site, or even via phone call if you can help it. This detached way of ending a relationship may be easier for you, but it is disrespectful to the other person. Ending a relationship via text or email can also increase the possibility of misunderstandings, which could lead the other person to feel that there is still hope when there is not. [5] X Research source Note: If there was absolutely no genuine intimacy and the two of you didn't really get to know each other, this is the only case when it's okay to have a break up that isn't in person.

This will help you be clear, and will also help you stay focused on what you need to say if you start to lose your courage. Have answers ready for any questions you can anticipate the other person asking. He or she will almost certainly want to know why this is happening, and if there's any chance you will change your mind. [6] X Research source Be specific about the grievances that have led you to this decision, and be clear about the fact that the relationship is over--this is not up for negotiation.

This way, you can be certain that he or she also has enough time and that you won't be interfering with an important public, business, or social engagement. If you can help it, do not tell the other person you need to have this conversation until a few hours beforehand, at most. Especially if there are obvious issues in the relationship, the other person may spend a lot agonizing hours worrying about what's going to happen if you give him or her too much advance notice.

Be specific about why it didn't work out. This can be a learning opportunity for the other person. For example, if you are breaking up with this person because he or she doesn't include you in other aspects of life (e.g. social outings with friends or meeting family), you might say: \"I haven't felt like I'm really part of your life. When you go out with your friends, I feel uninvited, and I feel that you haven't been inclusive when I've asked to go. I also feel concerned that you haven't introduced me to your family. It makes me feel like I'm not that important to you. I think you're a great person, but that's not the kind of relationship that's going to make me happy, so I need to move on.\" It is ok to be honest about your feelings about the breakup as well.

[10] X Research source It can lead him or her to hold onto hope that you may change your mind. This doesn't do the other person any favors in the long run. It's possible for a breakup to be so nice that the other person doesn't realize what has happened. If this occurs, you'll have to go through the whole thing again. You would not want to say, for example, \"I really love you, and I think this is something you need to work on.\" This could be interpreted to mean that if he or she made some changes, you'd be willing to continue the relationship."

Acknowledge your responsibility for the end of the relationship. For example, you might say, \"I probably should have spoken up more before now to let you know how I felt about these problems,\" or \"I know there's more I could have done to make you part of my life, too.\" Statements like these will help the other person feel less as if she or he is being blamed for all the problems that have brought about the end of the relationship."

Instead, provide a specific reason for the breakup based on your needs, but don't feel like you have to tell the person every single reason why you want to break up. [11] X Research source For example, you might say something like, \"I have noticed that I am becoming really critical of you and it is interfering with my ability to be a good boyfriend/girlfriend.

For example, if you hope to stay friends, you could say something like: \"I hope after we both take a little time to heal, we can still be friends.\" If you do not want to have the other person in your life at all, be honest. Say something like: \"I really think trying to be friends would be too difficult for me. It's probably best if we don't see each other anymore.\" Even if you want to stay friends, don't assume that will necessarily work out. The other person may not feel that way.

One of these is a tendency to complain about the other person. If word gets back to the other person that you've been saying unkind things about him or her, this can be hurtful and ruin any chances of an amicable end to the relationship. You may have feelings you need to vent, but don't do it with anyone who is likely to share your comments with others. Definitely do not complain about this person to mutual friends. [15] X Research source Don't vent on social media, either. If you don't think you'll be able to resist the temptation, just stay off social media for a few days until you are calmer about the situation."

It should go without saying that if you want things to be amicable, this is unacceptable. [16] X Research source Do not, for example, get romantically involved with a friend of other person as means of getting back at him or her. Do not post embarrassing pictures of him or her on the internet, or go around revealing information that was told to you in confidence."

This can be especially difficult if you live with the other person. Approach this as calmly as possible, and be fair. Give back anything that legitimately belongs to the other person. Try to find a mutually agreeable compromise with shared belongings, asking, for example: \"How would you feel if I took X and you take Y?\" If the other person really wants something and it isn't that important to you, it may be worth just letting him or her have it. If it's not worth a fight, consider just letting it go. [17] X Research source"

If the other person still has feelings for you and wants to get back together, do not encourage these feelings in any way, unless you are seriously considering getting back together. Sending mixed signals may be hard to avoid if you feel conflicted, but do your best. It isn't fair or respectful to the other person to string him or her along if you don't actually want to get back together. [18] X Research source Even if you still have lingering feelings for the other person, or still find him or her attractive, you should keep that to yourself. It might make you feel good to say it in the moment, and it may even feel good for the other person to hear it in the short-term. However, this can make it harder for the other person to move on with life, which can lead to resentment and anger after a while."

      "content": "Avoid intimate contact. Ending a relationship can be scary, for both parties. As a result, it's not uncommon for people to seek out the familiarity of intimate contact with someone they've recently broken up with. This should be avoided. Making out or having sex with someone you've just broken up with can feel good at the time. In the long run, though, it keeps you both from moving forward and can make the situation more painful and difficult for both of you. [19] X Research source"

Recovering from a breakup is a painful process and it can take a long time. [20] X Research source Even if you are happy about the break up, your ex-boyfriend or girlfriend might be heartbroken. He or she will recover, but it will take a while, so try to be patient. Trying to be friends right away can make it harder for one or both of you to move on with your lives. Wait until you are sure that you and your ex are ready to be friends. This may take a few months or even years."
