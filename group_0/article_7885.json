The code will appear as \"W,\" \"S\" or \"S-W.\" [1] X Research source \"W\" indicates that a water-based cleaning solution may be used. \"S\" indicates that a solvent-based cleaner (or one which dissolves chemical compounds) can be used. \"S-W\" indicates that you may safely use both types of cleaners. \"X\" means that you should vacuum clean only and skip the cleaning solution.

[3] X Research source If you have a very powerful or unwieldy vacuum, use a furniture brush instead. Even if the care tag says \"W\" or \"S\" on it, you should still vacuum the furniture before applying a cleaning solution."

Even if the fabric isn't stained, washing it will keep it smelling fresh and looking clean. [4] X Research source It's a good idea to clean a test spot with your chosen cleaner first to double-check that it won't stain or discolor the material."

You can use commercial cleaners on \"W,\" \"S,\" and \"S-W\" pieces. Alternatively, you can wash \"W\" furniture with cold, soapy water. For \"S\" furniture, you could use undiluted rubbing alcohol.

When it dries, run a vacuum over it."
