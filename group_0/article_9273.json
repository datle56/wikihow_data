When looking for ports, be sure to use the ones that say something like In or Input . This means they accept video input from other sources, allowing you to input video from your MacBook. Some of the most common ports are listed below. [1] X Research source HDMI ports look like trapezoids. DisplayPort (or Thunderbolt/Thunderbolt 2 ) ports look like a rectangle with two corners cut off. USB-C (or Thunderbolt 3/Thunderbolt 4 ) ports are small and ovular. VGA ports have 15 small holes with a larger screw hole on each end. They're often blue in color. [2] X Expert Source Luigi Oppido Computer & Tech Specialist Expert Interview. 31 July 2019.

Adapters can be bought directly from the Apple Store or any number of technology retailers.

For example, if your MacBook has USB-C ports while your monitor has HDMI ports, try searching for a “USB-C to HDMI adapter” . If you need a USB-C cable, make sure to buy one that supports video/data transfer! The USB-C cable that came with your MacBook is only for charging and will not be able to connect your Mac to an external display."
