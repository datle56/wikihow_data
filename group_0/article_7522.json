    {
      "title": "Place the citation at the end of the sentence before the period.",
      "content": "Place the citation at the end of the sentence before the period. Put the citation in parentheses. Each citation will contain either the author’s name or title of the dictionary, the year of publication, and a page number if there is one. These are separated by commas. Your citation may look something like these: [1] X Research source Crepuscular is an adjective meaning “of or pertaining to twilight” (Simpson, 2017). The first known use of “exordium” was in 1577 ( Merriam-Webster , 2005). Fabaceous appeared in Johnson’s first dictionary (Johnson, 1757, p. 757)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the editor or author’s last name and the year in the parentheses.",
      "content": "Put the editor or author’s last name and the year in the parentheses. It is rare to find the editors or authors of a dictionary, but if you can find them, this is the preferred way of citing any text in APA. Separate the author's name and the year with a comma. [2] X Research source For example, if R.H. Smith edited the dictionary in 2007, your citation would look like this: A \"cubit\" refers to the length between the middle finger and elbow (Smith, 2007). If there are 2 authors or editors, write both last names with a “&” in between. For example: A \"cubit\" refers to the length between the middle finger and elbow (Smith & Chang, 2007). If there are 3 to 5 authors or editors, write out all of their last names, separated by commas. Place an “&” before the last one. A \"cubit\" refers to the length between the middle finger and elbow (Smith, Chang, Jones, Diaz, & Ahn, 2007). If there are 6 or more authors or editors, write out the first name and then write “et al.” after it. For example: A \"cubit\" refers to the length between the middle finger and elbow (Smith et al., 2007)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the name of the dictionary to reference the entire work.",
      "content": "Write the name of the dictionary to reference the entire work. This is especially useful if you do not have an editor or if you are using the dictionary to reference more than one word. Write the name in italics. You still need to include the year. Your citation might look like: In Scots, \"deasil\" refers to a clockwise direction ( Dictionary.com, 2017). The term \"ruckus\" is an Americanism that came about in the eighteenth century ( Oxford English Dictionary, 2017)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the word you are referencing if you are only citing one word.",
      "content": "Put the word you are referencing if you are only citing one word. If you only used the dictionary for one word, use the word in the parentheses. This will help the reader find the citation in your reference list, which will begin with this word. For example: The \"exordium\" is the beginning of a treatise (Exordium, 2015)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include a page number if you used a physical dictionary.",
      "content": "Include a page number if you used a physical dictionary. Cite only the pages that you found the information on. If you used a digital dictionary, you do not need to use a page number. Write “p.” before the number for one page and “pp.” for multiple pages. For example, your citation might look like: [3] X Research source The word \"eadig\" meant blessed in Anglo-Saxon (Jones, 1996, p. 250). The term originally referred to an agreement between the Vatican and a foreign power (Concordat, 2001, pp. 191-192)."

Arrange the list alphabetically by the last name of the author. If you do not have the last name of the author, use the title instead."

    {
      "title": "Write the word you referenced first.",
      "content": "Write the word you referenced first. Capitalize the first letter of the word and place a period after the end of the word. For example, if you looked up the word \"crepuscular,\" you would just write: Crepuscular. If you used the dictionary to cite multiple words, do not use this method. Instead of citing individual entries, cite the entire dictionary instead."
