  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Write \"ATTN\" followed by the name of the recipient on the envelope.",
      "content": "Write \"ATTN\" followed by the name of the recipient on the envelope. Write the recipient’s information in the center of the letter or package. The \"ATTN\" line always appears at the very top of your package or letter’s address line when you address it , just before the name of the person you're sending it to. This line tells the mail carrier exactly who the letter is intended for. Use a colon after \"ATTN\" to make it clearly readable. [1] X Research source For example, write \"ATTN: John Smith,\" where \"John Smith\" is replaced with your recipient's name. Or, write out the full word \"Attention” or “Attention to”. If you don’t know who the letter needs to reach, exactly, write the most specific recipient you can, like the office, department, or job title of the person after “ATTN:”."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the business or organization name on the second line.",
      "content": "Write the business or organization name on the second line. The name of the company where the person works goes underneath the \"ATTN\" line. If the company is large and the person to whom you're writing works for a particular department, include the department name on a line of it's own before you write the company name. [2] X Research source If there is no business to add, skip this step. Not including the company name on the envelope will not usually prevent your letter from being delivered. However, your letter will look less professional , and may not get delivered promptly if you don't include the company name."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the street address beneath the company name.",
      "content": "Write the street address beneath the company name. Write the full address on a single line beneath the company name, if there is one, or beneath the recipient’s name, if there isn’t. [3] X Research source Make sure to include any directional signs (such as \"east\" or \"west\"), suite number, or unit number. Suite and unit numbers should not be placed on a separate line unless absolutely necessary. Make sure you know the exact street address where your recipient works. Many businesses that are located in multi-story or other large buildings will include a suite number in their address. Including this number is crucial."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill in the city, state, and postal code on the bottom line.",
      "content": "Fill in the city, state, and postal code on the bottom line. Format this section as “CITY, STATE POSTAL CODE,” with a comma after the city, but nowhere else. [4] X Research source If you know the \"ZIP+4\" postal code, include it to further ensure that your letter reaches the correct address."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the country to the last line.",
      "content": "Add the country to the last line. Finally, write the country that the recipient lives in under everything else. [5] X Research source Usually, the post office can deliver the letter without this if you’re mailing to someone within your own country, but it’s good practice, and ensures that the postal workers have an easy time delivering your letter quickly and safely. If you’re sending mail internationally , this is more important, so don’t skip it!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the return address in the top left corner.",
      "content": "Write the return address in the top left corner. The return address is where the letter will get sent back to if the postal worker can’t deliver it for whatever reason. Every piece of mail you send should have this, but it’s especially important when addressing mail with “ATTN,” since there’s a chance the person you’re writing to may not be available. [6] X Research source Format the return address the same way, with your name on the first line, your business name on the next, the street address below that, and finally the city, state, and zip code below that. Don’t include “ATTN” in the return address."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add postage to the top right corner and send the envelope.",
      "content": "Add postage to the top right corner and send the envelope. Place your stamp in the top right of the envelope or package. How many stamps you need depends on what type of envelope or package it is, and how much it weighs. A simple, standard envelope with a few sheets of paper inside usually requires only a single stamp. For anything larger, consult the USPS’s postage calculator to get more exact postage. Or, go to your local post office to mail the letter. The postal worker at the counter will help you calculate and print the exact postage."
    },
    {
      "title": "ATTN means “attention,” and indicates who should receive the letter.",
      "content": "ATTN means “attention,” and indicates who should receive the letter. When you add “ATTN” to the address of a letter, it tells the people handling the letter where the letter needs to go and to whom. It’s most often used when mailing something to an organization, like a business, where many people work, rather than mailing to a personal address. That way, once it reaches its final destination, the people there, like receptionists, can carry it that last little bit and deliver it to the right person or group. [7] X Research source You usually don’t use “ATTN” when mailing to a personal address, or when you’re certain that a mail carrier alone can get it into the right hands, without the help of someone like an office administrator."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use “ATTN” when a specific person needs to open the letter.",
      "content": "Use “ATTN” when a specific person needs to open the letter. If you’re mailing private information that only 1 specific person should see, or just want to make sure that 1 person in particular gets the package, instead of someone else, “ATTN” is a great choice. It tells everyone who handles your mail at that address that it needs to reach that person, and shouldn’t be opened until it does. [8] X Research source For example, if you’re mailing something to an employee within a certain department, using “ATTN” and then their name can help make sure it doesn’t just get opened by the front desk at that business. “ATTN” is also common when someone is already expecting your letter, so that they’re notified when it arrives."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use “ATTN” when you’re unsure of who the letter needs to reach.",
      "content": "Use “ATTN” when you’re unsure of who the letter needs to reach. ATTN is also useful when you know generally where the letter needs to go, like a certain department of a business, or to someone with a certain title, but you’re not sure of the person’s name or identity. This way, once it reaches its destination, the people there who are more familiar with how things are organized can hand it to the right person. [9] X Research source For example, if you’re mailing something to the leader of a department at a college, but aren’t sure of their name, you might write “ATTN: Head of Forestry Department”."
