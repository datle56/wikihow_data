Blackwidow keyboards have dazzling light displays, but these can be damaged if you leave the power on as you clean. Turn off all the settings on your keyboard and unplug it from your computer to prevent shorting or damaging your keyboard's lights. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove letter and number keycaps by pulling them off their base. All square-shaped keys on your Blackwidow can be removed simply by pulling the cover directly upwards to dislodge them from their bases. You may need to wiggle the key covers a little bit to get them off, but simply pulling upwards should do the trick. [4] X Research source Don't bend the keys as you pull them, as this can damage the connection. Pull the keys straight up to dislodge them, revealing plus-sign-shaped holdings."

      "content": "Remove any hinged keys, such as the spacebar, shift and enter keys. These hinges clip keys to the board, and usually are only used on larger keys. Pinch the white stubs at the bottom of the clips together and pull them out of their socket. [5] X Research source Use careful and slight movements to prevent breaking these fragile pieces. You can identify hinged keys by looking for white hinges on the bottom of any keycaps you couldn't pull off. Usually, the spacebar, shift key, enter key, and tab key will have hinges. [6] X Research source The hinges are slotted at the bottom of the keyboard and are more easily seen once all other keys are removed."

      "content": "Place every keycap and hinged key into a plastic container. Choose a plastic container just large enough to fit all of your keys — a sandwich or a leftover container should suffice. [7] X Research source Don't use a plastic bag or run the keys under water individually or you won't be able to loosen all the gunk and dust from them. Put a lid on the container to prevent leaks, and store it in the sink or in a draining area to avoid getting gunk on your floor."

Fill the plastic tub of keycaps with warm water all the way to the top, or at least enough to cover the top of the pile of caps. Let the keys soak for at least 5 minutes to loosen anything that dirtied them. [9] X Research source Let the keys soak for longer if there are particularly bad stains on them, up to 30 minutes at most, as water could loosen the surface layer of paint if left for too long to soak. You can also add some mild soap to the water to help remove buildup."

[10] X Research source Then, place a towel over the counter, and dry off each key individually with a cotton swab. When you've finished with a key, place it symbol-side-up on the towel to let it sit until there is no more water — this can take up to an hour. Let your keys sit on the towel until they are completely dry, even if it takes longer than an hour. Any water in your keyboard could damage the internal electronics, so be absolutely certain there are no drops left before you reattach them."

If there are any keys that aren't cleaned by a simple soak and dry, you will have to use a cotton swab with alcohol to fully loosen the material. Dip the end of a cotton swab into 70 percent rubbing alcohol and gently yet firmly rub the persistent gunk until it's removed or loosened. [11] X Research source While rubbing alcohol evaporates on its own, it's still best to run these keys under water and dry them again so your keyboard doesn't smell like alcohol. [12] X Research source Place them symbol-side-up on the towel when you've cleaned the persistent gunk."

Compressed air spray, or keyboard duster spray, sprays a highly pressurized stream of air that is perfect for cleaning delicate electronics. Once the keycaps are removed from the keyboard, spray along each line, row, and in the cracks and slots of the keyboard to loosen and remove big chunks of gunk and loose hair. [14] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 28 August 2019. [15] X Research source If you don't have access to keyboard duster spray, you can use a leaf blower or similar high-pressure air blowing tool. Just lay it flat on the ground, hold it steady with heavy objects, and let the leaf blower loose. [16] X Research source This will spray lots of gunk, dust, hair, and other particles all over the place. If you want to keep your floor and desk space clean, take the keyboard outside to spray it off."

      "content": "Pour rubbing alcohol into a small dish and dip your cotton swabs. It's difficult to get the right amount of rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab from the bottle, so pour out just enough to barely cover the bottom of a shallow dish, such as a small bowl or a clean ashtray. Dip your cotton swabs in the alcohol for just a moment. [17] X Research source If you leave your cotton swabs in the alcohol for too long the cotton will unravel from the stick and become unusable. Instead, just dip it in for a brief second, and let any excess alcohol drip off."

It will take more than a few cotton swabs to get the job done. [18] X Research source Be sure to apply pressure as needed to clean heavy stains. Let the keyboard fully dry for about an hour before continuing. If you find any gunk that is particularly stuck, try using more pressure, or use a small sharp object like a pocket knife to gently chip away the outer part of the gunk and then rub it with alcohol again. Be careful around the LEDs and consider using a cotton swab that has barely any rubbing alcohol on these parts to prevent electrical damage."

Dip a cotton ball in your rubbing alcohol dish and wipe the outside of the keyboard with it — the black portion between the key areas. Be careful not to soak your cotton balls too much or you will drip excess alcohol into the key area and possibly cause electronic damage. [19] X Research source Let the keyboard fully dry before continuing, and dab away excess alcohol with a dry cloth if necessary. You can also use regular cleaning wipes for this step, as they don't drip and are less likely to cause electronic damage. Opt for alcohol-infused cleaning wipes to get the best clean."

Starting from the left of the keyboard, push the keycap gently onto its proper spot until it snaps into place. [21] X Research source You won't hear a click, but the plus-sign-shaped hole should fit snugly over the plus-sign-shaped attachment on the keyboard.
