However, if you have a pretty high daily protein goal based on factors like your weight or activity level, it may make sense for you to try to get this much protein in one meal.

      "content": "50 grams of protein looks different for different food groups. Meat and animal products are very good sources of protein, so it takes a bit less of them to reach 50 grams of protein. For vegetarian foods like tofu, beans, or peanut butter, several servings are required to hit the 50-gram mark. Here are some examples of what approximately 50 grams of protein looks like for various foods: 7 ounces of beef, chicken, turkey, pork, or fish = 49 grams of protein 9 eggs = 54 grams of protein 17 ounces of tofu = 51 grams of protein 48 ounces (6 cups) of skim or 1% milk = 48 grams of protein 20 oz of Greek yogurt = 48 grams of protein 3 cups of kidney, navy, cannellini, or black beans = 48 grams 2 cups of cottage cheese = 56 grams of protein 14 tbsp of peanut butter = 49 grams of protein [1] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source In order to sneak more protein into your daily diet, Gomez recommends tofu, “a package of which can have close to 30 grams of protein” and “things like peanut butter and almond butter, [which] you can just throw on a sandwich or have some spoonfuls here and there.”"

      "content": "The amount of protein you need each day depends on a few factors. In general, it’s recommended that you eat between .8 g and 1 g of protein per kilogram of your body weight on a daily basis. For example, if you weigh 170 pounds (77 kg), you should eat between 61.6 g and 77 g of protein each day. If you’re not sure of your weight in kilograms, multiply your weight in pounds by .36 to determine your daily protein intake. You can also use this helpful online protein calculator to determine your target daily protein intake. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source So, is 50 grams of protein per day enough? For a relatively active adult to meet their recommended daily protein intake, at least 10% of their calories should come from protein. This means that someone eating a diet of 2,000 calories per day should eat at least 50 grams of protein. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source It’s important to note, however, that individual protein needs vary based on age, sex, activity level, and whether or not you’re pregnant, so 50 grams of protein may be too much or too little depending on your circumstances. [4] X Research source It’s crucial to include enough protein in your diet, as Gomez explains. “Protein does a billion different things in our body, and muscle building is really just one of them…protein is [also] necessary for hormone development and for different enzymes to do their job.”"

If you’re having a hard time getting enough protein in your regular diet, you may want to use a protein supplement, such as protein powders or ready-to-drink protein shakes.
