[1] X Expert Source David Jia Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 14 January 2021. Set up the equation using fractions, if needed. Put the number of grams over 1 and divide it by 1 kg / 1,000 g (which is the conversion factor). The grams will cancel out to leave you with an answer in kilograms. Make sure to label your answer with the correct units.

In other words, metric units are always a multiple of 10 apart. Grams and kilograms are a multiple of 1,000 apart, so you can simply move the decimal point 3 places to the left. Remember that for a whole number, the decimal point is to the right of the ones place. Fill in any blank spaces with zeroes, as needed.

In other words, metric units are always a multiple of 10 apart, meaning they get larger or smaller by a power of ten (10). A unit's prefix tells its power. The prefix \"kilo-\" means that the unit has one thousand (1,000) of the base unit.
