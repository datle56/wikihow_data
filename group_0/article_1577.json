      "content": "Know the types of cards. In Pokémon T.C.G., there are 4 main types of cards in a deck: Support Card : This card typically features a person. You can only play one per turn. Item Card : These items can have a wide variety of effects. You can play as many as you'd like in one turn. Pokémon Card : These vary between Basic, Stage 1, and Stage. 2. For a Pokémon card to come into play, you must play a Basic Card first. You can play a Stage 1 or 2 Pokémon only if you have the appropriate previous Stage card. The requirements for the \"evolution\" are found in the upper left-hand corner below the Stage Level (Basic, 1, or 2). If you have an image that matches the required Pokémon, then you can evolve into that Pokémon (once per Pokémon per turn). Energy Card : Each of these have a different symbol that corresponds to their type. You can play one energy card per turn. You will need to use only Energy cards and Pokémon cards to understand these instructions."

When drawing cards from your deck, place your prize cards on the left-hand side of your play mat. Typically these are displayed in 2 columns, but any method of displaying prize cards is acceptable as long as you can access any card at any time (i.e. the cards aren't covering each other)."
