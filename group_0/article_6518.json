Enter the exact number next to \"H,\" \"S,\" and \"B,\" to select a color using HSB percentages. The RGB scale lets you enter the values of Red, Green, and Blue separately.

Enter a number next to \"R,\" \"G,\" and \"B\" to select a color using RGB values. The LAB model is lets you specify the Luminance (it ranges from 0 to 100), A (which is how red or green the color is), and B (how blue or yellow the color is).

RGB Sliders: RGB colors are used in digital displays, like computer monitors, television screens, or mobile devices. This mode uses three slider bars for R (Red), G (Green), B (Blue). Each slider allows you to select a value between 0 and 255. By mixing various values of these three colors, you can select virtually any color. HSB Sliders: HSB stands for Hue, Saturation, and Brightness. This mode displays three slider bars. The H slider bar is rainbow colored and allows you to select a hue. The S slider bar allows you to adjust the saturation of the hue from pure white to a very rich hue. The B slider bar allows you to adjust the brightness from pure black to pure color.
