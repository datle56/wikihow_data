In this formula, A is the area of the trapezoid, a and are the bases (or parallel sides) of the shape, and h is the height (or the perpendicular distance between the bases. Here’s an example of how to use this formula with all dimensions given: Example Problem: Find the area of a trapezoid whose parallel sides are 32 cm and 12 cm, respectively, and whose height is 5 cm. Solution: The known dimensions are a = 32 cm, b = 12 cm, and h = 5 cm. Plug these values into the formula: A = ½ (32 + 12) × (5) = ½ (44) × (5) Solve to get 110 . Add the appropriate units to get 110 cm 2 . Note: Trapezoids that have equal bases (i.e., a = b ) result in a simplified formula: A = a × h. This is the same formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle ."

Check if you were given the measurements for each base—these measurements are your a and b values. [1] X Research source For example , the trapezoid shown above has values a = 8 cm and b = 13 cm. If you don’t know one of the bases , you can use a ruler to measure it (if the trapezoid shape is up to scale). Otherwise, you’ll need to already know the trapezoid’s perimeter or area and use those formulas to work backwards and find the missing base length."

Keep in mind that the length of the angled sides, or the legs of the trapezoid, is not the same as the height. The leg length is only the same as the height if the leg is perpendicular to the bases. If you don’t know the height , you can use a ruler to measure it (if the trapezoid shape is up to scale).

Subtract the length of the longer base by the shorter one: 20 - 10 = 10. Divide the difference by 2: 10 / 2 = 5. This is the length of the base of one of the triangles.

This area is measured in square units, such as cm 2 , in 2 , and ft 2 . It is calculated by using the lengths of each side of the trapezoid, particularly the bases (the two parallel lines) and the height (the perpendicular length between these bases). [8] X Research source But what’s a trapezoid? A trapezoid is a four-sided shape with one pair of parallel sides and one pair of non-parallel sides. The internal angles of a trapezoid always sum up to 360°, while the angles on the same side of a leg always sum up to 180º. [9] X Research source Examples of trapezoid-shaped objects include flower planters, handbags, popcorn buckets, and lampshades."
