      "content": "Tie your comment to physical flattery so he feels extra touched. Dating coach John Keegan recommends complimenting what you genuinely like. If you notice that his shirt really plays up his eye color, let him know. If he’s wearing a beautifully colored shirt, your compliment will make him feel extra flattered—because you're implying that his eyes are the same awesome shade. “Woah. Did you know that blue button-up is like the exact same color as your eyes?” Get near his eyes for a closer look. “Aw, wow. The gold in your jacket totally brings out flecks in your eyes. It looks great.” Tap another friend on the shoulder and have them look with you. “Okay, is it just me, or do Zander’s eyes match his turtleneck perfectly? It looks so good.”"

      "content": "Give him insight into your sweet thoughts on his flattering fits. As Keegan suggests, “give him some positive feedback.” Not only will this compliment him in the moment, but you’ll get him wondering about all the other times you’ve thought about how well he dresses. He’ll be flying high, and you’ll have left him thinking about how much he likes being around you. “When you walk in the room, my first thought is always, \"Dang, his outfit is amazing.\"” “You seriously always impress. Whenever you come into work, I'm thinking, \"He nails the dapper, trendy look.\"” “Man, you’re always the coolest looking one here. I’m jealous.”"

      "content": "Ask him to walk you through his outfit to prove how much you like it. When someone is excited to spend five minutes talking through the specifics of a fit, that’s a huge compliment. So, offer that to him! He’ll feel touched and walk away thinking about how much he liked talking to you. You may even impress him with your own style know-how! [3] X Research source “Okay, this canvas jacket and dark jeans combo is working so well. How did you decide on that?” “You look amazing. I’ve gotta know how you chose to pair those sneakers with that sweater.” “You always put together the coolest combos. How’d you choose these leather pants with this graphic tee?”"

Who do you think I stole that look from?” “Okay, so I did buy your sweater in purple. But I’m not trying to be a copycat.
