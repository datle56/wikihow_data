      "title": "Clean the watch with a damp cloth.",
      "content": "Clean the watch with a damp cloth. Even if you don't have a waterproof G Shock, you can still use water on a damp cloth to target the problem areas on your watch. Run warm water briefly over a sponge or soft cloth, then squeeze to release excess water. Rub the areas of dirt or buildup carefully with the damp cloth. Your rubbing should cause the dirt to lift away from the surface of the watch. Don't use paper towels or other abrasive cloths to clean your watch, as they may cause scratches on its surface."

      "title": "Wipe away dirt with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Wipe away dirt with rubbing alcohol. If using water to remove the buildup on your watch didn't do the job, you may have to use a stronger cleaning solution. Rubbing alcohol is a potent and safe cleaner to use on Casio G Shock watches. To use, pour about a teaspoon (4.92 ml) of rubbing alcohol onto a soft cloth. Then rub the surface of the watch, as you did before with the wet cloth, to remove the dirt or buildup. If you successfully removed the dirt with the rubbing alcohol, wipe away any lingering rubbing alcohol with a damp cloth, then dry with a clean soft cloth."

      "title": "Scrub problem areas with a toothbrush.",
      "content": "Scrub problem areas with a toothbrush. If you are tackling particularly stubborn dirt, it may be more effective to scrub at the buildup rather than to wipe it. Dip a toothbrush in warm water or rubbing alcohol, then shake it to remove excess liquid. Use the bristles to scrub in gentle circular motions on the dirt or buildup on your watch. Use a toothbrush with soft, as opposed to stiff, bristles."

      "title": "Use a cotton swab to clean crevices.",
      "content": "Use a cotton swab to clean crevices. Dirt and others buildups often form in the cracks and crevices of watches, making it difficult to clean. If you have dirt that has gathered in a hard to reach area, use a cotton swab dipped in water or rubbing alcohol to clean the spot. [1] X Research source Make sure to pick out any fluff from the cotton swab that may get snagged on the edges of the watch."

      "title": "Rub at scuffs with a pencil eraser.",
      "content": "Rub at scuffs with a pencil eraser. If you wear your watch regularly, you likely have a few scuffs and markings from regular wear. A handy tool that you can use to remove scuffs is a regular pencil eraser. To use an eraser, rub it gently on the scuff several times, then wipe away the eraser dust. Use a white eraser as opposed to a pink eraser to avoid discoloring the watch, especially if the watch is white. Scuffs are not to be confused with scratches. Scuffs are superficial skid marks on the surface of the watch, whereas scratches penetrate the surface of the watch."

      "title": "Use toothpaste to remove scuffs from the face.",
      "content": "Use toothpaste to remove scuffs from the face. Toothpaste is an unlikely but highly effective tool for removing scuffs and light scratches. To use toothpaste, dab a small amount on the end of a cotton swab and rub the scuffs or scratches gently in circular motions. After wiping, use a slightly damp soft cloth to rub away the toothpaste. Use a standard white toothpaste as opposed to a gel-based or non-white toothpaste."

      "content": "Use a jeweler's cloth to remove minor scratches. A jeweler's cloth is specially formulated to remove minor scratches from the surface of a watch or piece of jewelry. To use the jeweler's cloth, rub the light scratches with the cloth for about 30 seconds. You should see that the scratches have gone. [2] X Research source If you have particularly large or deep scratches on the surface of your watch, you may need to bring your watch to a professional jeweler to get them removed."

      "title": "Make sure your watch is water resistant to 50 m.",
      "content": "Make sure your watch is water resistant to 50 m. Before you rinse your watch, you need to make sure that it is waterproof. There are several classifications of water resistance within the Casio G Shock brand, ranging from the class of “Water Resistant” to “Divers' Watch 200M.” A “Water Resistant” watch, the first classification on the scale of water resistance, is only resistant to splashing and minor contact with water and is not designed to be rinsed or submerged in water. Make sure that you have at least a “Water Resistant to 50 M” classification watch, which is the next classification after “Water Resistant ”, before you submerge it."

      "title": "Run warm water over the watch.",
      "content": "Run warm water over the watch. Once you have ascertained that you have at least a “Water Resistant to 50 M” Casio G Shock watch, turn on the faucet and wait until the water is warm, then hold the watch directly under the jet of water. Turn the watch over to ensure that you are rinsing the entire surface of the watch. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Spread clear hand soap over the watch.",
      "content": "Spread clear hand soap over the watch. After you have gotten the surface of the watch wet, squirt a small amount of hand soap into your hand. Hold the watch away from the running water and use your fingers to spread the soap over the entire surface of the watch, including on the band and into the nooks and crannies of the watch. [4] X Research source Use clear soap, as colored soap may stain the band of the watch, especially if you own a white watch."

      "title": "Hold the watch under the water.",
      "content": "Hold the watch under the water. Once you spread the soap all over the watch, hold the watch back under the jet of water. While the water is running over the watch, use your fingers to massage the soap into the watch, letting the water wash the soap away. Run water over the watch until all the hand soap is removed from the surface of the watch. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Dry the watch with a clean cloth.",
      "content": "Dry the watch with a clean cloth. Once you have finished washing away all the soap, dry your Casio G Shock watch with a clean, soft cloth. It's better for the materials of the watch to manually dry it rather than to air dry it. [6] X Research source"
