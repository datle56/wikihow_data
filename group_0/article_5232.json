      "content": "There are several malfunctions that can cause your car to go into limp mode: Low fluid levels. Low oil and transmission fluid levels can cause your car to go into limp mode. When your transmission fluid is low, it can cause low pressure, which will prevent your transmission from operating properly. Faulty sensors. Your car has many sensors attached to the engine and your transmission, which your car's computer uses to diagnose your problems. If one of those sensors is sending inaccurate signals, it can cause your car to activate limp mode. Bad parts.
