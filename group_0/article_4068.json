      "content": "Gather all the supplies you will need. There's quite a list so you'll want to make sure you have everything before you start the bleaching process. Most importantly, you'll need to purchase a powder bleach and a developer, preferably of the same brand as the bleach. L’Oréal Quick Blue is the cheapest and most trusted option. [6] X Research source The developer is the liquid that reacts with the powder bleach to strip the color out of your hair. Developer comes in different volumes, such as 20, 30, 40, etc. The higher the volume, the greater the strength of the bleach. For example, you'd have to leave a developer of 20 on your hair for quite a while to cause significant damage, whereas a 40 will burn your hair pretty fast. On the other hand, a 40-strength developer will also lift the color without turning your hair bright orange or needing to repeat the process multiple times. If you’re nervous, use a 30-volume developer; it’s better to not have the exact color you want than to fry your hair. [7] X Research source off. You'll also need to get a toner and deep conditioner, as well as instruments, including a plastic mixing bowl (don't use metal!), a plastic spatula, a plastic rat-tail end brush, and gloves. All of these items are readily available at beauty supply stores like Sally or Ricky's. It should cost you anywhere between $40-$50 and you should be able to get a few bleaching jobs out of it. Be sure to also grab some old towels and old clothes that you don't mind getting ruined with bleach."

Quick Blue, for example, calls for 1 scoop of bleach powder to 1.5-2oz developer. If you want to make sure you have enough for all of your hair, double the mixing amounts. Pour the developer in the mixing bowl first since you’ll need to measure it using the graduated lines on the bowl, which can be challenging if there’s already powder in there. Instead, add the powder to the developer."

Sections should be very thin to ensure even application – think of how this looks at the salon when they do this with aluminum foil. Make a small part in the hair, spread the bleach on it in both directions, and then create another part directly behind the one you just made. You'll probably need to lift the hair up to do this. Think of it like the pages of a book. You are turning the page and the two already bleached 'pages' will touch and you will move on to the next fresh \"untouched\" section. If you are doing more than an inch of roots, the hair closest to your scalp will bleach quicker and become a few shades lighter than the rest because bleach is activated by heat. So, if you're bleaching more than just your roots, apply the bleach everywhere but the roots for the first 20 minutes and then go back."

However, if you are in pain or feel too much of a burning sensation, move to the next step. It's better that you get it done professionally or fixed up in a salon than burn your scalp. You could also use a foil-lined cap or heat to speed things up, but this isn't recommended until you've become more experienced at bleaching and know how your head and hair react to the process."

Focus instead on the lightness, not on the color, since you'll be toning it shortly. That said, yellow is what you're looking for, not orange. If your natural colour doesn’t lift enough after 45 minutes or so and is still an orange color, wash it out, deep condition, and either go to a salon and get it fixed OR deep condition for a few days and then try again. Do not try to leave the bleach on for longer and do not try to repeat the process immediately after a failed attempt; this will seriously damage your hair."

[10] X Research source Put on another pair of gloves, and slather the toner solution over your hair, but not on the roots quite yet. Once applied, comb the toner through to the roots and ends with a wide-tooth comb. This too should turn into a mousse-like texture. Follow any instructions that may be on your toner."
