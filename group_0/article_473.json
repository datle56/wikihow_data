If you have no sticker or instructions, dial the customer service or activation phone number listed on the back of the card. [1] X Research source If the card was purchased in person, it’s probably already activated and ready to use. Cards ordered online, on the other hand, need to be activated to access the balance. The phone number most likely leads you to the gift card issuer’s customer service team and not to Visa directly."

[2] X Research source Once you’ve submitted all of the card’s information, it will be activated and ready to use. Choose a strong PIN you’ll remember that’s also difficult for others to guess (not your birthday, for example). Look for the card number on either the front or back of the card. The expiration date and security code are most likely on the back of the card. If you’re struggling with an automated call, press “0” repeatedly.

Since Visa gift cards can be used anywhere, they’re really flexible and give the user a lot of freedom to spend the money how they’d like. Here are a few of the other key benefits of using a Visa gift card : [15] X Research source Ease of Use: Visa gift cards can be used as easily as a normal debit or credit card—just make sure to activate or register it first, if prompted by your card distributor. Security: Depending on which company issued your card, it often will come with security protections just like the ones offered on regular debit and credit cards. If you’re concerned about security, ask the card seller about replacement fees and fraud protection for the gift card. Gift giving: Visa gift cards are a popular gift because, unlike a normal gift card, the recipient can spend it anywhere they like rather than just at one specific store. Plus, it feels slightly more personal than cash! Alternative for no bank account: If you don’t have a bank account, then you’re probably tired of always having to carry and pay with cash (especially nowadays, when cash isn’t as commonly accepted). With a Visa gift card or prepaid card, you can load money onto your account and then use it anywhere that a Visa debit card would be accepted. Safer for financial management: For young adults or people who struggle with budgeting , Visa gift cards are great because they give a limited amount of cash. If you run out, you’re done! They’re a great stepping stone toward greater fiscal responsibility."
