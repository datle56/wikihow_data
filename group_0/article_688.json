      "content": "Factor each radicand into prime numbers. [1] X Research source An easy way to factor a number is by creating a factor tree diagram. Read Do a Factor Tree for complete instructions. A radicand is the number under the radical sign. A prime number is a number that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself, [2] X Research source for example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. You do NOT need to factor any coefficients. A coefficient is a number in front of the radical sign. Let’s say, for example, that you want to add 20 + 4 45 + 5 + 7 . {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {20}}+4{\\sqrt {45}}+{\\sqrt {5}}+{\\sqrt {7}}.} To do this, you need to factor 20 {\\displaystyle 20} as 2 × 2 × 5 {\\displaystyle 2\\times 2\\times 5} . You also need to factor 45 {\\displaystyle 45} as 3 × 3 × 5 {\\displaystyle 3\\times 3\\times 5} . If a radicand is already a prime number, it does not need to be factored. For example, since 5 {\\displaystyle 5} and 7 {\\displaystyle 7} are already prime numbers, 5 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {5}}} and 7 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {7}}} do not need to be factored."

For example, 2 × 2 × 5 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2\\times 2\\times 5}}} has a pair of 2s, so draw a circle around them. 4 3 × 3 × 5 {\\displaystyle 4{\\sqrt {3\\times 3\\times 5}}} has a pair of 3s, so draw a circle around them."

The square root of any pair of factors will equal the factor, because x × x = x 2 {\\displaystyle x\\times x=x^{2}} and x 2 = x {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x^{2}}}=x} . Place this number in front of the radical sign. If the expression already has a coefficient, multiply the two numbers. [3] X Research source For example: 2 × 2 × 5 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2\\times 2\\times 5}}} = 4 5 {\\displaystyle ={\\sqrt {4}}{\\sqrt {5}}} = 2 5 {\\displaystyle =2{\\sqrt {5}}} So, 20 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {20}}} simplifies to 2 5 {\\displaystyle 2{\\sqrt {5}}} . 4 3 × 3 × 5 {\\displaystyle 4{\\sqrt {3\\times 3\\times 5}}} = 4 × 9 5 {\\displaystyle =4\\times {\\sqrt {9}}{\\sqrt {5}}} = ( 4 × 3 ) 5 {\\displaystyle =(4\\times 3){\\sqrt {5}}} = 12 5 {\\displaystyle =12{\\sqrt {5}}} So, 4 45 {\\displaystyle 4{\\sqrt {45}}} simplifies to 12 5 {\\displaystyle 12{\\sqrt {5}}} ."
