If you snap a can tab and the bottom hole looks like a semi-circle, it might mean that the person you have a crush on will hug you sometime soon.

      "content": "A rainbow shape without a hole means you’ll hook up with someone. There’s a chance that when you break off the tab, you’ll get a rainbow shape without a hole at the bottom. If you get one of these tabs, it might mean that you’re going to hook up with the person you like. This happens when the button that attaches the tab to the can snaps off along with the tab. To take out a can tab and keep the button intact, this TikToker recommends twisting the tab around over the drinking hole. Keep a finger over the button and twist the tab forward to remove it."
