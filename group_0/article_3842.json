      "content": "Have great comebacks . Blair always has the perfect thing to say to anyone that insults her, right away. Make sure what you say is quick, witty , and makes total sense. Here's a tip: you have to hit the opponent where it hurts the most. Find out what makes them squirm,and use that in a comeback. Don't let anyone get away with insulting you. Being quick witted and smart is always respected. If for some reason you can't think of a good comeback on the spot, stare your opponent down. Give a tiny eye roll, smirk , and look them up and down. This would make them feel insecure without you doing anything. Then you would have won the battle."
