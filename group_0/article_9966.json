      "content": "Pick out bad beans. Mixed in with your dry navy beans may be stones or discolored kernels . Discoloration is usually a sign that the bean isn't fit for consumption, so you should remove these along with stones from the good beans. Canned navy beans can be prepared more easily than dry beans. You'll only have to cook these lightly for a short time with your ingredients and then the beans will be ready for eating. For the purposes of providing a guided example, the process of making navy beans on the stove top is provided. However, you may find making your beans in a slow cooker to be a preferred method."

      "content": "Rinse your beans. Get a large pot or bowl and place the good beans inside of it. Then run cold water over the beans to remove any impurities or bacteria from the surface of the beans. When you've finished this, you can use a strainer to remove the dirty water from the beans in your bowl/pot. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Prepare the dried navy beans by soaking them.",
      "content": "Prepare the dried navy beans by soaking them. Put your rinsed beans back into the bowl/pot and cover them completely with cold water. For every pound (.45 kg) of beans, you should use eight cups of cold water. Then allow the beans to soak for a minimum of eight hours or overnight. When you soak navy beans, enzymes inside the bean are broken down. This will decrease gas."

    {
      "title": "Simmer your beans until tender.",
      "content": "Simmer your beans until tender. First you'll need to strain your beans from the cold water they've been soaking in. Then put the beans into a pot and cover them with six cups of hot water for every pound (.45 kg) of beans. Turn on your stove and bring the water to a boil and then simmer the beans for 1.5 to 2 hours. You can adjust the time you simmer your beans to adjust the tenderness of your beans. Shorter simmer times will yield firmer beans, longer times will result in more tender beans. While simmering, it's likely a foam will form on the top of your water. Add 1 - 2 tablespoons of butter or olive oil to the water to cut down on foam. Wait until the beans are completely cooked before adding any salt. Adding salt earlier interferes with the re-hydration process and can result in \"tough\" beans."

During this process, you may need to add water to the mixture if you notice it getting too low. [6] X Research source"
