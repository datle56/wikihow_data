Citrus cleaners are great at removing limescale, soap scum, and related buildup (dirt from clothes, excess detergent, leftover fabric softener, etc.). You can purchase citrus cleaners at the store, or you can make them at home. Spray the cleaner in dirty areas, and use the cloth to wipe up the grime. Citrus cleaners use the natural properties found in fruits like lemons, oranges, and limes to remove dirt. When cleaning, make sure to wipe and rinse the fabric softener and bleach chambers that are on your washer. You can also use a toothbrush to get to hard to reach places."
