      "content": "Go with layers, an asymmetrical cut, or a defined pixie on a feminine round face. Feminine people with round faces will want to have layers with longer hair or make a bold statement with shorter hair. Hair past your shoulders or a bob should have rich layers to add definition to your face. [1] X Research source For shorter hair, try an asymmetrical bob or a defined pixie. Either cut will add angles and shape to your soft features."

      "title": "Wear the sides and back short to create chiseled features on a round face.",
      "content": "Wear the sides and back short to create chiseled features on a round face. Masculine people with round faces can create the illusion of chiseled features by wearing their hair longer on top and very short, even shaved, on the sides and back. Try a side part or messy fringes on the longer top section of your hair to complete the look. A thin, well-groomed beard that goes close to your Adam’s apple looks good on a round face if you like facial hair."

      "title": "Try blunt bangs or a center part on feminine heart-shaped faces.",
      "content": "Try blunt bangs or a center part on feminine heart-shaped faces. Heart-shaped faces are wider at the top around the cheekbones and come to a point down toward the chin. Bangs that are cut straight across your forehead work well on heart-shaped faces by framing the wider part of your face. [2] X Research source If you’re not a fan of bangs but have a heart-shaped face, try a center part to show it off. A side part tends to create an illusion of elongating your face, which is great for round faces but unnecessary for heart-shapes. This face shape can wear most all lengths and types of layers well."

      "title": "Get lots of layers, waves, or a diamond cut for a feminine square-shaped face.",
      "content": "Get lots of layers, waves, or a diamond cut for a feminine square-shaped face. People with square-shaped faces have a wider jawline and more angular features than other face shape types. Softer hairstyles work better than angular or boxy styles on this face shape. [3] X Research source Lots of length is great on a square-shaped face, especially if you add layers and/or waves to the ends. A diamond cut is longer in the back and shorter up front, and is worn best with wavy hair on square-faces. If you wear bangs, go with side-swept ones as opposed to straight-across to keep your style softer."

      "title": "Wear your sideburns short and style your hair upward for a masculine square face.",
      "content": "Wear your sideburns short and style your hair upward for a masculine square face. People with square faces can add a little length to their face by wearing an upward style like a pompadour. Another way to add some length is by keeping your sideburns above the ears. If you like facial hair, a longer beard also works well on a square face. If you'd prefer to keep longer hair, a bun may also be a good option. This keeps the sides looking short, and the bun can be as high and as long as you would like."

      "content": "Keep volume at the top for a triangular-shaped faces. People with triangle-shaped faces have narrower temples and cheekbones and wider jawlines. Keeping your hair longer and textured at the top can help your face look more proportioned. If your hair has some curl to it, grow it out on top and wear it in a messy pompadour. If you like wearing facial hair, a thicker beard or goatee that’s well-groomed can disguise the angles of your jawline. Feminine people with triangular faces can wear a layered bob with bangs well. Fringe in the front helps create the illusion of a wider forehead."

Take a round brush, and starting at the back of your head, roll the brush backwards while pushing your hair upward and forward and blasting it with hot air from your blow-dryer. [9] X Research source Continue the rolled brushing all the way over the top to your forehead until the top of your hair is tall and rounded. Run more pomade through it, and set the style with some high-hold hairspray. For optimal results, use a nozzle attachment on your blow dryer.
