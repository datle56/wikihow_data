      "content": "Identify relief pitchers. Relief pitchers are the only players for whom the save percentage is calculated. The relief pitcher replaces the starting pitcher late in the game when his team holds a slight lead. The job of the relief pitcher is to keep his team from losing its lead and losing the game."

      "content": "Search for save opportunities. A relief pitcher is not automatically eligible to earn a save simply by entering the game. The relief pitcher is only allowed to earn a save if the following conditions are met: Note the number of runs to be saved. The reliever must enter the game with no more than a 3-run lead and must pitch at least 1 inning. Such a situation would meet 1 of the criteria for a safe opportunity. Figure the position of the potential tying run. Note the opposing team's batting lineup. If all opposing runners on base were to score and 1 of those runs would tie the game, the game is eligible to be counted as a save opportunity. If all opposing batters on base scored and the opposing batter currently batting would represent the tying run, the game is eligible to be counted as a save opportunity. If all opposing players on base and the batter were to score, and the opposing batter on deck would be the tying run should that batter score, the game is eligible to be counted as a save opportunity. For example, if the relief pitcher entered the game with a 3-run lead, meeting the first criteria for a save opportunity, but there were no opposing batters on base, this game would not count as a save opportunity. In this example, even if the opposing batter and the on-deck batter were to score, the game would still not be tied. This example would not be counted as a safe opportunity. Check the number of innings pitched. If the reliever pitches 3 or more innings with a lead, it is at the discretion of the official scorer to designate this situation as a save opportunity."

Saves and save opportunities are tracked on a running basis during the season. Each game played by the reliever's team may cause a situation that will change the running season save percentage of the reliever."
