      "title": "Use the appropriate “kennel name.”",
      "content": "Use the appropriate “kennel name.” If your dog comes from a long established pedigree, they may already have a “kennel name” to use as their first name. The kennel name is often a made-up word that has some meaning to the breeder, for example, a combination of family names, names of other beloved pets, or names of places they've been. Talk to your breeder to find out if your dog has already been dubbed with a kennel name. All of the dogs bred in this family will share the same first name. You will want to choose a second name for each dog that is unique."
