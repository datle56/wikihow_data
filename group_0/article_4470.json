Here’s when breaking up over text makes sense: If you haven’t made the relationship “official” yet If you’re unable to see them in person soon If you’re worried they won’t listen to you or take the news appropriately Reader Poll: We asked 949 wikiHow readers who've ended a short-term relationship, and 64% of them agreed that the best way to end the relationship is by breaking up by text.

      "content": "Tell them how much you loved spending time with them. While it won’t make them feel all the way better, it can soften the blow of a breakup just a little bit. Start your text out with something nice, like: [1] X Research source “Hey Amber! I really enjoyed spending time with you last week.” “Hi John, I’ve had a lovely time on our dates so far.”"

Say something like: “I just can’t see us working out long-term. We want different things, so it’s probably best we go our separate ways.” Or, “I don’t think we’re a match since we’re at different stages right now, but I wish you luck out there!”"

That way, they’ll feel better about themselves and the breakup. Try something like: [3] X Research source “I just got out of a long-term thing, and so I’m not in a good emotional place to date right now.” “I’m overwhelmed with work and school right now, and I don’t have the time to commit to someone.”"

Be clear about your reasoning, and don’t leave any room for questions.

You can cut off your relationship by saying something like: [6] X Research source “I’m just not sure I see this lasting long-term. It seems like we have different goals in life, so I’m not sure we’d work out.” “You have super cool life plans, but I can’t see myself in them. It might be best if we part ways now.”"

Just because you weren’t feeling a connection doesn’t mean you’re a bad person.
