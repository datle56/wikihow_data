Newer Dreamcasts have changes made to the way discs are read which prevents backed up games from playing. On the bottom of the Dreamcast, look for a number in a circle near the word PAL or NTSC. If the number is 0 or 1 you can play burned games. If the number is 2 or higher, you cannot play burned games."
