You may think, “Sarah adores me, so I must be fabulous” or “At least I’m invited to all the parties.” Truth is, you should feel great about yourself regardless of who your friends are or how many you have. Learn to validate yourself instead of needing others to do it. [1] X Research source For example, if you have always counted on friends to help you make big decisions, try to make a decision on your own by weighing pros and cons. If you think being needed by your friends makes you important, find other ways to feel important, such as reciting positive affirmations or volunteering."
