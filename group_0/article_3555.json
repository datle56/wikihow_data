      "content": "Understand what differentiates Hare Krishna and Hinduism. Hare Krishna is a nickname for the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). It is a formal organization based on Gaudiya Vaishnava form of Hinduism. They key distinguishing feature is that Hare Krishnas believe in Lord Krishna as the Supreme Personality of the Godhead. In other words, Krishna is the supreme ruler over everything. [1] X Research source While most Hindus are polytheistic (belief in many Gods), Hare Krishnas are monotheistic (belief in one God). While Hare Krishna is based on beliefs that are thousands of years old, ISKCON was formally founded in 1965 by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Krishna Consciousness is a key part of the Hare Krishna movement. It refers to a state of awareness in which devoted followers are in perfect harmony with Lord Krishna. There is no formal “baptism” or anything for Hare Krishna. If you live the lifestyle and follow the tenets of the faith, you’re a member of the religion."
