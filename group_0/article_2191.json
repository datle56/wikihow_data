When you start work for the first time, the Starter Checklist, Form P46, is used to calculate the amount of taxes that will be withheld from your paychecks.

If you don't provide enough information on your Starter Checklist for HMRC to determine the right amount of withholding, you may have to pay emergency tax temporarily. Once your code is determined, your rate will be adjusted so that you get back what you've overpaid."
