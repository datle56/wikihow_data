Just be on the lookout for things that the person says during the course of a casual conversation to see if it can lead to some common ground, such as a favorite sports team, band, or even the fact that you and the person both have five siblings. [1] X Expert Source Candice Mostisser Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 24 January 2020. The key here is to really listen to people and to see if you can spot something that can help you bond. You don’t need to ask the person fifty questions to find common ground, either; let it come up naturally during the course of a conversation. You may think that you and the person you’re talking to have nothing in common, but just one or two things that you can talk about can really help you connect. It can be a favorite obscure author, the fact that you both randomly grew up ten miles from each other, or the fact that you both speak Japanese. Don’t get discouraged if you feel like the two of you couldn’t be more different, at first."

This means that you should find something about them that is truly admirable and make them feel good about themselves without overdoing it too much. [2] X Expert Source Candice Mostisser Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 24 January 2020. You don’t want to sound like you’re sucking up, but like you’re genuinely admiring them. Just giving one good compliment per conversation will do just fine. As long as you avoid complimenting physical attributes or overly personal subjects, you won’t be coming on too strong. Here are some sample compliments you can give: “You’re so good at talking to new people. How do you do it?” “Those earrings are so unique. Where did you get them?” “I’m so impressed that you can juggle being a parent and working full-time. I don’t think I could do that.” “I saw your tennis match yesterday. You have a killer serve!”"

If the last time you hung out with your friend, she was talking about a big job interview coming up or about a new guy she was really excited about, then you better make sure to follow up about it when you see her next, or even to text her asking how it’s going. You want people to feel like you actually care about what they tell you and that you remember it even when you’re not together. If your friend has to bring up that important thing you were talking about last time and you have to say, “Oh, right, how did that go?” then it looks like you didn’t really care that much to begin with. Your friends need you to support and care about them, and if you want to really connect with them, then you have to ask about the important things in their lives. This can even help you strengthen a bond with an acquaintance who may be pleasantly surprised when you ask about something he mentioned the last time."

Don’t be judgmental about what they say, give them confused looks, or generally act like there’s something wrong with the person. Also, don’t stand at a distance or look like you’re not really paying attention; make people feel safe and happy to be talking to you, and you’ll be able to connect with them much more easily. Work on exuding warmth and positive energy and letting people feel like they can tell you anything and will feel safe. If they get the feeling that you’re criticising them deep down or that you’ll share what they tell you with your five closest friends, then you won’t be able to connect with them.

Some people aren’t able to connect with others because they are too guarded or too afraid to really be vulnerable with other people. You don’t want people to think that you’re too closed off or too private; though you don’t have to let them know every little thing about yourself, as you get to know people, you should work on revealing some personal information so they feel that you’re more human and that they can really connect with you.

Make sure people feel appreciated and be honest and open about how much they mean to you. Even if you’re just thanking a coworker for giving you a helpful piece of advice or thanking your neighbor for looking after your cat, making an effort to truly show gratitude can really help you connect with people. Don’t just say “Thanks!” or send a thank-you text. Take the time to look the person in the eye, to say the word “thank you,” and to elaborate on why what this person did really meant so much to you. Research also shows that thanking people will make you feel happier and will make both you and them more likely to help people in the future. Everybody wins!"

      "content": "Make an effort to continue your relationships. Though it may sound obvious, many people aren’t able to truly connect with people because they don’t follow up and continue their relationships with them, even if they do truly like the person. This is either because of laziness, shyness, or because people feel like they’re too busy to hang out with too many people. But if you really want to connect with people, then you have to be willing to put in more than half an hour’s worth of small talk. If you feel like you’ve really connected with someone, invite that person to a low-key hangout, such as grabbing a drink or getting coffee. Don’t be a flake. If people invite you somewhere, then you should follow through or have a good excuse if you don’t. If you develop a reputation for being a flake, then people won’t want to hang out with you. Though it’s important to get alone time, if you never put yourself out there, then you won’t ever be able to build your relationships. Make an effort to be social at least 2-3 days a week, even if it just means grabbing lunch with someone."

[7] X Expert Source Maria Avgitidis Matchmaker & Dating Expert Expert Interview. 20 December 2019 If you really want to connect with people, then you have to work on being present in the conversation. If you’re already thinking about what you’re going to have for dinner or whom you’re going to talk to next, then the person you’re talking to will know and won’t like you any more for it. Work on making eye contact, really listening to what the person is saying, avoiding your phone or people walking by, and making the person see that you’re only focused on being in the moment. Working on being fully present in a conversation can make you feel more able to enjoy the moment you’re in and will therefore make you a better conversationalist.

Though you can break eye contact occasionally so the conversation doesn’t feel too intense, you don’t want the person to think you have other things on your mind.

There’s nothing that will make a person feel more insignificant than saying, “What was your name again?” or “I just can’t seem to ever remember your name…” and if you really want to connect with new people, then you should not only remember their names, but use them.

You may think that small talk is meaningless and only meant for people who want to make superficial connections, but making good small talk will actually allow you to make real connections and build toward deeper relationships with people. When you start connecting with people you know, you don’t talk about the meaning of life or how your life was affected by your grandmother’s death right away; you first ease into a more serious relationship by talking about lighthearted subjects and getting to know people little by little. Here are some tips for making great small talk: Use simple topics to transition into deeper conversation. You can casually comment that there was perfect weather over the weekend and then ask your conversational partner whether he did anything fun to take advantage of it. Ask questions that are open-ended instead of ones that can be answered with a simple “yes” or “no” to keep the conversation going. Notice your environment. If you see a flyer for an awesome concert on campus, you can ask the person you’re talking to whether he’s going or what he thinks of the band. Keep things lighthearted. You don’t want to turn someone off by talking about dark or intense topics too soon."

People like to feel happy and upbeat more than they like to feel sad or upset; it’s only logical that people are much more likely to connect with you and to want to spend more time around you if you keep things positive and work on talking about the things that excite you and make you happy. Though everyone likes to complain, you should focus on being positive and complaining a bit when you know the person, if you really need to. You want to send of positive energy that makes other people feel more positive around you; this will make it much easier for you to connect with people than being sad or angry the whole time. If you catch yourself making a negative comment, try to counter it with two positive comments so people still think of you as upbeat. This doesn’t mean you have to change your entire personality or fool anyone.
