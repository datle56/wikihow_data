      "title": "Accept full responsibility.",
      "content": "Accept full responsibility. The first step to apologizing is to take responsibility for your actions. Take accountability for what occurred (even if it means not putting yourself in the best light). Set your own prejudices aside to show your friend you’re truly sorry. [1] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source Try saying something like, “I know I really let you down when I didn’t go to your birthday party. I know how much it meant to you.” As another example: “I am so sorry that I kissed your crush last week. I don't know what I was thinking, and I've been kicking myself over it ever since. Your friendship means way more to me than him.”"

      "title": "Acknowledge what they may be feeling.",
      "content": "Acknowledge what they may be feeling. Round out your apology by expressing an understanding of your friend’s feelings. No matter what happened, it’s important to acknowledge that they’ve been hurt. Show that you’re aware of how your actions made them feel. [2] X Research source Licensed Clinical Psychologist Gera Anderson says, \"Acknowledge their feelings and any actions that may have led to those feelings. If you regret your actions, apologize for them. If you don't, apologize that your actions hurt them. For example, “I'm sorry that my actions made you angry; that wasn't my intent.”\" [3] X Expert Source Gera Anderson, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 18 October 2021. You could say something like, “I can’t imagine how disappointed you were when I didn’t show up to your party. You’d been planning it for so long, and I know you wanted it to be perfect.” Or perhaps, “I know you were incredibly hurt when I kissed him. You’ve had a crush on him for months and must have been heartbroken.”"

      "title": "Express what you’re sorry for.",
      "content": "Express what you’re sorry for. The next step is to apologize for what you’re taking responsibility for. The words “I’m sorry” on their own don’t carry much weight, but when paired with a reason, they can mean the world to your friend. Make eye contact with them, and start your apology with “I’m really that I…” And then reiterate what you possibly did to upset them. [4] X Research source Clinical Psychologist William Gardner says, \"When in doubt, say, “I am really sorry that what I said upset you.” This apology acknowledges that something you did hurt someone you care about and clarifies that hurting them wasn’t your intention. You’re taking responsibility, even if what occurred wasn’t intentional.\" [5] X Expert Source William Gardner, PsyD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 25 July 2019. Avoid inserting your friend into the apology. Instead, focus on “I” statements that keep the blame on you. For example, you might say, “I’m really sorry I wasn’t there to celebrate and see all the hard work you put in.” As another example: “It was wrong of me to kiss him, and I’m truly sorry. The last thing I wanted to do was hurt you.”"

      "title": "Tell them that you won’t make the same mistake twice.",
      "content": "Tell them that you won’t make the same mistake twice. Show your friend that their friendship means a lot to you by promising not to make a similar mistake again. Just remember, actions speak louder than words, so go through with your promises. [6] X Research source Try weaving your promise into your apology by saying something like, “I missed your birthday party. I shouldn't have done that. I made a commitment to you and dropped it, but I won't take my promises so lightly again.” Or, “I don’t know what got into me, and I’m so sorry I kissed him. Our friendship is more important to me than any romantic relationship.”"

      "content": "Find a way to make it up to them. See what you can do to lift your friend’s spirits and prove that you’re genuinely sorry for what happened. This might look like taking them out to dinner, treating them to a movie, spending more time with them, or simply butting out every once in a while. [7] X Research source Add this into your apology by saying something like, “I'll never flake on you again. When I say I'll be somewhere, I'll be there. Can I make it up to you by taking you out to a special birthday dinner?” Or perhaps, “I know how much your crushes mean to you, and I won't interfere with your romantic life again.”"

      "title": "Ask for forgiveness.",
      "content": "Ask for forgiveness. Let your friend speak honestly, and if they need space, give it to them. Remember, just because you give a sincere apology doesn’t mean they’re obligated to forgive you. As Shahbazyan explains, “The amount of hurt and pain someone can cause another person is very subjective.” [8] X Expert Source Michelle Shahbazyan, MS, MA Life Coach Expert Interview. 18 March 2020. So, be patient and accepting of however they respond. Avoid phrases like, “Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?” as this can come across as passive-aggressive. Let your friend speak for what’s in their heart themselves."

      "content": "Aim to apologize in person whenever possible. Making a face-to-face apology can mean so much more than an apology over the phone or through text message. So, if possible, ask your friend if you can meet up and talk things through. [9] X Research source If you live far away from your friend, that’s okay! Apologizing over the phone or through a text doesn’t make your apology any less sincere. However, do your best to plan a face-to-face conversation soon."

      "content": "Understand what you’re apologizing for before you apologize. Take some time to really think about what happened and whether or not you’re remorseful. Put yourself in your friend’s shoes—what occurred that hurt them? Are you truly sorry for it? Doing a bit of soul-searching before making your apology can help you come across as sincere and genuinely apologetic. [11] X Research source Try writing in a journal to process your thoughts and understand your emotions. Chat with a third party (a therapist or trusted friend) to talk things through or even practice your apology. At the end of the day, don’t apologize if you don’t really mean it. As Shahbazyan puts it, “The most important part of apologizing is being genuine.” [12] X Expert Source Michelle Shahbazyan, MS, MA Life Coach Expert Interview. 18 March 2020."
