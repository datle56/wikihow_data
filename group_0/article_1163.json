      "content": "Shorten the sleeves. For a t-shirt, you will only need to adjust the length of your sleeves. Line up the t-shirt sleeves so that the shoulder seams are lined up. Then, use a piece of chalk to trace ½” (1.3 cm) from the end of the well-fitting sleeve. Cut off the excess, and then fold over the end of your sleeve by ½” (1.3 cm) all the way around the sleeve opening. This will be the new hemline for your t-shirt sleeve. [3] X Research source"

Start at the bottom of the shirt and trace ½” (1.3 cm) from the edges of the well-fitting shirt on both sides. This will provide some extra fabric for your seam allowance. [5] X Research source Tuck in the sleeves on your well-fitting shirt all the way to the sleeve seam. This is where the shoulder and sleeve meet on your shirt. Do not trace around the sleeves.
