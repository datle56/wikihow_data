      "content": "Remove the face panel. The front cover, or face panel, is the plastic or metal grate secured to the front of your AC unit. It’s typically secured with screws, clips, and/or tabs, so refer to your owner’s manual to remove it properly. Removing the cover allows you to easily access the filter and coils. [2] X Research source On some models, the filter is housed inside the face panel. If this is the case, refer to your owner’s manual for instructions on how to remove the filter before cleaning the face panel. Put on some cleaning gloves, safety goggles, and a face mask, especially if you have dust allergies."

Spray down the face panel and wipe it clean with a soft cloth. Set it aside to dry while you clean the rest of the unit. [3] X Research source Alternatively, take the face panel outside and spray it down with a hose. Do not use alcohol, as this is flammable and could start a fire. Do not use bleach, as those fumes are toxic and bleach could damage the unit. While safer than bleach or alcohol, hydrogen peroxide should still be clearly labeled and kept out of the reach of children."

If it’s particularly dirty, try vacuuming it to remove large pieces of dust and debris. Then, wipe it with a soft, damp cloth and rinse it with fresh water. Set it aside to dry, flipping it halfway through the drying process so it dries evenly. [4] X Research source The filter must be completely dry before you reinstall it in your air conditioner. Feel free to take the filter outside and rinse it with a hose. Some filters cannot be reused and should instead be replaced. Refer to your owner’s manual to see if this is the case for you. In general, filters should be cleaned once a month and replaced every 3 months."

      "content": "Vacuum and clean the AC’s coils and interior. Use a soft brush or fin comb to brush any dirt and debris off of the air conditioner’s evaporator coils. Gently vacuum the AC’s interior with a brush attachment , then spray the coils with your cleaning solution. Wipe them with a clean cloth and let them dry completely before reassembling the unit. [5] X Research source Place a drip tray underneath the unit to catch any drips, which might otherwise bleach carpet, fabric, or wood. When vacuuming, be sure to clean the entire interior, including the drain pan at the bottom of the unit, the fan and blower in the middle, the evaporator in the front, and the condenser in the back. Belavus says, “Make sure to clean [the] drain pan after coil cleaning. It’s connected to your drain line, and it can easily clog, causing leaks and water damage.” [6] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 6 May 2020."

If you can easily access the back of your air conditioner (the part outside the window), clean the exterior and the condenser coils with a soft brush. Remove any leaves or debris and wipe the unit down. If it isn’t safe to do this, like if you’re not on the first floor, skip this step. [7] X Research source Consider using an AC coil spray cleaner or condensed air on the condenser coils. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to apply it correctly. At this time, examine the unit’s condenser fins (the thin metal slats on the AC’s exterior) to see if any are bent. If they are, carefully insert a fin comb or knife between the bent fins and run it parallel with the fins until they’re straight. This is optional. Belavus says to clean condenser coils, “Mix warm water and a simple detergent in a spray bottle, hand sprayer, or garden sprayer. Apply the water and detergent solution to the [condenser] coils. Give the solution 10-15 minutes to soak in and loosen debris. Then, spray the coil with water to loosen any dirt that’s caked on.

Dirty or clogged filters can significantly reduce the unit’s efficiency. If the filter is particularly dirty, replace it with a clean one, and replace filters in general every 3 months. The frequency at which AC filters need to be cleaned or replaced depends on how often they’re used and the air quality in your home.

If your filter is worn or torn, replace it. If the filter is designed specifically for your unit, identify your model number and order a new one online or from your unit’s manufacturer. If your unit has a universal AC filter , purchase a cut-to-fit air conditioner filter online or at your local home improvement store. Belavus recommends “using replaceable filters for your air conditioner” and says, “if you have a washable filter, vacuum it first to remove all big particles. [Then], mix 30 g of citric acid with 1 liter of water and submerge [the] filter for 15 minutes. [Then] wash with water.” [12] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 6 May 2020."

It isn’t necessary to deep clean your window air conditioner monthly, but quickly cleaning its exterior can help maintain it and keep it running smoothly. Dust it once a week to remove any debris that may have accumulated on the front of the unit, and wipe it down about once a month to remove more stubborn debris.

Just be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions to make sure you clean it properly. [17] X Research source If you really want to deep clean your unit, take it out of the window and place it outside. Remove the casing according to your owner’s manual.

      "content": "How do you remove mold from a window air conditioner? Put on rubber gloves, goggles, and an N-95 mask , and remove the AC from the window according to your owner’s manual. Disassemble the unit, and vacuum as much dirt and debris from the interior as possible. Spray a mold cleaner, like 3% hydrogen peroxide on the mold, and scrub until it’s completely removed . Rinse the parts with clean water and let everything dry completely before reassembling. [19] X Research source If possible, replace the filter instead of just cleaning it. If you have to reuse the old filter, spray it with your mold cleaner and let it soak in warm water and dish soap for 15 minutes before scrubbing it with a scrub brush. It may be better to throw out a moldy window unit and get a new one. Belavus says, “Molds require a wet environment to thrive, and [an] air conditioner, especially with dirty ductwork, is a perfect spot for it. Have your AC units inspected before every cooling season [to prevent mold].” [20] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 6 May 2020."
