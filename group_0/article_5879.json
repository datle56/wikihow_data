In the LGBTQ+ community, wearing a carabiner is often a form of “flagging,” or discreetly communicating your sexual preferences with others in the community.

The carabiner code is often compared to the hanky code, in which gay men indicate their sexual preferences based on the position and color of their hanky.

[2] X Research source Wearing a carabiner on you left side indicates that you’re a top . Wearing a carabiner on your right side indicates that you’re a bottom . Wearing a carabiner toward the center of your body sometimes indicates that you’re a switch . Keep in mind that not everyone follows this part of the code.

      "content": "Lesbians’ connection to carabiners can be traced back to WWII. While the exact origin of the carabiner code is hard to pinpoint, many believe it starts with World War II. When the war broke out, many women began taking over jobs traditionally done by men. Butches and other masc women were pushed into blue collar jobs and began using carabiners for practical reasons, like carrying their keys and tools in the workplace. After the war, women didn’t want to give up their financial freedom, so wearing a carabiner morphed into a symbol of female liberation, masculinity, and eventually, lesbianism. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Alison Bechdel’s memoir made the carabiner code more prominent. In 2006, American cartoonist Alison Bechdel published her graphic memoir, Fun Home, in which she describes her sexual awakening upon seeing a masculine delivery driver with a short haircut and a keyring on her belt loop. While Bechdel didn’t invent the trend of lesbians wearing carabiners or keyrings, she helped bring it to more people’s attention. [5] X Research source Fun Home was even turned into a musical, featuring the song “Ring of Keys,” in which the actress playing Bechdel sings, “Your swagger and your bearing/ And the just right clothes you’re wearing/ Your short hair and your dungarees/ And your lace-up boots/ And your keys, oh/ Your ring of keys.”"

These days, however, a lot of lesbians aren’t aware that the side you wear your carabiner on is supposed to reflect whether you’re a top or bottom. They simply wear carabiners as a form of self-expression or for convenience. Some lesbians view the carabiner code as an outdated stereotype that implies all lesbians are masculine."

      "content": "Popular TikTok videos helped spread awareness of the carabiner code. While the carabiner code has been used in some lesbian subcultures for years, not all lesbians or members of the LGBTQ+ community know it exists, especially if they’re younger or don’t know many other people in the community. However, in recent years, the carabiner code has gone viral on TikTok, giving people new ways to express themselves and their sexuality. In general, the TikTok videos are playful, like Poppy Laur’s video where she uses a set of nail clippers attached to a carabiner to indicate that she’s gay. The trend also shows that lesbians don’t have to fit certain stereotypes for their sexuality to be valid. For example, lislynn13’s video is captioned “It’s femme lesbian carabiner season,” showing that not all lesbians are butch."

      "content": "Wearing a carabiner doesn’t mean someone is a lesbian. While the carabiner is fairly well-known within the LGBTQ+ community, it isn’t a universally accepted symbol. Many lesbians wear them to express their sexual preferences, but carabiners are also useful accessories for anyone. If someone is wearing one, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re gay. The only way to know someone’s sexual orientation for sure is to ask them."
