      "title": "Put on gloves to protect your hands.",
      "content": "Put on gloves to protect your hands. Wear vinyl or latex gloves when you check for bedbugs. This can protect your hands from being bitten by live bed bugs and the gloves will prevent you from coming into contact with blood from smashed bed bugs. [1] X Research source If you don't have any gloves around, wrap a plastic bag over your hand before looking for the bed bugs."

      "title": "Identify small bed bugs that are red or brown.",
      "content": "Identify small bed bugs that are red or brown. Adult bed bugs are around 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) long and they have 6 legs. A bed bug that's recently fed on blood will be bright red and round. Once it digests the blood, it will turn a darker brown color and become flat. If the bed bug hasn't fed in a while, it will be a pale brown color. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look for red stains from crushed bed bugs.",
      "content": "Look for red stains from crushed bed bugs. Since bed bugs feed on blood, they can leave behind red or rusty stains if they get smashed. The color may be bright red if the bed bug was recently crushed or the stain may be dark if the bed bug was smashed a while ago. [3] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source The stains might look like single drops of blood or there will be smears and streaks."

    {
      "title": "Check for bed bug eggs and excrement.",
      "content": "Check for bed bug eggs and excrement. Bed bug excrement will look like very small black spots (about this size: •). The excrement can stain the fabric that's underneath it, so you may see dark streaks as well. You should also look for small pale white eggs that are around 1 millimetre (0.10 cm) in size. [4] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source You may also see pale skins that the bed bug nymphs shed as they grow larger."

      "title": "Strip the sheets and check the linen.",
      "content": "Strip the sheets and check the linen. Remove the bedspread, comforter, or duvet and shake it out before you look for signs of bed bugs. Then carefully pull off the sheets and mattress protector. Go slowly so any bed bugs don't fly off of the sheets into the room. [5] X Research source If you have a mattress protector that's designed to stop bed bug infestations, check the protector near any seams, zippers, or gaps."

      "title": "Look closely at the mattress and bed frame.",
      "content": "Look closely at the mattress and bed frame. Get help to pull the bed away from the wall. Inspect the seams of the mattress and then flip the mattress over. You might see bed bugs crawling away as you do this. Try to lift the mattress up so you can also check the bed frame and its joints.

Pay attention to excrement or blood stains from bed bugs."

      "title": "Check between the cushions and underneath furniture.",
      "content": "Check between the cushions and underneath furniture. Since bed bugs like to live where people rest for extended periods of time, look at recliners, chairs, and couches. Pay attention to the folds between cushions and remove any large cushions so you can look at the furniture's frame. You'll also need to tip the furniture over so you can examine underneath it."

      "title": "Move the furniture so you can look along the perimeter of the room.",
      "content": "Move the furniture so you can look along the perimeter of the room. If you have large furniture, such as a bed or couch, push them to the middle of the room. Then get down to the floor and run a credit card along the baseboards. Bed bugs can squeeze into the gap between the baseboards and walls so the card will help push them out. [7] X Research source If you have molding near the top of the walls or windows, get up on a ladder and check it for bed bugs too."

      "content": "Inspect the folds of fabric curtains. Bed bugs are more likely to be near the bottom of the curtains, but they can also crawl up to the top. Pull open the curtains so you can look into the folds where they may be hiding. [8] X Research source Remember to look behind the curtains as well. They might be behind the curtains where the fabric brushes the baseboards. Other readers who've been in the same situation are sharing their stories on the wikiHow forum.

Then crouch down and shine the flashlight up at the bottom of the desk, table, or dresser.

      "content": "Inspect hiding places in electrical items. If the room is heavily infested with bed bugs, they may hide in the crevices around electrical items. Remove electrical outlet covers and look behind them. You should also check near lamp or computer cords and inside wall-mounted lamps. [10] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Bed bugs can actually use electrical outlets to travel to other rooms. If you find bed bugs in 1 outlet, you must check the other rooms in your house or hotel."

      "content": "Peel back loose wallpaper and look behind it. Gently pull loose wallpaper or peeling paint away from the wall and look for bed bugs. You should also remove any picture frames or mirrors and check behind them. Bed bugs can hide in the joints of mirrors or frames.

If you suspect a severe infestation, lay a white sheet on the floor. Then take clothes out of baskets or the closet and shake them over the sheet. Check the sheet for bed bugs, excrement, or eggs.
