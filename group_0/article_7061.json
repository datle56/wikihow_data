Your processor model and speed will be displayed. The speed is measured in gigahertz (GHz). This is the speed of a single core of your processor. If your processor has multiple cores (most modern processors do), each core will be this speed. If your processor is overclocked, the actual speed may not be shown here. See the overclocking section for details on finding your actual overclocked speed."
