      "content": "Choose your type of saline. Nasal saline drops and sprays have both been shown to be effective in clearing mucus, reducing congestion, and improving breathing. The choice between drops or spray comes down to which your child tolerates better. The type of saline mixture that works best, on the other hand, depends on the nature of your baby's stuffy nose: [1] X Research source Isotonic solutions have the same salt concentration as human blood and cells. They are better for children suffering from colds or allergies. You can purchase them, or to make your own, combine 1 cup of warm sterilized water with ½ a teaspoon of salt and a pinch of baking soda. Hypertonic solutions have a higher concentration of salt than the average human blood and cells. They are better for children with chronic congestion. You can purchase them, or to make your own, combine 1 cup of warm sterilized water with 1.25 teaspoons of salt and ¼ teaspoon of baking soda. Hypotonic solutions have a lower concentration of salt than human blood and cells. They usually aren't effective at reducing nasal symptoms."
