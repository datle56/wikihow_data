    {
      "title": "Bring a waterproofed tent when you know it’ll rain.",
      "content": "Bring a waterproofed tent when you know it’ll rain. Have a tent with a rain fly that overhangs it so that rainwater drips off the sides. Good rain tents are also treated with waterproofing polyurethane or another product. [1] X Research source Getting a tent with a vestibule is also helpful. The vestibule can be used to air out damp clothing so you don’t drag water into the rest of the tent. Read the labels carefully to make sure the tent has these features."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seal an old tent’s seams with a waterproof coating.",
      "content": "Seal an old tent’s seams with a waterproof coating. Order a seam sealer online and let it dry over any loose seams. Then pick up a waterproof spray wherever camping gear is sold and spray the entire tent. Many store-bought tents aren't completely sealed and should be treated this way. You can test a tent for leaks by either spraying the tent with a hose or holding parts of the tent underwater while looking for bubbles or leaks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set up the tent on high ground.",
      "content": "Set up the tent on high ground. Take a look around your campsite before you set up the tent. Pick a spot that’s elevated, away from any slopes or hills. Avoid camping under heavy tree branches that could fall in a storm. Also, look around for any signs of previous flooding, such as narrow canyons and valleys. [2] X Research source Stay aware of your surroundings. Avoid those narrow areas and also be aware of the water levels of nearby rivers. Avoid camping at the highest geographical point when there’s lightning."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a tarp over the tent.",
      "content": "Place a tarp over the tent. Hoist the tarp over your tent on poles or by tying rope between trees. Make sure the tarp is angled so the rainwater runs off the sides, away from your tent. If you have to pitch a tent in the rain, put up a tarp first to protect your camping spot. [3] X Research source You can bring multiple tarps and set them up over other areas, such as a dining area, too. Then you won’t be stuck in your tent during the storm."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a ground tarp inside your tent.",
      "content": "Place a ground tarp inside your tent. Lay the groundsheet inside your tent on the floor. Avoid placing it outside, under the tent, since water can get on top of it. Also make sure the ends aren’t sticking out and letting rain slide into your dry space. [4] X Research source You may also lay a second tarp near the tent’s entrance to use as a doormat and storage spot for wet clothing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid digging ditches around the tent.",
      "content": "Avoid digging ditches around the tent. Newer models of tents don’t leak and digging damages the campsite. It should only be attempted if your campsite is gravel or sand. You can then dig a small moat all the way around your tent to protect it like a castle. [5] X Research source If you have to dig in dirt, dig a very shallow ditch and slope it so the water runs away from your tent."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ventilate your tent to avoid water build-up.",
      "content": "Ventilate your tent to avoid water build-up. Open up your door and any ventilation features in your tent that aren’t at risk of letting water in. Living in your tent causes moisture from your breath to condense, in addition to any water you bring in from the outside, so ventilation is important. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pack an extra set of water-resistant clothing.",
      "content": "Pack an extra set of water-resistant clothing. Quick-drying synthetic fibers like nylon are ideal. Avoid cotton clothing, since you’ll be cold and clammy as you wait hours for them to dry. Be sure to pack at least one extra set so you’ll always have something dry to wear. [7] X Research source Merino wool is a good choice for additional warmth. Avoid regular wool, since it dries slowly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring a raincoat or poncho.",
      "content": "Bring a raincoat or poncho. If you have to go outside, you’ll need a water-resistant outer layer. Ponchos are great for when you’re walking around camp. If you’re going to be in the rain a lot or near bodies of water, get a jacket that’s labeled water-repellent and has a breathable lining like Gore-tex. [8] X Research source Raincoats can be refreshed with the same polyurethane or wax coating that you use on the tents."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pack a pair of water-resistant camp shoes.",
      "content": "Pack a pair of water-resistant camp shoes. A pair of sandals or flip-flops are perfect to wear around camp. Put away your regular shoes or boots until the rain stops. They take ages to dry and there’s nothing worse than walking around in damp boots. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring a synthetic sleeping bag to resist moisture.",
      "content": "Bring a synthetic sleeping bag to resist moisture. Synthetic sleeping bags dry faster than down sleeping bags. The down ones may be warmer, but they’re no use when wet. You can bring additional layers of clothing or blankets to provide extra warmth when using a synthetic bag. [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Set up a quick-lighting stove for warmth and cooking.",
      "content": "Set up a quick-lighting stove for warmth and cooking. A warm drink or meal is great during bad weather, but you can’t depend on wood fires. Get a small wood or gas stove that’s easy to light and bring along some stormproof matches or a lighter. [11] X Research source Campfires are also fine, but should never be placed near a tent or tarp. You can keep a fire smoldering by covering the embers with logs until the rain passes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pack important gear in plastic bags.",
      "content": "Pack important gear in plastic bags. Plastic bags are water-resistant, so they’re one of the most useful things you can bring. Use large trash bags to store clothing, sleeping bags, and campfire fuel. Smaller sandwich bags are useful for sealing away important documents, money, and electronics. [12] X Research source Dry bags function the same way but are more expensive. You can get them wherever camping gear is sold."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move all of your gear out of the rain.",
      "content": "Move all of your gear out of the rain. Anything exposed to rain is going to take a long time to dry or clean. Obviously you never want wet clothing, but even items like your cooking set will get very dirty. No matter how waterproof you think they are, get them out of the rain. [13] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use newspaper and quick-dry towels to soak up moisture.",
      "content": "Use newspaper and quick-dry towels to soak up moisture. Pack some newspaper and towels for whenever you need to mop up rainwater. The towels can be used to wipe down tables and other surfaces, while newspapers are absorbent and can also be used as a fire starter. [14] X Research source One way to use newspapers is to place them in wet shoes and other clothing to help soak up the moisture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring foods that don’t require cooking.",
      "content": "Bring foods that don’t require cooking. Nuts, energy bars, and jerky are some good snack foods to get you through the rains. Sandwich-making supplies like bread and peanut butter also work. While cooking in the rain is possible, these foods can save you a lot of effort and spare you a soaking. [15] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Plan some fun activities you can do at camp.",
      "content": "Plan some fun activities you can do at camp. Bring along some books, a deck of cards, board games, drawing materials, or anything else that’ll keep you busy. Make sure you’re having fun while you’re stuck waiting for the rain to pass. You could sing or take turns telling stories, too. Keep children busy by playing games, doing coloring activities, or telling stories, especially if the storm will scare them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Air out your gear before packing it away.",
      "content": "Air out your gear before packing it away. Take down the tent first, removing the rain fly and tarp later, if possible. You will most likely need to pack away your gear before it fully dries. Pitch your tent as soon as you get to the next area. Leave your clothing, sleeping bag, and other dampened gear out in the sunlight to dry. [16] X Research source Wet gear can lead to mold or mildew, so it’s important to dry it out as soon as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Collect rainwater by leaving out open bottles.",
      "content": "Collect rainwater by leaving out open bottles. Put your pots, pans, water bottles, and other gear outside as soon as the rain begins. You may also set up a tarp to funnel water into one of these objects. Many people forget to drink adequate amounts of water when the rain starts, and you’ll need to do this if you can’t get back to civilization before you run out. [17] X Research source Always purify the water with a filter, if possible. Avoid collecting water running off of trees or rocks. This water is already dirty."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep cooking fires away from the tent and tarps.",
      "content": "Keep cooking fires away from the tent and tarps. Open flames should never be near tents or tarps. Set your stove outside the door of your tent or under a tarp, making sure the tarp is elevated far above the flames. Never cook inside the tent, since it’ll put you at risk for fires and carbon monoxide poisoning. [18] X Research source If an emergency forces you to cook inside the tent, do it at the entrance with the tent’s flaps pulled as far away as possible."

    {
      "title": "Warm up anyone who seems to be suffering from hypothermia.",
      "content": "Warm up anyone who seems to be suffering from hypothermia . Hypothermia is a serious health hazard and must be treated immediately. Get the person out of wet clothing. Cover them with any warm clothing, blankets, and sleeping bags you have. If possible, get them medical attention right away. [19] X Research source Hypothermia is a loss of body heat, so look for signs of constant shivering, hyperventilating, tiredness, and pale skin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay away from rocks or other slippery ground.",
      "content": "Stay away from rocks or other slippery ground. Wet rocks, muddy trails, and grassy or mossy slopes all become more dangerous in the rain. Avoid them as much as possible, whether you’re hiking or walking around in camp. Wait for them to dry before you begin hiking again. [20] X Research source Be sure to wear hiking boots with plenty of ankle support when around these areas."
