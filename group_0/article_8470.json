      "content": "Mix a cleaning solution of warm water and a neutral pH cleaner . Put 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water in a mop bucket and add 2–4 fluid ounces (59–118 ml) of a neutral PH cleaner. Stir the solution with your mop until it’s thoroughly mixed together. [3] X Research source In a pinch, you can also use mild liquid dish detergent to clean your rubber gym floor. Just check the label to make sure the dish detergent doesn’t have any moisturizers or additives. Avoid using harsh cleaners, such as bleach, vinegar, and commercial cleaners like Pine-Sol since they can damage and eat away at the rubber over time."

Work your way towards the entrance to the room so you don’t have to walk over any flooring you’ve already cleaned. [5] X Research source Apply enough cleaning solution so the floor is damp but not soaking wet. Excess water could soak into the rubber and cause damage more easily. Empty the bucket and refill it with fresh cleaning solution once the water turns brown or grey. Avoid using any textured or abrasive mop scrubbers since they could scratch your rubber floors."

      "content": "Let the solution sit on the rubber flooring for 5–10 minutes. Rather than mopping up the cleaner right away, let your gym floor sit with the cleaning solution for a few minutes. That way, it has time to kill any germs and bacteria that are still left on the surface. If you notice the cleaner starting to dry, move on to the next step and rinse the cleaner off. If the cleaner fully dries on your floors, it could ruin your rubber floors over time."

      "content": "Use an auto-scrubber with soft bristles. An auto-scrubber is a machine with a rotating scrubbing pad that dispenses and vacuums water. Make sure the scrubber has a soft-bristled pad rather than an abrasive one so you don’t leave scratches or scuff marks on your rubber flooring. [9] X Research source Auto-scrubbers cost anywhere from $85 USD for a small, personal machine best for home gyms, to over $1,000 USD for an industrial-performance machine meant for larger commercial gyms. You may be able to rent an auto-scrubber from a hardware store if you don’t have one of your own."

Pour warm water into the tank up to the fill line on the scrubber. Then, add about 4–6 fluid ounces (120–180 ml) of your neutral pH cleaner so you can kill germs and bacteria deeper in the rubber floors.

[10] X Research source Since the auto-scrubber has a built-in vacuum, it won’t leave behind any water or cleaner so it’s safe to walk on the surfaces you already cleaned.
