      "title": "Isaiah 49:15",
      "content": "Isaiah 49:15 \"Can a woman forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you!\" Isaiah chapter 49 is a promise from God that He will protect the nation of Israel and that He has not forgotten His people. He compares His care for Israel to one of the closest bonds known to man—a mother caring for her infant. He says that even if a mother forgot her child, He will still remember his people."

      "title": "Isaiah 66:13",
      "content": "Isaiah 66:13 “As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem.” [1] X Research source In this verse, God promises to care for His people warmly and lovingly, in the same tender way a mother might care for a child who’s sad or hurt. Motherhood is used metaphorically throughout this chapter—Isaiah 66:8–9 says, “Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children.”"

      "title": "Ezekiel 19:2",
      "content": "Ezekiel 19:2 “And say: ‘What a lioness was your mother among the lions! She lay down among them and reared her cubs.’” [2] X Research source In Ezekiel Chapter 19, God asks Ezekiel to mourn for the princes of Israel. This lamentation opens by comparing the kingdom of Israel to a lioness, illustrating the strength and power of both the nation and mothers in general. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Ezekiel 19:10–11",
      "content": "Ezekiel 19:10–11 “Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard planted by the waters; it was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water. Its branches were strong, fit for a ruler’s scepter.” [4] X Research source Ezekiel 19 continues the metaphor of Israel as a mother, comparing her to a vine that produced powerful branches (leaders). But this passage can also be interpreted as praise for godly mothers who raise their children according to God’s word (the “abundant water” in verse 10)."

      "title": "John 16:21",
      "content": "John 16:21 \"A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.\" In this verse, Jesus compares his upcoming death and resurrection to the beautiful love a mother has for her new child—his death will be painful, but when he is resurrected, that pain will be replaced by joy."

      "title": "1 Thessalonians 2:7–8",
      "content": "1 Thessalonians 2:7–8 “We were gentle among you. Just as a nursing mother cares for her children, so we cared for you.” [5] X Research source Thessalonians is a letter from the apostle Paul to the early church of Thessalonica (modern-day Thessaloniki, Greece). In it, he recalls the guidance and care demonstrated by the apostles as they brought the gospel of Jesus to the area, comparing it to a nursing mother lovingly looking after her children. It’s a warm greeting, illustrating how much love there was between the apostles and the Thessalonians."

      "content": "2 Timothy 1:5 “I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.” [6] X Research source This verse shows the importance of being guided by godly women. Timothy’s faith in God helped him become a valuable part of Paul’s ministry, and being raised by his spiritual mother and grandmother undoubtedly laid the foundation for his beliefs.

      "title": "Deuteronomy 6:5–7",
      "content": "Deuteronomy 6:5–7 “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.” In Deuteronomy chapter 6, Moses is speaking to the Hebrew people shortly after giving them the Ten Commandments, instructing them how they were meant to follow God. In this verse, he describes loving God so completely that He should be a part of every aspect of family life, including the conversations you have with your children at home."

Your works are wonderful, I know that full well.\" [8] X Research source This beautiful verse shows that God knows us and loves us before we’re even in our mother’s womb. It can be a cherished encouragement for expecting mothers or reassurance to someone who feels forgotten by God. This idea is echoed in Jeremiah 1:5: “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart, I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”"

She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: “Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.” [11] X Research source Proverbs chapter 31 is an ode to mothers in its own right because it records wise words that King Lemuel learned from his mother (Proverbs 31:1). These verses describe what it means to be a good wife and mother—patient, wise, and hardworking. King Lemuel’s exact identity is not known. Some people believe that he was actually King Solomon, so this wisdom would have been passed to him by his mother Bathsheba, wife of David. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Song of Solomon 8:2 “I would lead you, I would bring you to my mother’s house; she would teach me what to do. I would give you spiced wine to drink, some of my fresh pomegranate juice.” [13] X Research source This passage in Song of Solomon starts in chapter 7, verse 9, and it describes a maiden longing for her love.

I am the Lord your God.”"

In the midst of his pain, he noticed his mother standing nearby, and asked one of his disciples to look after her. This shows the powerful connection that Jesus shared with his mother. It also sets an example for how his followers should provide for family. This disciple is widely believed to be the apostle John, as he refers to himself this way several other times throughout his gospel. [21] X Research source"
