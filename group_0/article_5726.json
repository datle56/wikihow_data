If you're able to delete the Snap before a user has opened it, they'll only see a notification that you deleted a Snap, not the contents. If the user has opened the Snap, you can still delete it to make sure it's no longer in the chat log. Luckily, Snapchat notifies users if a screenshot was taken , so you'll know if the other user has kept evidence of the message on their device."
