With the number .325, in this case, there are three numbers after the decimal point. So, put the number \"325\" over the number 1000, which is really the number 1 with three 0's after it. If you were working with the number .3, which is one number after the decimal points, then you could represent it as 3/10. [2] X Research source You can also say the decimal aloud. In this case .325 = \"325 thousandths.\" That sounds like a fraction! Write .325 = 325/1000."

Find the biggest number that divides evenly into both 325 and 1000. In this case, the GCF of both numbers is 25, because that's the largest number that goes evenly into both numbers. [3] X Research source You don't have to look for the GCF right away. You can also use trial and error to simplify the fractions. For example, if you're working with two even numbers, keep dividing them by 2 until one of them becomes odd or you can't simplify further. If you're working with an even and odd number, try dividing them by 3. If you're working with numbers that end in a 0 or 5, divide them by 5."
