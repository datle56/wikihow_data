      "content": "Acknowledge the pervading spirit. Observe that there is only one all-pervading spirit (known as Akal or Ek Onkaar) that is formless and timeless. It is also almost difficult to know but not impossible. Akal is only realized through self knowledge, Sikhs therefore place emphasis on meditation to understand Akal. Sikhs aim to become one with Akal in order to end the cycle of birth and death, while not withdrawing from society."

Sikhs know Akal through meditation, so they know truth through meditation. Guru Nanak said truth is only attainable through self realization. Self realization thus leads to enlightenment and ends the cycle of birth, death and rebirth."

Sikhs have an optimistic view of life, a spirit of chardi kala. Sikhs also believe that they should defend and protect the rights of others. They should never endorse a class system, sexism, racism, or other stereotypes that support inequality. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Celebrate your faith. Sikhs have a number of festivals. As a Sikh you attend these festivals as a sign of faith and to strengthen faith. Here are some Sikh festivals taken from Wikipedia, though there are more. [5] X Research source Gurpurab are celebrations or commemorations based on the lives of the Sikh Gurus. They tend to be either birthdays or celebrations of Sikh martyrdom. All ten Gurus have Gurpurabs on the Nanakshahi calendar, but it is Guru Nanak Dev and Guru Gobind Singh who have a gurpurab that is widely celebrated in Gurdwaras and Sikh homes. The martyrdoms are also known as a shaheedi Gurpurab, which mark the martyrdom anniversary of Guru Arjan Dev and Guru Tegh Bahadur. Vaisakhi or Baisakhi normally occurs on 13 April and marks rebirth, the beginning of the new spring year and the end of the harvest. Sikhs celebrate it because on Vaisakhi in 1699, Guru Gobind Singh (the tenth guru) laid down the Foundation of the Khalsa as an Independent Sikh Identity. Bandi Chhor Divas celebrates Guru Hargobind's release from the Gwalior Fort, with 52 innocent Hindu kings who were also imprisoned by Jahangir, on 26 October 1619. Hola Mohalla occurs the day after Holi and is when the Khalsa Panth gather at Anandpur Sahib and display their warrior skills, including fighting and riding."
