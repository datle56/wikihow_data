      "content": "Observe your car from the front. With the car on a flat surface, it should appear perfectly level, i.e. both sides being the same height off the surface. If you actually know the specifications of your car's suspension, you can measure the height. If the height is at or below the minimum specs, then you should take the car to a professional for further evaluation and repair. Being at the \"minimum\" is just that. It is no longer at the ideal, and something has changed."

      "content": "Push down on the front of the car to test for weak shock absorbers. This is not a scientific test and is somewhat subjective. But it can be helpful when taken in conjunction with other checks made. Stand in front of the car and carefully place your foot on the bumper, or your knee on a surface that won't dent or bend; it doesn't have to be center. Shift your weight onto that point, pushing the car down. Then quickly remove your foot, or weight. The car should bounce up and return to its original position rather stiffly, without continuing to bounce. If it bounces more than a couple of times, this is an indication that perhaps the shock absorbers are weak. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Visually inspect the struts or shock absorbers. Look for signs of liquid that is or has been running down the shock absorber. If present, then your shock absorbers could be bad. Once the seals begin leaking, the shock absorber becomes ineffective. [2] X Research source You will need to get the car into a garage to confirm your observations and replace the shock absorbers. [3] X Research source Note that you want to get a confirmation that the liquid tracks you observed are indeed emanating from leaking shock absorber seals. It could easily just be something splashed up from the road."
