      "content": "Check the label. The care label is located on the inside of your raincoat near the collar. It includes information provided by the manufacturer on how to clean your raincoat. Once you've read the care label, follow its instructions closely in order to most effectively clean your raincoat. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash your raincoat in the washing machine.",
      "content": "Wash your raincoat in the washing machine. Close all buttons, zippers, and loops on your raincoat, including those on the pockets. If your coat has a removable belt, remove it. Place the raincoat in the washing machine. Add a mild, nontoxic, biodegradable detergent. Set the washing machine to delicate or hand wash and run the cycle with cold water. [2] X Research source If you have a top-loading machine, check the machine's user manual. Waterproof clothing might interfere with the machine's operation. If you use a regular laundry detergent to clean your raincoat, rinse it twice to remove detergent residue. [3] X Research source You might wish to run your raincoat through multiple spin cycles in order to get rid of excess water."

      "title": "Use a synthetic fabric cleaner.",
      "content": "Use a synthetic fabric cleaner. There are a number of products available that are specially designed to clean your raincoat. While specific instructions for use vary with the product you decide to use, you can generally substitute these products for regular laundry detergent. Simply measure the appropriate amount and pour it into the laundry machine along with your raincoat. [4] X Research source Popular products include Nikwax Tech Wash, Atsko's Sport Wash, and ReviveX. When using a synthetic fabric cleaner, you'll probably have to wash the raincoat separately from the rest of your laundry. Check product instructions before using a synthetic fabric cleaner."

      "title": "Dry your coat.",
      "content": "Dry your coat. Hang your coat using a hanger, or lay it flat in a well-ventilated area. It might be possible to place your raincoat in a dryer on low or even medium heat, though you'll have to zip/button it up first. [5] X Research source If placing your raincoat in the dryer, throw in a few towels to absorb excess moisture and soften the coat's impact against the dryer. If you suspect your dryer's low or medium setting is still too high for your raincoat, you could toss an old coat or other garment that you don't care about containing polyester, nylon, or another synthetic fabric into the dryer first to test it. Examine the garment afterwards for flaking or cracks in the material on either the inside or outside. Do not iron your raincoat. The rainproof coating will melt."

      "title": "Spot clean using soapy water.",
      "content": "Spot clean using soapy water. If your raincoat only has a small spill or area that needs cleaning, there's probably no need to subject it to the rigors of a machine wash. Mix a bit of mild liquid dish soap into some warm water until it is sudsy. Dip a clean sponge into the water. Gently wipe away at the spot you're interested in cleaning. [6] X Research source Avoid using soaps containing perfumes, enzymes, or surfactants. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean the coat by hand.",
      "content": "Clean the coat by hand. Fill your tub or large sink with a shallow layer of hot water. Mix in mild soap flakes until the water is sudsy. Dunk the raincoat in the water. Take it out and place it on a clean, flat surface. Gently scrub the whole coat using a soft sponge or scrubbing brush. Start by scrubbing the outside of the coat, then move on to the inside. Dip your sponge or brush back into the soapy water regularly to prevent it from drying out. Drain the water after you're done cleaning the raincoat. Place the raincoat in the sink or tub and rinse it off with cool water from the faucet or showerhead."

      "title": "Take your coat to a dry cleaner.",
      "content": "Take your coat to a dry cleaner. If the instructions provided by the care label seem onerous, or if you suspect that you are unequal to the task of cleaning it, you could choose to take the raincoat to a dry cleaners. If your raincoat has challenging care instructions, your dry cleaner may ask you to sign a waiver conceding that you will not hold them responsible for any damage that might occur in cleaning it. [8] X Research source If your raincoat contains polyurethane, do not take it to the dry cleaner. Polyurethane might be listed on the manufacturer's label as “PU” or “PVC.” Coats containing this material will crack and flake off when subjected to dry cleaning."
