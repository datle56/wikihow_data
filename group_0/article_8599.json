      "content": "Unplug and drain your ice machine. Dump out or use any ice that’s still left in the machine. Disconnect your ice machine from power so it doesn’t run while you’re trying to clean it. Look for the white drain cap on the bottom or side of the machine. Hold the machine over your sink and pull out the drain plug to get rid of any water that’s inside. Once the ice machine is empty, put the drain plug back on. [1] X Research source Some drain plugs have a small rubber stop underneath the cap. Pull out the rubber stop to let the water drain out."

Wet a washcloth with some warm water and a few drops of dish soap and use it to scrub the entire basket. Leave the bucket out to air-dry while you clean the rest of the machine. [2] X Research source Instead of using dish soap, you clean the basket with a solution that’s 1 part vinegar and 10 parts water, or 1 part baking soda to 5 parts water. [3] X Research source"
