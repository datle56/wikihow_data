      "content": "Does your current phone show these signs of needing to be replaced? Lagging performance : If your current phone has a sluggish response to anything, like opening apps, navigating through Settings, and even restarting, the software is bogged down with too much data. You can try making your phone faster , but a newer phone might be the only solution. You might even notice that it crashes a lot; being laggy and frequently crashing are signs to get a new phone. No more updates : When your current phone is old enough that the manufacturer no longer sends out security updates to it, you should upgrade. But that doesn't mean you need to replace your phone frequently; Apple updates support the iPhone XS, which was released in 2018. In order to protect your phone and personal information from security vulnerabilities that are frequently and issue with out-of-date phones, you want a phone that will be able to receive security and patch updates regularly. Outdated camera and display : If you want to have a new display screen, like OLED with vibrant colors, or the camera on your current phone is lacking, you might need a new phone. Even older phones still have amazing camera quality, like the iPhone 12 and Samsung S21 5G, so you don't need to invest in the newest devices for the better cameras. New phone carrier : If you have a phone that's locked to another network, you'll need to get a new phone. But if the phone is unlocked, which is often the case nowadays, you don't necessarily need a new phone. Instead, you can trade in your current phone for an updated one at a cheaper cost."

      "content": "Android Pros Variety : Since the Android OS is open, there are many different versions including Samsung, Google, and OnePlus. Customizable : Because of widgets and configurable settings, the Android experience means that you can customize your phone as much or as little as you want. Cons Old and laggy phones : Lots of phones are sold with older versions of the Android OS and often have the manufacturer's own software on top of the Android OS, which can lead to sluggish phones, low storage space, and clutter on the home screen."

      "content": "iPhone Pros Consistency : Apple's iOS is exactly the same between updated models of their phones (except older OS versions) and closely similar to the iPad and Watch OS. Interactive : The iPhone works beautifully with other Apple devices, like the Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBook. Cons Expensive : The iPhone is often pricey compared to many Android phones, and they frequently don't have comparable features. For example, the cameras in some iPhones aren't comparable price-wise to similar cameras on Android phones."

      "title": "Buy a phone with the features you need.",
      "content": "Buy a phone with the features you need. You don't have to pay extra to get a newer phone with features that you don't need. Look out for the following : Biometrics : You can unlock your phone or use a fingerprint, your face, or voice, to access important information. More and more modern phones use facial recognition nowadays. Camera : Smartphone cameras have come a long way! Many phones have multiple cameras so you have wide, ultra wide, and telescopic options as well as Portrait and Night Modes. But do you need everything that's offered? Wireless Charging : The more you plug and unplug a port, the more worn it gets, and the port or the cable will eventually stop working. To avoid this daily wear and tear, manufacturers are leaning more into wireless charging. Check out how fast the wireless charging is, since some are faster than others. And look at what kind of wireless chargers you'll need (like a Qi pad), because not every charging pad will work with every phone."

You don’t have to pay any additional fees or sign a lengthy contract. It’s yours!

      "title": "What cell phone carrier is the best?",
      "content": "What cell phone carrier is the best? T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T are the best major carriers. When it comes to the best plans, prices, and customer service, T-Mobile is the best overall of all of the large phone companies. Verizon and AT&T offer high-quality network speeds and great plans, but their unlimited plans can be on the pricey side and their “5G” speeds may be limited to select areas. Ultimately, the best carrier for you will be the one that satisfies your cell phone needs. [5] X Research source For instance, if you don’t need an unlimited plan, you may be able to get a cheaper plan at Verizon than with T-Mobile. Visible, Mint, and Metro by T-Mobile are the best discount carriers. If you aren’t looking for a pricey plan with one of the major carriers, there are a variety of alternative companies you can use. Companies like Visible and Mint may not have all of the service options of the larger companies, but you can get unlimited talk and data for a much cheaper rate. If you’re looking for the best cell phone service for the cheapest rate, Metro by T-Mobile (formerly MetroPCS) offers plans as low as $15 USD a month. [6] X Research source With some of the alternative companies, your loading speed can slow down if the network is heavily congested."

Companies like Samsung often offer older model phones at highly discounted rates and sometimes even for free. The phones may be older or they may have limited features, but if you’re looking for the most affordable way to get a phone, buying a plan from a carrier that offers free phones may be the way to go. [8] X Research source Companies like Google Fi, Cricket, and Pure Talk often offer free phones to entice you to switch to them. The cost of cell phone plans varies from company to company.
