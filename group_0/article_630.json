Select all the files that you want to add to GTA V by highlighting it, press the right-click on your mouse, and select “Copy” from the pop-up menu. Make sure the music files are MP3 file format. Any other format will not play inside the game. Note that since you are copying the files to another location, they will take up more space on your hard drive. For example, copying a gigabyte of music means that when you paste it, you’ll lose a gigabyte of space on your hard drive."
