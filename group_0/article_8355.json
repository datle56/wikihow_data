      "content": "Check your product manual to see if you can wash your filter. Before attempting to clean a HEPA filter, you’ll need to find out whether or not it’s washable. Some filters need to be rinsed out periodically, while any contact with water will ruin others. If you don’t have your product manual, you can search online for your appliance’s manufacturer and model number to download a digital copy. Washable filters are used in both air purifiers and vacuum cleaners."

      "content": "Disassemble the appliance outside to prevent releasing dirt and debris in your home. Larger filters can be cumbersome and hold lots of dirt and debris that you might not want to release into your house. Take your appliance outside or to the garage to remove and clean the filter if you’re concerned about your home’s air quality. Just make sure you’re within reach of a garden hose or water faucet. [1] X Research source If your filter is small and easy to handle, or if you’re not worried about spilling any dust, you can just remove the filter indoors and rinse it in a sink."

      "title": "Remove the filter from your appliance.",
      "content": "Remove the filter from your appliance. Make sure your air purifier or vacuum cleaner is turned off and unplugged. Remove the canister or panel that encases the filter, then slide the filter out of the appliance. Check your product guide if you’re not sure how to access the HEPA filter. Never operate an air purifier or vacuum cleaner without a filter."

      "content": "Tap the filter over a trash can to loosen debris. The filter might be caked with dirt and debris, depending on the type of appliance and how often you clean the filter. If necessary, you can gently tap the filter over a garbage can. This will knock off excess debris and loosen any built up dirt."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the filter with water.",
      "content": "Rinse the filter with water. You should use gentle or moderate pressure, as high pressure could ruin the filter. Rinse the filter until the water runs clear and dirt free. Some manufacturers recommend a lukewarm water rinse, while others stipulate cold water only, so check your product guide for the best water temperature for your specific filter. In general, you should rinse both sides of a washable flat filter. Cylindrical wet/dry vacuum filters should only be rinsed on their exterior and should not get wet inside the cylinder. Filters can also be cleaned and washed within a washing machine."

      "title": "Let your filter air dry completely before reinstalling it.",
      "content": "Let your filter air dry completely before reinstalling it. All washable HEPA filters must dry completely before reinstallation. Shake off excess water, then leave your filter out to air dry for at least 24 hours. Never put your filter in a clothes dryer, use a blower dryer, or use any method other than natural air drying."

      "content": "Wash your appliance’s other filters. At least one foam or activated charcoal filter usually accompanies a non-washable HEPA filter. These accompanying filters typically need to be rinsed for two to three minutes, or until water runs clear. [2] X Research source Towel dry your foam or activated charcoal filters, then let them air dry completely for at least 24 hours."

      "content": "Run a vacuum cleaner hose attachment over the filter. Use your vacuum cleaner’s hose with a nozzle or brush attachment to clean your non-washable HEPA filter. Run the attachment over the filter until you’ve removed all debris. Take care not to puncture the filter with the vacuum attachment."

You can wrap the HEPA filter tightly in plastic while you’re waiting for the other filters to dry or during any other extended period of non-use.

      "title": "Check the filter before using it and clean as needed.",
      "content": "Check the filter before using it and clean as needed. As a rule of thumb, you should change your vacuum filter every one to three months or every four to six uses. However, the frequency with which you clean a vacuum filter depends on how often you vacuum. To keep your appliance in the best working order, check the filter before each use and clean it if it's covered with a layer of dirt or debris."

      "title": "Clean your air purifier filter every three to six months.",
      "content": "Clean your air purifier filter every three to six months. Most air purifier manufacturers recommend cleaning both washable and vacuum-only HEPA filters once every three months. Remember that your filter will get dirtier if you live in a dusty environment or use your appliance more frequently, so check the filter periodically and clean it more often if necessary. [4] X Research source Check your user guide for your product manufacturer's recommendations for your specific model."

      "content": "Don't be afraid to clean your filter more often than recommended. There's no need to be afraid of cleaning your HEPA filter before it's due. As long as you clean your washable or vacuum-only filter using the correct method, you shouldn't worry about cleaning it more often than the user guide recommends. In general, the cleaner you keep your filter, the more efficiently your appliance will operate."

      "title": "Use the electronic clean filter reminder light as a general guide.",
      "content": "Use the electronic clean filter reminder light as a general guide. Some air purifier models come with an electronic filter clean reminder. The timer either keeps track of the appliance's hours in use, which is a more reliable guide, or just tracks calendar days. You should check your filter regularly instead of relying on the reminder timer alone, especially if it doesn't track actual time in use. [5] X Research source If you don't use the appliance often, the filter might not need to be cleaned when the timer light comes on. On the other hand, if you always keep the appliance on, but the timer tracks calendar days instead of actual time in use, you'll likely need to clean the filter more often than the timer recommends. You can check your user guide to find out if your appliance tracks use time or calendar days."

      "content": "Replace your filter when it's worn or as the manufacturer recommends. Since filter replacement standards will depend on your appliance type and model, it's best to check your user guide for information about replacing your filter. In general, washable and vacuum-only HEPA filters are designed to last much longer than disposable filters. Some can go years without needing replacement. [6] X Research source Some manufacturers suggest replacing your filter when it becomes visibly worn or discolored, so inspect your filter's condition when you clean it."
