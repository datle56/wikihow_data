[1] X Research source There are a few main types of connections that your laptop may have: HDMI : This is a 6-sided trapezoid-shaped port that's about ¾ of an inch wide. DisplayPort: The size is similar to HDMI, but one of the corners is bent inward while the other forms a 90-degree angle. USB-C: This is an oval-shaped port on many modern PC laptops. Not all USB-C ports support connecting to a monitor, though. You can connect to a monitor with your USB-C port if you see one of the following: If you see a lightning bolt with an arrow at the bottom next to the port, the port supports Thunderbolt 3, and you can use a USB-C or Thunderbolt 3-compatible monitor. If you see an icon of a black \"D\" with a white \"P\" inside, the port supports DisplayPort, which means you can use a USB-C or DisplayPort-compatible monitor. VGA or DVI: Less common nowadays are VGA ports, which are 15-holed ports with two pins on either side, and DVI ports, which have 24 holes and a gap on one side."
