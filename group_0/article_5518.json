      "content": "Use the formula V = B H {\\displaystyle V=BH} to find the volume of a triangular prism. According to physics teacher Joseph Quinones, “The volume of a triangular prism can be calculated by multiplying the base area of the triangle by the height of the prism.” In this formula, V {\\displaystyle V} is the total volume of the prism, B {\\displaystyle B} is the area of one of the triangular bases, and H {\\displaystyle H} is the height of the prism (the distance between the triangular bases, not the height of the triangular base itself). [1] X Research source You may also see the equation written as V = ( 1 2 b h ) H {\\displaystyle V=({\\frac {1}{2}}bh)H} , where b {\\displaystyle b} and h {\\displaystyle h} represent the base and height of the triangular base. This is because 1 2 b h {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}bh} is the formula for the area of a triangle."

Say the triangle has a base b {\\displaystyle b} of 8 cm and a height h {\\displaystyle h} of 9 cm. Just plug those values into A = 1 2 b h {\\displaystyle A={\\frac {1}{2}}bh} to find the area of the base: [2] X Research source A = 1 2 ∗ 8 ∗ 9 = 36 {\\displaystyle A={\\frac {1}{2}}*8*9=36} . The area of the triangle is 36 cm 2 . Insert 36 for B {\\displaystyle B} in the volume formula V = B H {\\displaystyle V=BH} ."

      "content": "Identify the height of the prism. Now you need to find the height of the triangular prism, which is the length of 1 of its sides (this is different from the height of the triangular base). For example, the prism may be 16 cm high. Place this number in the H {\\displaystyle H} place of the formula V = B H {\\displaystyle V=BH} . [3] X Research source For example, your formula should now look like V = 36 ∗ 16 {\\displaystyle V=36*16} ."

      "content": "Multiply the base area by the height of the prism to find the volume. Since you now have all the parts of the equation, multiply the area of the triangular base by the height of the prism. The result will be the volume of the triangular prism. [4] X Research source So, if V = 36 ∗ 16 {\\displaystyle V=36*16} , the answer is 576 cm 3 . Remember that when finding volume, the answer will be in cubed units (and area is in square units)."

      "content": "Right triangle: Pythagorean Theorem A right triangle is a triangle where one angle equals 90° (a right angle); the side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse and the other 2 sides are the legs (one is the base and one is the height, but they can be labeled interchangeably). [5] X Research source If you know the length of the hypotenuse ( c {\\displaystyle c} ) and only one leg ( a {\\displaystyle a} or b {\\displaystyle b} ), plug those values into the Pythagorean Theorem ( a 2 + b 2 = c 2 ) to find the length of the missing leg: [6] X Research source Then, you can calculate the area of the triangle . [7] X Research source Say the hypotenuse is 6 units and the base a {\\displaystyle a} is 4 units: 4 2 + b 2 = 6 2 16 + b 2 = 36 b 2 = 20 b = √20 (exact answer) or 4.472 (rounded answer). Once you know the height, you can use A = 1 2 b h {\\displaystyle A={\\frac {1}{2}}bh} to find the triangle’s area: A = ½*4*√20 = 2√20 (exact answer) or 8.944 (rounded answer)"

Then, use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the height (the other leg)."

      "content": "Triangular prisms have 2 triangular bases and 3 parallelogram faces. Prisms are named for the shape of their base, so the base of any triangular prism is a triangle. The base has a congruent (same size and shape) and parallel face that is also a triangle at the other end of the prism. Since a triangle has 3 sides, that means it takes 3 more faces to fully enclose the prism. These faces are parallelograms (polygons with 2 sets of parallel sides, like rectangles or squares) that connect the triangles together. The base of each parallelogram is equal to the length of the triangle side it connects to, and the height of each parallelogram is the total height of the prism. [11] X Research source Every cross-section of the prism parallel to the base will also be a congruent triangle. Triangular prisms have 5 faces, 6 vertices, and 9 edges. A triangular prism is also known as a pentahedron because it has 5 faces ( penta means 5)."
