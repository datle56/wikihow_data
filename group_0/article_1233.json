      "title": "Learn the parts of speech.",
      "content": "Learn the parts of speech. The words in a sentence are given names according to the type of function they serve in the sentence. There are 8 parts of speech: [1] X Research source Nouns are words that represent persons, places, or things. Examples include ‘’boy,’’ ‘’girl,’’ ‘’cat’,’ ‘’dog’,’ ‘’grass’’, and ‘’home’’. Pronouns are words that stand in for nouns so they don’t have to be repeated. Examples include ‘’he,’’ ‘’she,’’ ‘’it,’’ ‘’you,’’ ‘’we,’’ and ‘’they.’’ Verbs are words that express action or state of being. Examples include ‘’is’’/’’are’’, ‘’do’’/’’does’’, ‘’has’’/’’have’’, ‘’perform’’, and ‘’sing’’. Form of verbs, called verbals, can serve as other parts of speech. Gerunds are verbals that act as nouns; they usually end in ‘’-ing’’ (as in ‘’acting,’’ the profession). Participles are verbals that act as adjectives; they usually end in ‘’-ing’’ or ‘’-ed’’ (as in ‘’melted’’ when describing melted chocolate). Adjectives are words that describe, or modify, nouns. Examples include words representing size (‘’big’’, “huge’’, ‘’small’’, ‘’tiny’’), color (‘’red’’, ‘’green’’, ‘’blue’’), quantity (‘’one’’, ‘’two’’, ‘’three’’), or condition (‘’good’’, ‘’bad’’, ‘’happy’’). A special group of adjectives are called articles or determiners; these include ‘’a’’, ‘’an’’, and ‘’the’’. Adverbs are words that describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Many adverbs end in ‘’–ly’’ (‘’quickly’’, ‘’badly’’, ‘’really’’), but others do not (‘’very’’, ‘’fast’’). They describe how, when, where, why, and how much. Prepositions are words that connect nouns to other words so they can describe those words. Examples include ‘’at’’, ‘’in’’, ‘’on’’, ’’before’’, and ‘’after’’. Conjunctions are words that connect other words or parts of sentences together. Examples include ‘’and’’, ‘’but’’, and ‘’or’’, as well as ‘’because’’ and ‘’when’’. Interjections are words exclaimed to represent outbursts of emotion or pain. Examples include ‘’hello’’, ‘’ouch’’, and ‘’oh’’. Interjections are followed by commas when the feeling is mild, or by exclamation points when the feeling is strong. Some words can be used as more than one part of speech, depending on where they are placed in a sentence. The word ‘’well’’ can be used as a noun (place where water is drawn from), an adjective, an adverb, or as an interjection, for example."

      "title": "String words together into phrases.",
      "content": "String words together into phrases. A phrase is a grouping of one or more words that conveys an idea, usually about something that exists or some type of action, and may include other words that modify it. The most important word in the phrase is called its head. [2] X Research source Some of the types of phrases are given below: A noun phrase is a phrase built around and including a noun. In the sentence ‘’The big, red dog barked loudly at the mailman.’’, ‘’The big, red dog’’ is a noun phrase, with ‘’dog’’ the noun that forms the head of the phrase; the words ‘’big’’ and ‘’red’’ describe, or modify, it. Noun phrases can also be built around gerunds, as in ‘’loud, repeated barking’’. A verb phrase is a phrase built around and including a verb. In the sentence above, the phrase ‘’barked loudly’’ is a verb phrase, with ‘’barked’’ the verb that forms the head of the phrase; the word ‘’loudly’’ describes, or modifies, how the dog barked. An adjective phrase is a phrase built around an adjective. In the sentence ‘’I am fond of peanut butter.’’, ‘’fond of peanut butter’’ is an adjective phrase with ‘’fond’’ as its head. An adverb phrase is a phrase built around an adverb. In the sentence ‘’The mailman ran very rapidly from the barking dog.’’, ‘’very rapidly’’ is an adverb phrase with ‘’rapidly’’ as its head. An appositive is a phrase that adds detail to the sentence but won’t change the sentence’s meaning if it’s removed. In the sentence ‘’The big, red dog, an Irish setter, barked loudly at the mailman.’’, the phrase ‘’an Irish setter’’ is an appositive. Appositives are set off by commas. If the appositive is a name used to address someone, it’s called a vocative. A prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with a preposition and includes one or more nouns that serve as objects of the preposition. The phrase ‘’at the mailman’’ is a prepositional phrase beginning with the preposition ‘’at’’ and including the noun ‘’mailman’’ as its object. A prepositional phrase typically acts as an adjective or adverb. Phrases can contain phrases of the same or different kinds within themselves. For example, the prepositional phrase ‘’at the mailman’’ contains the noun phrase ‘’the mailman’’. Likewise, the adjective phrase ‘’fond of peanut butter’’ includes the prepositional phrase ‘’of peanut butter’’. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for phrases that form subjects and predicates.",
      "content": "Look for phrases that form subjects and predicates. To be complete, a sentence must have a word or phrase that serves as its subject and a word or phrase that serves as its predicate. [4] X Research source The subject is a noun phrase that tells what the sentence is about. It’s what does the action or experiences the state of being described in the predicate. In the sentence, ‘’The dog barked.’’, “dog” is the subject, or more correctly, the simple subject. (‘’The dog’’ can be called the complete or entire subject.) The predicate is a verb phrase that tells the action the subject performs or the state of being the subject experiences. In the sentence, ‘’The dog barked.’’, ‘’barked’’ is the predicate. In a longer sentence, such as ‘’The dog barked loudly.’’, ‘’barked’’ is the simple predicate, while ‘’barked loudly’’ is the complete predicate."

      "title": "Identify the object, if there is one.",
      "content": "Identify the object, if there is one. Some sentences also have an object, which is the part of the predicate that tells who or what received the action the subject is performing. Objects can be either direct or indirect. [5] X Research source A direct object is one that the action was done on; it can be the answer to the question “Who?” or “What?” In the sentence, ‘’The dog gave the puppy a bone.’’, ‘’bone’’ is a direct object. An indirect object is one that the action was done for. In the sentence, ‘’The dog gave the puppy a bone.’’, ‘’puppy’’ is an indirect object. (An indirect object functions the same as a prepositional phrase beginning with the preposition “to” or “for” that could be written after the direct object, as in ‘’The dog gave a bone to the puppy.’’) Verbs that can be followed by an object are called transitive verbs; those that can’t be followed by an object (other than the object in a prepositional phrase) are called intransitive verbs."

      "title": "Combine subjects and predicates into clauses.",
      "content": "Combine subjects and predicates into clauses. A clause is any portion of a sentence that includes both a subject and a predicate. There are two main types: independent and dependent clauses, with dependent clauses further divided into subtypes. [6] X Research source An independent clause can stand alone by itself as a complete sentence if all other information is removed. A sentence can have more than one independent clause; multiple independent clauses are connected with a coordinating conjunction (‘’and’’,’’ or’’, ‘’nor’’, ‘’but’’, ‘’so’’, ‘’yet’’) or a semicolon. A dependent clause cannot stand alone by itself but instead requires another clause to express a complete thought. (The frustrated parent’s reply of “Because I said so” is an example of an incomplete sentence made of a dependent clause.) Dependent clauses can function in sentences as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. [7] X Research source Dependent clauses may be introduced by subordinating conjunctions (‘’although’’, ‘’because’’, ‘’if’’, ‘’since’’, ‘’unless’’, ‘’when’’, ‘’while’’). These kinds of dependent clauses are called subordinate clauses. Dependent clauses may be introduced by relative pronouns (‘’who’’/’’whom’’/’’whose’’, ‘’what’’, ‘’which’’, ‘’that’’). These kinds of dependent clauses are called relative clauses. Dependent clauses that are essential to the meaning of the sentence because they limit what the sentence refers to are called essential or restrictive clauses. They are not set off by commas. In the sentence ‘’The big, red dog that lives on Pine Street barked loudly at the mailman.’’, the clause ‘’that lives on Pine Street’’ is a restrictive clause because it identifies a specific dog. Dependent clauses that add information that isn’t essential to the meaning of the sentence are called nonessential or nonrestrictive clauses. Like appositives, these clauses are set off by commas. In the sentence ‘’The big, red dog, which is seven years old, barked loudly at the mailman.’’, the clause ‘’which is seven years old’’ is a nonrestrictive clause because the dog’s age isn’t important information."

      "title": "Look for the subject of the sentence.",
      "content": "Look for the subject of the sentence. As noted earlier, the subject is a noun phrase (or a pronoun) that tells what the subject is about. The subject also determines the form the verb in the predicate takes. [8] X Research source In a simple declarative sentence (statement) or exclamatory sentence (‘’Harry threw the ball’’, ‘’I did it!’’), the subject is usually stated first. In a declarative sentence introduced with an appositive or a nonrestrictive clause (a complex sentence), the subject usually appears shortly after the comma that sets off the appositive or clause. (‘’After winding up, Harry threw the ball.’’) In an imperative sentence (command), the subject is usually not stated. (‘’Bring that over here.’’) It is understood to be whoever the command is given to, or more simply, “you.” In an interrogative sentence (question), the subject can sometimes begin the sentence (‘’It’s raining in Nebraska?’’, ‘’Who broke this?’’), but it can also follow the predicate (‘’Is this your car?’’) or fall between parts of it (‘’May I have this dance?’’). Often, you can rewrite the question into a statement (‘’This is your car.’’); in those cases, the subject of the statement is also the subject of the question. [9] X Research source A sentence can have more than one subject. Multiple subjects are called a compound subject; the individual subjects are usually connected with the conjunction ‘’and’’."

      "content": "Find the verb and you find the predicate. Also as noted earlier, the predicate tells what action the subject is taking or has taken or the subject’s state of being. In most sentences, the predicate immediately follows the subject, while for interrogative sentences, the predicate verb usually comes before the subject. [10] X Research source The predicate may include a main verb and a helping verb, as in ‘’I can speak German’’. ‘’Speak’’ is the primary verb, but ‘’can’’ serves as a helping verb, telling that I am able to speak German. The primary helping verbs are the forms of ‘’be’’, ‘’do’’, and ‘’have’’, while ‘’can’’ is part of a group of helping verbs that expresses need or possibility, called modal helping verbs. The others are ‘’could’’, ‘’may’’, ’’might’’, ‘’must’’, ‘’ought to’’, ‘’shall’’, ‘’should’’, ‘’will’’, and ‘’would’’. [11] X Research source Just as a sentence can have more than one subject, it can also have more than one predicate. Multiple predicates are called a compound predicate; the main verbs are usually connected with the conjunction ‘’and’’."

      "title": "Look for the direct and indirect objects, if they’re present.",
      "content": "Look for the direct and indirect objects, if they’re present. Objects, when present, typically follow the verb in the predicate. A verb followed by one or more objects is called a transitive verb, while a verb that isn’t followed by an object is called an intransitive verb. [12] X Research source An indirect object often follows the verb immediately, while a direct object may be preceded by modifiers or an indirect object. A sentence may have multiple direct or indirect objects. Not all nouns or pronouns that follow the predicate verb are objects, however. If the verb just connects the subject to a noun that describes it (‘’I am a man.’’), the noun that follows the verb is called a predicate noun."

      "content": "Identify modifying words, phrases, and clauses and determine what they modify. Often, you can determine what words modify other words by their position in the sentence. [13] X Research source Adjectives are usually placed before the noun they modify, whether it is the subject or the object of the sentence. If several adjectives modify a noun, they may be separated with commas if they describe different attributes of that noun. However, sentences with verbs that connect the subject with information about the subject, called linking verbs, place the adjective after the linking verb, as in the sentence ‘’He is happy.’’ The most common linking verbs are the forms of ‘’to be’’ (‘’am’’, ‘’are’’, ‘’is’’, ‘’was’’, ‘’were’’), ‘’become’’, and ‘’seem’’, but other verbs, such as ‘’appear’’and ‘’feel’’, can also function as linking verbs. Adverbs can be placed either before or after the verb they modify, but usually after. Adverbs that modify adjectives or other adverbs usually come before the word they modify."
