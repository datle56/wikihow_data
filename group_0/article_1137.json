      "title": "Move slowly.",
      "content": "Move slowly. If vertigo hits, the worst thing you can do is to change your position quickly. Reduce your feelings of dizziness by moving extremely slowly. These slow movements will allow you to focus more easily and clear your head. You should also have something stable (such as a wall or railing) to lean on when standing up or moving around. [3] X Research source If you need to, take short breaks between slow movements. Vertigo shouldn't keep you from you moving or getting out of bed in the morning. Don't be afraid to move -- just do so with care and patience!"

You'll feel better if you can keep your head level and parallel to the ground as much as possible. Use slow movements whenever you tilt your head in any direction.

[25] X Research source A specialist will usually be consulted if the head exercises don't work, the symptoms last for more than a month, or the symptoms are unusual or severe. An ENT specialist will also be called if you're experiencing hearing loss. The ENT will likely use an electronystagmogram (ENG) to see if there are problems in the connections between your inner ear, brain, and nerves. They may also order an MRI. A physical therapist can also help you to do the exercises properly, so you can also ask your doctor for a referral to this type of specialist."
