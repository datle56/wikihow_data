      "content": "Celebrate Eid al-Fitr at the end of Ramadan. Eid al-Fitr means \"Festival of the Breaking the Fast,\" and occurs on the first day of the lunar month Shawwal, after observing the fasting month of Ramadan . Traditionally, the start of Eid coincides with the arrival of the new moon, however this can differ based on geographic location, and so different religious authorities may declare the beginning of Eid on different days. [1] X Research source Because Eid al-Fitr is based on the Islamic lunar calendar, it can occur at almost any time of the Gregorian year, and its date varies from year to year. Search online or ask a Muslim practitioner to find out when the holiday occurs this year. Individual Muslim countries may have an official 3-day (or more) government holiday planned in advance to cover all possibilities. [2] X Research source Eid al-Fitr 2023 is about from the sundown of Friday April the 21st to the sundown of Saturday April the 22nd. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Bathe in the morning and put on best clothes. It’s traditional to perform ghusl , or take a shower or bath, before attending prayers during Eid. [4] X Research source Clothing traditions vary from culture to culture, but Eid is a time to present your best self, which includes looking and smelling good. Many people buy new clothes just for the occasion, and those who can't afford to still make an effort to appear well-dressed. [5] X Research source Wearing colognes and perfumes is encouraged, in order to present your best self in every respect–not just appearance-wise! [6] X Research source Muslim women in South Asia often decorate their skin with henna the night before Eid."

      "title": "Break your fast shortly after sunrise.",
      "content": "Break your fast shortly after sunrise. Muslims are not allowed to fast on the day of Eid al-Fitr, since they are celebrating the end of fasting during Ramadan, so eating food with your family before you attend prayer is encouraged. Sometimes, celebrants follow the Prophet Muhammad's example by breaking their fast by eating an odd number (usually 1 or 3). [7] X Research source Aside from dates, there’s no particular breakfast that must be eaten on Eid, and traditions vary by culture, but many people make Balaleet (an omelet with vermicelli), Sheer Khurma (sewai, dates, and milk), or Sajiyeh (a pan-fried beef dish). [8] X Research source People often make Arabic coffee and serve it during both Eids. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Attend an Eid prayer on the morning of Eid. Imams (Muslim spiritual leaders) hold special Eid prayers in the early morning of the holiday, usually at a large central mosque, an open field, or a stadium. Everyone is urged to participate in Eid prayers , including children. [10] X Research source After the prayer is completed, worshippers embrace each other and say \"Eid Mubarak,\" or \"Blessed Eid,\" to wish each other good will. [11] X Research source The event ends with a sermon by the imam. Recently, many people have opted to attend Eid prayers virtually, or to keep their in-person celebrations within their households.

      "content": "Eat sweet foods and spend time with family. Eid al-Fitr is sometimes called the \"Sweet Holiday,\" since sweet foods are usually eaten in celebration of the end of Ramadan fasting. [13] X Research source Mosques may provide sweet food before or after the Eid prayer, but many people also cook desserts themselves and celebrate at home. There are no requirements for the food you eat (other than following halal), but regional traditions include dates, halwa, falooda, cookies with milk, baklava, and vermicelli noodles.

      "content": "Give gifts to young people and to the poor. Adults usually give children and young people money or gifts on Eid, and occasionally trade gifts between each other as well. [15] X Research source Families will often visit their neighbors and extended relatives after the morning celebration to wish them a happy holiday and exchange these gifts. \"Zakat al-fitr,\" or the duty to give to the poor on this day, is a requirement for every Muslim who has the means to do so. [16] X Research source Zakat al-fitr is done so that poor people may receive the resources to take the day off from work and participate in Eid, as well. [17] X Research source Typically, each individual's contribution to the poor is about the cost of a meal, and may take the form of money, food, or clothing."

Some rest in the afternoon to recover from a day that began at sunrise. Others attend fairs and events organized for Eid, party with their friends in the evening, or visit the graves of deceased friends and family. [18] X Research source In many regions, Eid is celebrated for 3 days, or celebrated on different days by different Muslim groups. If you like, you can wake up early to repeat the celebration and prayer the next day, as well."

      "title": "Celebrate Eid al-Adha at the end of the time of pilgrimage.",
      "content": "Celebrate Eid al-Adha at the end of the time of pilgrimage. Eid al-Adha is celebrated directly after the Hajj , or pilgrimage to Mecca, and commemorates Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son. This is usually on the 10th day of the Islamic lunar month Dhul Hijjah (about 10 weeks after Eid al-Fitr), but this can vary based on the practices of local religious authorities. [19] X Research source Muslims everywhere celebrate this holiday, even if they did not perform hajj this year. Just like Eid al-Fitr, this holiday is determined by the lunar calendar, so it does not fall on the same date on the Gregorian (Western) calendar each year, and can vary quite a bit. Unlike Eid al-Fitr, there is no special focus on sweets or breaking your fast, since it does not come immediately after Ramadan, which is a time of fasting. Eid al-Adha 2023 lasts from about sundown of Wednesday the 28th of June to sundown of Thursday the 29th of June. [20] X Research source"

Each individual or household who can afford to do so sacrifices and cooks a healthy animal in accordance with halal, to commemorate the animal God sent to Abraham to replace his son Ishmael as a sacrifice. One third of it is eaten by the household or group that sacrificed it, ⅓ of it is given to extended family and friends, and the last ⅓ is given to poor or hungry people. [22] X Research source People often gather in groups to hold a barbecue, or to eat the meat that's been cooked in a pit oven. Other foods are usually eaten as well, but there are no special requirements apart from following halal. People who can’t make a sacrifice for any reason might send money to someone who can, make the sacrifice with the help of a butcher, or make a charitable donation in the same amount of the cost of an animal.
