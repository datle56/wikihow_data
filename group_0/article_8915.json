You may have heard that gender is a social construct, and what that means is that society has decided that men and women act a certain way. However, not everyone fits into these narrow descriptions, and sometimes how you feel on the inside is different than your biological sex. Give yourself permission to be the person you are because it’s who you’re meant to be. [1] X Research source"
