[1] X Expert Source Indigo Will Professional Canine Expert Expert Interview. 8 September 2020. Use their body language to learn how your dog is feeling and if they are comfortable. If you just adopted or purchased this dog, give it some time to adjust to its surroundings before overwhelming it with attention. Dogs will try to tell you things that they need and want. They may bring you their favorite toy or a tennis ball if they want to play, or whine by the door if they need to go outside. Paying attention to the cues that your dog gives you will help you to address their needs and wants. Some dogs may express themselves with different noises and expressions. Others, however, may be quieter and harder to read."

If they're tired, they may try to tell you that they'd like to be alone by avoiding you and going to a space they enjoy sleeping in.

Contact law enforcement or your local animal control agency and let them know that your dog has been harmed. If your dog does not trust you, it will take time to develop a relationship. Dogs that have been rescued from abusive situations may take a longer time to warm up to you and to feel safe. Be respectful of the fact that they need more time to feel comfortable, and let the relationship progress at a slower pace. Some dogs may be startled by noises or fast movements. If you have a new dog in your home, try to move more slowly around it until it relaxes and you learn its triggers."

The first week your dog is in your home, try feeding it from your hands. This will encourage the dog to trust you. Let your dog watch you fill their food and water bowls. They will associate you with food and understand that you are providing for them. Feed your dog at specific times during the day rather than leaving food out all day. This is a good way to help your dog build a routine and to further associate you with food and caring for them. There are many different types of dog food. Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation if you are unsure of what to choose. Some dogs are pickier than others and prefer certain types of dog food over others.

      "title": "Discipline your dog.",
      "content": "Discipline your dog. Disciplining your dog is essential in maintaining good boundaries in your relationship. There are different ways to discipline your dog, but you should never hit your dog. If a dog has done something that it shouldn't have, like going on your couch or eating off your plate, you can make them sit and sternly say, \"No! Bad dog! Don't do that!\" If you use a stern voice for disciplining them, they will act submissive because they will know they were bad. What you see as \"guilty\", a dog sees as sad. Averting the eyes, crouching down low with their head bowed, or giving you that look, shows that they know you are mad at them. While they might know you are mad at them, it is important to give discipline right away, when they are bad. That way, they will know why they are in trouble. If you come home to find that they have ripped the couch to shreds, do not discipline them. You didn't catch them in the act, therefore they have no idea what you are yelling at them for. Destructive behavior is a sign of boredom. Let them spend the day outside in your backyard, or perhaps take them for more frequent walks. If you do not want them in the livingroom, or any particular room, consider dog gates. Don't use threats that your dog won't understand. For instance, \"You ripped up the couch, we are not going to the dog park tomorrow!\". Dogs will not understand this and have no idea what you are saying. Use discipline that is appropriate for the scenario. The discipline that you would use if your dog barked when it shouldn't have versus tearing up your couch will be very different. Avoid using the dog's crate for discipline. The crate should be a safe space for your dog. Only put the dog in there if it is too hyper or wound up."
