      "title": "Write out your scores.",
      "content": "Write out your scores. Find your scores from each assignment, quiz, homework, etc. throughout the term. Sometimes this will be collected for you online, such as in a system like Blackboard. Sometimes, you'll have to go through your graded work. Write them all in one column on a piece of paper to refer back to. If things like participation or discussion are included as percentages of your final grade, you may have to ask your teacher or professor what your grade on this part is."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write out the total possible points.",
      "content": "Write out the total possible points. Refer to the syllabus for the grading system. Teachers employ various systems to determine final grades, but two common systems are points and percentages. Either way, write out the total possible points in the second column next to the score you received. In a points-based system, there is a maximum number of points you can earn in the class. Each assignment has a certain number of points assigned. For example, there may be 200 total points available in a course, split up into four assignments each worth a maximum of 50 points (4x50=200). In a percentage-based system, each assignment will be worth a certain percentage of your grade. These percentages add up to 100%. For example, you might have four assignments due, each worth 25% of the grade (4x25=100). Note that in these examples, each assignment is worth the same weight overall in your course, even though the numbers are different."

    {
      "title": "Add up both columns.",
      "content": "Add up both columns. Do this whether your assignments are graded on a percentage scale or some other total. Add up all the numbers for the first column and write the total at the bottom. Add up the numbers in the second column and write the total below. For example, say you have 5 graded course activities total. 2 of these activities were exams worth 20 points each. 2 of these activities were quizzes worth 10 points each. The final activity was an assignment worth 5 points. 20+20+10+10+5= 65. This is total number of points available in the class. Now add up your scores. Let us say you scored an 18/20 on your first exam, a 15/20 on your second exam, a 7/10 on your first quiz, a 9/10 on your second quiz, and 3/5 on the single assignment. 18+15+7+9+3= 52. This is the total number of points you earned in the class."

      "content": "Multiply the decimal number by 100. To get a grade that may look more recognizable to you, you need to convert the decimal to a percentage. Multiply the decimal times 100. Another way to do this is to shift the decimal point 2 spots to the right. 52/65= 0.8 or 80% To move the decimal point 2 places to the right, add some more zeroes, like this: 0.800. Now shift the decimal 2 spots. This gives you: 080.0. take away the leftover zeros, and you get 80. That means you scored an 80 in the class."

      "title": "Determine your letter grade or grade point equivalent (GPA).",
      "content": "Determine your letter grade or grade point equivalent (GPA). You'll need to understand your class grading scale to calculate your final grade. Some schools employ letter grades (ex. A, B, B-, etc...) while others use a point system (ex. 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, etc...). These scales all correspond with assigned percentages that work in relation to the total number of points that can be achieved in a class. These scales may also vary, depending on your school. For example, some schools may assign plus/minus grades, and some may not. Some may use a ten-point scale (e.g., anything between 90-100 is an A, anything between 80-89 is a B, etc.). Others may use a seven-point scale (e.g, 97-100=A, 93-96=A-, 91-92=B+, etc.). This may also vary depending on your professor's preferences. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Identify how grades are weighted.",
      "content": "Identify how grades are weighted. This means that some grades make up a bigger percentage of your final grade. For example, your grade may be made up of 30% participation, 4 quizzes at 10% each, and a final exam at 30%. Figuring out how your participation grades and final exam affect your grade, when they are 3 times as important as each quiz grade, is the tricky part. Check your syllabus or ask your teacher how the grades are weighted. In high school, it's common for advanced classes, such as Advanced Placement classes, to be assigned more \"quality points\" than average classes. If you are trying to calculate your GPA, make sure you know how each course is weighted. [2] X Research source"
