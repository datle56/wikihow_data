Promise to be responsible with the phone. Let your parents know that you'll be upfront with them about what you're doing on the phone and will use it responsibly. Promise to limit your time on the phone. You can agree to only use the phone for a set number of hours each day. A phone would allow you to call your parents if you’re in trouble or to contact emergency services if you’re in danger.

For example, they might say no because you might have had other electronics in the past which might've broken but try to convince them that you're older and more mature now and that you can take care of your belongings. If your parents are worried about money, then they are likely to say that they can’t afford a new phone. Many parents have practical concerns concerning cost and monthly bills when it comes to cell phones. You can offer to pay for some of the phones yourself by getting a part-time job or saving up your allowance to help with finances. If you play a lot of video games, then your parents may worry that you’ll download too many gaming apps. If your older sibling got caught talking to someone they weren’t supposed to, then your parents may worry that you’ll do the same."
