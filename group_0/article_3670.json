      "content": "Yes, it can be pretty challenging to meet some of the requirements. SWAT medics fulfill an exceptionally specific role on the SWAT team. They have to be equal-parts trained fighter and skillful healer. You need experience in law enforcement, medical training, proficiency with firearms, a reputation for having a level head, and a fair bit of luck to land one of these roles. [1] X Research source Part of this has to do with the fact that there are very few openings out there, and many SWAT teams don’t even employ a medic. As a result, it can take a long time to find and land one of these positions. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "It can be tough since there's no set process to become a SWAT medic. This isn’t the kind of job where you go to school, get certified, and fill out a resume to apply for jobs. [3] X Research source SWAT teams rarely accept open applications. In most cases, medics are recruited/promoted to the SWAT team after serving with a fire or police department. In some situations, SWAT departments will reach out to a reputable local nurse ask them to join their team. [4] X Research source You will likely need to spend the first portion of your career as an EMT, nurse, doctor, police officer, or firefighter. Departments tend to put veteran officers with a ton of training and experience in these roles, so don’t get discouraged if it takes some time."

      "content": "It can take anywhere from 3-10 years depending on your path. SWAT medics didn’t exist before 1989, and there are no universal rules, requirements, or certifications for SWAT medics as a result. In fact, many police departments don’t even have SWAT medics. [5] X Research source On top of that, many SWAT medics are volunteer doctors or nurses, and some departments simply promote regular police after having them complete a short EMT training. [6] X Research source As a result, this process can vary a lot depending on where you live. [7] X Research source Unfortunately, many departments will not hire SWAT medics if they’re over 30, 35, or 40 (depending on their internal policies), and many departments “rotate” SWAT team members out once they reach a certain age. As a result, it is rarely a lifelong position. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Become a police officer or firefighter . Unless you’re directly recruited to become a SWAT medic as a medical professional, start your journey as a police officer or firefighter. [9] X Research source This process differs a lot from area to area, so look up the requirements where you live and apply for the police academy or the fire academy depending on which strikes you as more interesting. The police academy often takes 3-6 months to complete. The fire academy is usually 6 months, but there’s often a trainee apprenticeship period that takes 1-2 years to complete."

      "content": "Start as an EMT to take it slow or complete departmental medical training. If you don’t want to become a police officer, become an EMT first and apply to become a police officer whenever you feel like you have the adequate experience. If you’re already a police officer, ask your supervisor about your department’s medical certifications. They’ll point you in the right direction to get the departmental training you need to become a SWAT medic. [10] X Research source EMT training typically takes 6 months to complete. Starting out as an EMT is probably the hardest way to become a SWAT medic, since the SWAT team really prefers hiring veteran law enforcement officers. However, if you don’t think you want to fall back on a career in law enforcement in the event you don’t get on to the SWAT team, then becoming a certified EMT is probably the way to go!"

      "content": "Get into the SWAT team first if your department has no SWAT medics. If a SWAT team doesn’t have a medic already, they probably aren’t looking to hire one. In this case, work as a police officer for a while before you apply to join the SWAT team. Once you’re on the team, ask your supervisor about opening a medical position. [11] X Research source You typically need to work as a regular police officer for 2-3 years before you can get into the SWAT team."

      "content": "Yes, but they’re only mandatory if your department says so. Before you’re officially hired, you may need to complete the National Tactical Officers Association’s (NTOA) TEMS course. In 2018, the NTOA created guidelines and training suggestions for SWAT medics. Depending on whether your state or police department abides by these voluntary guidelines, you may need to fly out to a NTOA training facility to complete a week or two of training with an NTOA-approved instructor. [12] X Research source THE NTOA is the only professional organization for SWAT teams, so many departments follow their guidelines, even though they’re totally optional. There is one other certification you may be asked to get—the TP-C certification for tactical paramedics. It’s distributed by the International Board of Specialty Certification (IBSC), and it’s a 2-hour written exam that consists of 125 questions. [13] X Research source It’s rarely mandatory, though."

      "content": "You’ll complete a departmental training program once you’re hired. SWAT medics go through some fairly complex and specialized training since, depending on a given situation, you may be fending off criminals, performing emergency medicine, or both. Often, your department will send you to a specialized training program where you’ll complete a highly immersive program over the course of a week or two. These programs differ from department to department, since SWAT team procedures are specific from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Many departments will require you to complete an interview, pass a written exam, and demonstrate you’re physically fit before or after your training program begins. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Get ready to do a ton of drills and target practice. Due to the fact that SWAT teams are typically placed in high-risk situations with firearms, most departments have some strict requirements when it comes to firearm skills. You’ll likely need to get a lot of practice to pass these departmental shooting exams depending on your background. [15] X Research source On top of that, you’re going to get a lot of practice by drilling with the SWAT team so that you internalize everything you need to know in a critical situation.

      "content": "The average base salary is roughly $97,000 a year. SWAT medics tend to make fairly good money considering the amount of training required to do the job. On top of that, the number of people who have the emotional and physical skills to keep people safe in dangerous situations is fairly small. If you have a ton of training and you’re a hot commodity, you may be able to make up to $225,000 a year! [17] X Research source If that salary strikes you as odd given how hard it is to get a position as a SWAT medic, think of it this way: the average SWAT team member makes $58,000 a year and the average EMT makes $36,000 a year. Since SWAT medics are basically doing both jobs at once, they get paid for doing both of them!"

This includes shootouts, hostage situations, bank robberies, and arrest warrant executions. Given the chaotic nature of these situations, everyone on the SWAT team must be prepared for the worst. As a result, SWAT medics carry the same weapons as everyone else on the team. [18] X Research source You will not be standing on the sideline waiting for the action to end if you’re a SWAT medic. You will be right in the middle of it when it comes time for your team to move. You’ll be breaching doors, arresting criminals, and clearing rooms just like the rest of the team. If this doesn’t sound like something you’re interested in, SWAT medic may not be the career for you."
