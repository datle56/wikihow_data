[3] X Expert Source Karuna Jain, MS Life Coach & Energy Healer Expert Interview. 23 November 2021. Some people view certain traits as fixed, and that significantly impacts how they behave.

      "content": "Challenge your negative thoughts whenever they come up. If you find yourself thinking, \"I can’t do this,\" you probably won't be able to. When that critical voice starts popping up in your head, put a sock in it by pushing back. Fighting your negative thinking by investigating and questioning how you think and feel can help you change. [5] X Research source For example, if you’re taking a test and you start thinking, “I am going to fail,” push back by asking, “How does that help me?” “Why am I thinking I’ll fail?” and “I’ve passed tests before. Why not this one?” When the voice acts up, make it sound like Donald Duck. It's a lot harder to take self-criticism seriously if it sounds ridiculous. Keep your head up (literally). Changing your body language can change how you feel and therefore think."

And guess what? It is true once you believe it! [6] X Research source No one has to know how you feel inside. All that matters is what you do.

You can reach out to people to heal broken relationships if you’d like, or acknowledge that what’s done is done and forgive them in your heart.

It follows you everywhere you go, and you can’t move forward until you put that anger down. The trick to forgiveness is to acknowledge the harm and accept what happened. Then, realize you’re not doing yourself any favors by spending energy on that pain. Make amends by telling others you forgive them and moving on will be a breeze. If you find yourself struggling with this, consider going to counseling or seeing a therapist. They’ll help you work through whatever pain and trauma you can’t escape."
