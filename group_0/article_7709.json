      "content": "Ensure your crystal is dishwasher safe. Many crystal glasses have a dishwasher safe label. If yours do not, check with the manufacturer or research online to find out if they can be put in the dishwasher. Crystal manufacturer Riedel notes that their glasses are used in hotels around the world and are thus cleaned in professional dishwashers. If you cannot find any information, err on the side of caution and wash by hand."

      "title": "Load the dishwasher carefully.",
      "content": "Load the dishwasher carefully. Ensure your glasses, bowls, or other crystal items have enough space. You don’t want them touching, as they could jostle and bump into each other causing damage during the dishwashing cycle. Don’t overcrowd or overload the dishwasher, and be sure any long-stemmed glasses fit securely in the rack."

      "title": "Allow crystal to warm up.",
      "content": "Allow crystal to warm up. Don’t start the dishwasher until your crystal has had time to come to room temperature. Sudden changes in temperature, such as heating a chilled glass, can cause breakage or damage to crystal."

      "title": "Use a small amount of detergent.",
      "content": "Use a small amount of detergent. Don’t add extra detergent in the hopes of getting your crystal extra clean. Excessive detergent can leave a cloudy film on your crystal. Follow the recommendations for your dishwasher and detergent, taking into account whether you have hard or soft water."

      "title": "Let the crystal cool.",
      "content": "Let the crystal cool. Allow the dishes to cool before opening the door to the dishwasher. This will also let your crystal dry in case the dish-washing cycle didn’t fully dry the crystal. Depending on your dishwasher and water temperature, this could take several hours."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the crystal carefully.",
      "content": "Remove the crystal carefully. You may want to wear gloves or remove the crystal with a lint-free cloth to prevent smudging and fingerprints. You can also use the lint-free cloth to remove any left-over water spots."

      "title": "Create a solution with warm water and mild dish soap.",
      "content": "Create a solution with warm water and mild dish soap. Fill your sink or a bucket with warm (not hot) water and a small amount of mild dishwashing soap. Too much soap can leave a cloudy film, so only use a little bit. Swirl or agitate the water to mix the solution thoroughly. Line the bottom of the sink or bucket with a rubber mat, soft cloth, or even paper towels to prevent damage to your crystal. Do not use hot water to clean crystal as this can cause it to break.

    {
      "title": "Submerge your crystal in the solution.",
      "content": "Submerge your crystal in the solution. You’ll want to do one piece at a time to prevent the items from clanking together, which could cause chipping or breakage. If needed, allow your crystal to soak for a few minutes. If your item is too big to fit in the sink or bucket, or cannot be fully submerged, such as a lamp or chandelier , dampen a soft cloth or sponge in the solution and use it to carefully wipe down the item."

    {
      "title": "Wash your crystal carefully with a cloth.",
      "content": "Wash your crystal carefully with a cloth. Use a soft cloth or sponge for washing your crystal to avoid scratches. Gently rub the sponge or cloth on the surface of the crystal in a circular motion, and be sure to clean the entire item, inside and out. If your item has a narrow opening, try using a baby bottle brush to move a sponge or soft cloth around the inside of the item. Some crystal is etched with language or artistic designs; use a soft-bristled toothbrush dipped in the warm water mixture to brush dust and dirt out of the etchings."

      "title": "Rinse thoroughly.",
      "content": "Rinse thoroughly. Use warm (not hot or cold), running water to rinse away any residue from the crystal. Don’t rinse with cold water as the sudden temperature change can cause the crystal to crack. [2] X Research source You may want to wear gloves to ensure you aren’t putting fingerprints on your clean crystal. For those larger items, use a clean, wet cloth or sponge to wipe down the item and remove any lingering soap. You could also rinse your crystal in a bucket or bowl of distilled water, as this will reduce the amount of water-spots left behind."

      "title": "Apply a bit of toothpaste to remove mineral deposits on the crystal.",
      "content": "Apply a bit of toothpaste to remove mineral deposits on the crystal. Rub the toothpaste around with a cloth, sponge, or even just your finger. Keep rubbing the toothpaste around on the crystal until you have removed the mineral deposits. Then, rinse the toothpaste off of the crystal. [3] X Research source Be careful not to press too hard!"

      "title": "Cover crystal in a mixture of vinegar and salt to remove deposits.",
      "content": "Cover crystal in a mixture of vinegar and salt to remove deposits. If your crystal is cloudy from stuck on mineral deposits or other types of residue, then you might also need to cover it in a paste made from vinegar and salt. Pour about 1 tsp (3g) of salt into a small bowl and add just enough vinegar to form a paste. Spread the paste over the crystal, and leave it on the crystal for 10 minutes. Then, rinse the paste off when the time is up. [4] X Research source For even more stubborn residue, put about 1/2 of a cup (120 g) of baking soda into the crystal and then pour 1 cup (240 mL) of vinegar over it. The foaming action will help to clean the crystal and remove the residue. Rinse the crystal with water after the baking soda and vinegar stop foaming."

      "content": "Create a solution of water and vinegar. Fill your sink or a bucket with one part vinegar and three parts lukewarm water. Mix the solution thoroughly. Pad the bottom of your sink or bucket with a soft towel to prevent the crystal from getting damaged. Vinegar will help remove cloudiness from crystal as well as add a beautiful shine. You can also substitute ammonia for vinegar. [5] X Research source"
