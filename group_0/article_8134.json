Blot the area lightly with soda water, dish soap, and a clean, white cloth. If possible, rinse the fabric from the reverse side of the stain.

Additionally, this harsh cleaner may cause your jeans to deteriorate more quickly. To best protect against yellowing, after washing your jeans in detergent, run them through another rinse cycle.
