      "content": "Disassemble the lens to clean it, if necessary. If the fungus is on the outer part of the lens, this isn’t necessary, but often the fungus is growing on the inner lens. If this happens, use a lens wrench to take the lens apart carefully. [1] X Research source Take pictures of the disassembling process so that you don’t forget where everything goes. Read the owner's manual for instructions on how to disassemble the lens correctly. If you’re not comfortable disassembling the lens yourself, it’s best to take it to a professional."

      "content": "Place the lens on a clean towel on a flat workspace. It’s best to use a microfiber towel that won’t scratch or damage the lens. Spread the towel out on the table so that it’s flat and the lens isn’t touching the table.

      "content": "Create a mixture using equal parts hydrogen peroxide and ammonia. Pour 1 part hydrogen peroxide and 1 part ammonia into a small bowl. Stir the mixture well with a spoon or similar utensil. [3] X Research source Prepare the mixture in a well-ventilated area. When working with ammonia, be careful not to breathe in the fumes or get the liquids on your clothing or skin. Wear protective gloves and goggles for extra protection."

      "title": "Moisten a cotton ball with the mixture to easily wipe off the fungus.",
      "content": "Moisten a cotton ball with the mixture to easily wipe off the fungus. Use a cotton ball or a Q-tip, depending on how you want to treat the fungus. A cotton ball is great for covering the entire lens while a Q-tip makes scrubbing one spot on the lens easier. Dip the cotton ball or Q-tip in the hydrogen peroxide and ammonia mixture, ensuring it’s wet but not dripping. [4] X Research source Wear latex gloves to protect your hands when handling the mixture."

      "title": "Soak the lens in the mixture for less than 3 minutes if fungus lingers.",
      "content": "Soak the lens in the mixture for less than 3 minutes if fungus lingers. If the cotton ball method didn’t work, fill a small dish with the mixture and place the lens in it so that it’s completely submerged. Let the lens soak in the mixture for less than 3 minutes before taking it out. [5] X Research source Make sure you’re only soaking the glass lens, as any other materials like plastic may become ruined by the mixture. Put something soft like a paper towel on the bottom of the dish to protect the lens from getting scratched. Use a cotton ball to wipe off any remaining fungus after the lens has soaked."

      "content": "Rinse the lens under running water after it’s been cleaned. Turn on a faucet and hold the lens under the water. This will wash off all of the hydrogen peroxide and ammonia so that the lens is clean. [6] X Research source Wear gloves to hold the lens to avoid getting it dirty."

Dry the lens thoroughly, making sure you wipe the entire surface to get rid of any excess moisture. [7] X Research source If you don't have a lens blower, try using a syringe to blow a small puff of air onto the lens."

      "title": "Hold the lens under a light source to ensure the fungus is gone.",
      "content": "Hold the lens under a light source to ensure the fungus is gone. Turn on a strong light and hold the lens up to it. Look for any remnants of fungus, and if you do spot any, repeat the cleaning process to help get rid of it. [8] X Research source A light such as your phone’s flashlight will work to spot any remaining dirt or fungus."

      "content": "Put the lens back together so it’s ready to be used. If you had to take the lens apart to clean it, it’s time to put it back together using a lens wrench or similar tool. Be careful to put each part back in the correct order so that it will work properly. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Use gloves when handling the clean lens to ensure it doesn’t get dirty again.

      "title": "Store the lens in a clean, dry place.",
      "content": "Store the lens in a clean, dry place. Dark, moist places tend to help fungus grow, so avoid storage places like this when putting away the lens. Keep the camera and lens in a dry area without humidity for the best results. [10] X Research source Try storing your camera in a clean, dry cabinet or closet inside its protective casing. Avoid leaving your camera in areas of direct sunlight to avoid heat damage, as well as any place with extreme temperatures."

If you’re using your lens in the rain or by a wet area such as an ocean, it’s super important to wipe away any moisture on the lens once you leave. Use a soft microfiber cloth to dry the lens once you’re finished shooting. [11] X Research source Carry the lens in a camera bag or wrapped in plastic while transporting it in wet weather. Place a soft cloth in your camera bag so that you're always able to wipe the camera down if necessary."
