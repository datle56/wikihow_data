      "content": "Cut 3 pieces of wood from a piece of 1 in (2.5 cm) thick unfinished wood. Start by purchasing a 66 inch (170 cm) long piece of 1 in (2.5 cm) thick unfinished wood. Now, cut it into 3 pieces: one 11 in (28 cm) piece of 1 in × 12 in (2.5 cm × 30.5 cm) wood for the roof; one 23 in (58 cm) piece of 1 in × 8 in (2.5 cm × 20.3 cm) wood for the sides; and one 32 in (81 cm) piece of 1 in × 6 in (2.5 cm × 15.2 cm) wood for the back and front. Although you can choose pretty much any kind of wood you want, white pine and cedar are the easiest to find.

      "content": "Buy glue made from aliphatic resin, urethane, or construction adhesive. Make sure you purchase one of these glue types to ensure that your bluebird house stays together in the long-term. Standard glues are not strong enough for the needs of a bluebird house. If you use a urethane-based glue, such as Gorilla glue, be sure to secure the joints with screws before it dries."

      "title": "Purchase 10 exterior grade 2 inch (5.1 cm) screws.",
      "content": "Purchase 10 exterior grade 2 inch (5.1 cm) screws. Using these screws you will drill 4 in the front, 4 in the back, and 2 to secure the base. Purchase all of these from the local hardware store or online supplier. If you don't have an electric drill, purchase one as well. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Audubon Society Nonprofit environmental organization focused on conservation, citizen science, and public science education Go to source Purchase a twist bit to pre-drill the holes. These also create a countersink, which is the indentation that the screw head sits in. If you have the money, purchase 2 drills to avoid switching drill bits."

      "content": "Cut the wood pieces into the necessary bluebird parts. The 11.25 by 11 inch (28.6 cm × 27.9 cm) piece doesn't need to be cut. Use a circular saw and ruler to measure and cut your remaining 2 pieces of wood into the bluebird parts listed below. You can also use a bandsaw if you have access to one. If you don't feel comfortable cutting the pieces on your own, pay someone at the local hardware store or lumberyard to create the specific dimensions you need. Regardless, you should have 6 pieces of wood at the end: [3] X Trustworthy Source National Audubon Society Nonprofit environmental organization focused on conservation, citizen science, and public science education Go to source Two side pieces 6.5 in (17 cm) wide, angled 12.25 in (31.1 cm) top to bottom in the back and 10.75 in (27.3 cm) in the front.

The back end of the pieces are 12.25 in (31.1 cm) tall and the front ends are 10.75 in (27.3 cm). If you're cutting wood on your own, start with 12.25 in (31.1 cm) tall side pieces and mark the spot 1.5 in (3.8 cm) down from the top on each opposing side.

The hole should be placed 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the top of the wood and 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) from both sides. Use a spade bit, hole saw, or adjustable size hole bit with your drill to create the hole. For best results, drill the hole about 3/4 of the way through, flip the board, and finish the hole by drilling through the reverse side.

Use a chisel , nail, or knife to create crisscrossed scratches running from the entrance hole to the bottom on both sides of the front piece. This will give young birds traction to climb to the hole and easily leave the nest. It will also give the mother something to land on."
