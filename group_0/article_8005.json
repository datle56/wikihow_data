      "content": "Soapy water will remove most dirt and grime. Mix a bowl of warm water with several drops of soap and soak a sponge in it. Then, wash your grips with the sponge. [1] X Research source Soak all the surfaces of your rubber grips with the soapy water, then rinse them with clean water to get rid of the soap residue. [2] X Research source The milder the cleaning product, the less likely you are to damage the rubber. Using a mild soap, like dish soap or castile soap, is a great place to start. [3] X Research source For a deeper clean, use a toothbrush instead of a sponge. Apply a few drops of dish soap or castile soap to your grips, then scrub them with a toothbrush. Once the grips are foamy, you can wash them off with water."

      "content": "Baking soda mixed with water is a good abrasive cleaner for grimier grips. Mix baking soda with a little bit of water to create a cleaning paste. Spread it over your rubber grips by hand, before letting it rest for about 2 hours. After you’ve waited for 2 hours, wipe the grips down with a wet cloth to remove the paste. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source Try another method if your rubber is black or another dark color and you want to avoid discoloring it. Baking soda can whiten your rubber if left on too long. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Ammonia cleaners, like ones used for cleaning glass, work just as well on rubber.",
      "content": "Ammonia cleaners, like ones used for cleaning glass, work just as well on rubber. Use an ammonia-based spray cleaner, and spray your rubber grips until they’re soaked. Then, take a clean rag and rub the grips thoroughly for about a minute. Be sure to scrub hard at any areas that are particularly grimy. When you’re done scrubbing, leave the grips to air dry. Ammonia cleaners in spray bottles, such as Windex, pose less of a risk to your health when accidentally inhaled after a spill. Choose this kind of cleaner over the full-strength liquid versions if you can. [8] X Trustworthy Source Nature Respected Multidisciplinary Scientific Journal Go to source Ammonia can remove the surface of damaged rubber, so it’s especially helpful if you’re dealing with a sticky grip problem."

      "content": "Also known as methylated spirits, denatured alcohol is a powerful cleaner. Wear rubber gloves, and soak a rag in the denatured alcohol. Then, wipe all the surfaces of your grips with the rag. The denatured alcohol will air dry rapidly, breaking up any stickiness and disinfecting your grips. [11] X Research source If you don’t have it on hand, you can find denatured alcohol at your local home supply store. Denatured alcohol is a strong cleaner, so be careful with how much you use. If you notice that the alcohol hasn’t evaporated after a minute or so, wipe it off with a paper towel to prevent it from harming the rubber. Treat denatured alcohol like you would when working with other strong cleaning chemicals, such as bleach. Aside from wearing rubber gloves, keep a window open if you’re cleaning indoors. [12] X Research source If methylated spirits come into contact with bare skin, immediately flush your skin with water for 15 minutes. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Acetone is a strong chemical cleaner for very dirty rubber.",
      "content": "Acetone is a strong chemical cleaner for very dirty rubber. It’s also sold as nail polish remover. Dip a corner of a soft cloth in acetone, and gently spread it over the rubber. Work it into the surface carefully by pressing the acetone into the rubber with your cloth. Then, wipe off any residue with the rest of the cloth. The acetone will dry by itself quickly. [14] X Research source Be careful when dealing with acetone, since it’s highly flammable and can cause eye irritation. Use gloves when you’re working with this chemical. [15] X Research source Be sure not to leave acetone on your rubber for too long. It can degrade rubber if it’s left on too long, so be sure to wipe it off quickly."

[16] X Research source Lighter fluid is an excellent degreaser of rubber, but be careful! You’ll want to handle it with care and wash your hands thoroughly after using it. Keep any areas that are still wet with lighter fluid away from open flames. Removing lighter fluid from your rubber is important, since it can degrade the rubber if you don’t wipe it off. Be sure not to skip wiping down your grips with a wet paper towel."
