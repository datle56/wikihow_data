When you’re in conversation let the person speak; you will get your turn to contribute and avoid making the other person feel invalidated in the process. [7] X Research source If you're trying to interrupt someone while they're speaking, take a mental note until they're done. If you have a hard time remembering things, use a notepad or your phone to jot down your thoughts and talk about them when it's your turn to speak.

Discuss what makes sense and try to stay away from examples that may seem irrelevant, unreasonable, and ambiguous. Give simple facts and clear logic that will help the listener to gain some sense. Use silence and the context of the conversation as guidelines for when to talk. If someone is venting to you, it's probably not a great time to talk about a rave you have been trying to attend for weeks. If you don't know what you want to say, ask more investigative questions, such as “What does this mean? Who can we hold responsible, how, and why?” This encourages the person to speak more. [11] X Research source Try to ask open-ended questions, as they allow the person to speak more while allowing you to speak less."

As a result, you may talk too much to cope with the awkward feelings brought on by the silence. Luckily, you can learn to sit with these feelings by practicing sitting in silence. Sitting in silence helps you observe your thoughts better and be more mindful about what’s happening in the moment, which are both helpful for improving listening. [14] X Research source Ask a close friend or family member to sit with you in silence. Make a pact not to talk for a set period of time. Keep doing this until you don't feel awkward anymore."

When you quiet down and focus less on bringing attention to yourself, you free your focus up to the person you're talking to, which allows for better listening. Instead of thinking about what you’re going to say while the other person is talking, actively listen to them and hear what they have to say.

When you listen to someone without being judgmental in your responses, you can prevent them from shutting down and help them feel a sense of freedom and acceptance. You may also gain acceptance from them too. [21] X Research source According to psychologist Elisha Goldstein, the two pillars of acceptance are understanding and caring. If you care about others and work to understand them, that will make it easier to accept them. [22] X Expert Source Elisha Goldstein, Ph.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 25 April 2023. Respect the other person and contribute to the conversation rather than judging beliefs you might disagree with. Remember facial expressions such as a visible wince, eye rolls, or body language speak as loudly as any verbal judgmental response would. Accepting someone's ideas does not necessarily mean you agree with them. Understanding through listening does not mean your opinions become mutually in sync with one another."
