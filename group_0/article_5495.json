Then take the square root of that product to get your final result. [3] X Research source If you did your calculations in meters, then your final answer will be in kilometers. If you did your calculations in feet, then your final answer will be in miles . The result of this formula is the rough estimate of the distance between you and the horizon. For a more precise distance (if you have a calculator handy), use the formula Distance = 1.22459 x √( h ) to get your result in miles. This formula gives you the distance from your eyes to the horizon if you were to travel in a straight line. The actual distance you'd have to travel to get to the horizon will be longer because of surface curvature and irregularities (on land). If you want to know the actual travel distance to the horizon, proceed to the next section."

As a human on planet Earth, you’re standing on the Earth’s surface and seeing the curvature of the globe as it meets the sky—that makes the horizon line. [7] X Research source The horizon is a changing thing—its appearance and properties are influenced by tis surrounded environment. The horizon line is only well-defined in mathematics if there are no obstacles in your line of view. For this reason, the best way to see or calculate the horizon is to go to the seashore and face the open sea."

However, you can see objects like mountains and skyscrapers that are further away because there are no horizons to obstruct them.

Of course, any given person’s range of vision may be affected by personal factors such as eye health and the brightness and size of the object they’re looking at."
