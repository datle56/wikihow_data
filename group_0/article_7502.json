  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Always start with the name of the person who wrote the letter.",
      "content": "Always start with the name of the person who wrote the letter. List the writer's name with their last name first, then a comma. After the comma, type the person's first name and their middle initial, if available. Close this section of your citation with a period. [1] X Research source Example: Keller, Helen."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the title or subject line of the letter in quotation marks.",
      "content": "Add the title or subject line of the letter in quotation marks. If the letter has a title or subject line, provide that after the name of the person who wrote the letter. Use title-case, capitalizing most words, including nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. Place a period inside the quotation marks at the end of the title. [2] X Research source Example: Smith, John. \"Inspirational Quotes for Students.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a generic description if there is no title or subject line.",
      "content": "Use a generic description if there is no title or subject line. Some letters, particularly historic correspondence, won't have a title or subject line. In this case, identify the source as a letter and state who it was written to. End your description with a period. [3] X Research source Example: Keller, Helen. Letter to John Hitz."
    },
    {
      "title": "Indicate who received the letter and the date it was received.",
      "content": "Indicate who received the letter and the date it was received. When citing unpublished letters or personal correspondence, include the name of the person who received the letter. List their first name first, followed by their middle initial (if any) and their last name. Place a comma after the name, then include the date they received the letter in day-month-year format. If you don't know the date the letter was received, use the date on the letter itself. [4] X Research source Example: Smith, John. \"Inspirational Quotes for Students.\" Received by Sally J. Sunshine, 7 September 2017. If the name of the recipient was already included in a generic description of the letter, do not repeat it. Instead, simply include the date after the description. For example: Keller, Helen. Letter to John Hitz. 29 August 1893."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include collection or location information, if appropriate.",
      "content": "Include collection or location information, if appropriate. Letters by famous writers or people of historical significance are often preserved in library collections for use by researchers. Name the collection, then place a comma. After the comma, provide the name and location of the institution that houses the collection. End your citation with the format of the letter. [5] X Research source Example: Keller, Helen. Letter to John Hitz. 29 August 1893. Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. Manuscript."

    {
      "title": "Include a description and date for in-text parenthetical citations.",
      "content": "Include a description and date for in-text parenthetical citations. When citing the letter in the text of your paper or report, the information you include in your parenthetical citation will depend to some extent on which details you've included in the text itself. [6] X Research source If you include the name of the writer and the date of the letter, you wouldn't need to repeat the same information in your parenthetical citation. For example: \"Helen Keller described her trip to Chicago in an 1893 letter to John Hitz (Letter).\" If Helen Keller wrote several letters to John Hitz that you are using as references, use specific dates to distinguish the letters in your parenthetical citations. For example: Helen Keller described her trip to Chicago in an 1893 letter to John Hitz (Letter [29 August]).\" A full parenthetical citation would include the name of the addressee and the date of the letter. For example: \"Helen Keller traveled to Chicago to visit the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 (Letter to John Hitz [29 August]).\""

Then type their first initial. Include their middle initial if it is available. [7] X Research source Example: Keller, H."

      "title": "Include the date of the letter in parentheses.",
      "content": "Include the date of the letter in parentheses. If the letter has a date on it, place that information after the writer's name in your citation. Start with the year. If the letter includes a month and a day, put a comma after the year, then type the number of the day and the name of the month. Place a period after the closing parentheses. [8] X Research source Example: Keller, H. (1893, 29 August). If you have multiple letters from the same author in the same year, assign a letter to each so you can distinguish them when citing them parenthetically in the body of your paper. For example: Keller, H. (1893a, 29 August). [9] X Research source"

If the letter is a standalone document, format the title in italics. Use sentence-case, capitalizing only the initial word and any proper nouns. If it is part of a larger work or collection, do not italicize the title. Place the word \"Letter\" in square brackets after the title to indicate the format of the document.
