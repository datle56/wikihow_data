      "content": "Scrub lightly burnt areas with hot water and a stiff brush. Boil water in the microwave or on the stove and carefully pour it into the pan. [1] X Research source Firmly scrub the burnt areas with a chain mail cast-iron scrubber or a stiff brush. Repeat until the stain is gone. To remove rust, house cleaning professional Kadi Dulude recommends using “a brillo pad or any other metal scouring pad and water and soap to scrub off the rust,” then “wash it off.” Optionally, add a drop or two of dish soap as you scrub. Some sources say that dish soap strips away cast iron—however, modern dish soap is gentler than it used to be and the seasoning on cast iron keeps the metal safe. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use baking soda or salt to scrub away stuck-on burnt food. Scatter kosher salt, coarse sea salt, or baking soda over the base of your skillet. Use a paper towel or soft scrub brush to scrub out any food stuck to the skillet. Give the cast iron a light rinse to remove any leftover salt or baking soda. [3] X Research source Alternatively, add a little water to the baking soda to form a paste. Scrub the burnt area with the paste and a stiff brush. Baking soda can also help remove brown rust spots on your cast iron skillet."

      "content": "Lift away stubborn stains by boiling water in your skillet. Fill your skillet with around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water and place it over high heat. After the water boils for about 10 minutes, Dulude says to gently nudge the stubborn burnt-on spots with a cast iron scrubber or wooden spatula. This method also works to clean enameled cast iron pots and pans. [4] X Research source To clean the outside, use dish soap or baking soda, warm water, and a soft cloth or plastic scraper. [5] X Research source Use plastic or wooden tools in your cast iron rather than anything metal. Metal spatulas and spoons can scratch the surface and strip away the seasoning on the pan."

      "content": "Dry the skillet in the oven and apply a thin coat of oil. Wipe the surface of the cast iron down with a dry cloth to remove most of the excess water. Put it in a 300 °F (149 °C) oven for 1 hour until it’s completely dry. When the pan is still warm, pour 1 to 2 US tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of oil into the skillet and use a paper towel to spread it evenly over the surface. [6] X Research source Any water left on your skillet when you put it away may cause it to rust. Make sure the skillet is completely dry before oiling it or storing it. Store your pan by hanging it up or stacking it inside other pans with paper towels in between them to prevent them from scraping the finish. [7] X Research source Choose a neutral oil with a high smoke point. Vegetable oil, canola oil, and grapeseed oil are best. [8] X Research source"

Pour 1 to 2 US tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of vegetable, grapeseed, or flax oil into the skillet and spread it all over the surface with a paper towel. Once the skillet is covered, use another paper towel to wipe away any excess oil. [9] X Research source Cast iron is porous, which means there are small holes in the surface that absorb the oil, resulting in a smooth cooking surface. Make sure to spread the oil in a thin layer. If you leave too much oil on the skillet, it may become sticky. Colorful enameled cast iron pans don’t require seasoning. Follow the steps above to clean your skillet or pan, then you’re done!

      "content": "Put the skillet face down in a 500 °F (260 °C) oven for 1 hour. Place your pan face-down on the top or middle rack of the oven with a sheet tray or tin foil on the rack below it to catch any oil drips. Bake the pan for 1 hour. This allows the oil to set into the surface and give it a non-stick quality. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the pan cool and repeat the seasoning process . After an hour, turn your oven off and let the cast iron skillet cool down. Repeat this process several times or as necessary until your pan has multiple layers of seasoning and the coating is non-stick. [12] X Research source You’ll know your pan is sufficiently seasoned if you can fry an egg in oil or butter without it sticking to the surface. [13] X Research source Store your skillet in a clean and dry place. Cast iron tends to rust very quickly, so make sure to keep it away from as much moisture as possible. If you’ve just stripped your pan, repeat these steps multiple times until a smooth finish develops on the surface. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the pan in a trash bag and spray it with an oven cleaner. If you picked up a used skillet with a ton of built-up grease and gunk, strip the surface to restore the cast iron. Place the pan in a heavy-duty trash bag outside, then spray it thoroughly with an oven cleaner. Tie the bag and let it sit for 12 to 24 hours. [15] X Research source Stripping a pan is usually only necessary for badly rusted or burnt pans that won’t come clean with the methods above. If your pan is slightly rusted or burnt, scrub the surface with dish soap, warm water, and steel wool. This will not strip it down to bare metal but will give you a level surface to re-season.

You may have to scrub and rinse the surface multiple times to make sure no chemicals remain. [17] X Research source Some recommend using a sandblaster, lye bath, or electrolysis. However, these methods can be dangerous and unnecessary if you only strip 1 pan. [18] X Research source"

Place it over medium-high heat for around 10 minutes, or until all the water evaporates and the skillet is dry."
