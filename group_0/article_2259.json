      "content": "Make sure they fit. The most important thing is to purchase panties that fit! Make sure they are not too tight, or else they will dig in to your skin and cause unsightly panty lines. At the same time, if you choose underwear that is too loose, it can easily wrinkle up inside your clothes, showing wrinkles and bumps. [1] X Research source If the elastic is cutting into your skin and feels restrictive, your underwear is too tight. If there is any excess fabric hanging down or you feel like your underwear isn't supporting your butt at all, it's probably too big.

      "title": "Consider thongs.",
      "content": "Consider thongs . Thongs simply don't have the lines to show, making them the ideal panty line-free choice. While they may not be the most comfortable underwear, they are a good option when you are wearing especially tight clothing. [3] X Research source [4] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 23 April 2019. Be sure to check out the rear view when you sit or squat, as these positions tend to expose part of the thong if you're wearing low-cut pants. If you're concerned about your thong showing when you squat, be sure to wear high-waisted pants and skirts or shirts that extend lower than the waistline of your bottoms. G-strings have even less fabric than thongs, so they're the best choice for minimizing panty lines. Keep in mind that thongs are much less comfortable if they are too tight, so get one that fits properly."

      "title": "Try boy shorts.",
      "content": "Try boy shorts. For those who hate thongs, there is another alternative! Boy shorts provide full coverage, and because they do not cut across your butt, they offer a much more seamless look than most bikini-style underwear. [5] X Research source [6] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 23 April 2019. You need to be more cautious with boy shorts than you do with thongs because they do not eliminate the possibility of a visible panty line. It's a good idea to test them out with your favorite pair of form-fitting pants. You can find boy shorts in many different materials. Choose one that you find comfortable and that has invisible or very minimal seams. Make sure your boy shorts fit snugly, but don't cut into your skin."

      "title": "Look for seamless panties.",
      "content": "Look for seamless panties. Most major lingerie brands have a line of seamless panties, so there are plenty of different styles to choose from. Many of these styles have laser cut edges, which are very thin edges that do not leave a visible panty line. [7] X Research source Elastic and spandex panties are very good for a seamless look. Unfortunately, cotton panties, which are the best for feminine health because of their breathability, are typically not seamless because the fabric is too thick."

      "title": "Go commando.",
      "content": "Go commando. If you're brave enough to do this, simply don't wear underwear. This is the only way to know that there are no panty lines whatsoever. Going commando is best when wearing pants. Always wear underwear with skirts and dresses. Be sure to wash your pants after each use when going commando to prevent infections like bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections. Some workout pants are actually made with special linings so that they can be worn without underwear. If you feel uncomfortable doing this, you can also go \"faux commando\" by ordering disposable cotton patches that adhere to the inside of your pants, allowing you the freedom of no underwear without any discomfort."

      "title": "Try shapewear.",
      "content": "Try shapewear. If you want a totally smooth look without wearing a thong or skipping the panties altogether, consider wearing shapewear under your clothes. These undergarments typically extend to your mid thigh, so there will not be a panty line. They also suck in unwanted bulges, and they're available in a variety of styles for different body types and different outfits. [9] X Research source [10] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 23 April 2019. You can wear panties under your shapewear or not, depending on your personal preferences. If you just want to smooth out your butt, upper thighs, and/or lower stomach, you can buy panty-style shapewear. For more coverage, you can opt for a pant-style that extends further down your legs or a bodysuit-style that covers your upper body (except your chest) as well. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Shapewear should not be used to attempt to fit into a smaller size of clothing. If it feels overly restrictive or you begin to experience numbness or tingling, your shapewear is too tight.

      "content": "Wear tights. If shapewear isn't for you, you may be able to get the same benefits from a pair of tights or pantyhose. Wear a pair under your pants or with a skirt for a smooth look. [13] X Research source As with shapewear, you do not need to wear underwear under your tights or pantyhose if you don't want to. The choice is up to you. You can buy high-waisted styles if you want some coverage over your stomach, although tights will never give you as much control as shapewear."

      "title": "Consider a slip.",
      "content": "Consider a slip. If you're wearing a skirt or dress, consider wearing a slip or half slip underneath. This old-school accessory can help you achieve the seamless look you want. [14] X Research source [15] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 23 April 2019. A full slip covers your entire torso and the upper parts of your legs, and is meant to be worn with a dress. A half slip covers only your butt and upper legs, and is meant to be worn with a skirt. Many slips contain some lycra, which helps shape your body and prevents the garment from bunching. If you are looking for a little extra control, you can also find shapewear in slip styles. [16] X Research source Try to match the color of your slip to your dress or skirt as much as possible. This will make the slip less visible if it ever peeks out from under your clothes. Make sure your slip is always shorter than any slits in your dress or skirt. [17] X Research source Avoid slips with lace details, as this may show through your clothing. [18] X Research source To avoid static cling between your slip and your garment, try gently pulling each item through a wire hanger before you put it on."

      "title": "Avoid skin-clinging clothing.",
      "content": "Avoid skin-clinging clothing. Extremely tight clothing will always bring out a panty line if there is one to bring out. If you don't feel comfortable going commando or wearing a thong, but you don't want panty lines, avoid wearing super clingy pants and skirts. Leggings are especially likely to show panty lines. If you want to wear them with regular panties, consider wearing a tunic-length shirt with them. The shirt will cover your butt, so you won't have to worry about whether or not your panty lines are visible through your leggings. If you love to wear skirts, consider wearing a loose-fitting style that will not show panty lines as much. For example, instead of wearing a tight pencil skirt, wear an A-line skirt."

      "title": "Choose thicker fabrics.",
      "content": "Choose thicker fabrics. Pants and skirts made from thick, textured fabrics are much less likely to show panty lines than silky, clingy fabrics. If you don't want to have to worry about panty lines, choose fabrics like denim and tweed over fabrics like jersey and silk. [19] X Research source [20] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 23 April 2019. Rear pockets add extra fabric to the seat of your pants, so they may also help hide panty lines. Keep in mind that not all denim is created equal. Some is much thicker, while some is thinner and stretchier. Opt for thicker, less clingy styles if you are trying to avoid panty lines."

      "content": "Opt for prints. Prints are better at disguising panty lines than solid colors, so if you want to wear some tight leggings or yoga pants with your regular undies, you may want to choose a patterned pair. [21] X Research source Remember that prints will not eliminate panty lines; they will only help disguise them. It's a good idea to check for panty lines in the mirror before you go out."

      "content": "Steer clear of see-through pants. You definitely have to put a lot of thought into choosing the right underwear when you are wearing pants that are even remotely see-through. If you don't want to have to worry about it, avoid wearing any bottoms that may show more than you want. [22] X Research source White pants are common culprits, so always make sure you can't see your underwear through them before you buy them. Leggings and yoga pants can also be see-through, so make sure you buy a pair that is thick and opaque."
