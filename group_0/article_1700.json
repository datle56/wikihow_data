      "content": "Geminis are social, active creatures who fall for each other quickly. Since they can match each other’s energy so well, they’re more likely to fit into each other’s lifestyle and understand each other on a deeper level. However, they also have a tendency to blow things out of proportion and take little things very personally. [1] X Research source Geminis can make their relationship work by focusing on their mutual attraction and their love for spontaneity. The one thing Geminis hate is being bored, and with another Gemini, they never will be. Geminis tend to fall for their love interests hard and fast. In a Gemini-Gemini relationship, they won’t be quiet about their feelings—in fact, they’ll probably let the whole world know.

      "content": "In the bedroom, Geminis will constantly be surprising each other. Routine is fairly boring for a Gemini, and they’re always throwing out new positions, toys, and kinks to try out. This double Gemini couple will never get bored of each other, and they’ll probably discover some new interests along the way. [3] X Research source Geminis need to be careful not to relive their favorite fantasy every night—too much of a good thing can get boring, and Geminis can’t handle being bored."

      "content": "Air signs love to teach and to learn, so Geminis are well-matched together. Not only will they tell each other a lot about the world, but they’ll be open to hearing whatever opinions the other one has.

Reader Poll: We asked 424 wikiHow readers who’ve dated a Gemini, and 57% agreed that this air sign loves meaningful, intellectual talks with their crush more than any other activity. [Take Poll] Two Geminis would totally enjoy bonding over hours of long, stimulating conversation!"

      "content": "Unfortunately, Geminis aren’t known for their emotional intelligence. As the two bond and grow together, their deepening feelings will ultimately strengthen their connection. However, if they keep their feelings at surface-level while they date (as many Geminis tend to do), they may never grow closer to each other, and could ultimately end up apart. While Geminis are big talkers, they sometimes have trouble expressing their feelings. You can tell a Gemini has a crush when they act awkward or uncomfortable around someone (since that’s the opposite of how they normally are).

If one of the Gemini partners decides that they’re no longer interested, their relationship can go downhill quickly."

      "content": "Gemini is ruled by planet Mercury, the planet of communication. Geminis are very talkative in any setting, and you’ll usually find them completing each other’s sentences or talking over one another. It’s great for the people in the relationship, but their friends and family members might find them slightly overbearing, at least at first. [6] X Research source"

In that way, Geminis are perfect for each other—they’re constantly discussing new, big ideas and the wonders of the universe. Geminis will never get bored of talking to each other, because they never stop talking. [8] X Research source One tricky area of a Gemini relationship is their listening skills. This sign is great at talking, but when it comes to pausing and letting another person speak, they tend to step on each other’s toes."

      "content": "Geminis are very similar, which can sometimes cause them to clash. Although they will understand each other very well, this double-Twin relationship has a tendency to spark brightly for a few weeks and then fizzle out. Oftentimes, Geminis need someone more level-headed to keep them grounded—dating another Gemini will do the opposite. While this can be fun for a while, ultimately, Gemini-Gemini relationships tend to stay fairly surface-level with little emotional depth. [9] X Research source For a Gemini pairing to work, each partner needs to commit to getting to know one another deeply. Geminis are hugely social signs, so they need to set aside some time to spend just with each other, without a huge group of pals around."

      "content": "Trust can sometimes be lacking in a double-Gemini relationship. Since Geminis are so spontaneous, they can often be unreliable or even a little flaky. While both partners will understand this need to be on the go constantly, it doesn’t usually bode well for relationships, and can ultimately be what tears them apart. Some Geminis find it hard to commit to one person. Talking about their intentions and how serious they want to be can help prevent issues. [10] X Research source"
