There are several ways you can recognize scams: Beware of companies that reach out to you first. Legitimate cam sites will advertise, but they will never contact you first. A cold contact through social media, messaging, or email is likely a scam. Reputable companies will ask for verification that you are over 18 since this is the legal age requirement for adult work of an explicit nature. A scam will not ask for such documentation. If a company requests nude pictures or an interview via webcam, this is most likely an attempt to get a free show. No legitimate company will ask for such an interview or for nude pictures. Instead, a reputable company will ask for a full-body picture and a headshot. A company with a registration, application, or processing fee is rarely reputable. If anything, your initial investments will have to do with purchasing a quality webcam, lingerie, or novelty items. If the company guarantees a certain income, it is most likely a scam. Webcam models make money when customers pay, and that is a variable factor. The company is most likely a scam if it says it uses PayPal as a payment service. PayPal has a zero-tolerance policy for adult services. [2] X Research source"

Some sites, for example, will allow you to keep 50-60% of the profits from tips. [3] X Research source You should also find out how frequently you will be paid. Some companies will pay you twice a month, some monthly, a very select few daily. Factor this into your considerations for what company you will sign up with. Know that as an independent contractor, you will still owe taxes to the IRS. You will have to pay these on your own through quarterly estimated payments or by filing a tax return at the end of the year.
