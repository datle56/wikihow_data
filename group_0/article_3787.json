      "content": "Choose one type of martial art to specialize in if you prefer to master one task at a time. Many of the most successful MMA fighters spend years specializing in one martial art before branching out into other disciplines. If you prefer to hone one skill set before moving on to the next, consider picking one martial art to train in first. After you’ve developed a strong foundation, you can start adding additional martial arts into your practice. [1] X Research source Boxing and kickboxing can provide a solid foundation for basic hand and footwork as well as critical striking skills. Muay Thai is very helpful for basic striking, handwork, and footwork. [2] X Research source Karate and Kung Fu can help improve your strikes and accuracy in stand-up fighting. Taekwondo is one of the broadest forms of martial art study and can provide a well-rounded base of fighting skills. [3] X Research source Wrestling teaches skills that are very important in controlling your opponents to the ground. Judo helps you leverage your opponent to the ground and gain a good position once there. [4] X Research source Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ), seen by many as one of the most critical disciplines of successful MMA fighting, teaches body control and ground defense. [5] X Research source"

MMA fighters need to be skilled at stand-up fighting, grappling, and groundwork to be successful, so many younger fighters are choosing to train in a range of disciplines rather than specializing in one fighting style. If you prefer more varied training, look for MMA gyms that offer classes in a variety of fighting techniques."

Shadow boxing in front of a mirror is an easy way to observe and tweak your form. With or without a punching bag, practice basic punches like the jab, cross, and hook, as well as front, side, and roundhouse kicks. You can also work in combination moves, such as a jab-cross or cross-front kick. [13] X Research source Some fighters prefer to practice in short bursts (30-60 seconds), taking a break in between more intense rounds. Others work at lower intensity for 3-5 minutes to simulate an actual MMA fight. Try multiple methods to see what works best for you."

Professional MMA fighters can spend months perfecting their diet plans, but even amateur trainers can benefit from a diet rich in proteins, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Try limiting simple carbohydrates and make sure to consume plenty of water before, during, and after training sessions. [18] X Research source Eating 5-6 small meals throughout the day can help to increase metabolic activity and speed muscle growth, supporting your MMA training process. Protein is critical to building and maintaining muscle. When you’re training, aim to get 0.5 to 0.9 g of protein per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of bodyweight per day. So, for example, if you weigh 150 pounds (68 kg), you should consume between 75 g and 135 g of protein daily. [19] X Research source"
