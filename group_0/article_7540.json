      "title": "Start with the author's name.",
      "content": "Start with the author's name. When it comes to a website, it can be difficult to find an author for the whole website. If the author isnâ€™t clearly stated, you may be able to find one on the \"About Me\" page. You can also use an editor or compiler. If you can't find one, you can skip this step and begin with the next part, the website name. [1] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source When listing the name, put the last name first, followed by a comma and the first and middle names (if available). It should look like the following name: Roberts, Rebeca Jean. Put a period after the name. In the case of authors, you're now allowed to use a handle (such as a Twitter handle) rather than the author's name if you can't find a name, such as @felinesforthewin."

    {
      "title": "Add the title of the website next.",
      "content": "Add the title of the website next. The title of the website is the main name given to the website. You'll often find it in the header of the website, at the top of every page. Normally, you'd put what MLA calls the \"Title of Source\" next, which refers to the smaller section where you found your information, such as the page name or a journal article in a larger journal. However, if you're using a whole website, you leave this part out and just put in the name of the website. [2] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source The name of the website should be in italics. It should look like the following citation: Roberts, Rebeca. Cats Who Sleep, Use a comma after the website title."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include other contributors.",
      "content": "Include other contributors. If you find other people who contributed to the website besides the main editor, you can include it after the name of the website. Usually, you add in how the person or persons contributed, such as \"edited by\" for editors. Add contributors in using the following method: Roberts, Rebeca Jean. Cats Who Sleep, edited by John Jacobs and Joseph George, Put a comma after the contributors. If the website doesn't have other contributors, leave this part out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move on to the publisher.",
      "content": "Move on to the publisher. Normally, a version and number would come next, such as with a journal, but most websites don't have versions or numbers, so move on to the publisher. The publisher in this case is the organization or sponsor of the website. If the name of the publisher is the same as the website, you can leave off the name of the publisher. [3] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source The publisher will follow the comma after the other contributors: Roberts, Rebeca Jean.

      "title": "Add the location.",
      "content": "Add the location. The location does not refer to the place it was published. While older editions of the MLA Handbook required the place of publication, that is not included in the 8th edition for the most part. The location, instead, refers to the place you found the information. In this case, that is the website's URL address. The URL address is what's found in your browser's address bar at the top of your computer screen. Don't use the \"http://\" or \"https://\" before the website. Instead, begin with \"www.\" Add the website after the publisher: Roberts, Rebeca Jean. Cats Who Sleep, edited by John Jacobs and Joseph George, The Cat Institute, www.thewebsiteforsleepingcats.com."

      "title": "Leave out any information you can't find.",
      "content": "Leave out any information you can't find. In the past, when you couldn't find a piece of information, you'd need to add things like \"n.d.\" for \"no date\" or \"n.p.\" for \"no publisher.\" However, now MLA recommends that you just leave the information out. You don't need to put anything in its place. You can add the date you viewed the page if you wish, but you aren't required to include it. The date goes before the location."

      "title": "Begin with the author's name.",
      "content": "Begin with the author's name. Once again, you begin with the author's last name, then the first. In this case, you're looking for the author of the page you're citing, not the whole website. Often, the author's name will be at the top of the page or near the bottom, before the comments. If the whole site was put together by one person, you can use that person's name. Otherwise, if you can't find an author, leave it off and begin with the title of the page. [4] X Research source Start with the last name first, followed by the first and middle names, if applicable: Fitzgerald, Rosa. Use a period after the name. If you can't find the author's name, you can use a handle in place of the name."

The title is usually at the top of the page, under the header for the whole website. [5] X Research source Put the page title in quotation marks: Fitzgerald, Rosa. \"The Sleeping Habits of Elderly Felines.\" Use a period before the final quotation mark."

The website name is usually found at the top of any of the website's pages, in the website's main header. If you can't find it there, look on the \"About Me\" page.

      "content": "Place other contributors next. If you find someone else who contributed to the page or who edited it, you can add that name in next. You should also add in a description of how the person contributed, such as \"edited by,\" to indicate what the person did. The contributors come after the website name: Fitzgerald, Rosa. \"The Sleeping Habits of Elderly Felines.\" Cats Who Sleep, edited by John Jacobs, Put a comma after the contributor.

It doesn't matter whether you are quoting from the source directly (with quotation marks) or paraphrasing from the source (in your own words without quotation marks). Either way, you need to add a citation to tell where you found the information. [9] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source If you use information from other sources without citing it, it's considered plagiarism, with the exception of factual, common knowledge. Citing your sources is also a courtesy to your readers. It lets them know where they can find more information on the topic."

      "title": "Add parentheses.",
      "content": "Add parentheses. Once you get to the end of the sentence you're citing, use an open parenthesis. The parentheses indicate to your reader that you are opening a citation. The citation goes before the period at the end of the sentence, though if you're using quotation marks, they should come before the parentheses. [10] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source You can also add a citation directly after the citation, preferably before a comma or other punctuation mark, if you're citing more than one source in a sentence."

      "title": "Use the first part of your full citation.",
      "content": "Use the first part of your full citation. Normally, with a book source, you use the author's name and page number. Because websites don't always have authors, use whatever comes first in your citation, be it the author's name, the title of the page, or the title of the website. You do not need to use a page or paragraph number with the website. [11] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Therefore a citation would look like the following in a sentence: Cats enjoy sleeping for many hours a day (Fitzgerald). You only use the last name when using the author's name. Use a shortened form of the title. Try to stick to 3 or 4 words that will lead the reader directly to the citation at the end. If you are using the page title (because the author's name is not available), it would look like the following sentence: Cats enjoy sleeping for many hours a day (\"Sleeping Habits of Felines\")."
