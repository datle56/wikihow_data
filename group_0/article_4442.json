      "title": "Breach reduces the effectiveness of armor protection by 15% per level.",
      "content": "Breach reduces the effectiveness of armor protection by 15% per level. What this means is that Breach makes your enemy's armor less effective, so they will take more of the damage you're outputting. Breach only reduces armor protection effectiveness. It does not reduce the effectiveness of enchantments like Protection or Resistance. Breach has a maximum level of IV, and reduces armor effectiveness by the following amounts per level: Breach I: -15% armor effectiveness Breach II: -30% armor effectiveness Breach III: -45% armor effectiveness Breach IV: -60% armor effectiveness For example, if you're fighting an enemy with 50% armor effectiveness and you have Breach I on your mace, it will reduce their armor effectiveness to 35%."

      "content": "There are 4 enchantments that are incompatible with Breach. If you want to add multiple enchantments to your weapon, Churchill says you can do so by combining your weapon with an Enchanted Book in an Anvil. However, be aware that some enchantments are incompatible. You cannot have a Breach enchantment as well as one of the following enchantments on a mace: Density Sharpness Smite Bane of Arthropods If you have a mace with one of these enchantments on it and you want to use Breach instead, you'll need to remove the enchantment first with a Grindstone."

      "content": "You can bypass this restriction by using commands. The command to add an enchantment to the item you're holding is /enchant player_name enchantment_name enchantment_level . For example, to give the mace you're holding Breach V, the command would be /enchant player_name density 5 , where player_name is your player name."

      "title": "Density is usually better than Breach—with a few exceptions.",
      "content": "Density is usually better than Breach—with a few exceptions. If you don't play on PvP servers or you play Java Edition, it's better to take Density instead of Breach. However, there are a few times where you might prefer to use Breach: PvP: Since Breach is effective against armored characters, it doesn't make much sense to use it in a single-player Minecraft game, since most enemies aren't armored. However, if you play PvP, Breach can be very useful. Bedrock Edition: On Java Edition, the mace is very slow. However, this isn't the case in Bedrock Edition thanks to the lack of attack cooldown. Since you can spam click attacks in Bedrock, Breach becomes very deadly against armored opponents. [1] X Research source Preference: If you prefer Breach over Density, you can and should use it!"

For best results, surround your Enchanting Table with bookshelves, leaving 1 block of empty space between the enchanting table and the bookshelves.

Chest loot: Enchanted Books potentially containing a Breach enchantment can be found in the Jungle Pyramid, Stronghold, Monster Room, Mineshaft, Ancient City, Desert Pyramid, Pillager Outpost, Underwater Ruins, Woodland Mansion, or Ominous Vault. Fishing: There is a 0.8% chance per fishing attempt to get an Enchanted Book. Librarians: Librarians of any level have a chance of trading a Breach Enchanted Book.
