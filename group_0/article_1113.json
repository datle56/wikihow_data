      "content": "Check the charging port for lint or debris. If you often carry your AirPods case in your pocket, purse, or backpack, the charging port may have collected dirt or debris. If this is the case, the case may not charge properly, as the contacts inside the charging port can't connect with the charging cable. First, use a flashlight to look inside the port to see if you can see any lint or debris. Then, insert a wooden or plastic toothpick into the charging port to gently dislodge and remove the debris. Avoid using metal or sharp instruments, as they can damage the charging port. Gently blow into the port to remove any loose or fine particles. If you have a can of compressed air on hand, you can use that insteadâ€”but be sure to spray gently and never spray the can upside down, which can release the coolant liquid and cause damage or injury."

If the cable won't stay connected to the charging port and/or the charging adapter, you may need to try a different cable or adapter ."
