      "content": "Slip on interesting earrings. [1] X Expert Source Sarah McDonald Certified Stylist & Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. Earrings can draw attention to your face and are a fun way to differentiate your uniform’s look. Experiment with different styles, such as studs, chandelier-style earrings, hoops or geometric earrings. You can also play with different materials, such as metals or acrylics, or different colors, to find the perfect combination that suits you. [2] X Research source Select earrings that match your personality. If you are loud and love to make jokes, maybe bright color hoops, such as neon pink, would suit you. If you’re a romantic, perhaps lace-appliqué earrings would best showcase who you are."

      "title": "Layer bracelets for more visual interest.",
      "content": "Layer bracelets for more visual interest. Layer lots of thin bracelets in different metals to add texture to your look. Wearing multiple chunky jewelry pieces can make your appearance seem sloppy. Opt for thin bracelets you can mix and match in silver, gold and bronze tones. [3] X Research source A three-quarter sleeve uniform top could be matched with a thin gold finger bracelet and lots of bangles for a pretty and unexpected look."

      "title": "Choose a statement necklace that fits your neckline.",
      "content": "Choose a statement necklace that fits your neckline. Wear a statement necklace with a shape that mimics that of your uniform neckline. If your school uniform has a blouse with a round collar, for example, try a statement necklace with a rounded shape. Whether you prefer a statement necklace that is thick, very colorful, or both, opt for just one rather than layering several, which can be distracting. A navy V-neck sweater could look nice with a V-shaped statement necklace in gold. A khaki uniform dress with a square collar might look nice with a bib necklace in olive green."

      "title": "Wear an eye-catching watch that complements your uniform colors.",
      "content": "Wear an eye-catching watch that complements your uniform colors. Use the face or strap of a watch to highlight a color in your uniform. This will make the whole look cohesive but also more interesting. Or, if your uniform colors are very drab, add some pop by selecting a watch in a fun color you love. [4] X Research source If your uniform skirt is a green, blue and red plaid, you could wear a watch with a red strap to highlight that tone. If your uniform is white and tan, you could choose a watch with a purple face to provide interest and contrast."

      "title": "Switch up the frames of your glasses.",
      "content": "Switch up the frames of your glasses. Choose glasses in a new shape or fun color to differentiate your look. Frames are a great way to express yourself, as they come in a variety of shapes, such as square, cat eye or round. They also come in all the colors of the rainbow, as well as interesting patterns, such as tortoise shell. Make your uniform look more interesting by choosing glasses with some personality. [5] X Research source For example, a cat eye frame in a tortoise shell color could be flirty and interesting. Square glasses with navy frames could highlight navy in your uniform."

      "title": "Express yourself with a tie.",
      "content": "Express yourself with a tie. Make yourself feel more unique by choosing a tie with a print of your favorite hobby or even favorite color. Often school uniforms are formal, and some may even require you to wear a tie. This is a great way to show your style even within a strict dress code. [6] X Research source If you’re into baseball, you could pick a tie with bats and balls printed on it. If you love the color orange, choose a tangerine or peach color tie for a formal look that goes with your uniform. A tie bar is also an interesting way to add flair to your look."

      "title": "Carry an interesting bag.",
      "content": "Carry an interesting bag. Select a bag with cool features like fringe, a unique print, or cool material. You can even decorate your bag by drawing on it or adding patches or glitter. Often school handbooks have stricter rules about what you can wear but more lax rules for things like bags that you carry with you but are not a part of your clothing. [7] X Research source You could add patches of your favorite band to your book bag, for example. If you like to dress up, you could carry a patent leather purse in a jewel tone, such as purple or teal."

      "title": "Try a cool belt buckle.",
      "content": "Try a cool belt buckle. Choose a belt buckle that reflects your style or a unique interest of yours. Since many school uniforms require belts, a belt with a surprising buckle is a fun, everyday way to express your style. If you’re into comic books, you could get a belt with a batman buckle. If you like a feminine look, you could choose a belt in a thin leather with a gold buckle."

      "title": "Play with headbands.",
      "content": "Play with headbands. [8] X Expert Source Sarah McDonald Certified Stylist & Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. Choose a headband that lies flat against the head for the most wearable look. You can use a headband to pick up a color you like in your uniform or even add a little sparkle to your look. Experiment with prints and different widths to find a headband that you like. [9] X Research source A headband can be particularly interesting if you have short hair, like a pixie cut. Try wearing a headband with your hair up or down to see which look you like best."

      "content": "Wear a scarf. [10] X Expert Source Sarah McDonald Certified Stylist & Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. Play with scarves in different materials and prints to add interest to your school uniform. You can style them in a Parisian way tied around your neck, around the handle of a bag to add some color, or around your hair like a headband. Silk, cotton and linen are all versatile materials to consider. [11] X Research source If you like an edgy, modern look when you’re not at school, you could choose a geometric scarf in a bright print. If you a like a softer look, try a floral scarf in pastel colors."

      "title": "Secure your hair with an interesting clip.",
      "content": "Secure your hair with an interesting clip. Use a hair clip instead of a plain hair band to dress up your uniform and express yourself. You could choose a clip with a motif you like or a clip covered in printed fabric for some color. [12] X Research source If you’re dreaming of the beach, you could choose a pearlescent clip in the shape of a seashell. If you love dogs, try a clip with a paw-and-bone print. You can use the clip to secure your hair in a ponytail or try using one to clip your bangs out of your face."

      "title": "Try wearing hats.",
      "content": "Try wearing hats. Any hat indoors is a bold choice, so opt for a sophisticated hat to elevate your uniform. Avoid extravagant or large hats, such as a sombrero, which will seem like a costume. For a feminine look, you could try a small fascinator in black or navy, or if you like a throwback, don a fedora in a color that matches your uniform. [13] X Research source If allowed, you could try a more casual style, such as a baseball cap, in a more sophisticated fabric, such as a gray flannel."

    {
      "title": "Switch to a new style.",
      "content": "Switch to a new style. Embrace a new style of shoe, such as a different height or toe, to add interest to your look. If you usually wear wedges, you could try a neat ballet flat. If you usually wear an open-toed sandal, try a short boot to switch things up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play with color in a traditional style.",
      "content": "Play with color in a traditional style. If the style of shoe you can wear is restricted by the dress code, wear a fun color for a new twist. Burgundy, forest green and cobalt are all subdued enough to satisfy many school dress codes while still setting you apart. If shoe color is highly restricted, try swapping in some different laces for a new look."

    {
      "title": "Embrace patterns for a funky look.",
      "content": "Embrace patterns for a funky look. Try shoes with a floral, geometric, or other pattern to liven up your uniform. Since most uniforms are in flat, neutral colors, embracing a pattern on your feet can add color and interest to your look. Plus, since shoes are not a huge accessory, even loud or busy patterns are often very wearable. [14] X Research source Try a polka-dotted kitten heel for a retro spin on your uniform, for example. You could try a ballet flat in a blue floral pattern to go with a navy uniform, for example."

      "title": "Bedazzle or bejewel your shoes.",
      "content": "Bedazzle or bejewel your shoes. You can add some sparkle to your shoes by gluing on glitter or using a bedazzler to add gems and grommets. This is a fun and playful look that sets your shoes apart, even if they have to meet various other rules. You could try bedazzling just the toe, or adding glitter to only the heel as a creative accent. [15] X Research source"
