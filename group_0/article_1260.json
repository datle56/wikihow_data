      "title": "Angel shots are a drink that bar patrons order when they feel unsafe.",
      "content": "Angel shots are a drink that bar patrons order when they feel unsafe. Angel shots are not an actual drink—instead, the phrase is a coded message. Whenever a guest feels uncomfortable, unsafe, or in need of outside assistance for any reason, they can ask the bartender for an “angel shot” to alert them to the situation. Then, the bartender can take the appropriate action to discreetly ensure that the guest’s safety is ensured without causing a scene or escalating the situation. [1] X Research source Often, these shots are ordered by women who feel unsafe around a man who they suspect has ill intentions. Often, this “code” is needed because the guest or customer doesn’t feel comfortable asking for help directly. Maybe the person who’s making them feel unsafe is listening in, so they use the “angel shot” order to ask for help without drawing attention to themselves. There are different types of angel shot orders for different situations, so the bar staff can immediately understand whether a guest needs an escort to their car or for the police to be called, for instance. [2] X Research source Who can order an angel shot? Most angel shots are ordered by women since they are more likely to feel unsafe in bars, on dates, and in public areas. [3] X Research source However, anyone who feels unsafe can order an angel shot, regardless of their age, race, gender, sexuality, or level of intoxication. If you’re wondering if you should order an angel shot, remember that your safety always comes first, and it’s better to be safe than sorry. If you have any doubt about your current and imminent wellbeing, prioritize your safety by discreetly reaching out for help."

      "title": "Angel Shot Straight Up (or Neat)",
      "content": "Angel Shot Straight Up (or Neat) Asking for an angel shot “neat,” “straight,” “or “straight up” means that a guest needs to be escorted to their car by one or more staff members. These individuals likely feel uncomfortable with a situation at the bar and want to ensure that they can safely get to their vehicle without being followed or harassed. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that certain bars may have their own variations of this code. If so, their codes will be advertised discreetly on their menus or in the bathroom stalls. When in doubt, order a basic “angel shot” so that the servers know you need some kind of help."

      "title": "Angel Shot on Ice (or On the Rocks)",
      "content": "Angel Shot on Ice (or On the Rocks) Asking for an angel shot “on ice” or “on the rocks” means that a guest needs to be escorted to a rideshare vehicle or taxi by a member of the staff. A bartender or other staff member should call a cab or other rideshare vehicle, then immediately escort this guest to their safe mode of transportation and ensure that they enter it without any interference.

      "title": "Angel Shot with a Twist (or with Lemon/Lime)",
      "content": "Angel Shot with a Twist (or with Lemon/Lime) Asking for an angel shot “with a twist,” “with lemon,” or “with lime” means that a guest needs a staff member to contact the local authorities immediately. This shot is usually employed as a last resort when a customer feels highly unsafe to the point that they need police intervention. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Act as normal as possible while being alert and ready to take action.",
      "content": "Act as normal as possible while being alert and ready to take action. If you’re a bartender and one of your customers has ordered an angel shot, it’s important to maintain your composure—as if you’re dealing with a typical drink order—while cautiously monitoring the situation in the bar. Most importantly, it’s your job to unflinchingly believe that the guest is unsafe and get help in the most discreet and efficient way possible. [7] X Research source Some customers may be trying to act as normally as possible while ordering the shot—just because they’re smiling or seem like they’re in good humor is not a reason to believe that everything’s okay."

    {
      "title": "Pour a non-alcoholic shot for the guest and try to assess the situation.",
      "content": "Pour a non-alcoholic shot for the guest and try to assess the situation. In order to make the angel shot seem like a legitimate drink order (and not give away that it’s a code word for something else), pour the guest any sort of non-alcoholic shot—e.g., water, tonic, soda, juice, etc. You can even pretend to ring up the order in your point-of-sale system in order to avoid rousing suspicion. [8] X Research source If the potential harasser, abuser, or unsafe individual becomes suspicious, they may take action and remove your guest from the bar before you have a chance to help them. As you pour the drink, try to identify who they’re trying to avoid and see if you can discreetly get the person alone to ask them exactly what they need."

      "title": "Depending on the order, alert bar staff, call a taxi, and/or call the police.",
      "content": "Depending on the order, alert bar staff, call a taxi, and/or call the police . There are different types of angel shots for different scenarios—if the customer doesn’t clarify which type of angel shot they need, just ask. If they aren’t sure which type they need, take action anyway by alerting your bar manager or the authorities. In other cases, the patron may want you (or another member of your staff) to order a rideshare for them or to walk them to their car. [9] X Research source If possible, call over another bartender to let them know that the customer ordered an angel shot. Then, your colleague can call for help and alert the rest of the team while you’re keeping an eye on the customer—someone should stay with them at all times, from when they order the shot to when their ride or the authorities arrive. If the patron requests a taxi or rideshare, you can let them know that their “angel shot is ready” when their ride arrives. Then, ask a coworker to accompany you and the guest to their vehicle. If the patron is at their table when they order an angel shot, tell them that you have a selection of “angel shot specials” at the bar and firmly ask them to come look at the menu. Once you have them alone at the bar, you’ll be able to further inquire about the situation or escort them to their car without interruption."

      "content": "Not all bartenders know what an angel shot is, but the vast majority do. Over the past years, the general public awareness of angel shots has grown, so it’s safe to assume that most people who work consistently in bars will understand what an angel shot is. However, that doesn’t mean that every bartender will be trained to swiftly and discreetly respond to an angel shot request. [10] X Research source However, it’s still worth it to order an angel shot even if you’re unsure that the bartender will understand what you’re asking. You can simply respond to their confusion with “Oh, you must not serve them here” or ask them to look up a recipe, which should lead them to more information about the shot. At the very least, your unusual request will bring the bartender's attention to you, which may help you get out of any precarious or dangerous situations."

As important as it is to offer angel shots in your bar, it’s also important to teach your staff what they mean and how to safely and effectively respond to them. When onboarding new staff, include training on the angel shot and training skits that show the best (and worst) ways to handle the order. Also include the training information in your employee handbooks so that your bartenders can discreetly reference the handbook and act according to the instructed steps and precautions.

While many customers may already know what an angel shot is, others may need prompting to know what the shot is or even to realize they’re in an uncomfortable situation. To make customers aware that you can assist them in an uncertain or dangerous situation, hang a sign or otherwise (discreetly) advertise your angel shot program. Your angel shot sign should clearly and legibly include: An explanation of what an angel shot is.

It’s important to post your angel sign somewhere that at-risk patrons will see it—however, your advertising must also be discreet enough that a guest can order an angel shot without drawing any attention to themselves or making their situation known. Most bars hang their angel shot signs in the restrooms—especially the women’s restroom. However, other bars place small sections or QR codes on their menus so guests might notice the information without drawing the attention of their potential abuser. [13] X Research source You can also encourage staff to ask any customers who seem uncomfortable if they’d like an angel shot. A patron who feels unsafe or uneasy may not be comfortable enough to come to the bar and order a shot, or they may be prevented from doing so by another guest."

      "title": "Design distinct signs for male, female, and nonbinary customers.",
      "content": "Design distinct signs for male, female, and nonbinary customers. Since angel shots are primarily designed for women—the overwhelming targets of sexual assault and other types of violence—they’re usually only placed in women’s bathrooms. [14] X Research source This way, women will understand the significance of an “angel shot” while their male company will not, which adds to the code word’s effectiveness. [15] X Research source However, this system prevents men and non-binary individuals from getting help when they need it—1 out of every 10 sexual assault victims are male, while nearly half of all transgender and nonbinary individuals experience sexual assault in their lifetime. [16] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In order to protect patrons of all genders, consider having unique drinks and signs for men, women, and nonbinary people and placing them in their respective bathrooms (if your establishment has the facilities for three separate restrooms). For example, maybe women can be instructed to order an angel shot, while men may order a “Johnny Depp” shot and nonbinary people may order a “starlight shot.” [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid advertising your use of angel shots to the general public.",
      "content": "Avoid advertising your use of angel shots to the general public. Angel shots are only effective if the harassers, abusers, and other dangerous individuals in your bar do not know what they are when someone they intend to harm orders one. Therefore, avoid advertising angel shots as a selling point for your bar on social media or within advertising campaigns. If the wider public knows that your bar serves angel shots, it may prevent those with ill intent from visiting your establishment or escalate an already dangerous situation. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Aside from serving angel shots, it’s important for all bar managers and staff to be highly trained on and effectively deliver best safety practices for serving drinks and keeping patrons safe. Bars, restaurants, and other establishments that serve alcohol can be a hotspot for dangerous situations, and it’s the responsibility of staff to do everything in their power to minimize these situations. Here are some of the basic safety steps that every bar should be implementing to protect guests and prevent sexual assault : [19] X Research source Train staff to be on high alert if any drink is left unattended. Ensure no one drugs their drink, and prepare a new drink at no cost to the guest if there’s any chance that their drink was drugged. Keep an eye on anyone who may have had too much to drink. If other customers are feeling unsafe or are worried about this inebriated patron’s safety, follow established procedures to escort this person out of the bar or help them to sober up until they can safely head home. Designate a first-date dining spot for online dates. As dating apps become the cultural norm for how people meet their significant others, it’s also become clear that online dating can often lead to sexual assault. [20] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source To help mitigate this trend, set aside a table or bar corner for online first dates that’s near to members of staff who can monitor the date and any signs of danger."

      "content": "What does “Ask For Angela” mean? “Ask for Angela” is a phrase that originated in England but that has a similar purpose to the angel shot. Basically, bars and restaurants post signs about “Angela” to encourage guests (especially female guests) to ask a staff member for Angela if they feel unsafe for any reason. When a patron asks for Angela, the bartender will then follow established safety protocols to ensure the customer’s well-being. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "What is an angel cut with layers? An “ angel cut with layers ” is a code phrase used by women to discreetly express that they’re in an abusive relationship. Unlike angel shots and the “Ask for Angela” phrase, this code is primarily used at hair salons. If a woman is seeking help to escape domestic abuse or another abusive situation, she can tell her hairdresser that she’d like an “angel cut with layers.” The staff member will then take the appropriate steps to ensure her client’s safety. [22] X Research source This code phrase is especially effective since women are usually sitting alone when at the hair salon, away from anyone who may be abusing or harming them."
