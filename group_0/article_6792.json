If you have two individual mono tracks (or a mono and a stereo track) that you want to join into a single stereo track, the process is super easy. You can also pan each track left or right to customize how much of each track you'll hear in the left and right speakers. [1] X Research source If you only have a single mono track that you want to convert to stereo with custom panning (such as vocals you recorded), you'll want to duplicate the track first. Just select the track, go to Edit , then select Duplicate so you have two separate identical tracks. If you're starting with a stereo track that you want to edit as two separate mono tracks (one for each channel), click the down-arrow next to the track's name, then select Split Stereo to Mono ."

For the top track, you'll want to drag the slider that has an \"L\" on one side and an \"R\" on the other to reflect how prominent this track should play through the left speaker. It's important to have the panning be at least a little bit different for each track to get stereo-width sound. [2] X Research source For example, if you only want this track to play on the left speaker, you'd drag the slider all the way to the \"L\" to pan 100%. If you wanted the track to play mostly in the left speaker but also a little bit on the right speaker, you can pan to 75%."

[3] X Research source If you want to edit either of the tracks , you can do so now.
