      "content": "Use different absorbencies on different days. For most people, flow is the heaviest on days 1-3 of their cycle. After this, the flow usually begins tapering off (for days 3-7 or longer). You can use higher absorbency tampons on your heavy flow days, and switch to lower absorbency as your period begins to taper off. Look for tampons sold in variety packs, with multiple absorbency levels in one package. You may want to use a panty liner or pad as a back-up on heavy flow days."

      "content": "Start with slender tampons. If you are new to using tampons, or if you find regular tampons too bulky, look for tampons that labeled Junior, Slim, or Slim fit. These tampons can be easier to insert, and can be more comfortable for some people.

If you are new to using tampons, plastic applicator tampons can be the easiest to insert. But all applicator types have their benefits. [7] X Research source Plastic applicator - These tend to be the easiest to insert (for most people). Extendable applicator - These are usually made of plastic and are designed to be more discreet. To use, you first pull down on the applicator to extend it. Cardboard applicator - These are the least expensive type of tampons, and are commonly found in vending machines. Digital tampon (applicator-free) - These tampons are inserted using your finger. Some people find these easier. They are also discreet and produce less waste."
