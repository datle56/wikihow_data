Combine ½ cup (136 g) of baking soda, 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 ml) of hydrogen peroxide, and 1 tsp (4.9 ml) of dish soap in a small bowl. Keep stirring the mixture until it forms a thick paste that’s easy to apply to the grout between your floor tiles. [1] X Research source Hydrogen peroxide paste works on any type of grout whether it’s sealed or unsealed. Baking soda acts as a natural abrasive to scrub away stains and build-up while the hydrogen peroxide helps cut through discoloration. The added dish soap helps loosen dirt and remove grease.

Either stand on the towel and slide your feet along the grout lines, or work on your hands and knees to scrub the floor by hand. As a section of the towel gets dirty, fold it over and use a clean section so you don’t spread the dirt back onto your floor. [6] X Research source"

Then, spray the vinegar solution directly onto the baking soda paste so it’s thoroughly coated. The paste will immediately start bubbling once you apply the vinegar spray, which lets you know that the cleaner has started working. [9] X Research source Avoid using vinegar on natural stone tiles or unsealed grout since it could leave marks or damage on the surface. Just use the baking soda by itself instead."
