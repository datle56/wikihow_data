To turn off notifications for a specific user, do the following: Tap your profile icon and select Settings (the cog icon). Tap Notifications . Scroll all the way down and tap Manage Story Notifications . Select the user to stop their Story notifications. If you continue to receive Story notifications in Snapchat, you can choose to silence all Snapchat notifications instead. On iPhone: Open the Settings app and tap Apps . Go to Snapchat > Notifications and toggle off Allow Notifications . On Android: Open the Settings app and tap Notifications . Go to App Notifications > Snapchat and then toggle off notifications."
