[2] X Expert Source Collette Gee Relationship Coach & Certified Violence Prevention Specialist Expert Interview. 1 May 2020. It might be in the hallway, at the water fountain, on a sports field after practice, or wherever else you usually see him. Pick an isolated place, as well as a time when he is likely to be relaxed. Here are some things to keep in mind when you choose the right time and place: Get a little privacy. You do not have to be completely alone, but you will both probably be more comfortable if you can do the actual asking in a semi-private space. People may not respond honestly when their friends are hanging around and they feel pressured, so some privacy can help you get a real answer. Do not make a big deal about pouncing on the first available second of alone time. If you're both together in a group, lower your voice to half volume and say, \"Hey, could I talk to you alone for a second?\" and walk a few paces away. Do not give off creepy vibes. Things like silently standing in front of his locker every morning, calling him then hanging up over and over, or constantly asking other people about him may come off as creepy--and something a stalker may do. Give your crush some space. Do not follow him around in real life or on-line. A little recon is fine, but following his every move gets into an unhealthy obsession. Pick a time and place that makes sense. Asking him out after drama rehearsal may be perfect, a 1:30 a.m. text may not be."

[3] X Expert Source Collette Gee Relationship Coach & Certified Violence Prevention Specialist Expert Interview. 1 May 2020. It spares you the stress of coming up with something to do while you're on the actual date, and won't leave you saying \"Uhhh... I don't know\" when he asks what the plan is. Here are some ideas to get you started: Don't think too hard about negative thoughts like 'he will laugh at me', 'he will reject me', 'he will friend-zone me' etc. Remember that guys feel and think the same way when they approach a girl which is the main reason why so many guys exist in the so-called 'friend-zone'. The truth is you will find out only after asking, muster up some courage, ask him out. You can do it! You may be surprised to find how they would react as most guys are quite easy to talk to as compared to girls. Plan a classic date. There are some tried-and-true activities to do together for dates: Dinner: at a restaurant, or at home with takeout, or something you made. Activity: seeing a movie, going to a concert or show, visiting a museum, comic book convention, a hike, a baseball game or another interest you two have in common. Pick something that specifically appeals to your target date. Sometimes you may not sure if you share common interests, or you are not sure if you like something he likes. Find out what he enjoys, and give it a try. Very often this is a great way to show you are really interested in finding out more about what he likes, and willing to try something new for his sake!

If this guy isn't into you, it doesn’t mean someone else won’t be. You should actually feel proud because it takes courage to actually tell someone you like them. If he said yes… congratulations!

Though you should focus on the best case scenario (a resounding yes!) instead of the worst, you do need to be aware that there is always a chance that the guy won't say yes. Maybe he likes someone else, or maybe he was startled and only thought of you as a friend -- either way, you'll get through it. But if you want to make the most of the situation and not lose your cool, you should come up with a Plan B in case things don't go as planned. Come up with a reason to leave in advance. Whether it's saying that you have to study for a test, get to your next class, or that you're late to meet up with a friend, it'll sound better if you've prepared it. [5] X Research source Come up with something else to ask in case you can tell he's not feeling it. If you approach him and he's clearly not in the mood to get asked out, think of something else you can ask him so it doesn't look weird that you came up to him -- ask for the math homework or if he knows when the home baseball team is playing that day."

      "content": "Use the \"extra ticket\" trick. Buy two tickets to see a movie, a concert, a stand-up comedian, or anything that you think will interest the guy. Then, when you start talking to the guy, casually mention the event and add, \"Ugh, my friend completely bailed on me...\" if the guy doesn't take the bait and ask to come, just say, \"Is there any chance you'd like to go? I've been dying to see this show, and I think it'll be fun.\" Make it sound very casual, like you thought of it on the spot. This is a perfect low-pressure way to ask a guy out. However, be careful. If you are too vague on your intentions, your guy might think he is going as a friend, not as a date."

If you and your guy are hanging out with a group of couples, or even just a group of friends, then it'll feel less like a date and more like hanging out. Just tell the guy that you and a bunch of friends are going bowling, to the movies, to dinner, or whatever, and ask if he'd like to come along. [6] X Research source A group date can help him know that you'll be asking him out but neither of you will feel the same pressure you'd feel if you were going at it alone. If the group date goes well, then hopefully that will lead to a regular date. Try not to be too vague on your intentions. A group date may be indistinguishable from a group of mixed-gender friends hanging out. Your date may not know he is on a date and leads to awkward situations."

(Rather than something women tend to enjoy more, like going to get nails done!) Find out what he likes to do first. Although there are activities that typically appeal to men more than women, you might be surprised. If going to the movies, try to pick a movie that has broad appeal. An action blockbuster movie might be a fun one for you both. Be sure you enjoy the activity, too. You do not want to end up always going to the local go-cart place because your guy thinks you like go-carts, but really you do not."

Then, mention a new movie that's playing or a concert that's coming to town, trying to make sure that it appeals to him. Wait for him to say how much he likes this concert or band, and if he really doesn't get the message, then say, \"I've really wanted to see that movie too. Want to go check it out over the weekend?\" If you really want to act casual about it, you can add, \"I can't think of anyone else who wants to go with me\" or \"none of my friends like that band...\" [7] X Research source"

Simply say, \"Want to go out sometime?\" and leave him your phone number. This works great with guys that you don't know very well, and it takes the pressure off. Not only is this an effective method, but it'll make the guy think that you're cute and a little bit creative. If you really want to be romantic about it, you can even ask him out through a letter, as long as it doesn't freak him out."

When you go up to talk to him make sure your friends are in sight so that they can help you. Tell him all the reasons why you like him and then tell him you like him because it will give him a confidence boost and your chances of getting rejected will be a little slimmer. It's best if you ask him if he's free on a specific day and tell him your plans and if he likes them there's a chance he'll say yes. Let him know that if the date doesn't work out you'll still be willing to be his friend and if it does then you can go on a second date. He wants to know you won't be so mad. Say something like \"hey you know you're smart, kind, funny, etc. and you know I like you. Maybe if you're free on Friday night we could go out to dinner and watch a movie. We could go alone or with some friends and if it doesn't work out I won't be mad we could stay friends.\" Something like that so that he is willing to say yes or just say everything and change the friends part. Like if he says yes say \"okay, well is it alright if some friends come or just you and me\" that way he knows you care about his opinion. Another way to do it is say \"Hey, me and my friend were supposed to go out to dinner and she invited her boyfriend. Maybe you could come with me and be my date because I like you. You're smart, funny, and super nice. What do you say? You know if you're free on Friday night?\" Then, wait for his answer."
