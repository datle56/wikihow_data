      "title": "Treat yourself to a restaurant-quality dinner and try a new recipe.",
      "content": "Treat yourself to a restaurant-quality dinner and try a new recipe. Is there a recipe or a type of food you’ve been dying to try lately? Seize the day and give it a shot! Choose a recipe to make for dinner and gather all the ingredients—you might have everything or a trip to the grocery store might be in order. Whip up dinner for yourself and enjoy the taste of a gourmet home-cooked meal. [1] X Research source Have some fun with it! Play your favorite tunes while you cook and sing along to pass the time—nobody’s there to judge you if you dance around your kitchen a little. Make the meal feel extra special by prepping (or buying) a delicious side and having one of your favorite drinks with dinner."

      "title": "Start a new program or catch up on your current favorite show.",
      "content": "Start a new program or catch up on your current favorite show. What’s wrong with a night of binge-watching? Absolutely nothing! If work or your social life keeps you busy, it’s easy to fall behind on all the programs you’ve been meaning to watch—so spend the night watching your TV show of choice. It can be really nice to watch whatever you want without having to take someone else’s preferences into account. [2] X Research source Alternatively, have a movie marathon! Play a few movies you’ve been dying to see, or have a nostalgia night and play all of your favorite feel-good movies from over the years."

      "title": "Take some time to pamper yourself and relax at the end of the week.",
      "content": "Take some time to pamper yourself and relax at the end of the week. You deserve some peace and comfort, so why not create a spa night for yourself? Take a luxurious bath (complete with a bath bomb, bubbles, or essential oils), light some scented candles, and apply face and hair masks. A makeshift spa can be an amazing way to de-stress, helping you feel rejuvenated for the weekend (and week) ahead. [3] X Research source Make the spa night extra special with a glass of wine and a good book while you soak in the tub. Give yourself a mani-pedi after the bath if you want your nails to look a little fancy too."

      "title": "Catch them up on everything that’s been going on in your life.",
      "content": "Catch them up on everything that’s been going on in your life. Just because you don’t have plans with anyone on Friday night, doesn’t mean one of your friends or family members isn’t available for a chat. Call up someone you care about but haven’t really spoken to in a while—or, alternatively, give your BFF or your parents a buzz. Staying in touch is super important for your relationships, especially if you have a busy work life! [4] X Research source Making a Friday night phone call is a super simple (but effective) way to reconnect with friends you don’t see often and let them know you still care. Or, if you and your bestie have been busy lately, then a Friday night alone can be a golden opportunity to shoot them a friendly “What’s up with you? Got time for a call?” text so you can catch up."

      "title": "Pick a game that catches your eye and spend the night exploring it.",
      "content": "Pick a game that catches your eye and spend the night exploring it. Do you love games? A solo Friday night is absolutely the right time to choose a new adventure to get lost in (or pick up where you left off in whatever game you’re playing currently). Check out platforms like Steam or GOG for your next game if you have a computer. If you have a console, access its online store to see your options. Not sure which video game to play? Take a video game quiz to get some suggestions!"

      "title": "Take an online class or watch a tutorial to learn a new skill.",
      "content": "Take an online class or watch a tutorial to learn a new skill. Is there a skill you’ve always wanted to learn but never seemed to have the time? Well, there’s no time like the present! Find an online class or tutorial that aligns with your interests, from skills like knitting and drawing to playing musical instruments. When you’re alone on a Friday night, expand your knowledge and upgrade your skills. Platforms like Skillshare , Udemy , and MasterClass have a ton of courses for you to take. YouTube also has plenty of video tutorials that are free to watch. Other specialized platforms and apps can teach you things, too. For example, if you want to learn a new language, Duolingo is a great resource!"

      "title": "Declutter, organize your living space or redecorate if you need a change.",
      "content": "Declutter, organize your living space or redecorate if you need a change. Spend some time making your home look the absolute best it can be! Throw away things you don’t need or, if possible, donate them to declutter . Organize any areas that don't have a lot of structure currently. And, if there’s a room in your house that you’ve been dreaming of redecorating, go for it. Reorganize the furniture, and do some online shopping for decor. For example, if your kitchen pantry has no organization whatsoever, or your office space is overflowing with papers and folders, come up with an organizational system for them! If your bedroom’s layout feels a little stale, move around the big furniture pieces, like your bed, bookshelves, and dressers (if you have them). Then, head to your favorite online store and find a new accessory or two to give your room a brand-new vibe."

      "content": "Curl up with a book you’ve been meaning to read and relax. Do you have a list of unread books at home? Get started on it! Grab a book from your bookshelf or pull up a book on an e-reader platform like Kindle and Google iBooks. Find the comfiest reading spot in your home and spend your evening in a book, enjoying a whole new world created by the author. It’s a great way to fight off any loneliness you might be feeling. [5] X Research source Pay a visit to your local library and peruse the reading options there if you don’t currently have a book you’ve been meaning to read at home. You definitely don’t have to read a novel if there’s something else more interesting to you. Pick up a comic book, graphic novel, or magazine instead! Anything that suits your interests is the perfect reading material."

      "content": "Try an at-home workout routine or hit the gym for a couple of hours. Working out can help you stay fit, and it's also a fantastic mood booster—the endorphins you get from exercise can help you feel happier! So, if you’re feeling a little bored or lonely on a Friday night, put on your exercise clothes and get your blood pumping with the workout of your choice. [6] X Research source Play some music while you exercise; it can help to put an extra spring in your step! Head to the gym to use machines like a treadmill or elliptical (or if the gym offers a class you’d like to take, like Zumba or indoor cycling)."

      "content": "Take yourself out on an elegant date. The most important thing to remember is that you should never feel awkward about eating alone! It’s not unheard of, and nobody will judge you for it—least of all the staff at the restaurant. Taking yourself on solo “dates” can be a really nice way to pamper yourself, so don’t be afraid to hit up your favorite restaurant alone and have a delicious meal. [7] X Research source Bring a book or a notebook to scribble your thoughts in if you need something to do while you eat. Otherwise, simply make sure you have your smartphone and stream funny videos while eating."

Check your local listing and buy a ticket to whichever movie sounds most appealing to you. If you have the funds, indulge in some theater popcorn and a soft drink, and enjoy the movie! It’s actually very easy to go to the movie theater by yourself—after all, most people don’t talk much while the movie is playing anyway!"

Then spend the evening planning a quick getaway for the rest of your weekend (or, if the current weekend is busy, plan for a different one in the near future).

Put together an itinerary for yourself, and when you’re ready, start booking your trip! Traveling solo can be really fun!

Use whatever ingredients you have at home, or head to the liquor store for whatever supplies you need to make your favorite drink. Mix the cocktail at home, and enjoy it with dinner or dessert, or sip on it while you do another activity (like reading or watching a show). Are you a fan of classic cocktails? Try making a mojito or mixing up a margarita. If you’re feeling bold, try creating your own basic cocktail instead! If you don’t drink, you can still enjoy a fancy mocktail and get the satisfying taste without any alcohol."

As you find things you like, add them to a wishlist so you can go back for them later. Don’t forget to see what’s on sale at the moment! You might find an especially sweet deal."

Grab your journal (or a blank notebook if you haven’t started a journal yet) and write an entry to start things off. Write about anything you like—maybe you’ve had an eventful week and want to process it, or maybe you have a dilemma and want to weigh the pros and cons, for example. No matter what you write about, you’ll likely feel better after expressing your thoughts on the page! Try lighting a scented candle to help you relax and create a comforting atmosphere while you write. Make sure to sit somewhere cozy, too."

Simple though it may sound, taking a walk can be a great way to unwind, enjoy the scenery, breathe the fresh air, and get some non-strenuous exercise at the same time.

Pack a meal (ideally one that’ll travel easily) for yourself in a bag or basket and head out to a public area where you can enjoy it—like a park or beach. Eat dinner in the great outdoors, take in the sights, and bring a book or some music to entertain yourself as well. If you like, end the night with some stargazing! Bring a blanket from home and lay it outside so you can gaze up at the stars for a while."
