Submerge the bottle and let it soak for at least a couple of minutes. Hot water does a better job of loosening grease and oil and also prevents streaking. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Put dish soap and a small handful of uncooked rice into the bottle. There should be enough rice so that it forms a thick layer at the top of the water. The rice acts as an abrasive and each grain will do its share of scrubbing the sides down, so be sure to add enough to clean the sides thoroughly. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Shake the bottle vigorously.",
      "content": "Shake the bottle vigorously. The water, soap, and rice should wash over every part of the interior surface. Make sure to swirl the rice so that it comes in contact with the bottle. Do this until every oil streak and bit of grease residue is gone. Make sure there is enough free space left in the bottle for allow the materials inside to pick up momentum within a few seconds of shaking. Look at the inside of the bottle after every thirty seconds of shaking to see which spots need the most cleaning, and then alter bottle movements in order to reach those places.
