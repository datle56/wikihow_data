      "content": "Angel number 1117 is a sign to cultivate your spiritual side. You’re highly independent and hardworking. But you may be focusing too much on the material aspect of life and success. Your angels want you to remember you are a divine creature with access to all the wisdom of the universe, if only you’ll hone your spiritual sight and learn to trust your intuition. In numerology, the number 1 represents new beginnings, creativity, and self-reliance. 7 represents spiritual enlightenment and opening your third eye. [1] X Research source A series of repeated numbers (like 111) indicates a sequence of stability or sameness, but when that sequence is interrupted (such as by a 7), it’s a sign something will (or should) interrupt that stability…."

      "content": "In terms of romance, 1117 is a sign to let go of the past. Whether you’re currently single or in a relationship, dwelling on past wounds can make it hard to live fully in the now or to move forward into a bright future. Identity what past hurts still haven’t healed. What are you afraid to face? Sit with the pain of your wounds. It hurts, but it’s the only way to let go of the past. Consider speaking with a trusted friend or current partner or [ a therapist ] about what’s clinging to you from the past. Opening up about what still haunts you may help you release it."

      "content": "If you’re single, practice opening your heart to others. Whether you’re content being alone or you’re looking for the One, opening your heart will help you live a more fulfilling life—and it may help the One find you. Maybe you feel closed off due to past pain, and you’re afraid to trust other people, whether platonically or romantically. Or perhaps your natural hyper-independence makes it difficult for you to rely on others. In either case, take small steps this week to become closer to others—either to your friends, potential lovers, or total strangers. Ask open-ended questions to get to know them better, and practice being open about your own inner world: your dreams, fears, and desires. Reader Poll: We asked 234 wikiHow readers what the most important quality in a good friend is, and 57% of them said Honesty. [Take Poll] Seeing 1117 is a sign you should be more honest with others to build closer bonds."

      "content": "If you’re in a relationship, work on open communication. Even if you believe you’ve found your soulmate , there’s still work to be done to cultivate a strong relationship. Practice communicating openly with your partner to build trust, mutual understanding, and respect. It’s easy to feel that your partner innately understands you—or to believe they should. But take it as a general rule that if you don’t share what you feel, want, or need, they’re very unlikely to know. Maybe there’s something you need to discuss with your partner but have been holding off mentioning, or maybe you generally find it difficult to express yourself in your relationship. Open communication can be difficult and even scary at times, but it’s how a strong relationship is made stronger."

      "content": "This number is a sign you’re on the right career path. Be self-assured: you’ve got what it takes to succeed in your chosen field, so don’t lose focus now! 1117 is a sign you’ve chosen your career path wisely—we celebrate this! But don’t slow down now: keep going even when the path seems hard to figure out. Don’t be afraid to push yourself at work right now. Maybe this means gunning for a promotion or applying for a more promising position elsewhere—the important thing is to not doubt your abilities or your angels’ faith in you. At the same time, realize that you can work hard and dedicate yourself to your career without micromanaging your whole life: let your coworkers take over on projects now and again, and give yourself enough time to rest."

      "content": "If you haven’t met your twin flame, you may soon. 1117 is a sign that something new is coming around the corner, something metaphysical and powerful that will shake up your sense of independence and solitude. And that “something” may be your twin flame—the one person in the universe who shares your soul. Meeting your twin flame is an exciting experience, one only few people are lucky enough to have. But if you’re used to being on your own and doing things your way, it can be jarring to suddenly have to make room for someone who knows you so well. Don’t be afraid to open up your heart to a new love (and your twin flame may be platonic or romantic). The twin flame relationship can be challenging, but it’s sure to transform your life."

      "title": "If you’ve found your twin flame, practice relying on them.",
      "content": "If you’ve found your twin flame, practice relying on them. It can be hard to sacrifice some independence to a relationship as intense as the twin flame relationship, but know that giving in a little will make your bond richer and stronger. Your twin flame knows you better than anyone—so let them! Cultivate some intimacy with your flame by spending time together and forcing yourself to rely on them for small things—like planning your next outing or picking up groceries. Over time, they may prove themselves to be not only reliable, but invested in you and your bond. Giving up some independence here doesn’t mean losing yourself entirely or becoming codependent—it just means learning to trust others with your heart and become a little more vulnerable."

      "content": "Practice honing your intuition. You’ve got a good head on your shoulders and you know you’re capable of making it in the world, thanks to your wits and material know-how—but don’t be afraid to move beyond the physical and lean into your metaphysical prowess. “Trust your gut!” may be easier said than done, but it’s possible to train your intuition through practice.

Start small: practice not second-guessing yourself when it comes to “minor” things, like where to eat for lunch or what to wear to work. In time, you’ll get into a habit of listening to your gut when it speaks to you."

      "content": "Try letting go of some of your control. For a long time—maybe forever?—you’ve had everything handled. But trying to control everything in your life is not only not possible, it can leave you feeling isolated and mistrustful of others. This week, try letting go of your grip on life where you can. Try your best, but don’t shoulder the responsibility for every little thing. Meditation and breathing exercises can help you relinquish some anxiety and your need for control. Try the 478 breathing exercise: breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 7, and then breathe out through your mouth for 8 seconds.
