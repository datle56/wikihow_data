      "title": "Decide on a specialty.",
      "content": "Decide on a specialty. It's common for image consultants to choose a particular type of service to provide. You might decide to specialize in fashion and style consulting, and help clients build a flattering wardrobe, as well as provide makeup and hair tips. You may choose to focus on etiquette and communication skills to help clients project a more confident, polished image. However, you may prefer to give advice on all facets of a person's image, providing style, etiquette, and communications assistance to help individuals become the complete package. [6] X Research source You can also choose to specialize in certain types of clients, such as job seekers, executives, beauty pageant contestants, singles, or cancer survivors. Some image consultants choose to work exclusively with corporate clients instead of individuals, so they provide advice regarding employee uniforms, communications and body language for sales teams, and multicultural etiquette.

      "content": "Develop strategic partnerships. While an image consultant needs to have knowledge of fashion, makeup, hair, and other image related topics, you may not have the necessary skills to help your clients actually make changes. For example, you might be able to help a client choose a new hair color and style, but you may not have the training to actually do the cut and color work. That's why it's important to develop partnerships with makeup artists, hair stylists, and personal trainers, who you can refer your clients to. In turn, these partners can recommend you to individuals who are interested in a complete makeover. [8] X Research source You may also want to develop partnerships with dietitians, cosmetic surgeons, dentists, and vocal coaches. It's important to find partners whose skills you really trust, so it's best to work with individuals who you have personal experience with. For example, if you have a hair stylist who's always given you great cuts, ask her or him if s/he would like to partner with you."

      "content": "Offer free makeovers. You need experience working with individuals to convince clients that you're qualified to help revamp their image. Start by offering friends and family free makeovers. For example, if you have a friend who's going to a school reunion, take her shopping for new clothes and provide tips for her makeup and hair. Make sure to take before and after photos of all of your makeovers too. [9] X Research source If you don't have enough friends and family members who are interested in makeovers, consider offering your services to local charities, such as a homeless shelter where individuals might need tips preparing for job interviews."

      "content": "Create a portfolio. Prospective clients aren't just going to take your word for it when you tell them that you can successfully help them improve their image; they're going to want to see visual proof. That's why a portfolio of your successful makeovers is a must when you're trying to get clients. Even if you've only given free makeovers, before and after photos show potential clients what kind of results they can expect. [10] X Research source Make sure that your portfolio has high quality photos. If possible, take them with a digital camera instead of the one on your phone. Pay attention to the lighting in your photos. You want prospective clients to be able to see all of the details in your makeovers. It's a good idea to have both a physical portfolio that you can bring to meetings with clients, and a digital version that you can send to potential clients who may not be willing to commit to a meeting."
