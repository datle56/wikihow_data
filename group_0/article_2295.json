    {
      "title": "Avoid pretending not to be afraid if you don’t want to be targeted.",
      "content": "Avoid pretending not to be afraid if you don’t want to be targeted. Acting tough or saying “I’m not scared” indicates to the actors that you actually are. They’ll likely try even harder to frighten you or pick on you. Pretending like you don’t care also makes it less fun for your friends."
    },
    {
      "title": "Walk in the middle of your group so your friends get scared first.",
      "content": "Walk in the middle of your group so your friends get scared first. Always keep someone between you and the actors so you have a lower chance of being the one singled out. This includes your backside, too. Make sure there's always someone behind you. [1] X Research source If there are only 2 or 3 of you, walk as close as possible to your friends. Then, if something jumps out, you can hide behind them. The 1st and 2nd spots where you'll experience the most scares are the front or the back of the group."

      "title": "Refrain from scaring other house-goers, which frustrates the actors.",
      "content": "Refrain from scaring other house-goers, which frustrates the actors. The actors are the ones who should be doing the scaring, not you. Let them do their jobs by just walking through and experiencing the house instead of trying to be a part of it. If one of your friends is scaring people on purpose, firmly ask them to stop. You don’t want to get kicked out because they’re being obnoxious."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pretend not to see an impending scare so you don't annoy the actors.",
      "content": "Pretend not to see an impending scare so you don't annoy the actors. If you see an actor setting up a scare for someone in your group, don't try to help by pointing it out to them. That will irritate the actor and might cause them to turn on you, instead. Telling your friends that they're about to be scared also makes it less fun for them. For example, if you see an actor peeking out from behind a curtain, don’t say, “Kate, watch out!” Let the scene happen on its own."

    {
      "title": "Stay on the marked path to avoid getting cornered by a monster.",
      "content": "Stay on the marked path to avoid getting cornered by a monster. Leaving the group you are with or straying behind the scenes is asking for trouble. If an actor finds you alone, they'll likely pick on you. Don't stray from the route you're supposed to follow. If you aren’t sure where to go, follow the group in front of you. Leaving the path can be dangerous, too. There are hazards, like electrical cords and other items, that are intentionally hidden. If a room or door is marked “Staff Only” or \"Emergency Exit,\" don’t enter it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move at a quick pace so the actors have less time to prepare a scare.",
      "content": "Move at a quick pace so the actors have less time to prepare a scare. Keep moving through the house and don’t hesitate too long at one scene or walk too slowly. Getting to the next room or scene quickly not only gets you out of the house faster, it prevents the actors from planning an elaborate scare. Never run. Running in a haunted house can be dangerous and destructive."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid asking the actors not to scare you.",
      "content": "Avoid asking the actors not to scare you. Saying something like, “Leave me alone!” or “Please don’t scare me!” will only encourage them to try even harder to scare you. It’s best to keep quiet and blend into the rest of the group so you aren’t an easy target. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that usually, if an actor notices someone is genuinely upset or very frightened, they’ll back off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your hands to yourself and don’t touch the actors.",
      "content": "Keep your hands to yourself and don’t touch the actors. Many haunted houses have rules against touching the staff. But even if this isn't explicitly mentioned, grabbing, pushing, or hitting the actors is liable to get you thrown out, and possibly even arrested. [3] X Research source Some light bumping or brushing against other people is normal and expected. Apologize immediately if you accidentally knock into an actor. If you have a tendency to strike out when scared, have a friend agree to hold your \"hitting hand\" to keep you from doing so or keep your hands in your pockets."

    {
      "title": "Stay on the actors' good sides by not trying to scare them.",
      "content": "Stay on the actors' good sides by not trying to scare them. First, attempting to frighten the actors probably won’t work and will just make you look foolish. Plus, they’re there to do their job (which is to scare you) and if you’re getting in the way of that, you’re being disrespectful. They'll definitely \"punish\" you for it by trying even harder to frighten you later on. [4] X Research source It’s not funny to ask for an actor’s phone number or comment on how hot they are. Harassing them can get you escorted off the property. Don't try to get the actors to break character. They won't do it and it will just make them angry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask to leave the house only if you’re too scared to continue.",
      "content": "Ask to leave the house only if you’re too scared to continue. Do not request to be taken out unless you genuinely want to leave. A false alarm will irritate actors who have to break character to escort you out. Use a strong, clear voice to be heard over the noise and show you're serious about leaving. [5] X Research source Some haunted houses have safe words or phrases for guests to use in the event they want to leave. For example, it might be “I want my Mommy.” Find out before you enter the house what the guidelines are for leaving."

    {
      "title": "Wear dark-colored clothes so that you’re harder to see.",
      "content": "Wear dark-colored clothes so that you’re harder to see. Haunted houses are often very dark with poor lighting, so choosing clothing that’s equally dark will help you blend in. Look for pieces that are black, navy, dark gray, or a deep purple. Avoid neon colors or bright white clothes that stand out, especially if the haunted house has a black light. Pay attention to your footwear, too. Dark boots or black tennis shoes are both good options."

    {
      "title": "Cover up with a long-sleeved shirt and pants to hide your goosebumps.",
      "content": "Cover up with a long-sleeved shirt and pants to hide your goosebumps. You get goosebumps when you’re scared, so those tiny dots all over your arms and legs are a dead giveaway to actors. Wear a long-sleeved T-shirt or a hoodie and pants that cover your ankles. [6] X Research source If you get cold easily, add layers like an additional sweatshirt or jacket, too, to prevent goosebumps from the chilly air."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a large, puffy coat to look more intimidating.",
      "content": "Choose a large, puffy coat to look more intimidating. While an oversized coat might not make you blend in, it will make you appear larger. Actors may mistake your size for muscle and they won’t want to mess with you. [7] X Research source Look for down parkas or ski jackets with extra padding. Wearing a heavy sweatshirt underneath your coat will make you even bigger."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave the masks at home.",
      "content": "Leave the masks at home. Most haunted houses don't allow masks to be worn, except on special occasions. If you're allowed to wear a mask on that day, remove it before approaching the ticket booth or a police officer or security guard on duty. [8] X Research source Wearing a mask in the haunted house might make others mistake you for an actor. If masks are allowed, make sure yours isn’t offensive or overly gruesome. There may be kids at the haunted house."
