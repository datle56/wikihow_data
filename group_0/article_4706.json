    {
      "title": "Pick a spot that has even ground and lots of shade.",
      "content": "Pick a spot that has even ground and lots of shade. Avoid a spot with tree stumps or shrubs that you will have to move. A shady spot will ensure the pool is not exposed to direct sunlight. Sun can encourage algae to grow in your natural pool, forcing your filtration system to work overtime to keep the water clean and clear. [1] X Research source Look into your local regulations before you start any construction. For instance, in California, your pool needs to be at least 5 ft (1.5 m) away from the property line. View a diagram of a natural swimming pool : here ."

    {
      "title": "Section out a hole for the pool.",
      "content": "Section out a hole for the pool. The hole should be at least 45 to 50 square metres (480 to 540 sq ft) and 1 to 2 metres (3.3 to 6.6 ft) deep. Try not to make the pool too deep, as a deeper pool may require steel reinforcements. Make the pool a square or rectangle so it is easy to line and fill. [2] X Research source Use tape or chalk to mark out the dimensions of the pool so you have a guideline for when you dig."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create an adjacent hole for the plant zone.",
      "content": "Create an adjacent hole for the plant zone. The hole should be 10 to 20 square metres (110 to 220 sq ft) and 1 metre (3.3 ft) deep. This hole is for the plants and other natural elements that will help to filter the water in the pool. It should be right beside the larger hole for the pool. [3] X Research source The hole for the plants should take up or be equivalent to 30-50% of the main pool area. The plant zone will be separated from the pool by a piece of black liner that you will put in later. This will allow the water to flow from the plant zone into the pool, but keep the plants from floating into the pool area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dig the holes with an excavator.",
      "content": "Dig the holes with an excavator. Using an excavator will make digging the holes much easier and faster. Dig the holes so they have sloped sides, as this will ensure they do not cave in. The holes should also have an even, flat bottom so sealing and filling them are easier to do. [4] X Research source Save any large rocks that you come across as you dig, as you can use them later when you seal and fill the pool. You can rent an excavator from your local hardware store at an hourly or daily rate. Digging the holes should take no more than a few hours."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a small water pump on the far end of the pool.",
      "content": "Place a small water pump on the far end of the pool. Though the natural pool will use plants to filter the water, you will need a pump to move the water towards the plants. Buy a small water pump at your local hardware store or online. Place it at the far end of the pool and run electricity to the pump so it can run. [5] X Research source You can bury the water pump in the ground if you do not want it to be seen. Running a water pump in or around water can be dangerous, so exercise caution when you set it up and make sure the wire you use is water safe. When in doubt, consider hiring an electrician to set up the water pump for you."

    {
      "title": "Run PVC tubing from the pump to the plant zone.",
      "content": "Run PVC tubing from the pump to the plant zone. Bury the tubing at least 18 inches (46 cm) deep in the soil as you run it from the pump to the hole for the plants. Run the PVC tubing underground beneath the entire pool from the far end to the plant zone. Make sure the piping touches the plant zone so the water flows into this area. [6] X Research source If you are unsure of how to do this, you can hire a plumber or a contractor to assist you."

      "title": "Attach an underwater aerator to the pump to add oxygen to the water.",
      "content": "Attach an underwater aerator to the pump to add oxygen to the water. Aerating the water will ensure the water has enough oxygen to feed the plants and other organisms in the pool. Place the aerator in the deepest part or corner of the pool so it is not disturbed. Make sure the aerator is properly connected to the water pump. [7] X Research source Underwater aerators can range in price from $1,000-$1,200 USD."

      "title": "Protect the pump and the aerator with a skimmer.",
      "content": "Protect the pump and the aerator with a skimmer. Place the pump and aerator in a plastic container or bucket with a skimmer. Then, cover the bucket with a steel-mesh filter mat to keep debris out of the equipment. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Use synthetic liner to smooth out the bottom and sides of the pool.",
      "content": "Use synthetic liner to smooth out the bottom and sides of the pool. Place the liner tight to the bottom and sides of the pool. Cut the liner to fit the sides correctly, making sure it sits right at the top line of the pool. Line both the main pool and the hole for the water zone so they are protected. The synthetic liner is a good way to prevent leaks or cracks in the pool due to rocks or other objects."

    {
      "title": "Apply bentonite clay if you do not want to use a synthetic liner.",
      "content": "Apply bentonite clay if you do not want to use a synthetic liner. Another option is to apply a layer of bentonite clay over the holes for the swimming pool and the plant zone. You will need at least 6 pounds (2.7 kg) of clay per square foot to seal the pool. Spread a 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) layer of clay with your hands. Wear gloves and a face mask to protect yourself. [9] X Research source If the soil is very sandy, you may need to double the amount of clay per square foot to ensure the pool is properly sealed. Pack the clay down with a tractor or a plate compactor to really seal it into the soil."

    {
      "title": "Lay black liner on the bottom and sides of the pool to reflect the sun.",
      "content": "Lay black liner on the bottom and sides of the pool to reflect the sun. Use synthetic liner that is black over the base liner or the clay so it can trap the heat of the sun, heating up the pool naturally. It will also help to protect the pool from leaking. [10] X Research source Leave a piece of liner hanging between the pool and the plant zone. Cut the piece so it sits 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) below the top edge of the pool. This piece of liner will act as a barrier between the pool and the plant zone. Use scissors to cut the liner so it just drapes over the sides of the pool."

    {
      "title": "Place large rocks on the walls of the pool to keep the liner in place.",
      "content": "Place large rocks on the walls of the pool to keep the liner in place. Use smooth slabs or rocks to secure the liner and create an extra barrier. Lay them against the walls of the pool so they sit flush to the top edge of the pool. You can then fill in any gaps between the large rocks with smaller rocks or slabs. [11] X Research source You can also use stone slabs that have been cut to fit together if you want a smooth, even surface for the sides of the pool. The stone slabs will be heavy to lift so you may need someone to help you lift them in place."

      "title": "Fill the pool with 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) of gravel or pea rock.",
      "content": "Fill the pool with 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) of gravel or pea rock. Cover the bottom of the pool with gravel or pea rock to create a good habitat for microorganisms. This will also keep the bottom soft and easy to walk on. [12] X Research source Make sure you use gravel or pea rock that has been washed so there is no dust or particles in the pool."

    {
      "title": "Line the edge of the pool with rocks or pebbles.",
      "content": "Line the edge of the pool with rocks or pebbles. Finish off the pool by placing small rocks or pebbles on the edge so they cover up the black liner. Make sure the liner is completely covered and there is a clear perimeter around the edge of the pool with the rocks. Reinforce the rocks with gravel and soil so there are no leaks. [13] X Research source Make sure there is a clear pathway between the pool and the plant zone, as water will need to flow between these 2 areas."

      "title": "Put water in the pool and let it rest for a week.",
      "content": "Put water in the pool and let it rest for a week. Use fresh water to fill the pool to the top edge. Then, let it sit and monitor the pool for any leaks or issues. Test the water with a home water testing kit to ensure the pool levels are safe and not contaminated with any chemicals or biological substances. [14] X Research source Do not fill the plant zone until you are ready to add plants to the pool."

      "content": "Put 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) of aggregate or gravel in the plant zone. Use aggregate or gravel that does not contain any additives or large portions of organic matter that has not decomposed. Make sure the aggregate has not been in contact with animals, as you do not want germs or bacteria to get into the water. [15] X Research source"
