      "content": "Wash the blanket on the delicate cycle or soak it in a tub of cool water. When using water to block a natural-fiber crocheted blanket, the item needs to be completely soaked through. You can do this by washing the item on the delicate cycle in your washing machine or by soaking the item in a small tub of cool water. [2] X Research source You may use a small amount of detergent to wash or soak the blanket if desired, but plain water also works fine for blocking."

      "content": "Wring and press out the excess water. After you remove the item from the washer or tub of water, use your hands to gently squeeze out any extra water. Then, place the blanket on a towel and roll the towel up around the blanket to blot more water out of the blanket. [3] X Research source Use more than 1 towel to blot the excess water out of the blanket if needed. Do not twist or stretch the blanket as you wring out the excess water!"

      "content": "Spread the blanket out on a few towels on a flat surface. Lay a few clean, dry towels on a flat surface such as your bed or the floor. Then, lay the blanket on top of the towels and smooth it out so that it is flat. Arrange the blanket how you want it to look when it is dry, but be careful not to stretch it out. Aim for straight edges and an overall even appearance. [4] X Research source There are also special blocking mats that help to promote air circulation under the blanket as it dries. These are available at craft supply stores or online. [5] X Research source [6] X Expert Source Sarah Stearns DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 4 October 2021."

Insert 1 pin into each of the corners of the blanket and then insert a pin about every 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) along each edge of the blanket. Push each of the pins all the way through the blanket and towel, and then back up again. [7] X Research source [8] X Expert Source Sarah Stearns DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 4 October 2021. Use rust-proof pins to prevent stains on your blanket. Special blocking clips are also available at craft supply stores if you prefer not to insert pins."

      "content": "Allow the blanket to dry for 12 to 24 hours. The total time your blanket needs to dry will depend on the size and density of your item as well as on the climate you are in. If you have a small blanket, then it might only take 12 hours to dry, whereas a large blanket will take longer. If you are in a hot, dry climate, then your item will also dry faster than if you are in a cold or humid climate. [9] X Research source Wait until the blanket is completely dry to remove the pins. Touch it in a few places to check."

      "content": "Spray the blanket with water until it is just damp. Fill a spray bottle with plain tap water and then spritz the blanket all over so that it is damp. Making the blanket damp instead of soaking it through is enough to block the blanket. The blanket will also dry much faster if you only get it damp, so this is a good option if you are short on time.
