      "title": "Dust the plastic.",
      "content": "Dust the plastic. Use a soft damp cloth (water only) or soft hand-held dust mop (available in the car care section of any grocery or discount store) to clear away dust. A small, soft-bristled paintbrush works well to clear dust from crevices such as around the gear shift and hand brake, the radio controls and other tight spaces where dust can settle. You can also use a soft-bristled toothbrush and cotton swabs to clean crevices and hard to reach areas. If you used a damp cloth, go back with a dry soft cloth to dry the plastic."

      "title": "Use polish.",
      "content": "Use polish. To add some shine to your plastic, use a plastic polish or an oil such as olive oil or boiled linseed oil. Put some oil or polish on a soft cloth and then rub it into the plastic. Then use a clean soft cloth to rub away any excess product. You can purchase boiled linseed oil from a hardware or paint store. There are also all-in-one products that act as both a polish and a protectant. This is convenient and cuts down on the amount of products you have to buy. [2] X Research source"

Start at the top of your car and work your way down. Once you have cleaned your entire car, rinse the car with water again. Clean your car in a shaded area to prevent your car from getting too hot. If the surface of the car is too warm, the soap may dry and you will have to wash your car multiple times. Dry your car with a clean, soft, dry towel or drive your car around the block."
