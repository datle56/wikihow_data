If you’re sure that you want to be a physicist, major in physics as an undergraduate, and focus on your studies to maintain a high GPA in both your physics major and in all your college courses. Students usually have to declare their majors in their sophomore (second) year of college. Having a high GPA, not only in just your physics major but in all your classes, makes you a stronger candidate when either applying for graduate schools or going directly into the workforce after college."

While nearly 50% of physics majors go directly into the workforce after getting a bachelor’s degree, often the best and highest paying career options in physics require a graduate degree. [3] X Research source While you sometimes might be able to teach physics at the high school level with just a bachelor’s degree, a master’s degree is necessary to teach at the junior college level. Some high schools even require a master’s degree to teach physics at their schools.
