Place a period after the end of the instructor's name. Example: Kent, Clark. If you're using your own notes from the lecture as a reference, your citation should be to the lecture itself, not to your personal notes. So you'd still use the instructor's name as the \"author\" of the lecture."

If you are citing a written handout or slide show, use the title provided for that document. Use title-case, capitalizing all nouns, pronouns, verbs, and adverbs. Place a period at the end of the title, inside the closing quotation marks. Example: Kent, Clark. \"Superheroes in the 21st Century.\" If the lecture doesn't have a specific title, provide a brief, general description of the topic of the lecture."
