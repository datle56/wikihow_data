      "content": "Consider why you want to amend the death certificate. Incorrect information on a death certificate is important to change. Not only does it affect demographers' data, it may impact an insurance settlement. You should get organized at an early stage by identifying all details you need to correct on the death certificate. It is possible, and imperative, to amend any and all incorrect details of the death certificate. For example, a death certificate with an inaccurate veteran status may affect death insurance claims you file with armed forces aid associations. Incorrect dates, misspelled names, and other personal information should always be corrected."

      "title": "Find out your eligibility.",
      "content": "Find out your eligibility. Anyone is eligible to initiate the amendment process if they find information they know to be incorrect and get the necessary signatures. However, some states have restrictions on who can actually file the paperwork. If you are not eligible to file death certificate amendment paperwork, contact those who are. Tell them what is wrong and how you can give evidence to back up your claims. For example, in Michigan, only a certifying physician or medical examiner can amend medical details such as cause of death.

      "title": "Know the time limitations.",
      "content": "Know the time limitations. You can always amend death certificates as long as you have evidence to support your claims. However, the manner in which you file the amendment paperwork is more restricted as time goes on. This varies state-by-state, however in many cases it means only being able to file through your state's central vital statistics and vital information registry. For example, in Minnesota, the funeral home can only amend the death certificate in the first year after death. After 5 years, only the state registrar can process and file your request."

      "title": "Figure out which state the death certificate was registered in.",
      "content": "Figure out which state the death certificate was registered in. Look on the death certificate if you are unsure. Depending on where you live, you might be able to contact the office online through the state government's website. Many states now have the applicable instructions and forms accessible on their website. Some states give you a choice whether to you’re your amendment request through state or local government. Amending a death certificate is not yet a process you can complete on a website or online interface. You still have to mail amendment request forms most likely because you have to present the original copies of your supporting documentation. However, most states now have the information and resources you need on their webpage."

    {
      "title": "Download the forms you need.",
      "content": "Download the forms you need. You will need to fill out a form telling the state how the death certificate needs to be changed. Some states require you to complete an application for amendment form before you can amend the death certificate. Your state’s website should tell you what procedures you will need to follow. Look over the forms before you continue so you can ensure you have all the items and information you need in each stage of the process. You have to provide documentation to support your claims. These have to be the original copies with all the authorization needed (such as signatures, seals, etc.). They have to be intact and legible. For example, if you are amending the deceased's death certificate to indicate his veteran status, you will need to find their discharge certificate. Supporting documentation could also be their birth certificate, if a date or location is wrong on the death certificate. You will also have to remit the requisite amendment fee."

Phone your office of vital statistics or records and ask where you can pick up other forms. If you have all the information you want to complete the amendment on-site, you can fill out the form and submit it in person. If not, take it home and make sure you have all the documents in order."

This may be the county office of vital statistics, department of health, licensing center, county recorder, among other things. You can only use this method through the first five years after the date of death in some states. Check time restrictions in your state before beginning any amendment process."

Informants are often family members. They could be fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, partners, etc."
