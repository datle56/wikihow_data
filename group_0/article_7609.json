      "content": "Coat the bottom of the dish with a liquid soap and baking soda. Using a bottle of standard dish soap, drizzle a cherry-sized amount of cleaner over the greasy parts of the dish. Next, sprinkle at least 1 tsp (6 g) of baking soda over the especially greasy areas. If your glass is completely covered in baked-on grease, feel free to use more baking soda as you see fit. [1] X Research source You can use whatever type of dish soap that you have on hand."

      "title": "Fill the glass dish with hot water.",
      "content": "Fill the glass dish with hot water. Fill the bottom of your glass dish with hot water until the dish soap and baking soda are completely covered. Continue pouring until about 1 in (2.5 cm) of the dish is filled. If you’re cleaning a smaller dish, you might not need to use as much water. [2] X Research source Hot water helps wear down old stains like baked-on grease."

      "title": "Wait 15 minutes so the dish can soak.",
      "content": "Wait 15 minutes so the dish can soak. Don’t wipe off any grease until you’ve given the dish soap and baking soda enough time to soak. If the baked-on grease stain is especially bad, let the dish soak for at least 30 minutes. [3] X Research source If you want, you can also soak your greasy dishes overnight."

Once you’ve cleaned off the baked-on grease, rinse off any leftover residue with warm water. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Fill the bottom of the dish with warm water.",

      "content": "Pour a pea-sized amount of dish soap into the water. Drizzle a small amount of soap along the bottom of the dish, so the grease can be soaked away. Next, try spreading the soap around, so entire dish is sudsy. [6] X Research source Any kind of dish soap will work for this process."

      "content": "Place 1 dryer sheet into the glass dish. Place the item on top of the water, so it can float in the center of the dish. If you’re cleaning an especially large item, consider soaking multiple dryer sheets in the sudsy water. [7] X Research source Similar to the dish soap, the chemicals in the dryer sheet help to work away the grease from the dish."

Don’t try to scrub or rinse out the dish; instead, give the grease time to loosen and soak. After 10 minutes pass, remove the dryer sheets and toss them out. [8] X Research source If you remove the dryer sheet right away, you won’t notice a difference."

Sprinkle a small amount of baking soda along the bottom and sides of your glass dish, focusing on the especially greasy areas. After filling a small spray bottle with white vinegar, spritz over the baking soda. Let the dish sit overnight, then wipe away any excess vinegar and baking soda the following day. [10] X Research source You can repeat this process as many times as necessary."

Using long, forceful movements, rub the areas of the dish that have a lot of baked-on grease. Keep scrubbing the glass until the patches of grease are completely gone! [11] X Research source You might need more than 1 Magic Eraser to clean out your dish, depending on how bad the grease stains are."
