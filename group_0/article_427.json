      "content": "This saying means what a person does is more important than what they say. In this case, the actions aren’t literally “louder” than someone’s words. They just carry more weight and meaning (it’s another way to say “talk is cheap”). For example, a person’s spouse might say “I love you” every day, but if they never do anything to show their love, then their words seem empty or less meaningful. [1] X Research source On the flip side, if the spouse offers to clean the house, does favors for their partner, and shows other signs of appreciation, then they’re demonstrating that they meant it when they said “I love you.” “Actions speak louder than words” is another common way to express this idiom."

If someone keeps saying they’ll do something or that they feel a certain way but their behavior and demeanor don’t match their words, use this phrase to let them know you suspect they’re not being 100% honest. Anyone can use words to make you think they’re making progress or experiencing certain emotions, but you can’t know for sure until they act upon those words. Girlfriend: “I said I love you! Don’t you believe me?” Boyfriend: “You’re never on time for our dates and I’ve seen you flirting with other guys. Actions speak louder than words, you know!” Student: “I promise I’ll turn in my midterm paper on time, this class is really important to me.” Professor: “Well, most of your other assignments have been late and you were on your phone during the entire lecture today. Actions speak louder than words, remember that.”"
