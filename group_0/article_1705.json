      "content": "Leo's love of the spotlight may conflict with Scorpio's need for privacy. A Leo wants to be the center of attention in any friend group, preferring to attend social events and hang out with friends often. On the other hand, Scorpio likes to hang back and observe—they're extraordinarily cautious and private. If Scorpio tries to hold Leo back as well, Leo will feel like their freedom is being limited. These signs will need to understand each other's needs and find a middle ground in their relationship. Leo and Scorpio should be calm and respectful as they discuss their individual desires to find the middle ground between them. Both signs like to be in control, but neither one can call the shots 24/7. It's possible for Scorpio to embrace the fun and adventure Leo brings to the relationship, while Leo can enjoy the moments of quiet passion Scorpio initiates."

      "content": "There's a ton of raw physical chemistry between Scorpio and Leo. Scorpio is ruled by Mars, the planet of passion, lust, and aggression—while it's not a fire sign, Scorpio can be downright fiery in the bedroom. Leo is ruled by the Sun, so they have the energy and fire to match Scorpio's; Leo is one of the few signs that can easily keep up with them. Both signs will get a rush from being with someone so different from them, making for a thrilling (if sometimes volatile) love life."

      "content": "Both signs are incredibly passionate. They're known to give everything they have to relationships; Leo is a die-hard romantic, and Scorpio can be downright obsessive when they develop feelings for someone. Leo needs the attention that Scorpio is happy to give them, and Scorpio needs the loyalty that Leo is known for giving their partners. Scorpio can blow hot and cold very suddenly and intensely. A generally positive sign, Leo will need to work to understand Scorpio's moods without letting them affect Leo's warm optimism."

      "title": "Scorpio's \"all or nothing\" mindset in relationships can conflict with Leo.",
      "content": "Scorpio's \"all or nothing\" mindset in relationships can conflict with Leo. This isn't necessarily a dealbreaker; Leo is confident and independent but generally wants to know that a relationship is going somewhere before they commit. If Scorpio lets Leo see how serious they are, Leo will have no problem settling in with their Scorpio partner. However, Scorpio will still have to reign in their obsessive tendencies and sometimes let Leo do their own thing."

      "content": "Leo and Scorpio's egos can cause friction between them. Their nature as fixed signs is both a help and a hindrance; Leo and Scorpio have similar values regarding commitment and long-term relationships but are extremely stubborn. Neither wants to change their mind or admit to being wrong, so arguments last far longer than they have to. These signs need to remember that the goal in a conflict is to find a resolution—not to win. As long as they stay focused on understanding each other rather than proving themselves, they can make up and move forward.

This common trait will work well for Leo and Scorpio as they build up the trust in their relationship, so long as both signs reign in their natural jealousy. Scorpio is a naturally mistrustful sign, and it may take time for them to open up. Leo will have to be patient and understanding for Scorpio to relax and start trusting freely.
