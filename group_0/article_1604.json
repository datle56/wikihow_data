      "title": "Clean and dry your skin where the tattoo will go.",
      "content": "Clean and dry your skin where the tattoo will go. Temporary tattoos are made with water-based ink, which means that they’re repelled by skin’s natural oils. Carefully clean the area of skin you want to tattoo using soap and water. Pat the area dry with a paper towel so the tattoo will adhere to your skin. If you’re very sweaty, rubbing alcohol can help cut the grease. Pour a little onto a cotton ball, and then wipe it on the area. Absorb excess with a paper towel. Don’t do this every day, though--you could dry out your skin. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Peel off the tattoo’s clear plastic cover.",
      "content": "Peel off the tattoo’s clear plastic cover. At this point, your tattoo is protected by a thin layer of clear plastic. Carefully peel this off, starting from one corner. Once it’s peeled, you should be able to see the brightly-colored, mirror-image version of the tattoo you’re planning to apply to your skin. [2] X Research source If you’re using a tattoo that’s on a sheet with other tattoos, use scissors to cut around the design you want. Then, pull the plastic cover from the individual tattoo."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the tattoo design-side down on your skin.",
      "content": "Place the tattoo design-side down on your skin. Confirm that you want to apply the tattoo to the spot you just cleaned—once it’s placed, you won’t be able to change your mind. Place the tattoo’s design against your skin, so that the white paper backing faces you and the image is touching your skin. Don’t wiggle it around. Just hold it firmly in place while you move on to the next step. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Hold a damp cloth or sponge over the tattoo paper for 60 seconds.",
      "content": "Hold a damp cloth or sponge over the tattoo paper for 60 seconds. Take a fabric cloth or sponge. Wet it so it’s damp, but not soaking wet, with lukewarm water. Press it firmly against the backing of your tattoo. Hold the sponge or cloth in place for at least 60 seconds. While you’re waiting, try to move as little as possible. As tempting as it is to check on the design, be patient. Waiting will ensure your tattoo transfers fully from the paper to your skin. Set a timer on your phone to help keep track of time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gently peel off the paper from your arm.",
      "content": "Gently peel off the paper from your arm. Set the sponge or cloth aside. Start by lifting a single corner of the paper backing in order to peek at the tattoo. If the image looks blotchy or isn't fully transferred to your skin, put the cloth or sponge back on and wait another 30 seconds. If the tattoo looks good, continue to slowly peel off the paper. Once the paper’s peeled, discard it."

    {
      "title": "Wait 10 minutes for the tattoo to dry.",
      "content": "Wait 10 minutes for the tattoo to dry. Set a timer on your phone for 10 minutes. Resist the urge to poke or rub your temporary tattoo as it dries. Sit reasonably still and don’t move or flex too much to avoid wrinkling or smearing the tattoo. When time’s up, you’re done! Your tattoo should last for 3-5 days."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply water-based lotion over the tattoo.",
      "content": "Apply water-based lotion over the tattoo. To make your tattoo last even longer , hydrate your skin by gently patting a bit of thin cream or lotion on top with your fingers. Avoid thick, oil-based moisturizers, like petroleum jelly, which may smear the tattoo. Dust baby powder over the top of the tattoo to make it look more matte (and thus more like a real tattoo.)"

      "title": "Use baby oil to remove your temporary tattoo.",
      "content": "Use baby oil to remove your temporary tattoo. Temporary tattoos tend to fade on their own after 3-5 days as you sweat, shower, and go in the sun. If you want to remove your tattoo before it’s faded on its own, gently rub it away with a washcloth soaked in baby oil or petroleum jelly. Wash any remaining oil residue away with soap and water.

      "title": "Clean and dry your skin before application.",
      "content": "Clean and dry your skin before application. The process for applying glitter tattoos is a bit different than transfer or paper-backed tattoos, but they still need clean skin to adhere to. Wash down the area you want to tattoo with lukewarm, soapy water, then pat it dry with a paper towel."

    {
      "title": "Select a stencil.",
      "content": "Select a stencil. Not just any stencil will do! It’s best to get a stencil specially intended for glitter tattoos. These have an adhesive back that won’t hurt your skin too much as you peel them off. They can be found in glitter tattoo kits , or sold separately at party, big-box, or beauty supply stores. [5] X Research source Apply the stencil of your choice wherever you want the glitter tattoo to be. Make sure not to stick the stencil to a hairy place on your body, or it’ll hurt to peel off."

      "title": "Paint over the stencil with body-safe glue.",
      "content": "Paint over the stencil with body-safe glue. If you’ve purchased a glitter tattoo kit, it should come with a special body adhesive intended for skin; if not, you can purchase body-safe glue separately. Apply a thin layer of the adhesive with a foam paint brush until it covers the skin left bare by the stencil. Then, wait for the glue to dry until it’s almost clear. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply glitter with a fresh, small paintbrush.",
      "content": "Apply glitter with a fresh, small paintbrush. Now comes the fun part—getting the glitter on there! Dip a paintbrush in body-safe glitter (any cosmetic-grade glitter is fine). Dab the glitter onto the skin inside the stencil, making sure it covers any narrow corners or curves in the stencil. Have fun and experiment by blending and mixing glitters for a gradient effect.

      "title": "Peel off the stencil.",
      "content": "Peel off the stencil. Once you’re comfortable with the amount of glitter you’ve used, take a corner of the stencil and peel it off the skin. Go slowly, so that you don’t disturb your fresh glitter tattoo too much. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Dust off any extra glitter.",
      "content": "Dust off any extra glitter. Once you’ve peeled off the stencil, you might notice a bit of fallout from the glitter. If that’s the case, use a large fluffy brush (a blush brush is perfect) to banish any wayward glitter flecks. It’s probably best to do this over a paper towel or trash can, so you don’t have to pick glitter specks out of the carpet."
