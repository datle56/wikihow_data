      "title": "Remove any stains or spots immediately.",
      "content": "Remove any stains or spots immediately. If you have fabric placemats, do not let any stains or spots sit on the fabric for very long. Remove stains right away, as the longer they sit on the placemats, the more difficult it will be to get them out. Foods that tend to stain fabric, like tomato , mustard, and coffee, should be removed right away if they get on the placemats. [5] X Research source You may keep 2 sets of placemats, 1 made of vinyl or plastic and 1 made of fabric. Use the fabric placemats for special occasions, as they will be more difficult to clean if they get dirty."

      "content": "Put the placemats in the washer if it's safe to do so. Check that the fabric placemats are washing machine safe before you put them in your washer. Most fabric placemats can go in the washing machine. Once you have washed the placemats, let them air dry. Air drying them will ensure they do not get damaged by the high heat of the dryer. Do not wash towels or clothing with the placemats, as this can lead to pilling. Wash only the placemats and other fabric items like table runners or table cloths together."

Then, dampen a clean cloth with the solution and wipe down the cork placemats. You can also put the solution in a spray bottle and apply it to the placemats in a few sprays. Cork can mold if water is left sitting on it. To avoid this, use a clean cloth to absorb any water remaining on the cork once you clean it. Press the cork dry using the cloth. Then, let it air dry overnight. [8] X Research source You can also use sandpaper to gently buff out marks or stains on your cork placemats."
