      "title": "Be informed about mating.",
      "content": "Be informed about mating. Most snails are hermaphrodites meaning they have both male and female sex organs. After laying a clutch of eggs, snails are generally ready to reproduce again in six weeks throughout the year. Snails lay between 30 and 140 eggs at a time; that's nearly 480 snails a year! [1] X Research source The mating of two snails is possible but extremely painful for both snails, so it's not necessarily encouraged. For two snails to mate, one snail aggressively fights the other looking for attention harming both snails in the process. Eventually the pursued snail will give in and involuntarily receive a 'love dart' full of sperm. You might see a little white dagger-like thing sticking out of the snails body. Do not attempt to remove this as it could harm the snail even more. The love dart is the equivalent of having a thumb-sized needle in your stomach. To prevent mating, keep an eye out. You might see a snail with its male genitalia out (penis). This is identifiable by the long white stick-like thing close to the shell. Move the snail to a different terrarium until it has fully retracted; this could take a few hours, in some cases up to a day."

      "title": "Make sure the condition of your snail's home is in good shape.",
      "content": "Make sure the condition of your snail's home is in good shape. The soil must be at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep and must be quite moist. Make sure you purchase soil from your local store, just make sure there are no pesticides or fertilizer in the soil as it could harm your snail. Never use soil from your garden as it could contain pests or parasites that could harm (or kill!) your snail. Snails need air! They're not that much different from us! If you put them in a plastic container, make sure you pop some holes in the top. Keep the temperature moderate and comfortable too."

      "content": "Take care of their basic needs. This doesn't include singing to them, because they don't have ears. But they do have eyes and a mouth -- so make sure to provide the right lighting and food necessary for their growth and success. Check on them regularly. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Snails are omnivores, which means they eat vegetation and animals.",
      "content": "Snails are omnivores, which means they eat vegetation and animals. Some good sources of food are: Apples Apricot Banana Blackberry Grapes Kiwi Mango Melon Nectarines Orange, Papaya, Prickly pear, Peach, Pear, Plum, Raspberry, Strawberry, Tomato, Lettuce, Broccoli, Spinach, Cabbage, Cucumber, Green beans, Mushrooms, Peas, Potato, Sprouts, Sweet corn, Turnip, Watercress, and non-seasoned, raw meat. Don't forget the water! [4] X Research source Most snails are nocturnal. If you turn on the interrogation lights at night, they'll immediately go to hide in their shells. If you're looking for a good show, they'll be the most entertaining in early evening, at night, and in the wee hours of the morning. Sprinkle them with water if you want to excite them a bit!

      "content": "Make sure they have some foliage to frolic in. Don't worry; they use their feelers to sense obstacles (lacking the sight to do so). Get a couple of leaves and sticks in the cage and make sure you spray it with a water sprayer at least once a day. Add a layer of sphagnum moss or leaves, remember to wet all of it. If your snails aren't already in their home, place them in now. They love damp and dark. You may miss the act of their breeding unless you take up nocturnal habits yourself. Unfortunately, there is not much more you can do other than creating a hospitable environment."

      "title": "Be patient.",
      "content": "Be patient. You must now wait until the two snails have 'mated' or impregnated themselves. When they have, it takes a week or two for them to lay. It can take 1 to 4 weeks for the eggs themselves to hatch depending on the species. Some snails lay them all at once while others spread them around."

      "title": "Watch the eggs hatch.",
      "content": "Watch the eggs hatch. This all depends on the species of your snail and the species you bred it with. It could be a very slow or very fast process -- wait and see! The eggs will start to hatch in 1 to 4 weeks onward in some species but it is genes and possibly species dependent, with additional factors of how long they have been stored internally and the ambient and soil temperature. Eggs do not necessarily hatch uniformly and this is more noticeable in species that have a long gestation period (perhaps 4 weeks). The first (usually an uppermost member) to hatch can be 10 days or more in front of the main group, with some taking noticeably longer. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure to add a fresh food and water source. Add calcium to help your snails grow strong shells, too. they love to play. Pick them up and let them crawl on your hand, but be careful; you may crack their shell. Don't pick small ones up, because their shell is very weak. With the adults, do not ever pick them up by their shell."
