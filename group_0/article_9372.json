When I received my package today, I opened it immediately to see that I got a gray bathrobe instead. I’d like to return the bathrobe and get the towel that I ordered. Can you help me correct this?” Remember to remain calm and speak clearly . Let Amazon know exactly why you're contacting them and what you think the best solution is to the problem at hand."
