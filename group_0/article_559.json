The attribute should be one of the column labels from the source data that is populating your pivot table. For example, assume your source data contains sales by product, month and region. You could choose any one of these attributes for your filter and have your pivot table display data for only certain products, certain months or certain regions. Changing the filter field would determine which values for that attribute are shown."
