      "title": "What are Adinkra codes?",
      "content": "What are Adinkra codes? Adinkra symbols often act as a graphic representation of certain codes. These codes depict the mathematical relationship between certain objects. The symbols do this by starting with squares, cubes, and other geometric shapes. The structure within the symbol uses patterns that go by certain rules. For instance, white dots and black dots cannot share the same vertical position, so black dots cannot appear to be as high as white dots. The purpose of codes is to help the symbols communicate a complex idea through a simple image. [46] X Research source"
