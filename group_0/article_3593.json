And it all starts with giving yourself concrete, measurable goals that you can keep your eyes on. [1] X Research source Perhaps you want to reach millionaire status by a certain age, like 30. Or perhaps your first goal is just to be out of debt within two years. Break bigger goals into more actionable smaller goals. For example, if one of your goals is to have a growing business in a year, start with the goal of fleshing out a business model within the first month."

      "content": "Stop spending and be thrifty. This is a key element of becoming a millionaire. Either you have the money in savings or you're spending it on things. You can't have both if you're aiming to become a millionaire. Most millionaires (a net worth of $1 million to $10 million) are living a very frugal and cost-effective life, without hyper-expenditure. [5] X Research source This includes: Live beneath your means. A good rule of thumb for your living situation is to spend no more than one-third of your monthly salary on rent. Buy quality clothing but don't pay ridiculous prices. A suit under $400 will do you just fine. Wear inexpensive watches, jewelry, and accessories. Don't collect things. Drive a reliable but affordable car of an ordinary brand. Avoid prestige and luxury brands. Stop comparing yourself to others and trying to keep up with them through spending."

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with savings. If you're used to maxing out the credit card and not saving much, you're going to find it hard to become a millionaire at any stage in your lifetime. Begin by opening a savings account purely for keeping aside money and add to it regularly. This should be different from your everyday bank account that you use to draw bill payments from and it should preferably be one that has a higher interest rate than the usual savings account options which are available through brick and mortar banks. [6] X Research source A savings account is one of the many places where you can set your money up to work for you. Your initial deposit of money grows whether you make additional deposits by interest. Learn the different types of accounts, including accounts like IRAs. Saving money requires self-discipline. Spend time working on any bad habits that take away from your self-discipline. Focus on what you can accomplish by saving rather than showing off to others through conspicuous consumption and instant gratification. Try to open a savings account with an online bank instead of a bank that has a physical location since digital banks usually have better savings interest rates.

One of the best ways to invest in individual stocks is through an investment club; you may want to consider forming one with your friends. However, whatever way you choose to buy stocks, get really sound and good financial advice first. Do your due diligence on that financial advisor - check their reputation and record of accomplishment first.

Things like garbage disposal, energy creation, providing products to the health and dying industries, etc. In addition, the certainty of customers should not be overlooked lightly. Choose a business that provides what people really need and be prepared to put in the effort to make your products and services either the best, the most price efficient or unique.

      "content": "Have a frugal startup. There is much talk about \"looking the part\". There isn't much point looking the part if it cost an arm and a leg to get it and you lack clients to pay for it. Get yourself a fabulous suit that is worn every day and makes you feel confident and ready to meet people but be very careful with your office fit-out and other business elements. [10] X Research source Here are some ideas to help you initially: Consider renting offices that someone else furnishes, cleans and that get shared around. Spend only the time needed in them, to cut costs. If you do have your own offices, rent furniture or buy it cheap at auction. Lease anything that needs to be constantly updated, computers being number one in this group. Keep staff expenses under strict control from the beginning. Fly economy. Or use Skype and other online forms of virtual conferencing and avoid flying at all. Be eco-aware and turn off unused items all the time. Save the planet and your bottom line."

Every cent counts and if it's not in your savings or being churned back into your business, it's in someone else's pocket. [11] X Research source Don't neglect the viability of your business. Always pay attention to what isn't working and remedy it at the earliest possible opportunity. Don't neglect the mundane but essential parts of running a business, like timesheets, tax, petty cash, invoicing, etc. Do them with clockwork regularity or employ someone who is capable to deal with these things. Deal with bad debt as soon as it rears its head. It isn't going away, so the earlier you face it, the better."
