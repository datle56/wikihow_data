      "content": "Obtain your country's international exit code. Your country’s exit code allows you to dial out of your country. If you’re dialing a US number from a landline, you’ll need to enter your country’s exit code before doing anything else. To find your country’s exit code, search \"[country name] exit code\" in Google or your favorite search engine. We've also listed most exit codes at the bottom of this article . If you're calling from a mobile phone, you can use \"+\" instead of your country's code. The \"+\" symbol can be dialed by pressing and holding the \"0\" button on your device. If you’re calling from Canada or another country covered by the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), you do not need to use an exit code. [1] X Research source You only need to dial the number \"1\" before the area code and 7-digit local US number, as you would to place a regular long-distance call."

      "content": "Know that the USA country code is \"1.\" A country code allows you to call one country from another—in this case, the country code \"1\" allows you to call the USA from outside the USA. Country codes comprise 1 to 2 digits; you dial them after you’ve dialed your country’s exit code—for example, \"010\" + \"1\" would be the first four numbers to dial when calling the USA from Japan."

      "title": "Confirm that you have the correct area code.",
      "content": "Confirm that you have the correct area code. An area code narrows your call geographically and refers to a specific region. US phone numbers are preceded by 3-digit area codes. The area code is usually separated from the phone number, either by parentheses or a hyphen. For example, (503) 555-555 or 503-555-5555. If you don't know which area code to dial, the North American Numbering Plan and Area Code Locations websites can help. [2] X Research source Mobile phone users may have area codes that don’t match the cities in which they live; for that reason, if you're unsure of the area code, it’s best to double-check with the person you intend to call. If you're dialing from within the USA and your phone number has the same area code as the number you’re calling, you may only need to dial the 7-digit local number. If the area has multiple overlapping area codes, however, you may need to dial their area code plus the number \"1.\""

      "content": "Double-check the local phone number you wish to dial. The local phone number will be 7 digits long, separated into a group of three numbers and a group of four numbers by a hyphen (e.g. 555-5555). If you’re calling a business, you can likely double-check their phone number via an online search; if you’re calling a person, you can double-check with them or by looking at your contacts list."

      "title": "Write down the complete phone number.",
      "content": "Write down the complete phone number. Before dialing the number, you may want to write it down or otherwise record it—that way, if your call doesn’t go through the first time, you can easily redial it. The order of the numbers will be [your country’s exit code] + 1 (US country code) + [area code] + [7-digit local phone number]. For example, if you were in Japan and called the US number 555-5555 with a 718 area code in New York City, you would dial 010-1-718-555-5555."

To make a VoIP call, you need a computer, tablet, or smartphone, plus an Internet connection. If you call the USA often, check to see if your VoIP application offers subscriptions or monthly flat rates for a predetermined number of minutes; these subscriptions can significantly lower your per-minute VoIP costs. Rebtel is a VoIP service that is currently offering free calls to the US. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a voice or video chatting app. If you're trying to call a friend or family member, consider using a voice chatting app instead of placing an actual phone call. Both you and the other person would need to download the app and sign up for an account before you can start voice chatting for free. You'll also need an internet connection (either Wi-Fi or data). Some voice chatting apps that offer free voice chatting include Skype, WhatsApp, Discord, and Facebook Messenger. If you have a camera on your device, many voice chatting apps also offer video calls. If you and the call recipient both have iPhones, you can use FaceTime to video call over an internet connection instead of using your phone plan."

Popular calling cards include Pingo, EnjoyPrepaid, Comfi, and Nobelcom. Note that calling cards are best for landlines and mobile phones with unlimited local minutes. Unless your mobile phone has unlimited local minutes, a calling card will not be the best option for you, as you’ll end up paying for the calling card minutes plus your mobile minutes."

Unless the person or company you’re calling has expressly told you it’s okay to call them collect, this is not advisable. To call someone collect internationally, have the US area code and 7-digit phone number ready, dial your international phone operator, and ask them to place the call for you. Phone numbers for international phone operators vary depending on which country you’re in; an online search of your country’s name plus the words \"international phone operator\" will reveal the number for yours. In the UK, you can call your international inland operator on 155; in Japan, you can call the international telephone operator at 0051."
