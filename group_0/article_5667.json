      "content": "Definitely—it’s a curious match, but a strong one when they commit to each other. Aquarius and Virgo form a minor quincunx aspect on the zodiac wheel (they’re 5 signs apart), which means they don’t have a lot in common but coexist easily. They’re pretty different—Virgo is a reserved, organized earth sign while Aquarius is an eccentric air sign that plays by their own rules. When they communicate what they have in common, they make a strong pair. These signs are independent and satisfied with the single life. Virgo is known as the bachelor of the zodiac, and Aquarius is not one to settle down easily. When they meet, there probably won’t be enough chemistry to pique their interests right away."

      "title": "Their relationship will probably begin as a friendship.",
      "content": "Their relationship will probably begin as a friendship. Aquarius and Virgo need to start things slow—Virgo is very cautious and careful and Aquarius needs to feel like they’ll be accepted for who they are. It’s possible they’ll enjoy a friends-with-benefits arrangement for a while before actually dating. Aquarius is known to blend love and friendships, so there may not be a clear line where one ends and the other begins. Aquarius is a natural altruist and Virgo loves to pitch in and help people. It’s possible they’ll meet at a charity event or while they’re volunteering. Their first conversations will be very animated. Outsiders might think they’re arguing, but they’re really enjoying a lively, intellectual debate. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Aquarius and Virgo might have a tough time connecting at first.",
      "content": "Aquarius and Virgo might have a tough time connecting at first. Virgo dates for long-term stability and family life while Aquarius is in it for fun and mental stimulation. The emotional connection Virgo needs is hard to find in Aquarius—they don’t want to constantly reassure their partner of their feelings. If Virgo doesn’t feel like their affection is being reciprocated, they’ll decide the relationship just won’t work. Virgo will worry about wild Aquarius and want to keep them close. This goes against Aquarius’s need for personal freedom and space. Aquarius can satisfy Virgo by being more romantic. Their creativity can lead them to unique gestures of love. Career-driven Virgo can take some time away from work to give Aquarius more attention. The Water Bearer needs to feel understood and accepted."

      "title": "Both signs are honest and give each other space to thrive.",
      "content": "Both signs are honest and give each other space to thrive. Aquarius and Virgo are very rational when it comes to honesty, so trust will form early on. When they learn to accept each other despite their differences, their bond will be virtually unbreakable. Doubt might creep in at large gatherings—Virgo can be insecure when Aquarius socializes with everyone, and Aquarius might get irked if Virgo thinks somebody else is as interesting as they are."

      "title": "These two value intelligence and a rational mind above all else.",
      "content": "These two value intelligence and a rational mind above all else. They’re logical, informed, and love to learn. Their conversations will be incredibly stimulating and they’ll never run out of things to talk about. Since Virgo is ruled by communicative Mercury and Aquarius is a logical air sign, they’re natural problem solvers who will motivate each other to develop their intellectual talents. Aquarius and Virgo represent the ultimate union of creativity and organization. There’s not much they can’t do when they put their minds together. [2] X Research source They have similar taste and will probably be interested in the same TV shows, art galleries, live performances, and music."

      "title": "Communication is where Aquarius and Virgo run into the most problems.",
      "content": "Communication is where Aquarius and Virgo run into the most problems. They both value openness and honesty but tend to skirt around their emotional issues, which can cause resentment to build until it explodes in a fight. They’ll need to work on being direct with each other to diffuse drama and grow together as a couple. Day to day, Aquarius will need to hold themselves accountable for not texting back or leaving the house without telling Virgo, who will worry or grow irritated by the chaos. Virgo needs to set firm personal boundaries since they’re more likely to cave to Aquarius’s wants and needs. Aquarians are stubborn and when they reach a decision, it’s hard to get them to change their mind. Virgo prides themself on being the critic who’s always right. This might upset Aquarius, who is deeply hurt when they feel judged."

      "title": "These two have the potential for great sexual chemistry.",
      "content": "These two have the potential for great sexual chemistry. Virgo will be anxious about pleasing Aquarius, and Aquarius will find that annoying. When Virgo feels reassured they’re doing a good job and Aquarius looks at Virgo’s attentiveness as a gift, then their pleasure will be never-ending. They enjoy trying new things, and Aquarius will tease out Virgo’s hidden fantasies with their refreshing non-judgement. Shy Virgo needs Aquarius to be patient while they adjust to their fast-paced, uninhibited sexuality. Virgo needs to let Aquarius know they’re interested in them sexually early on, or Aquarius will keep thinking of sex as a concept and not act on it. Aquarius will benefit from the affection Virgo brings to the bedroom since they have a hard time bridging the gap from a physical relationship to something more serious."

      "title": "This relationship works when both partners are upfront about what matters to them.",
      "content": "This relationship works when both partners are upfront about what matters to them. They’re very different, but they share many values like helping others, exploring the world, and learning new things. When they’re direct about their feelings and embrace honesty and patience, they’ll find the balance between Virgo’s love of order and Aquarius’s eccentric patterns. Each partner thrives where the other doesn’t and when they work together, they’re truly unstoppable. These two will flourish in shared creative projects and will grow even closer when they embrace spontaneity and new experiences. Virgo can support Aquarius’s unique traits and ideas, and Aquarius can teach Virgo how to relax and enjoy going with the flow."
