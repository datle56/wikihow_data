When you give your pan some time to gradually cool off, it won’t shatter from “thermal shock” because of an extreme temperature change. [1] X Research source"

Drizzle about 2 tbsp (28.3 g) of the baking soda onto all the dirty spots on your pan. Wait 25 minutes. Then, dampen a non-scratch scrub sponge . Using circular motions, work it into all the stains to clean them. [3] X Research source Rinse with water and repeat if necessary.

Since ceramic pans don’t have any chemical additives and they don’t need much oil when you’re cooking, they’re a great staple in your kitchen. In order to keep your ceramic pans in their best shape, make sure to: [8] X Research source Use plastic, wood, nylon , or silicone utensils to avoid scratches. Place empty pans on very low heat so you don’t scorch them. Turn on very low heat if you cook food without liquid so it doesn't burn. Store your ceramic pans carefully so other cookware don’t scuff them. Season your pans with oil to restore their nonstick qualities. [9] X Research source"
