      "content": "Understand the difference between belief and truth. Consider the following examples: [2] X Research source A stranger comes to your door and tells you that your child has been killed in a car accident outside their school. You would feel a pang of emotion, but this is a stranger. Do you believe them? Do they know who your child is? Is this some sort of cruel joke? Do you really believe that your child has been killed? You will be inclined to harbor some strong doubts. Two police officers come to your door, squad car in the driveway. They tell you your child has been killed. They need you to come with them to identify the body. You will in all likelihood believe them, they are police officers. You will feel the emotion as though you know for a fact that your child is dead. It will be real to you. You should notice that the difference between these two examples is the authority of the messenger, not the message itself. These examples are also chosen for their emotional content because the emotional content is a large part of what makes a situation real to us. The point is, whether we believe something based on authority, or emotion, or both, we cannot know it is true until we see with our own eyes. The highest authority you can imagine could tell you the simplest thing, and you may believe them, and they may believe themselves, but that does not in any way make it true."

      "title": "Understand the difference between scientific belief and religious belief.",
      "content": "Understand the difference between scientific belief and religious belief. The difference between belief in a scientific theory as opposed to belief in a religious dogma boils down to the difference between the institution of science and the institutions of various religions. The underlying concept in religious institutions is that the nature of reality is known. The nature of reality is written in a book or scroll. This writing was originally done, or dictated, or inspired, by a god. Religious institutions are primarily concerned with spreading information about the \"known\" nature of reality because, in their understanding of reality, that is what they are required to do. Religious \"facts\" are not subject to testing, and in most cases cannot be tested. Religious \"facts\" are supported by evidence that is open to interpretation, or no evidence at all. Religious \"facts\" are not reviewed by all religions to reach a consensus. The underlying concept in the institution of science is that the nature of reality is unknown. The institution of science is primarily concerned with discovering the nature of reality without making assumptions. Scientific theories must, by definition, be testable (falsifiable). Theories must be published for review by other scientists with the intention of reaching a consensus. Accepted theories are supported by evidence that is not open to interpretation, or is consistently interpreted by qualified scientists. If evidence is found that contradicts a theory, the theory will be abandoned. One believes in a scientific authority, because they derive their authority from the review process, and because they have an interest in discovering the truth. One believes in a religious authority because they have been given authority by their superiors, who in turn get their authority from their subordinates. Religion has no interest in discovering the truth because the \"facts\" are already known. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Remember that you aren't the only person who has found fault with their religion. People throughout history have looked critically at their religious beliefs and found fault. If you have issues and problems, then look at them honestly, with the notion that you will not be punished for trying to find what you truly believe. If your beliefs are valid, then they will stand up to scrutiny. Most of the religions that have ever been, have gone extinct. You would be hard pressed to find people worshiping Thor or Quetzalcoatl. Take a hard look at why you don't believe in Thor, or Rah, or Zeus. Would you be Islamic, Christian, or Jewish if you were raised in Iran, Mississippi, or Israel?"

Like many theists, many atheists donate to charity and live lives that are morally similar to those of theists. Atheists just might have different motivations for doing so. Many non-believers focus their concerns on social justice. [5] X Research source With or without religion, people can be good or bad. [6] X Research source - Steven Weinberg."

      "content": "Understand what atheism isn't. Many people conflate atheism with things that are either unrelated or true of most but not all atheists. agnosticism|An agnostic is someone who is unsure of whether or not a god exists. [7] X Research source You can be both an atheist and agnostic. Many atheists are also agnostic (even if they only identify as agnostic). A gnostic atheist is someone who is someone who is sure of god(s)'s nonexistence. Atheists do not \"hate god\". Since atheists do not believe in a god(s) they cannot hate something they cannot hate it. (They can however hate the notion of a god(s) or the idea of god(s)'s impact on society though many atheists do not hate the notion of god.) Atheists aren't always non-religious. Though most people who identify as atheists are non-religious some organized religions are atheistic. Note that being an atheist does not mean that someone doesn't believe in the afterlife. Although many atheists don't, atheism is lack of belief in god(s) not the afterlife. You do not have to be anti-religion. Some atheists, however, do disapprove of organized religion as well as the doctrine of faith as a virtue. There are others who still attend religious services for their own reasons, such as an agreement with some of the moral tenets, membership in a community, or even just a fondness for the music. You do not have to write off the possibility of unverified or unverifiable phenomena. You can acknowledge that they are possible without insisting or acting as if they are true, or trying to convince others that they are true. You do not have to subscribe to any set of beliefs. Atheism is not a religion. Atheists hold a wide variety of beliefs and outlooks, the only similarity being a lack of belief in a god or gods."

      "content": "Understand that you do not have to give up your culture. Culture, tradition, and tribal loyalty are important to many people, including atheists. By denying belief in a god/gods, one need not totally dissociate oneself with the culture associated with his or her former religion. Virtually every northern hemispheric culture celebrates a winter solstice holiday. A possible explanation for this is the lack of agrarian work to be performed and the abundance of food stores for the dearth winter months ahead. Such a celebration can be, and is in many cases, still important to an atheist for its intrinsic values -- those of sharing and community, among others. Many atheists who were either formerly religious or even one who were never religious celebrate religious holidays such as Christmas or Hanukkah with their religious and nonreligious friends and family alike."

The more versed you are in other religions and the more you understand why people believe what they do, the better basis you'll have for your worldview.
