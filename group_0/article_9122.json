      "content": "Consider the delivery method. Will you send your congratulations via text, email, or a card in the mail? All of them are great, but a card is a classic way to send warm wishes. A text message may also be a good idea for a more casual friendship. No matter which way you choose, try to keep your message short and sweet since you're working with limited space. Examples: Hey Dawn! I saw the photos of your beautiful baby girl on social media and wanted to reach out with my most heartfelt congratulations. You and Ed are gonna kill it! And if you ever need anything, I’m just a call away! Can’t wait to meet her. Sending lots of love. Dear Julia, I was so thrilled to see that you’ve finally welcomed your newest addition to your gorgeous family. The joy of parenthood is unmatched and we’re overjoyed that you’ve joined the club. Weekly playdates, here we come! I hope you enjoy the flowers attached to the card. Although I’m sure they’re no where near as beautiful as your new baby girl. Congratulations and blessings! - the Smith Family"

And has the baby girl been born or is this a congratulations on the pregnancy? If the parents are close friends or family, almost any warm words will be welcomed with an open heart. If you’re sending a congratulatory email to your boss or co-worker, keep the tone slightly more reserved and professional. Examples: \"Congratulations on your pregnancy, Beth! The nine months of no wine, sushi, or deep-sea scuba-diving will definitely be worth it. From mama to mama, you got this! Enjoy these precious moments before the two of you become a family of three– which is when there real fun begins! Sending you lots of love, luck, and well wishes.” “Dear Erica, congratulations on welcoming your little bundle of joy into the world! I trust you and Alex have your hands full, so we’ll hold down the fort here at the office. Wishing you a fun, restorative, and cuddle-filled few months of maternity leave!”"

      "title": "Speak from the heart.",
      "content": "Speak from the heart. Whether you have advice to impart on a new girl dad, or are genuinely excited about the prospect of babysitting your new cousin–say what you mean from the heart. It’s easy to get lost in a sea of pleasant platitudes when it comes to congratulating someone on their new baby girl, but your goal is simply to convey your feelings of love and warmth. Avoid cliches and simply say what you feel. Examples: “I didn’t believe anyone when they told me that I wouldn’t know what real love was until I had my baby… until I had my baby. The moment you hold her for the first time, you’ll know too, and I’m so glad you’ll get to experience this kind of unparalleled, all-encompassing joy. Congratulations! I promise this is the best thing that has ever happened to you.” “First of all, congratulations, mama! You did it! Second of all, thank you for giving me the sweetest goddaughter anyone could ask for. I can’t believe I get to be a part of this little angel’s life. I have no doubts that you’re going to raise her to be an incredibly human. How could you not? You’re you!”"

Tailor your message to the people you’re congratulating. This will add that unique personal touch that Hallmark simply can't compete with. Examples: \"Congratulations on your little princess! Just remember, it's okay to not know what you're doing! Everyone’s faking it til they make it!” “Amy Tan wrote, ‘A mother is always the beginning. She is how things begin.’ For your little girl, you’re the first home she’s ever known and she couldn’t be more lucky. Congratulations on becoming a mama to your baby girl!” [6] X Research source"
