      "content": "Understand tax liens. A tax lien represents an unpaid tax debt on a property. If a property owner does not pay their taxes within a certain time period (it varies by jurisdiction), tax collectors will put the unpaid taxes up for auction. It is through this auction process that you have the opportunity to purchase a tax lien. [1] X Trustworthy Source Internal Revenue Service U.S. government agency in charge of managing the Federal Tax Code Go to source . In the auction the highest bidder wins. The bidder then pays cash to the government in exchange for the lien, thereby transferring the risks and rewards of the lien from the government to the bidder."

      "content": "Learn how you make money on a tax lien. There are two ways to get a return on investment from a tax lien. The first is through interest payments. The second is through potential ownership of the property. When you purchase a lien the property owner is required to pay back the entire value of the lien plus interest. Interest rates can vary widely from one location to another. Typically they may run from 5% to 36%. All of the interest goes to the lien holder. The lien will be structured to give the property owner a period of time in which to pay the taxes, usually between six months and three years. In the event the property owner cannot pay off the lien (with interest) in that period, you have the right to foreclose on the property -- or take ownership of it. This is a complex and time-consuming process and should involve the assistance of a lawyer. [2] X Research source ."

Counties that are financially strained may be more willing to offer good deals on tax liens. They're looking for money right away instead of having to wait for property owners to pay their taxes. Investigate the financial status of various counties to get an idea of where you might get the best deals on lien certificates.

Real estate laws vary between jurisdictions, so you'll want to familiarize yourself with the laws where you plan to invest. Most of what you'll need to know will be on a county's website, so start there. If you have further questions, call the county executive office and get specific answers. You should specifically find out when the county can legally place a lien on a property. If they don't follow proper procedures, you could wind up with a lien that was illegally placed, in which case you could lose your investment. Keep this in mind as you investigate specific properties, and make sure a lien is legitimate.

In other cases, you may bid down on the interest rate for the lien. In that case, the interest rate may start at 20% and go down. Find out which format your county uses so you can devise a strategy for the auction. Remember that the homeowner's liability is not affected by how much you pay for the lien. Even if you pay too much, the owner doesn't owe more than the original tax bill and interest. Keep that in mind when planning your bids."

A good way to do this is to think about how much money you have to invest. If you plan on investing only a few hundred dollars, then you can easily cross off any liens that require more money than that. If you have several thousand dollars to invest and are looking for a big profit, don't bother with smaller liens. You can focus on particular types of liens. Tax liens can be placed on residential or commercial properties, so focusing on one or the other could narrow down your list."

In this case, the lender might step in to pay the lien before you get a chance to buy it. Lenders might be willing to pay more than you would to protect their larger investment in the property and prevent foreclosure. They also might try to legally stop you from foreclosing on the home if you do manage to buy the lien. [9] X Trustworthy Source Official UK government website Official website for the public sector of the UK government Go to source It's better to go for homes that have the mortgage paid off, because you won't face competition from mortgage companies that have a lot more money at their disposal. Dilapidated properties in economically depressed neighborhoods are a very risky investment. Such liens might carry higher interest rates, but if the occupants are unable to pay their debt, the interest rate won't do you any good, and you'll wind up losing money. Sometimes occupants owe more in back taxes than the value of the home. This means that if they abandon the property, you won't even be able to earn back your investment by selling the property. Avoid such places, or at least invest with caution. Properties that have suffered environmental problems such as chemical contamination are a risk as well. The cost of the cleanup will probably outweigh the potential profit to be earned from back taxes. Take, for example, old gas stations. These properties need a complete overhaul. Old gas tanks have to be dug up, and the ground has to be decontaminated. This is a dangerous investment that could easily end up losing you money."

      "content": "Attend the lien auction. When you've done all of your research and have a final list in mind, it's time to bid on the liens you want. Go to the location of the lien sale. Work out beforehand exactly how much you're willing to spend on each property. Without an advance plan, you could get carried away and bid too much on a lien that won't give you a good return on your investment. Remember to take other expenses into account besides the cost of the lien. For example, if the homeowners fail to pay their taxes, you might have to start judicial foreclosure proceedings. This will lead to legal fees, which can get expensive. Keep this in mind when deciding how much to spend. The lien sale, whether online or in person, should feature a typical auction format. The lien for sale will be announced, an opening price will be set, and then bidding will start. Pay attention during the auction so you know when a lien you're interested in comes up. Usually auctions require payment in cash or certified check. Add up what you're willing to spend on your liens, and bring either enough cash or a few certified checks. Some auctions allow you to finance a purchase. If this is the case, you should get pre-approved to avoid administrative slowdowns. [10] X Research source"
