      "content": "Measure your neck. [1] X Research source It’s important to measure your neck before investing in a choker, since they are meant to fit relatively tightly. Take a soft measuring tape and loop it around your neck once. Be sure to hold the tape close to your neck – chokers should fit tightly, but they should be loose enough for you to breathe easily. [2] X Research source A good rule of thumb is to add 2 inches (50.8 mm) onto whatever your neck measurement is. This will be a comfortable choker length for you. The standard choker measurement is usually 14 to 16 inches (356 mm to 406 mm) in length. Chokers can vary greatly in width from 3 inches (76.2 mm) down to just a small wire about 1/16 of an inch (4 mm)."

      "content": "Assess the length and width of your neck. [3] X Research source Chokers look best on those who have long, slender necks. If you have a very short neck, a choker won’t look very flattering unless it's very thin and simple. If you have a wide neck, a choker is still an okay option as long as you choose a slim one; otherwise, you run the risk of making your neck appear even wider. The longer and more slender your neck, the wider the choker you can wear while still looking appealing. A longer, more slender neck can wear chokers with more detail and gems. If you have a wider neck, it is best to go for something a bit simpler. If you have a short neck, it's best to avoid wearing most chokers at all, unless it's a very thin one. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider your face shape.",
      "content": "Consider your face shape. [5] X Research source Chokers, like all necklaces, accentuate your strongest facial features by framing your face. If you have a round face, steer clear of chokers, since they will emphasize the roundness. If you have an oval-shaped face, you can wear necklaces of all shapes, lengths, and styles. If your face is on the long and thin side, a choker will make your face appear wider and softer. Chokers look very flattering on people with heart-shaped faces because they make the face look fuller while balancing out the narrow chin. Those with round faces should avoid chokers completely because they will emphasize the fullness of your face."

      "title": "Try it on before you buy it whenever possible.",
      "content": "Try it on before you buy it whenever possible. Before you begin shopping for a choker, make sure you’ve recorded your neck measurements. When you try one on, keep in mind that the best positioning for a choker is on, or just above, the collarbone. Always look for a style that comes in your size. If you are unable to try it on before purchasing, there are many choker options that come with adjustable chains. These chains usually offer about 2 inches (50.8 mm) of adjustability. Most sellers will list the length/size of their chokers – if not, ask a shop assistant for help. If the choker makes your neck look shorter or disappear completely when you try it on, avoid this type of necklace."

      "content": "Choose colors that look best with your skin tone. Hold different colored fabrics up to your neck and take note of which hues look best with your coloring. Some colors can cause your skin to appear washed-out or blotchy, depending on your particular skin tone. Once you’ve determined what these colors are, avoid them. Always choose the most flattering color(s) for you. Black tends to look great on everyone, as well as most neutral colors. Match the color of the choker’s embellishments, like stones or cameos, to your eye color for a mesmerizing and unusual look."

      "content": "Select pieces made of leather, velvet or lace for a goth-inspired look. A simple black choker made of velvet or lace creates a softer goth look, while leather versions have a slightly more alternative edge. The velvet and lace versions usually have embellishments like drop pearls, intricate chains, dangling pendants, tiny fabric roses, cameos, lockets, and jewels. They range from very simple to incredibly ornate. The leather versions are usually more simple, with a snap closure. Studded leather chokers are popular in punk and goth fashion. Try a cameo for a gothic-tinged Victorian or Edwardian look. [9] X Research source"

One of the most common varieties is a simple, dainty chain choker, which can easily accessorize lots of different looks. There are also bold statement pieces, such as wide gold or silver bands, that can make a real impact. [10] X Research source Layered chains, tiny charms, and stacked bands in a variety of widths are all popular choices for metal chokers.

Simple, solid bands look best – the most favored versions are usually made of leather, rope, or hemp. Those who enjoy punk fashions will look great with a dog collar style choker. Woven hemp chokers have always been popular in surfer culture. Some feature puka shells, which is another popular look."

      "title": "Consider the neckline.",
      "content": "Consider the neckline. The more bare skin is exposed around your choker, the more it will stand out, so definitely consider the necklines of your tops and dresses. Chokers are the most flattering with sweetheart, scoop, v-neck, strapless, off-the-shoulder and square necklines. For an alternative look, wear chokers with a top that leaves your chest and shoulders bare, like a corset. When possible, try selecting a choker design that coordinates with the neckline. For example, you could pair a gothic choker with a point in the middle with a v-neck top. Another example would be wearing a round-shaped choker with a scoop neck top. Avoid wearing chokers when you're wearing clothes with high necklines since they might snag your clothing and cause your neckline to look bulky."

      "content": "Match the choker style to your clothing style. If you are into goth, alternative or punk fashions, choose chokers that reflect those styles. Velvet, lace and leather chokers all fall under that umbrella. Chokers also look fantastic with corsets and dramatic evening attire. Pair gowns with elegant pieces. Burlesque dancers love to wear chokers with their stage outfits since they’re so flattering with that style. Bohemian fashions work best with crochet and tribal chokers."

Bridal wear is also similarly suited to those kinds of pieces. Fabric and crocheted chokers work best with casual Bohemian styles. Chokers that are simple strands, featuring beadwork or other embellishments, can look great with both casual and formal wear. [11] X Research source A strapless formal gown can be made even more elegant with a delicate choker featuring translucent glass beads, crystals, and gems."
