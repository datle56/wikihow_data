Stay near your dog, and offer them lots of cuddles and pets to comfort your sick pup . [5] X Research source Some dogs may not want to cuddle while they’re sick, and that’s okay. Pay attention to your dog’s body language: if they’re baring their teeth, growling, or trying to get away from you, they probably just want some alone time instead. As your dog recovers, avoid straining them by taking them on short walks instead of doing strenuous exercise."

      "content": "Most dogs recover from mild cases in 2 to 4 days. The prognosis of pancreatitis really depends on how severe it is. The good news is that if it’s caught and treated quickly, your dog will likely recover and be back to normal in just a few days. If they have a severe case of pancreatitis, your vet may recommend a stay at the vet or long-term care measures. [14] X Research source Pancreatitis can recur after it’s happened once. To avoid it in the future, keep your pup on a low-fat diet and don’t let them eat unusual foods."
