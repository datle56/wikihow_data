However, napping for a long period of time in the middle of the day can make you less able to fall asleep with ease when you go to bed at night. Moreover, when you are tired at night and ready to go to sleep, you have less time and energy to think about being scared. [4] X Research source If you feel that you must nap mid-day because you're too zapped to keep going, try taking a \"power nap\" just before lunch. [5] X Research source These short naps of 15-20 minutes can give you some great benefits, including a burst of energy and alertness and increased motor performance. These shorter naps are what most people really need to stave off sleepiness and get the energy needed to continue on with their day.

Deep breathing slows the heartbeat and stabilizes blood pressure.

Meditation is one way to become more aware of your surroundings and to achieve a higher level of awareness and inner calm. It is recommended that you meditate an hour before bed.

Sit in a comfortable position. Focus on your breath. Focus on being present and relaxed in your body, and notice every breath you take. Work on clearing your mind of any negative or stressful thoughts; this can be the hardest part. If you find your mind wandering, focus on counting your inhales and exhales.

In general, seeing your thoughts reflected on paper might help you identify some important patterns, which then you can learn to cope with or alleviate. Try journaling for 10-20 minutes a day about whatever comes to your mind. Do not worry about spelling or grammar. Just let yourself process whatever you need to on paper. Ask yourself some key questions to try to figure out what it is that scares you: [13] X Expert Source Hilary Jacobs Hendel, LCSW Certified AEDP Psychotherapist & Emotions Educator Expert Interview. 8 September 2021. What fears come to mind about the night? What feelings are coming up in the night or when you try to go to sleep? Do you avoid any particular places or activities at night? Listing-making can also be a useful part of journaling, especially if you find worrying a reason you are unable to sleep. Make a \"to-do\" list for tomorrow, make a list of all of the positive things about a day, or make a list of what you look forward to tomorrow."

      "content": "Take a warm bath. The reason a bath helps with sleep is because your body temperature increases while you are in the bath and then lowers after the bath. Lower body temperature helps you to fall asleep. A bath should be taken about 2 hours before you plan to sleep because of the time needed to first raise and then lower your body temperature to enable easier sleep. To enhance the calming effects of a warm bath, try incorporating some essential oils or scents associated with relaxation. Consider using a bubble bath or soap scented with lavender. Research shows that the herb lavender can produce calming, soothing, and sedative effects when its scent is inhaled."

In addition, avoid all stimulants such as coffee, nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, and/or sugar within 4 hours of when you plan to go to bed. Stimulants keep your brain awake, which can make it harder to stop worrying and calm down before bed. However, eating a small snack about two hours before bed can be helpful. A good choice would be a banana and low-fat milk or a small handful of almonds. [14] X Research source"

Secure windows with locks. Put curtains up to provide privacy. If it make you feel safe, keep an item by your bed that could be used to protect yourself. However, avoid keeping an item near you that you or someone else in your home could accidentally use to hurt themselves or others, such as a gun or knife. Instead opt for a heavy object, such as a book or paperweight. The placement of this object nearby may help you feel safer, but will also not increase any risk or danger in your home."

Your body temperature drops as you go to sleep and a slightly cooler, rather than too warm, room can help this process along and help you achieve a sounder and easier sleep. But if the room is too cold (or too warm), you are more likely to have trouble settling into sleep and will wake up more often. Though researchers can't say what is an ideal temperature because what is comfortable for one person isn't always the case for another person, a typical recommendation is to make sure your room is between 65–72 °F (18.3–22.2 °C).

A \"healthy amount\" means enough distraction to engage your attention and emotions but not enough that you get hyper or overexcited and cannot settle down before bed.

This will keep you focused on the plot and/or subject, and not on your fear. Watch TV or go on your computer, tablet or smartphone. The evidence is mixed on the impact of using technology before bed on your sleep patterns. The most recent research suggests that watching TV or using technology before bed in fact hinders healthy sleep patterns. However, if you want to use technology to distract yourself a few hours before you head to bed, this can be helpful in keeping your mind off of your fear. Just make sure you \"unplug\" an hour or two before you actually plan to sleep. [18] X Research source Listen to calming music.

It can also be useful to pause and use your logistical thinking. For example, if you live in an apartment, most of the sounds that scare you are probably just the sounds of other people in your building. Creaky floor sounds, muffled voices, occasional thuds as doors shut, etc., are not indications that anything sinister is going to happen to you, but that you live near other people - and that you are not alone!"

For example, younger kids have a harder time telling the difference between what is real and what is imaginary.

Remember that you were once a child and likely had lots of silly fears too! [22] X Research source Try talking about your child's fears during the day, when they're not afraid. Discuss strategies regarding how they can be less scared at bedtime. Additionally, build your child's self-confidence during the day; comment on their \"bravery\" and what a \"big boy\" or girl they are.

For example, if your child is afraid of monsters, don't pretend to get out the monster repellant spray or to check the room for monsters. Such actions make it seem to your child like you too believe that these monsters exist. Instead, consider talking to your child about the difference between imagination and reality. For example, if he's afraid of monsters under the bed because he watched the film Monsters, Inc., let your child know that movies are made-up and are not real. You will likely need to have this conversation multiple times as the child develops his mental capacity for logic and reasoning. [23] X Research source Constantly reassure your child that he is safe.
