Have you ever met someone that was perfect for you on paper, but when you’re with them, you just aren’t really feeling it? You might be missing that certain “spark,” or physical attraction to them. If you want to make this work, don’t worry—experts note that it often takes some time for us to realize just how attracted we are to someone. [3] X Research source For many people, attraction develops after you’ve created a deeper connection with someone. As you get to know them more, you’ll probably find that you have more sexual chemistry together."

Oftentimes, love at first sight is simple attraction—it can become love over time, but it might not start out that way. Keep in mind that there’s a difference between love and lust, too. Lust usually disappears after 3 to 6 months, while love will usually stick around for much longer. [5] X Expert Source Christina Jay, NLP Matchmaker & Certified Life Coach Expert Interview."
