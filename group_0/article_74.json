Number 4 represents strong foundations, stability, hard work, and practicality. It’s a reminder to ground yourself and strive for what you want with genuine effort. 242 reduces to 8 since 2+4+2=8. Number 8 is associated with prosperity, finances, discipline, and abundance. It means you have the resources you need to accomplish your goals."
