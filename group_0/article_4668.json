      "content": "Lure the bug out with light. The bug was initially drawn to your screen's brightness. To get it out, turn your computer off entirely and unplug all cables. Place a new light source next to your computer, such as a flashlight, to draw the bug out from the side. If it's a flying insect, try building a simple trap with an old plastic bottle and something sweet as bait. If an ant is inside of your computer screen, try luring it out with sugar or honey. Just keep an eye on the bait; you don't want the ant running back inside before you can get rid of it . You can choose to put your monitor in a box to isolate the bug if you're worried about it getting back in again. Once it crawls out, you can dispose of it ."

      "content": "Gently tap the back of the monitor to move the body. If the bug is already dead inside your monitor, you can try getting it to fall to the bottom so it's out of sight. Please turn off the monitor and unplug it completely. Turn it upside down, and then gently tap the back (non-screen side) of the monitor to shift the carcass down. If the bug has been squished against the monitor, it is most likely stuck there. You can wait for the bug to dry out completely before tapping it away."
