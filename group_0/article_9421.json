      "title": "Tweet his handle @JacksonGalaxy to respond publicly to him.",
      "content": "Tweet his handle @JacksonGalaxy to respond publicly to him. Write a tweet that’s 280 characters or less with your message. Keep in mind that your tweet will be public and viewable by anyone on Twitter. Tag Jackson in the tweet by including his handle, @JacksonGalaxy, so he gets notified of the mention. [1] X Research source Another option is to retweet one of Jackson’s tweets and include your message in the retweet. This shows you care about the content he’s putting out, too. A sample tweet would be: “Loved your latest ‘My Cat From Hell’ episode @JacksonGalaxy! Can’t wait for next week’s!” Jackson occasionally pulls fan tweets from his feed to read and answer in a YouTube video."

    {
      "title": "Comment on his Facebook posts to share your message with everyone.",
      "content": "Comment on his Facebook posts to share your message with everyone. Visit Jackson Galaxy's public Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/JacksonGalaxy . Leave a comment containing your message on a photo, post, or video that’s relevant to what you have to say. Keep it short and sweet with no more than 3 sentences. [2] X Research source For example, if you’re leaving a note about how much you learned from his most recent Facebook Live event, find the video of it and leave your comment there. Everyone who visits his page will be able to see your comment so post accordingly. Due to privacy settings, you cannot send Jackson a private message on Facebook."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start a conversation with Jackson and other fans on YouTube.",
      "content": "Start a conversation with Jackson and other fans on YouTube. Jackson has quite the presence on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCatDaddy66 . Click “Subscribe” on his main channel page to be updated whenever he posts a new video. Then, leave your message in a comment on the most recent video. These comments are public and other fans may respond to you, too. If your post gets enough attention, it may catch Jackson’s eye, too! Jackson doesn’t often comment back on YouTube videos so it isn’t the best platform if you’re looking for a response."

    {
      "title": "Contact him publicly or privately on his Instagram, @thecatdaddy.",
      "content": "Contact him publicly or privately on his Instagram, @thecatdaddy. Open the Instagram app on your phone and type “@thecatdaddy” into the search bar. On his page, tap a picture to open it and post a comment. To send a direct message, click the ellipses in the top right corner of his page and select “Send Message” from the drop-down menu. A comment will be public whereas a direct message will just be between you and Jackson. [3] X Research source If Jackson doesn’t follow you on Instagram, your direct message will be sent to a hidden folder known as “Message Requests.” This means he won’t get notified of your message so it will only be seen if he deliberately goes to his request folder."

    {
      "title": "Write a creative subject line so Jackson will want to open your email.",
      "content": "Write a creative subject line so Jackson will want to open your email. Jackson probably gets hundreds, if not thousands, of emails in his inbox every day. One way to make yours stand out is by writing an intriguing subject line. That’s what he will see in his inbox and what will determine whether or not he opens your email or simply deletes it. Write a subject line that describes your email but in a more interesting way. [4] X Research source For example, your subject line could be “Help! I have the next cat from hell” instead of “Problem with cat.” Avoid using too many exclamation points, special characters, or all caps. These increase the chances that your email will be caught by a spam filter and not even delivered. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Describe your reason for emailing Jackson in 4 to 6 sentences.",
      "content": "Describe your reason for emailing Jackson in 4 to 6 sentences. Since Jackson is a busy man, keep your email brief and to the point. Start by introducing yourself and summarizing your main point, similar to a topic sentence in a book report. Then take 2 to 3 sentences to expand on your point. End it with a call to action if you have one, like requesting that he reply to your email or consider your suggestion for his next YouTube video. Remember to stay professional and polite with your tone and language. [6] X Research source Run your email through spell check or an online grammar check service before you send it to catch any mistakes. Include all relevant contact information like your email address, phone number, or mailing address at the end of the email below your sign-off if you’re asking for a response."

      "title": "Send your completed email to care@jacksongalaxy.com.",
      "content": "Send your completed email to care@jacksongalaxy.com. This is the general email provided on Jackson’s website. Make sure you fill out all of the necessary sections like subject line, email address, and the body prior to hitting “Send.” You may receive an auto-confirmation email within 15 minutes of sending it letting you know that your email was received. You do not need to reply to the auto-confirmation email. The “Contact Us” page on Jackson’s website also has a contact form that you can fill out with all of the information you’d include in a regular email."

      "title": "Check Jackson’s website or social media accounts to find the next event.",
      "content": "Check Jackson’s website or social media accounts to find the next event. Jackson does everything from book signings to talks at state fairs. There’s a page containing the schedule of events on Jackson’s website and his Facebook page also lists upcoming events. Both his website and Facebook include a brief description of the event. Follow him on Twitter, too, as he occasionally will tweet about where he’s headed and when. If you don’t see an event near you or one that you’re able to attend, sign up for his email newsletter on his website. You’ll receive email notifications whenever there’s a new event added to the schedule."

    {
      "title": "Sign up for the event or purchase tickets if necessary.",
      "content": "Sign up for the event or purchase tickets if necessary. On Jackson’s website, each event has a button next to it that either says “Free Admission” or “Buy Tickets.” If it says “Free Admission,” click the button to go to the individual event’s page to see if you need to sign up and other details. If it says “Buy Tickets,” you’ll be taken to the vendor selling the tickets. Purchase these as far in advance as possible in case it sells out. The price of tickets will depend on the type of event and how good your seats are. For example, tickets for one of Jackson’s individual speaking events range from $20 to $60."

    {
      "title": "Raise your hand if Jackson asks for questions from the audience.",
      "content": "Raise your hand if Jackson asks for questions from the audience. Occasionally, performers will ask if anyone in the audience has a story to share or a question for them. If Jackson opens up the floor to the audience and his request is relevant to what you wanted to share, raise your hand or stand up to be chosen. If you’re selected, speak clearly and concisely and don’t ramble on and on. A VIP seat at his events will get you closer to the stage which could improve your chances of speaking with him if he accepts audience questions. Don’t use up time during a show to ask personal questions or give irrelevant feedback. Be respectful of the other people in the audience and their time, as well. For example, if Jackson asks if anyone has a story about their cat scratching someone, don’t share your story about your favorite Jackson Galaxy advice."

      "title": "Wait around after the event to potentially score one-on-one time.",
      "content": "Wait around after the event to potentially score one-on-one time. Particularly at smaller events, performers or celebrities sometimes come out from backstage to spend time close-up with their fans. Hang out for 15-20 minutes after the event ends in case he decides to do so. If he does, first ask him if it’s okay for you to take a few minutes of his time. If he says yes, introduce yourself politely, say how much you enjoyed the show, and then ask your question or say what you’re there to say. If Jackson is in a rush or clearly not interested in talking to fans, respect that. Don’t force yourself on him or follow him. That’s liable to get you kicked out of the venue."
