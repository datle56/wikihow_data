      "content": "Bring a heavy stick or pipe in case you have to defend yourself. If you have to go in the same corral with a bull, hold a weapon in your hand to defend yourself with or make the bull think twice about attacking you. [1] X Research source Good options include a walking stick, a heavy branch that won't break on impact, an axe handle, a 1–2 feet (30–61 cm) long metal pipe, or a baseball bat."

      "content": "Look around for cattle before entering a pasture. If you see a bull in a pasture or field, avoid going on his side of the fence whenever possible. This is the safest way to walk past a bull, even if it means having to walk the long way around to get to your destination. If you have to enter the pasture, take note of the bull's location. [2] X Research source Even a bull without horns can be dangerous—as can a cow, for that matter. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Watch for signs of aggression.",
      "content": "Watch for signs of aggression. If you must go through the field, examine the bull first to check for danger signs. A bull that sees you as a threat has many ways to signal its intentions and warn you to keep away: Pawing the dirt or rubbing himself in it [4] X Research source Bellowing or growling (it sounds something like \"rrrrrumph rrrrummph\") Tossing his head Glaring at you or following your movement with his eyes [5] X Research source Lowering his head so his forehead points toward you [6] X Research source Raising his tail slightly [7] X Research source Standing sideways to show you how big and powerful he is [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Stay near fences or obstacles.",
      "content": "Stay near fences or obstacles. Whenever crossing an area that might contain a bull, walk next to a fence that you can climb over for a quick escape. If that's not an option, choose a route that takes you past hay bales or other obstacles that you can get behind to protect yourself from a charge. [9] X Research source Walk as far away from the bull as you can, and not through the center of a herd. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Walk calmly through the area.",
      "content": "Walk calmly through the area. Since cattle can't judge distances well unless you're directly in front of them, walking too quickly into their field of vision can spook them. If the bull is facing away from you, walk slowly to avoid startling it. Once you're in its field of vision (anywhere not directly behind it), walk at a normal pace, but do not run or make any sudden movements, since these can encourage the bull to charge. [11] X Research source If the bull starts to watch you and make warning signs, turn so your side faces the bull and walk diagonally away. This makes you look smaller and less threatening."

    {
      "title": "Stay aware of the bull without making eye contact.",
      "content": "Stay aware of the bull without making eye contact. Always stay aware of the bull's movements and never turn your back on him. [12] X Research source That said, do not make eye contact, as the bull may interpret this as aggression. [13] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Back away from the exit if the bull makes warning signs or approaches.",
      "content": "Back away from the exit if the bull makes warning signs or approaches. If the bull shows any signs of aggression, back away calmly to the nearest gate, climbable fence, or cattle guard (also called a \"cow grid\" or \"Texas gate\"). The bull is assessing you as a threat, and running can cause it to charge. [14] X Research source Do the same if the bull seems calm but starts to walk toward you. Bulls that sneak up behind you can be even more dangerous than the ones that give you obvious warnings. Walk backward or diagonally away from the bull without turning your back on him or making eye contact. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Dodge a charge to the side, then run past the bull. If you are charged and can't get to safety in time, run to the side to get out of its path. As the bull passes you, change direction and run past the bull so it has to turn fully around. As you run to safety, zig-zag to slow the bull's momentum. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Throw your backpack or shirt as you run to distract the bull.",
      "content": "Throw your backpack or shirt as you run to distract the bull. Be aware, though, that a bull is much faster than you in both speed and reaction time, and often you won't have enough time to take your shirt off and throw it at the bull."

      "title": "Yell and hit the bull's face with your weapon if it corners you.",
      "content": "Yell and hit the bull's face with your weapon if it corners you. If a bull has backed you into a corner without an escape route, face the bull and yell as loud as you can. Hit the bull hard across the face or muzzle with your weapon. Keep striking and yelling until it backs off. [17] X Research source A hard hit to the muzzle or nose is often enough to make the bull stop chasing after you. This may sound cruel, but many farmers and ranchers do this when they have to deal with a dangerous bull. It's unlikely to cause much actual harm. If the bull is charging you, your priority should be getting out of its path. Dodge first, strike later."
