      "content": "You don’t have to be in a relationship to feel connected. If being single makes you feel down or make you feel like you’ll always be alone, don’t buy into it. Consider adopting or fostering a pet that you can take care of and spend time with. Look for volunteer opportunities in your area so you can give back and help others in need, which can give you a sense of fulfillment.

[7] X Research source If you’ve always wanted to see the Grand Canyon or go to Paris, you have much more time and opportunity if you’re single. Go for it! You don’t always have to travel far, though.

Start following a healthy diet that includes lean proteins, healthy fats, whole grains, and lots of fresh veggies. Try to get more active and exercise a little bit every day. Go to bed early enough to get at least 7 hours of restful sleep each night.

You may find that healthy, platonic relationships can make you feel happier and more fulfilled than even a romantic one. [9] X Research source You can visit your family or just give them a call every now and then to stay in touch. Go out and have some fun with your friends! You can catch a movie, go eat some tasty food at a restaurant, grab a drink at a bar, or just hang out and watch some TV."

      "content": "Keep in mind that your thoughts aren’t necessarily true. The next time you catch yourself thinking something negative about yourself, take a second to really question it. Think about why you might be thinking it and whether or not it’s actually true. Counter negative thoughts with positive ones and you may notice you’re not so upset about being single. With practice, you’ll get better at catching negative thoughts before they get a chance to take root. [10] X Research source For instance, if you find yourself thinking something like, “I’m going to be single and alone forever,” try rethinking it in a more positive way like, “Being single means I can focus on myself and spend time doing things I like to do.” It can sometimes be easy to listen to your negative thoughts and feelings without even realizing it."

Being single means you have plenty of time and opportunity to evaluate yourself and think about where you want to be in life. Think about what changes you’d like to make, skills you’d like to learn, activities you’d like to do, or new attitudes you’d like to develop. Knowing what you want can make it easier for you to focus on the ways you can make it happen. [12] X Research source For instance, if you want to start your own design company, you can focus on learning the skills you need, researching what it takes, and saving the money to make it happen. You may find that there are some things that you’d like to change about yourself, and that’s great! You can definitely make it happen and be the person you want to be."

      "content": "Your own personal growth can bring its own satisfaction. Being in a relationship often means you have to account for your partner’s thoughts and feelings in addition to your own. If you’re single, you’re freer to pursue your own passions and interests. Instead of thinking about finding a partner, focus on yourself. Commit to doing whatever it takes to make your dreams a reality and you may not have time to worry about a relationship. [13] X Research source For example, if you want to get in shape, you can join a gym and commit to taking fitness classes and following a healthy diet to do it."

People who long for a partner or a romantic relationship can sometimes experience something known as “ambiguous grief,” which can feel a lot like you lost someone close to you. If your friends that are in relationships sometimes make you feel sad or uncomfortable, talk to them about it. Tell them if something they do exacerbates your grief and they may understand where you’re coming from and make changes to prevent it from happening in the future. [14] X Research source For instance, if your friend talks to you about arguments they have with their partner and they expect you to take sides and condemn their partner’s behavior, but the next day they’re back to being madly in love with them, it can understandably make you feel uncomfortable.

While you don’t have to be on the lookout for a new relationship, if an opportunity for a date arises, pay attention to how you feel. If you want to give it a shot, go for it! But at the same time, try not to get your expectations or your hopes so high that you might be willing to overlook red flags or signs that maybe the relationship isn’t right for you. [15] X Research source There’s no harm in having a nice dinner with someone that you might like. But try not to think of them as future relationship material until you’ve had a chance to really get to know them."
