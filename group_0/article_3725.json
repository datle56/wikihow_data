      "content": "Get in physical shape. In order to become a warrant officer, you'll first need to join the Army National Guard. Enlisting in the army means you'll need to be in top physical shape. There are a number of fitness exams you'll need to pass during your initial army training and later on when applying to become a warrant officer. Join in a gym and work on both cardiovascular fitness and weight lifting. You'll need to have both stamina as well as basic strength to become a member of an army. To keep your workouts engaging and effective, itâ€™s essential to add variety to your routine. Repeating the same exercises can lead to a plateau, where your body no longer improves. Mixing up your exercises, changing the number of repetitions, and adjusting the intensity can help you continue progressing and stay motivated. Consider hiring a personal trainer or talking to your doctor before starting a fitness program. If you are currently sedentary or otherwise out of shape, you'll need to start working out gradually and build your strength. A doctor or trainer can take stock of your current physical health and provide workout recommendations and fitness goals for you."
