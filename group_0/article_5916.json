      "content": "Use a volumizing shampoo. Volumizing shampoo coats each shaft of thin hair to make it appear more thick. It has a lightweight formula and won’t weigh your hair down. To find a quality shampoo, pick a more reputable, high-end brand or ask your hair stylist for recommendations. Avoid shampoos that are meant for dry hair types. These shampoos are best for people with thicker, frizzy hair, and will weigh down fine hair, making it look limp."

      "title": "Use heat protective spray for styling.",
      "content": "Use heat protective spray for styling. Heat stylers like curling irons or straightening irons can cause damage to any hair type, but they are particularly harsh on fine hair. It’s best not to use irons at all, but if they are an important part of your beauty routine, use a heat protective spray before using heat tools. Heat protective sprays coat the strands of your hair so that they are not damaged as much by the heat of the iron."

      "content": "Use a cool or warm setting on your heat tools. Always start with the lowest setting on your hair iron or dryer.

      "title": "Try dry shampoo for touch ups.",
      "content": "Try dry shampoo for touch ups. People with flat, fine hair often notice that their hair gets oily quickly. Dry shampoo is a great product to counteract oil build-up because it acts as a powder that absorbs excess grease and oil. To use a dry shampoo, dust a small amount on the scalp. Then use your fingers to work it through the oily areas of your hair. Don’t use dry shampoo as a replacement for regular shampoo. Instead, use it occasionally for touch ups."
