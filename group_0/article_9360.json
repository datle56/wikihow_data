      "content": "Choose a location for your bed that gets full sun 6-8 hours a day. Most vegetables do best if they get full sun for most of the day. Find a spot where any plants you intend to grow will get all the sunlight they need. [2] X Research source If you plan to have several planting beds side-by-side, orient them so the long sides face north-south. This will prevent the beds from shading each other. Avoid building your planting bed under a tree to prevent excessive shade and leaf litter."

      "content": "Select a level spot. Find an area in your garden that is as flat as possible. Not only will this make it easier for you to build, but it will also help prevent water from draining unevenly from the planting bed. [3] X Research source To check if the ground where you want to build is level, hammer 2 stakes into the ground around the same distance apart as the length of the planter you want to build. Tie a length of string between the stakes and hang a carpenter’s level on it. If the area is level, the bubble should appear between the 2 center lines. If you can’t find a level part of your lawn, you may have to topdress it to even out bumps, or even build a terrace if your whole yard slopes. You can level out uneven areas in your yard by filling in depressions with soil and tamping it down."

Look for a spot in your garden where you’ll have the freedom to move all around the planting bed so you’ll have easy access for watering, weeding, and harvesting. [4] X Research source If possible, leave at least 18 inches (46 cm) between the planting bed and any surrounding beds or planters so you can move between them easily. You can build your planting bed up against a wall or fence if you wish, but you’ll need to make it narrow enough so you can easily reach plants at the back of the bed (i.e., at most 2 feet (0.61 m) wide).

You can make your planters as long as you want, but they’ll need to be narrow enough so that you can easily reach all the plants inside. For most people, 4 feet (1.2 m) is the maximum comfortable width. [6] X Research source For example, you might build a planting bed that’s 4 feet (1.2 m) wide and 8 feet (2.4 m) long.

If possible, build your planter 1–2 feet (0.30–0.61 m) high. [8] X Research source A higher planting bed also has the advantage of being easier to reach without bending over or squatting as much."

      "content": "Select a durable type of wood for the frame to prevent rot. Wood is the most common material for building raised planting beds, although you could also use other materials, such as brick, concrete, or even aluminum siding. If you go with wood, select a type that is chemically treated to last longer. [9] X Research source Most modern pressure-treated or chemically treated lumbers no longer contain arsenic or other toxic compounds. Choose a copper-based treatment such as ACQ, which is considered safe for food crops. If you’d rather avoid chemically treated wood altogether, get a more durable type of natural wood, such as cedar, redwood, or cypress. These types of lumber are more expensive than less durable woods, like pine, but they may last for up to 20 years."

Unless you plan to build up the walls with several courses of wood, choose boards that are wide enough to reach the desired height (e.g., 18 inches (46 cm)). For example, if you want to make a planter that’s 2 feet (0.61 m) wide by 4 feet (1.2 m) long, cut 2 planks that are 2 feet (0.61 m) long and 2 planks that are 4 feet (1.2 m) long to make the sides of the frame.

There are a couple of ways to do this: Use a shovel or spade to cut grooves into the turf along the outer edges of the planting bed site. [12] X Research source Alternatively, mark out the corners with stakes and run string or twine between them to define the edges of the bed."

Lift an end of each strip with the edge of a spade or garden fork, then roll the strip up and remove the roll from the planting area. [14] X Research source Purchase or rent a sod cutter to make this task easier, especially if you’re building a long planting bed. [15] X Research source If you come across any large rocks or old roots under the turf, remove those as well. If you remove the turf carefully enough, you may be able to save it and use it to patch another area of your lawn."

[17] X Research source To make it easier for your plants to root in the soil under the bed, remove the top layer of loosened soil and then dig down about a spade’s length deeper. Put the soil you removed back in the bed and mix the 2 layers of loose soil together."

At each of the 4 inside corners of the area you marked out, drive in a heavy wooden stake. Drive it in far enough so that about 60% of the stake is below ground, while the other 40% is exposed above ground. [18] X Research source Use stakes that are long enough to reach the tops of the planter walls after you drive them in. If you’re building a long planter (e.g., longer than 4–6 feet (1.2–1.8 m), you may need to drive in stakes every 3 feet (0.91 m) for extra support."

You can also create a frame by attaching the boards together with brackets, then simply set it in place around the outside of the bed. [22] X Research source Then, fix it to the stakes for extra stability. If the boards you’re using aren’t wide enough to achieve the height you want, use taller stakes and build up the walls with 2 or more courses of boards. For example, use stakes that extend 24 inches (61 cm) above the ground, then built the sides of the frame with 2 rows of boards that are 12 inches (30 cm) wide."

You can attach it to the bottoms of the walls with a staple gun. [23] X Research source The hardware cloth will keep out pests without preventing good drainage or rooting."

If you want to cover your garden bed with netting to keep out insect pests, create a simple frame by bending lengths of PVC pipe into arches and mounting them over the planter. In cooler weather, create a mini-greenhouse by clipping a clear plastic cover to the PVC arches. Use flexible lengths of 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) pipe that are twice the width of your planter to make the arches. [29] X Research source To mount the arches: [30] X Research source Cut sections of stiff 1 in (2.5 cm) pipe to the same length as the height of the frame (e.g., 18 inches (46 cm)). Use clamps and screws to attach 2 sections of 1 in (2.5 cm) tube opposite each other on the inside of the frame anywhere you want to install an arch. For example, you might install these tubes at both ends and the middle of the planter frame. Insert 1 end of the 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) pipe into one of the short tube sections, bend it in the middle to create an arch, and insert the other end into the tube section on the opposite side of the planter."
