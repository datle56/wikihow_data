      "title": "Respect a celebrity’s private and personal time.",
      "content": "Respect a celebrity’s private and personal time. Celebrities have their own private lives, even when they’re out in public, and may not respond well to being approached out of the blue. Signing autographs and taking photos is part of their work life, so respect their “time off.” As a general rule of thumb, steer clear if the celebrity is with their family or spending time with someone already. [1] X Research source It’s especially important to avoid asking for autographs or photos while a celebrity is with their children. They may wish to protect their children’s safety and relative anonymity. Also avoid asking if you’re in an enclosed space, like an elevator, where they might feel trapped or obligated to do as you ask."

      "title": "Avoid interrupting celebrities.",
      "content": "Avoid interrupting celebrities. Think about how you’d feel if someone asked you to answer a work call while you’re at dinner with a friend. It’s the same with a celebrity! If they’re already engaged in something—dinner, a conversation, or even business—avoid approaching them, and try again another time. The best time to ask for an autograph is at an official event, like a meet and greet or signing, where the celebrity is expected to interact with fans. Also avoid lingering until they’re done. If you have to, go somewhere nearby and enjoy yourself, then check back in 15-20 minutes."

    {
      "title": "Plan what you’ll say beforehand.",
      "content": "Plan what you’ll say beforehand. Plan ahead by knowing what you will say to the celebrity. Phrases that are appropriate are, “Can I have your autograph?” or “I really like your work, may I have an autograph or a picture?” Avoid saying things like, “I really hate to do this, but may I take a picture with you?” or “I really didn’t want to bother you, but my friend wanted me to ask for a photo of you.” These don’t come across as sincere."

    {
      "title": "Have your materials ready.",
      "content": "Have your materials ready. A celebrity who agrees to sign something or pose for a photo is already taking time out of their day for you, so try to minimize that time by being prepared. Have your own pen (and a backup), camera, or item to be signed handy, and make sure they work beforehand. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Let any kids ask them first.",
      "content": "Let any kids ask them first. Chances are, you’re not the only person who’s spotted the celebrity from afar. Consequently, there might be other people, including children, asking for an autograph or a picture as well. Let the children go first—not only is it the right thing to do, but kids are more likely to get the autograph, anyway. [3] X Research source Definitely avoid pushing or chastising children, which isn’t a good look and may make the celebrity decide not to give you their autograph."

    {
      "title": "Stay polite and casual.",
      "content": "Stay polite and casual. Say “please” when asking, and say “Thank you for your time,” even if they decline. Celebrities deserve respect just like anyone else. And, they also deserve peace, so avoid drawing attention with loud excitement, shouting, or clamoring. Treat them like an acquaintance. [4] X Research source Open with something short and simple, then make your request. You might say, “Excuse me, I’m a fan and I recognized you. If it’s not too much trouble, could we take a picture together?” Also, approach them from the front or side. Avoid startling them from behind, or touching them to get their attention."

    {
      "title": "Thank them for their work, but be conscious of their time.",
      "content": "Thank them for their work, but be conscious of their time. If the moment allows, say something like, “I’ve always admired your work,” or, “Thank you for your amazing art,” but don’t linger. Be aware that celebrities have places to be, and that there may be other people waiting to get an autograph or a picture, too. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stick to a single autograph or photo, rather than multiple.",
      "content": "Stick to a single autograph or photo, rather than multiple. Further respect the celebrity’s time and energy by ending the interaction after they give one signature, or take one photo. This lets them get on with their day, or greet other waiting fans. Also, asking them to sign multiple things can be suspicious, as some “fans” sell autographs for a profit. Avoid asking them to sign odd things, like body parts, clothing, toilet seats, or other unconventional objects. The celebrity might find it offensive and you may not get an autograph."
    },
    {
      "title": "Respect their personal space and consent.",
      "content": "Respect their personal space and consent. Consent applies to touching celebs, too. Always ask for things like a handshake, or a close pose for a photograph, and respect their answer. If you respect their personal space, and follow the celebrity’s lead on how to act around them, they'll be more willing to accept your request. Also, avoid filming the encounter, which can be incredibly awkward and apply needless pressure to the celebrity."
