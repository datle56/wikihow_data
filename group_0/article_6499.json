      "content": "Change your address or other contact information through your credit card issuer. Your bank or credit card company will allow you to change your contact information either through their website or over the phone. Use the customer service number printed on the back of your card to call your credit card issuer. If changing this information online, you will likely need to look for a section of the website marked “Change Address/Phone Number” or something similar. Use the “Help” or “FAQ” section if you can’t figure out how to do it. Bear in mind that you will need to have an online account already set up with your credit card issuer to change your address over the Internet. Capital One’s option for changing your address can be found on their customer service page. [1] X Research source Discover provides instructions for changing both your address and name on their site. [2] X Research source American Express’ system for changing your contact information works similarly to Capital One’s. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Update any subscription-related billing information online using the website of the organization to which you subscribe. Most websites that need your credit card information on file will have a “Billing” section where you can update your credit card info if necessary. Such changes can range from adding a totally new card to simply updating your current card’s expiration date. Either look for the site’s billing section or go to the “Help” section to find it. When changing your payment information on iTunes, remember that if you have Family Sharing turned on you will need to have your Family Organizer update the information. [4] X Research source Netflix allows you to update payment and address information on the same page. [5] X Research source You can manage your Amazon shipping and billing addresses in between purchases or while you are in the process of making a purchase. [6] X Research source If your account is disabled because your card expired, updating the card will generally cause your account to be re-activated. If you use a debit card for subscriptions, the process of changing them is the same as it is for changing credit card-related information."

Most organizations that require your credit card to process recurring payments will have a hotline that you can call to change the information related to the card they have on file for you. In some cases these hotlines will operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In other cases they will only operate during business hours, such as 8am through 5pm, Monday through Friday. Check the organization’s website for a help line. This information is usually listed at the bottom of the main webpage or under the “Contact” page."

      "content": "Obtain the correct documentation for a legal name change to your credit card. If you need to change your name for a reason such as getting married, you’ll need to file official paperwork with your state of residence before you can change the name on your credit card. This is because credit card companies will generally require official documentation such as a copy of your government-issued ID displaying your new name before they can make the change. The process varies by state, but generally you will need to file for a new Social Security card as well as driver’s license or other ID before you change the name on your card. Because the process of legally changing your name is different depending on the state in which you reside, you should contact your local court clerk to determine the specific requirements. [7] X Research source In Virginia, for instance, you need to fill out official paperwork with the county court before going to the DMV and utilities to change the name on your official documentation.

      "content": "Contact your bank immediately if your credit card is lost or stolen. Banks and other credit card companies often have specialized hotlines you can call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to report a lost or stolen card. U.S. federal law limits your liability for any unauthorized charges on your card to $50, and most credit cards come with policies that leave you liable for no unauthorized charges at all. But those policies usually only apply to purchases made after you report the card as lost or stolen. So if you wait until someone starts using your card in a fraudulent manner, you may be liable for $50 worth of purchases you didn’t make. [9] X Research source Contacting your bank immediately is especially critical if you have a debit card. If you report the card missing between 2 and 60 days of when it was lost or stolen, you may be liable for up to $500 worth of unauthorized purchases. If you wait more than 60 days, you may be liable for all unauthorized purchases made during that time. [10] X Research source The process for replacing a lost or stolen debit card is the same as it is for replacing a credit card. But be aware that you may be without a debit card for up to a week while you wait for a new one. That would mean you wouldn’t be able to withdraw cash from your bank account during that time. You can generally find the correct number to call if your card is lost or stolen on your most recent credit card statement. If you have online access to your card’s account, many banks and credit card companies will allow you to report the loss or theft online. [11] X Research source"

A thief who steals your credit card information may make a small purchase of $20 or less to see if you notice. If you don’t dispute that charge, the thief may make bigger and bigger charges. A common variety of this scam is to place a charge of $9.84 on your card, as this value is small enough to avoid detection while also appearing legitimate. [13] X Research source Remember that in some cases legitimate charges may show up under different names on your credit card statement. Therefore, don’t dispute charges that seem fraudulent without at least doing an internet search for the name under the charge. In some cases the charge may come with a phone number, which you should consider calling to ask about the charge. [14] X Research source"

Your credit card company may require you to contact the merchant first to ask them to cancel the charge. If they do, keep records of your communication with the merchant such as copies of emails or phone records to prove that you called them. Otherwise the credit card company will likely just cancel your card and replace it. [15] X Research source Consider contacting the police to report an unauthorized charge first. Your credit card company may need a police report to find you not liable for the charge, and credit card fraud is a serious crime in any case."
