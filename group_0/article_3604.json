Whenever your characters speak, have them say something that propels them to the next beat of your story. Think about what needs to happen in the scene and how your characters would naturally react to what’s happening. [6] X Research source Listen to how actual people talk so you can make your dialogue more believable. If you have trouble coming up with dialogue, write the very basic phrases you want to convey. You can always come back to it later. For example, you could just write in, “We have to get away from these zombies!” as placeholder dialogue."
