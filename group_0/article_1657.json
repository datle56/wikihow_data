      "content": "If you don’t know him well, start out by getting some insider knowledge. You can ask your friends (or even his friends) which sports he does, if he’s in the school play, what his favorite class is, or which TV shows he likes to watch. You don’t have to get his whole life story, but try to prepare yourself with one or two things you know about him. [1] X Research source You can also get this info if you have classes with him or see him around school. For instance, if he’s wearing sneakers and basketball shorts, you can probably guess that he plays basketball."

      "content": "You might be a little nervous, but that’s okay! If you feel shy, try to fake it until you make it. Push your shoulders back, lift your chin up, and keep a smile on your face. The more confident you look, the better chance you have of striking up a conversation with a cute guy. [5] X Research source If you’re feeling a little awkward, try waiting until the guy is alone. It’s much easier to approach someone one-on-one than in front of a group of people."

      "content": "It’s a good starting point if you two don’t know each other. If you’ve only ever seen him around school, just start by heading over and saying hello. Then, tell him your name to get a conversation started. [6] X Research source Say something like, “Hey, my name’s Alyssa. What’s yours?” If you two already know each other but you haven’t talked in a while, you could say something like, “Hey, I’m Brad. Remember me? We went to kindergarten together.”"

      "content": "Maybe you two have classes or friends that overlap. Or, maybe you both play sports after school. Talking about something you’re both interested in will get a good conversation flowing, and it’s an easy way to approach someone. Try something like: [7] X Research source “That math test last week was brutal. How’d you do?” “Do you play soccer too? I’ve seen you out in the field a few times.” “Have you started the science homework yet?”"

      "content": "Everyone likes hearing nice things about themselves! As you two chat, work in a few compliments to let him know that you might be interested in him. You could talk about how good he looks today, how you like his outfit, or even how smart he is. Say something like: [8] X Research source “I really like that sweater on you. Is it vintage?” “You killed that debate in class yesterday. It’s like you’ve been practicing!” “I wish I could pull off curly hair that well. It looks amazing.”"

You don’t have to call it a date if you don’t want to. Try something like: [9] X Research source “I was gonna watch the football game after school today. Wanna come?” “Are you doing anything next week? It would be fun to check out the new bowling alley.”"

He’ll be able to text you and you two can talk about hanging out later. [10] X Research source You could say something like, “I have to run to class, but I want to finish our conversation. Could I give you my number?” Or, “Why don’t I give you my number? That way you can text me later.”"

If you’re feeling shy or you just can’t work up the nerve to talk to him, try following him on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. You can send him a DM to get a convo going and then chat with him in person when you know him better. Your DM could say something like, “Hey, don’t we have English class together?” or, “You’re on the football team, right? Good luck tonight!”"
