      "content": "The “Coastal grandmother” aesthetic is a fashion and home decor trend. It was inspired by the aesthetics of director Nancy Meyers’ movies, especially the 2003 classic Something’s Gotta Give. The movie’s main character (played by Diane Keaton) embodies the coastal grandmother style with her wardrobe, which is filled with cozy knitwear, breezy button-down shirts, and lots of linen. Her beachfront home, where much of the movie takes place, is also a perfect example of the aesthetic with its neutral-toned decor and laid-back coastal vibe. [1] X Research source The term was coined by TikTok user @lexnicoleta, whose viral post explaining the aesthetic garnered 469.2K likes and 2.8 million views. The popularity of the trend even caught the eye of Nancy Meyers herself, who posted about it on Instagram . “This article says the Coastal Grandmother aesthetic has garnered over 1 billion views on TikTok,” she wrote in the caption of her post. “That’s a lot of views for a pair of khaki pants, a GAP sweater, and a bucket hat!”"

      "content": "Tops The coastal grandmother aesthetic is all about cozy, laid-back pieces in a color palette of sandy neutrals, bright whites, and soft baby blues. Here are a few staple tops to look for if you want to try out the style yourself. Luckily, a lot of these pieces are classics that have stood the test of time, so you likely already have a few of them in your closet! [2] X Research source Breezy button-down shirts: Loose-fitting button-downs are an important staple in the coastal grandmother wardrobe. For colors, white, baby blue, and neutral tones are preferable, and vertical stripes within this color palette work as well. Oversized denim button-downs are also great. Cozy knit cardigans and sweaters: Layer your coastal grandmother look with a soft pullover sweater or a knit cardigan . The same color palette applies here: whites, beiges, blues, and stripes are all perfect options. [3] X Research source Laid-back cotton T-shirts: Comfy cotton T-shirts in the same color palette are another popular addition to the coastal grandmother wardrobe. You can wear a tee on its own on a hotter day, or throw it on under an open button-down shirt or cozy cardigan when it’s a bit chillier out. Classic turtlenecks: For colder weather, a white turtleneck is a great option. Diane Keaton’s character in Something’s Gotta Give and Cameron Diaz’s character in The Holiday both rock this look.

      "content": "Bottoms The coastal grandmother aesthetic is all about blending class with comfort. The goal is to look laid-back and breezy but still put together. For this look, loose-fitting bottoms in natural fabrics like linen are key. Here are a few options to try out: Linen pants: White linen pants are the ultimate coastal grandmother bottoms. You can opt for a flowy, wide-legged pant, or go for more of a straight leg if you prefer. Chinos: When you need to dress things up a bit, white, tan, brown, or navy blue chino pants are a great option. Wide-leg or straight-leg jeans: Jeans are the perfect middle ground between comfy and dressed-up, but be sure to opt for a looser, more laid-back fit, like wide-leg or straight-leg . Breezy midi or maxi skirts: If you’re not much of a pants person, mid-length or maxi skirts in the same color palette work as well. A white or neutral-toned linen skirt would look great with an oversized sweater, and a denim midi skirt would pair super well with a loose-fitting button-down."

So, you need some cute shoes to pair with your coastal grandma ensembles! Here are some options to try out: Sandals: Neutral-toned leather sandals are a safe bet, but since the coastal grandmother style tends to be a bit more understated and laid back, try to look for options that have simple designs , without tons of complicated straps or embellishments. Espadrilles: Espadrilles are the perfect embodiment of the coastal grandmother aesthetic. You can go for flats or wedges, solid, striped, or patterned—whatever you prefer!

You can pick whichever style you like the best, whether that be a simple canvas sneaker or a chunkier leather sneaker."

It’s a simple, laid-back aesthetic, so you don’t want to go overboard, but a few cute finishing touches can definitely tie the whole look together. Here are some ideas: Hats: For warm days at the beach or sunny afternoons at the farmer’s market, try a wide-brimmed straw hat . A white bucket hat (a favorite of Diane Keaton’s character in Something’s Gotta Give ) is also a great option. [6] X Research source Bags: For casual outings, canvas or woven totes and crocheted bags work perfectly. If you’re getting a bit more dressed up, opt for a simple and classic leather crossbody bag in white, black, or brown. Jewelry: Simple pieces, such as a delicate gold necklace with a charm or plain pearl earrings, are key. Less is more, so try not to layer tons of bracelets or necklaces on top of each other."

Think plush couches and armchairs to sink into, preferably in white or beige (if your couch isn’t in this color palette, you can always try a slipcover !). For a pop of color, opt for some blue-toned throw pillows and blankets . [7] X Research source Finally, add a few floor lamps or table lamps for bright, ambient lighting, and you’ve got a coastal grandmother living room! For decorative accents, wicker baskets , jute rugs , and vases of fresh flowers all work perfectly.

A solid or patterned bedspread in light blue, white, or beige is ideal, topped with throw blankets and throw pillows for extra comfort. To balance out all of the light colors, consider opting for a bed frame or nightstand with darker wood. [9] X Research source For added character, try using books as decorative accents. A wall shelf displaying your favorites or even a curated stack on your dresser can give your room a cozy, lived-in look. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Kitchen A bright and airy farmhouse kitchen is the heart of a coastal grandmother-inspired home. To achieve this look, white or light-colored cabinetry is ideal, but darker wood also creates a nice contrast. Decorative accents like fresh flowers on the counter, cute blue patterned dish towels , and a nice utensil holder with lots of wooden cooking utensils inside are also common. [11] X Research source It’s a good idea, in general, to opt for wood instead of plastic or metal when you’re going for the coastal grandmother look. Wood cutting boards , for example, go great with this aesthetic! Neutral-colored ceramic dishware, pottery, and cookware are also ideal, especially if they have a more vintage, artisan-like look."

      "content": "Go all-in on the coastal grandmother lifestyle and throw a dinner party. In a video on her account, TikTok user @lexnicoleta (who first coined the “coastal grandma” term) explains that cooking and hosting are some of the quintessential “coastal grandmother” hobbies. So, if you’re looking for ways to truly embrace your inner coastal grandma, hosting a classy dinner party is the perfect place to start! Here are some tips to make it perfect: The guest list: Try to invite about 5-7 people. A coastal grandmother party should be intimate and laid-back, so you’ll want to keep the guest list on the smaller side. The vibes, ambiance, & decor: Dim the overhead lights and use lots of candles and lamps to create cozy mood lighting. For decor, you can keep things simple—vases of fresh flowers and beautiful table settings are perfect. The playlist: Put on some nostalgic oldies to create the right ambiance. TikTok user @lexnicoleta even created an official coastal grandmother playlist you can check out! The food: Coastal grandmothers are frequent shoppers at the farmer’s market, so opt for something that features lots of fresh produce. Pasta dishes, roasted meat or fish with veggies, and delicious soups and salads are all great options. For appetizers, a fancy charcuterie board is definitely a crowd-pleaser!"
