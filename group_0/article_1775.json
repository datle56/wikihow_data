Romance-neutral : Someone who neither particularly enjoys nor strongly opposes receiving romantic gestures or doing traditionally “romantic” things.

The difference between asexuality and aromanticism is a matter of sexual desire versus romantic desire. Someone who’s aromantic can still feel sexual attraction, and someone who identifies as asexual might still experience romantic attraction. [24] X Research source A person who is aromantic asexual , or “aroace” for short, feels little to no romantic or sexual attraction toward others. There are many different combinations of romantic and sexual orientations that exist. For example, someone who is aromantic heterosexual might feel no romantic attraction toward others but may be sexually attracted to people of the opposite gender. Another example would be someone who is demiromantic bisexual , meaning that they are sexually attracted to men and women, but may only feel romantic attraction once they’ve formed a strong emotional connection. The aromantic and asexual communities share many of the same terms when it comes to defining sub-identities. For example, asexual sub-identities such as graysexual, demisexual, and fraysexual all have the same meanings but refer to sexual attraction instead of romantic attraction. [25] X Research source"
