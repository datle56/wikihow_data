      "content": "Recognize the difference between a racist action and a racist person. Doing or saying one racist thing doesn't necessarily make you a bad person, especially if you react well and make up for it. There's a difference between one or two mistakes and a habit of doing bad things. [1] X Research source Compare it to tripping other people. If you accidentally trip people on occasion, and then apologize and make sure they're okay, that doesn't make you a bad person. If you trip people on purpose, or refuse to watch where you're going even though you are repeatedly hurting people, that is a reflection on your character. Your character is not defined by your mistakes, but how you react to your mistakes. If you live in an area where there is racism, you may unintentionally pick up a few racist attitudes. It happens. To help fix it, you can work actively on un-learning and challenging your questionable thoughts and assumptions."

      "content": "Recognize that it may have taken a lot of courage for the person to come to you. Living in a racist world can be very tough for some people. If they've had a lot of bad experiences, it can be stressful, and they may have a really hard time figuring out how to bring it up with you and how to phrase it well because they don't want to be attacked. Compare it to being punched. Imagine if people often punched you in the stomach, sometimes lightly, and sometimes really hard. You would get a bruise there, and it would really hurt. Thus, any time you got punched on that bruise, it might hurt a lot more. People who didn't understand your bruise might think you were over-reacting, because they didn't know you were already hurt. Similarly, people of color might react strongly to racism if they have already been hurt many times. This context may help you understand the stress that the other person is experiencing. Keep it in mind, to help you empathize with them."

      "title": "Avoid common logical fallacies about racist comments.",
      "content": "Avoid common logical fallacies about racist comments. Some people try to minimize or make excuses for what they've done. But this makes it worse, not better, because it implies you don't take it seriously. Here are some mistakes to recognize and avoid. Good intent doesn't negate bad impact. \"I didn't mean anything bad\" can be true, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't have to apologize. A caring person apologizes for their mistakes, including total accidents. Bystanders can speak up against racism and request an apology. The burden of stopping racism shouldn't only fall on its direct victims. For example, a black person can speak up against anti-Asian racism, and a white person can defend a Latinx friend. [2] X Research source One person not minding doesn't make it okay. Some people will tell you they don't care if you insult them. That doesn't mean it isn't inappropriate, or that other people shouldn't object. Racist jokes may not have funny consequences. Research shows that disparaging jokes can shape and reinforce negative attitudes in certain individuals. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Prejudiced jokes can make prejudged people accept prejudice [4] X Research source and may embolden prejudiced people to act in discriminatory ways. [5] X Research source \"It's just a joke\" may ignore serious consequences of normalizing racism, if the joke was told to already prejudged person."

      "title": "Take accusations seriously.",
      "content": "Take accusations seriously. Even if you don't understand why, act with the assumption that the person has a very good reason for saying that they’re offended. Racism isn't something that people take lightly. It's better to be too serious than to blow off someone else's pain. [6] X Research source If someone points out a racist comment, they aren’t saying, \"You're a terrible person\" or even, “You’re a racist.” They are telling you that you said something hurtful. Don’t take it personally, but instead, recognize that they’re helping you see your blind spots."

      "title": "Ask questions.",
      "content": "Ask questions. You might wonder what was racist in your words. If so, ask the person. You might have a lot of questions, so ask them one at a time. For example, if you’re unclear, ask, “What did I say that was racist?” You might also wonder, “How was that offensive?” or, “What could I have said instead?” Don't push them to explain if they're uncomfortable. While some people are willing to gently guide you through the painful world of racism, it isn't their job, so don't expect it, and express gratitude if they take time for you. If the interaction happens online, consider private messaging the person to talk about it further and ask your questions."

      "content": "Take responsibility for your actions. Own up to what you said and accept any consequences that have (or may) occur. Taking responsibility means admitting that you said something hurtful and that there’s no excuse for it. It means you don’t blame anything or anyone else for what came out of your mouth. [7] X Research source Taking responsibility often doesn’t feel good, but it’s an important part of admitting your actions and showing that you’re sincere in taking steps to amend what went wrong."

      "content": "Plan your apology. Choose the circumstances around your apology carefully. For example, don’t casually bring it up in the middle of something or around strangers. Try to apologize in a private way. Choose a good time and a quiet setting that will facilitate the discussion and apology. Pick a time you know the person or people are available and have time to talk. Allow some time for discussion. Say, “Is this a good time to talk?” or, “Can we talk tomorrow after class?” [8] X Research source If they seem iffy, it may help to tell them that you want to talk to them to apologize. You don’t want to feel rushed in your apology, nor do you want the other person or people to feel awkward or uncomfortable."

      "content": "Decide how to deliver your apology. In most cases, you’ll speak in-person to one person or a group of people. There are certain instances that may warrant a public apology. If you made a racist comment online, for example, you may want to publicly take responsibility and apologize for your comment. Or, if you made a comment in your workplace or classroom, you may want to revisit that space and those people and make amends. You may choose to write a letter. If you struggle to say things out loud or have difficulty wording your apology, try a letter (or email). This can help you say what you need to say how you want to say it."

Avoid trying to justify why you made your comment (“It was funny at the time”) or making a non-apology: the apology isn’t about how they feel or if they feel bad, it’s about your actions. Avoid saying things like, “I’m sorry if you feel bad” or, “I’m sorry you didn’t understand me.” [10] X Research source One helpful technique is to use the word and instead of the word but, such as \"I'm sorry and I didn't mean it\" instead of \"I'm sorry but I didn't mean it.\""

      "content": "Avoid placing further emotional burdens on the person you apologized to. You may be feeling guilty and rotten inside (which is a sign that you are a good person with a functioning conscience). It is your responsibility to deal with those feelings, and the other person shouldn't have to hand-hold you through them. Focus on their feelings, not your own. You should be comforting them, not the other way around. You can mention your bad feelings without expecting the other person to fix them for you. \"I feel terrible for hurting you and I'm so sorry\" is a decent apology. \"I feel terrible, I can't sleep just thinking about it, and I've never felt this bad in my life, and you forgive me right, and...\" isn't appropriate. If you're struggling to process your feelings, talk to someone who isn't involved in the incident. For example, if you upset your friend from work, maybe you could talk to your mom about it."
