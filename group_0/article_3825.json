      "title": "Set up your website.",
      "content": "Set up your website. This will probably be one of your main sources of income. Avon provides each representative with a personalized website they can use to take orders, give information about the products and disseminate contact information. Name your website URL something that's easy to remember; it could be your name or something that grabs prospective customers' attention. Even though Avon is called a \"direct selling\" company, you don't have to go door-to-door to sell it anymore. You can use your website to sell Avon to customers who are not even near you geographically, for example, by sending the link to your online store to family in another state. In fact, some Avon reps sell exclusively online. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Spread the word.",
      "content": "Spread the word. It's important that you let everyone know that you're now selling Avon; customers won't just come to you! Distribute brochures to friends, family members, co-workers and people at your church, gym, grocery store or anywhere else you frequent on a regular basis. Consider asking local businesses if you can leave the brochures in the break room or front lobby. Be sure to attach your business card to the brochures so people will know who to contact when they want to purchase Avon products. Utilize social media, especially if you have a lot of friends or follows on websites like Facebook or Twitter. Let everyone know you are now selling Avon and post about products you love. Try not to overdo it, since most people don't appreciate having their feeds overwhelmed with sales pitches. The best posts are those that give your personal experience with products that you love. Consider setting up a party to help you get started selling Avon products. While parties are not required, it can be a useful selling tool."

      "title": "Form relationships.",
      "content": "Form relationships. Avon and other direct-selling businesses succeed or fail based on your ability to reach out to people and create loyal clients. This means you have to be willing to put yourself out there and start conversations! Consider everyone you meet a potential customer. This includes people at church, other parents in the PTA, people at work or at your spouse's work, and the people you chat up at the playground. Avon gives its new representatives the suggestion that they should try to talk to three people about Avon every day. That might seem like a lot, but when you realize that most of those conversations will not result in a sale, it isn't that many after all."

They even make d√©cor, gift items, and toys for children. When you use your own products, you are better equipped to talk up the benefits. Plus, if you receive a compliment on your eye shadow or shoes, you can launch into a pre-planned sales pitch about Avon and the affordable price of the item."
