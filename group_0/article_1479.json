      "content": "Pull down any clothing to your ankles. Any pants, skirts, and underwear should be pulled all the way down to avoid staining them. If you are wearing a dress, try to hold the dress up out of the way, if possible. If needed, pin the dress up out of the way while you change. If your clothing is damp or soaked, replace it with a fresh set. You may want to consider carrying an extra set of clothes to be prepared for these situations."

In the future, consider bringing a pack of moist towelettes with you. Avoid applying creams to this area when you're using liners. Creams might reduce the effectiveness of liners."

If it’s not wet, change it after 3-4 hours. Most people go through 4-6 pads a day. Never reuse a wet pad. Always dispose of soiled pads. Some brands may have a “wetness indicator” that will fade or change color when it is time to change your pad. Read the package of your pads for more information. Remember that the best way to prevent skin irritation is to keep the skin clean and dry. This requires checking the liner often and changing it as soon as it becomes soiled."
