      "content": "Replace your everyday vocab with 1950s words and phrases for a retro vibe. Using 1950s slang is easier than you may think! Simply use the words as defined to describe something or someone or express an emotion. Here are some examples: Instead of saying, “Are you going to the party tonight? It's going to be so much fun!” try, “Are you going to the bash tonight? It's going to be kicking!” If something is cool, say, “That’s nifty!” Rather than saying “goodbye,” go with, “I’ve got to split. See you tomorrow!” Keep in mind that some of these phrases or words may be a bit offensive today, so use them with caution."

      "content": "There was resilience and eagerness around economics in the 1950s. Part of America was homogeneous and resistant to change when it came to money. After all, the nation had just rebounded from the depression and WWII, and many held tight to loose change just in case. On the other hand, some Americans were eager to spend their money on new products and inventions, causing a rise in businesses (and therefore, new terms and slang). [12] X Research source One of the most popular businesses to arise from the 1950s was McDonald’s! McCarthyism and the Red Scare of communism became a pressing matter because of consumerism and the wider reach of the media. [13] X Research source In order to seem like you had classic American family values, slang was used to talk about things that were taboo in more uptight, \"traditional\" settings."
