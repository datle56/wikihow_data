If someone leans in for a kiss, tell them to back off in clear and simple terms. [1] X Research source [2] X Expert Source Crista Beck Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 26 August 2021.

Depending on who you're talking to—and how pushy they're being—you might try softening your approach a little.

      "content": "Be firm about enforcing your boundaries . Clearly stating that you don't want a kiss should be enough, but some people aren't good at taking the hint. Once you've told the other person what your boundaries are, stick to them. Let them know what the consequences will be if they don't respect your wishes. [8] X Research source For example, you might say, “I told you I don't want you to kiss me. If you keep trying to do it, I'm going to leave.” Make sure to follow through on your consequences. For example, if you tell the other person you're going to leave, get up and walk out immediately if they try to kiss you again."

      "content": "Get help if you feel like you're in danger. Some people can get hostile or aggressive when they feel rejected. If the other person threatens you or even if you just get a bad feeling about the situation, leave as soon as you can. If possible, let someone else know what's going on. Call emergency services as soon as it's safe to do so if you feel like you're in immediate danger.

If you're a child or teen, tell a trusted adult, such as your parent, a teacher, or a school counselor, as soon as you can. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Make up an excuse to prevent the kiss. If you're worried about hurting someone's feelings or don't feel comfortable just saying “No,” try coming up with a polite excuse to discourage the kiss. For example, you might explain that you're sick and don't want them to catch anything from you. Try saying something like, “You might not want to get too close—I'm fighting that nasty cold that's been going around.”"

      "content": "Try hugging or shaking hands before they can kiss you. If you suspect someone is going to swoop in for a kiss, you can sometimes divert it by making the first move. This works especially well in awkward greeting situations. Before they can get too close, stick out your hand for a handshake or pull them in for a quick hug. If you go for a hug, keep it short and light. Adding a pat on the back can also make it feel more friendly than intimate. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a distraction if you think they're going in for a kiss. If you think someone is about to kiss you, try quickly diverting their attention to something else. You could do this by pointing something out to them, bringing up a new topic of conversation, or making a request. For example, as they're leaning in, say something like, “Hey, I'm really thirsty, would you mind grabbing me a drink?” or “Wow, check out that waiter's amazing tattoo!”"

      "content": "Put some space between yourself and the kisser. Creating a little physical distance is another way to subtly avoid a kiss. If you know the person is likely to try to kiss you, keep some space between you or find an excuse to quickly move away from them if they try to get close. [13] X Research source For example, if they're dropping you off after a date, quickly hop out of the car and say goodnight from outside the car door. You could try saying something like, “I had a great time, but I'd better run. I have to get up early tomorrow.” If you're hanging out somewhere, try sitting across from them instead of next to them to create a little extra distance."

      "content": "Turn your head to dodge the kiss at the last minute. If the other person is already going in for a kiss, look for a way to subtly dodge it. If they're going for your lips, try turning your head to the side so that the kiss lands on your cheek instead. If you think they're going to kiss your cheek, try putting your cheek against theirs and turning it into an air kiss. [14] X Research source If you want to duck the kiss altogether, try pretending that you dropped something or that you saw something that startled you across the room. Say something like, “Oh, oops, let me pick that up!” or “Wait, is that Roger? What's he doing here?” and quickly duck or step to the side."

      "content": "Avoid being alone with the person if they like you romantically. Someone who's interested in you romantically is less likely to make a move if you have a friend or relative with you. Try to avoid being in situations where you're with the person one-on-one. While this isn't always guaranteed to work, it might make a difference! [15] X Research source For example, if they've invited you to hang out, have your best friend tag along or suggest a group activity. You can even try positioning a friend in between you and the potential kisser. For example, if you're going to a movie together, your friend can sit in the middle."
