Put the fresh or thawed squid on your cutting board and use a sharp knife to carefully cut across each squid to make 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) thick rings. If your squid has tentacles, cut them into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces. [1] X Research source It's important to make the rings thin so they cook quickly and don't become tough. If you can't buy cleaned squid, cut the squid in 1/2 so the tentacles are separate from the body. Then, pull the head off and peel away the skin. Rinse the squid before cutting it."
