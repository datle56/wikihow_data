If you want a happy-go-lucky, physically fit, educated man, you should work on being a happy-go-lucky, physically fit, educated woman. You need to become the type of person you want to attract, first and foremost. [1] X Research source Not only will this attract the right kind of men, but working on yourself will also increase your self-confidence. A good rule of thumb is to sporadically “check yourself,” and decide if you would want a man who is doing what you’re doing. In other words, if you’re lying on the couch eating Twinkies and feeling sorry for yourself, decide if you want a man lying on his couch doing the same thing. You’d probably rather have a man who is out, doing something he loves, and feeling great."

At first, it seems perfectly fine to overlook certain things they lacked, or make excuses for lackluster behavior. Stop doing this! If you want a better man, stop making excuses for them. Note that this doesn’t mean you should reject any man who isn’t a billionaire with a supermodel face and an 8 pack. It means that you have every right to hold out for a man with a stable job, an active lifestyle, a generous spirit, and a sense of humor. It’s OK to be picky. There are millions of men in this world, and you can and will find someone who has everything you’re looking for, if they are realistic expectations."

By staying busy and following your own passions, you’ll naturally up your standards. You’ll only accept a man into your life that will add to it, not fill some sort of void. Don’t be so fiercely independent that you refuse to open yourself up to love. It’s important that you can be content and satisfied on your own, but be careful not to completely block yourself off from receiving love."
