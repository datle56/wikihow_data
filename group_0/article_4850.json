      "content": "Design the green. It should have a variety of slopes to challenge you, but ultimately slope away from the center. This will prevent puddles from forming after it rains. If you want to have a depression in your green, you must install a drain pipe beneath it to carry away the water. However, this won't work if you build a green in a climate where the puddle will freeze during winter."

      "title": "Put in an irrigation system if necessary.",
      "content": "Put in an irrigation system if necessary. Keep in mind that adequate, even irrigation is the key to keeping turf healthy. Watering your green with a garden hose is time-consuming and tends to irrigate unevenly. It's easiest to use your municipal water source if you do not live in an area that restricts water usage during droughts. If you choose a different water source (well, rainwater, gray water, etc.), you will have to more carefully monitor the effect of the water on your turf and irrigation system. Some water sources may clog sprinkler nozzles or introduce harmful chemicals. You can water your green with garden sprinklers or drip lines connected to timers, but you will spend a lot of time moving them on and off the green. An underground system with pop-up sprinklers can be fully automated. Install a residential sprinkler system rather than one designed for a golf course. Golf course irrigation systems operate at higher pressures in order to spread the water over a wider area. However, since you only have one green to irrigate, a residential system will work well and is less expensive."
