      "title": "Talk to your doctor about risk factors that affect folic acid absorption.",
      "content": "Talk to your doctor about risk factors that affect folic acid absorption. Some people are more prone to folic acid deficiency than others because of genetic causes, intestinal issues, chronic illness, and the use of certain medications. Talk to your physician if you have risk factors that may prevent you from absorbing enough folic acid. [2] X Research source Genetic mutations such as polymorphism (a genetic variance or flaw) can be a risk factor for folic acid deficiency. Known as a MTHFR mutation, your body may have trouble making an enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase which is critical for the body’s processing of folic acid. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Chronic illnesses that affect absorption in the gastrointestinal tract may also cause folic acid deficiencies. If you suffer from Crohn’s or celiac disease, or are on dialysis, discuss strategies with your doctor to ensure you are ingesting enough folic acid. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source A number of common medications may interfere with folic acid absorption, including anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, and antacids. If you are being treated for a particular condition, do not take folic acid supplements without first discussing it with your physician."

      "content": "Discuss the symptoms of anemia with your doctor so you’re aware of them. Anemia is a tell-tale sign of a folate deficiency, so knowing the symptoms can help you identify if you’re having trouble absorbing folic acid. Symptoms of anemia include weakness, lack of concentration, and lightheadedness. Other symptoms may include diarrhea, numbness of the hands and feet, muscle weakness, and depression."

      "content": "Combine vitamin B12 with folic acid to help with absorption. Both vitamin b12 and folic acid deficiencies can cause anemia. Taking folic acid supplements alone can mask anemia caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, and vice versa. To make sure you’re getting enough of both, take vitamin B12 and folic acid together. [5] X Research source Vitamin B12 and folic acid work synergistically to support heart and nerve health."

      "title": "Take the folic acid within 30 minutes of eating a meal.",
      "content": "Take the folic acid within 30 minutes of eating a meal. Taking a folic acid supplement just before you eat a meal will ensure that your body digests it along with your food. Make it a habit to take your supplement before you eat so you’re getting your daily recommended amount of folic acid. Stick to a schedule. Because daily intake is important for folic acid, take it at a convenient time when you will remember. If you have trouble, set an alarm on your phone or computer."

      "title": "Consume alcohol in moderation.",
      "content": "Consume alcohol in moderation. Alcohol can affect your body’s ability to absorb folic acid so avoid drinking more than 2-3 alcoholic drinks a day. Try to minimize your use of alcohol or stop drinking completely, especially if you’re pregnant or trying to get pregnant, to increase your folic acid absorption. [7] X Research source Alcohol can also cause you to excrete folic acid in your urine, lowering the level in your body. If you’re struggling to quit drinking , try getting help from a counselor or a program such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Alcoholics with folate deficiency are more at risk to develop liver injuries."

      "content": "Choose raw or steamed fruits and vegetables to get more vitamins. Folic acid is destroyed by air and heat and the amount present in the foods can decrease significantly if food is improperly stored, overcooked, or reheated. Steaming is an excellent method for cooking vegetables since it preserves vitamins, including folate, better than boiling [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "content": "Aim for 400 – 600 micrograms of folic acid a day. Anybody over the age of 13 needs at least 400 micrograms of folic acid a day, while pregnant people should try to get up to 600 micrograms daily. Avoid taking more than 1,000 micrograms of folic acid a day from supplements or fortified food unless you’re advised to do so by your doctor. [10] X Research source Controlled trials indicate that proper folic acid intake protects against strokes and heart disease. [11] X Research source Although most people don’t notice side effects from folic acid, some may experience nausea, gas, bloating, trouble sleeping and other symptoms."

      "content": "Eat a serving of foods rich in folate with each meal. The folic acid that occurs naturally in foods is called folate. The best sources include asparagus, broccoli, chickpeas, lentils, and other legumes. Other good sources include eggs, cauliflower, and papaya. Try adding a serving of a folate-rich food source to each of your meals to boost your folic acid intake naturally. [12] X Research source The FDA requires that enriched bread, cereals, flours, pastas, and other grain products have added folic acid. These are important contributors of folic acid intake to the American diet. [13] X Research source"

While a diet with folate-rich foods is important, some people cannot absorb the daily requirements for folic acid through food alone. Choose a vitamin or supplement that contains at least 400 micrograms of folic acid. The body is able to absorb approximately 100 percent of folic acid taken in supplement form. [14] X Trustworthy Source Oregon State University Linus Pauling Institute Research center dedicated to promoting optimal health through cutting-edge nutrition research and public outreach Go to source Because folic acid is water-soluble and is excreted in your urine, it requires daily supplementation. Your body cannot store folic acid. [15] X Research source Avoid eating too many heavily fortified foods while also taking a multivitamin. This can increase your risk for overdosing on folic acid.

      "content": "Take folic acid before you plan to become pregnant. Adequate folic acid intake prevents neural tube defects (NTDs), which affect the spinal cord and brain. The neural tube is the part of the embryo from which the brain and spinal cord develop. Because NTDs happen within the first month of pregnancy, it is important to ensure that you are getting enough folic acid every day, even before you even know you’re pregnant. [17] X Research source Folic acid intake can also prevent other birth defects involving the heart, upper lip, and palate. It can also reduce a mother's risk for preeclampsia, a serious blood pressure disease that can threaten the life of the mother and baby. Neural tube deficiencies adversely affect 3,000 pregnancies per year. The two most common neural tube defects are spina bifida, where the fetal spinal column does not close completely, and anencephaly, which results in incomplete development of the fetus’ head, skull, and scalp. [18] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Taking folic acid can help reduce a baby’s risk of NTDs by up to 70%.

If you have had a pregnancy affected by a NTD in the past, are obese, or have diabetes, you may need extra folic acid during pregnancy. If you’re trying to have a baby, talk about your folic acid needs with your doctor. They may run tests and recommend that you take a higher dose of folic acid. [21] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Those who are overweight appear to be more likely to have babies with neural tube defects. With no intervention, people who have previously had an NTD-affected pregnancy have a three to five percent chance of another NTD-complicated pregnancy. If you've previously been pregnant with a baby with a neural tube defect, you'll probably be advised to take 4,000 mcg of folic acid a day."
