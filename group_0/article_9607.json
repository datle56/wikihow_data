You can convert any binary string to hexadecimal (1, 01, 101101, etc.), but you need four numbers to make the conversion (0101→5; 1100→C, etc.). [1] X Research source For this lesson, start with the example 1010. 1010 If you don't have 4 digits, add zeros to the front to make it four digits. So, 01 would become 0001. [2] X Research source"

If you have a one in the first number, you have one eight. If you have a zero in the second column, you have no fours. The third column tells you how many twos, and the second how many ones.
