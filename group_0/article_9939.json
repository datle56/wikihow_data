Add 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of lemon juice and .5 cups (120 mL) of avocado oil or olive oil into a medium-sized bowl. [1] X Research source Try to soak the skewers you'll be using in cold tap water overnight. This stops them from drying out or burning in the oven. If you can't do it overnight, leave them in water for as long as possible. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Whisk the mixture until it’s combined. Measure 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of fresh flat-leaf parsley, 1 teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of pepper, and ½ teaspoon of garlic powder into the bowl. Use a fork or a whisk to briskly stir the ingredients together. Continue whisking until the ingredients have all merged together, this will take about 1 minute. [3] X Research source Use circular stirring motions to stop the mixture from splashing over the edges of the bowl. If you don’t have flat leaf parsley you can substitute it for a different variety of parsley. If you don’t enjoy the flavor of parsley, try using coriander, basil or rosemary instead."

      "content": "Use a clean, sharp knife to cut the chicken. Place the chicken onto a chopping board and cut the chicken crosswise into 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide strips. Turn the board 90 degrees and cut the breasts lengthways, leaving 1 inch (2.5 cm) gaps between the cuts. This process creates chicken cubes that are an easy size to push onto the skewers. [4] X Research source Always wash your hands after touching chicken to avoid food poisoning. Make sure that the chicken is fully defrosted before you start preparing it."

      "content": "Transfer the chicken cubes into a medium-sized ziplock bag with the marinade. Use one hand to hold the ziplock bag open and the other hand to gently pour the marinade into the bag. Close the ziplock bag and check that no marinade is leaking from the seal.Then, massage the marinade into the chicken with your hands. [5] X Research source If the seal on the bag isn’t working, pour the chicken and marinade into a new bag. Press down on the chicken cubes as you move them around. This will help the marinade to soak into the chicken."

      "content": "Place the ziplock bag of marinated chicken into the fridge. Leave it for 4-6 hours to achieve the optimum flavor. [6] X Research source If you are short on time, even 1 hour will help to soften and flavor the meat. Don’t leave the chicken to marinate for more than 24 hours as this increases the risk of food poisoning."

With the bell peppers, use a sharp knife to make lengthwise cuts that are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. Turn the chopping board 90 degrees and cut crossways, leaving 1 inch (2.5 cm) gaps between your cuts. With the onions, cut each onion in half and peel the skin off. Placing the flat side of the onion onto the chopping board, cut the onion in half lengthways and then crossways, to create quarters that are approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) in size. [8] X Research source Repeat this process for all 3 peppers. Use different colored peppers to add contrast and color to your kabobs. Peel apart the layers of the chopped onion so you have thin chunks of onion. Repeat this process for both onions."

Place a vegetable onto the skewer and push it down until it is touching the chicken. Keep repeating this process until you have filled the kabobs with chicken and vegetables. Leave about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) at the top of the stick. [9] X Research source Repeat this process until you have used all the vegetables and chicken."

Line the dish with the foil and place the kabobs on top. Spread the kabobs evenly across the dish. Transfer the tray into the middle shelf of the oven. Leave the tray uncovered as this will allow the vegetables to become crispy. Remove the tray from the oven after 15 minutes.

Make sure that none of the kabobs are touching each other before placing the tray back into the oven. Then, bake for another 10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. [11] X Research source Take a piece of chicken off a kabob and cut it in half. If the inside of the chicken is still pink, leave the kabobs to cook for a further 5-10 minutes."
