      "content": "Avoid a fight. When someone else is at a boiling point, getting equally angry is only going to make matters worse. Focus on keeping yourself calm, or else the situation might quickly spiral into an argument. This is not to say you should act completely unemotional, but try not to let your own feelings get too heated. A way to remain neutral is to let go of your own ego and not take things personally. [1] X Research source Knapp, H. (2007). Therapeutic Communcation: Developing Professional Skills. Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publications. It can be natural to respond to an angry person by defending yourself or your reputation, but it’s important to remember that someone who is very angry cannot be reasoned with until they have calmed down."

      "title": "Try not to get defensive.",
      "content": "Try not to get defensive. When someone’s so mad they can barely speak in a level tone, it’s easy to absorb that negativity and feel defensive. When you’re communicating with someone who is angry, realize that the anger is likely not about you. [2] X Research source Separate the person’s emotions from your own so you can be there for the person without feeling the anger is directed toward you."

      "title": "Stay in the present.",
      "content": "Stay in the present. People who are angry will often bring up situations or conversations from the past, particularly if they are trying to draw you into their anger. Try to counteract that by keeping them focused on the present situation and solving a solution to the current problem. Don’t let yourself get drawn in to feeling angry about past events. If the conversation seems to be drifting towards past events, try saying something like, “We can talk about that later. I think right now, we should focus on what is immediately upsetting you and finding a solution to that problem. Let’s take one thing at a time.”"

      "content": "Stay calm and quiet. [3] X Expert Source Chloe Carmichael, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 29 May 2019. If someone is yelling or venting, you can decide to let them vent to blow off steam, but the best thing for you to do is to remain quiet or to say nothing. If you do speak, keep a quiet level voice. If you remain quiet, try to keep a neutral facial expression and open body language. You remain in more control if you do not react to the “bait” of the person yelling. There is a difference between letting someone vent and being the victim of verbal abuse. If the person is berating you, calling you names, or directing unrelated anger towards you, you may want to make a statement such as, “I understand that you are frustrated and I would like to be here for you. But please do not take your anger out on me.” If someone is disrespecting you, address how you feel right away. If you push down your feelings, they'll eventually bubble up in an angry outburst.

      "title": "Apologize if you were in the wrong.",
      "content": "Apologize if you were in the wrong. If you did something to anger the person, maybe what they need is a heartfelt apology. Apologizing is not a sign of weakness. It shows that you care about the feelings of the other person. Reflect on the situation to see if you did something wrong, and if you did, say you’re sorry. Sometimes that’s all a person needs to hear to feel better about what happened. If you don’t feel you were in the wrong, however, then don’t apologize just to calm the person down. An effective apology may be, “I’m very sorry that I spent the money you were saving for retirement on a time share in Hawaii. I don’t know what I was thinking, and I can understand why you are angry. Let’s work together to find a solution.”"

      "title": "Don’t say “calm down.”",
      "content": "Don’t say “calm down.” Someone who is really angry is being ruled by their emotions and is not accessing the rational part of their brain. Trying to use reason or making suggestions to “remain calm” or “be reasonable” are likely to fuel the fire and make the person feel invalidated . [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use good listening techniques",
      "content": "Use good listening techniques . When people are feeling emotional they want to know someone else understands. Really listen to the person talk. Look him or her in the eye, nod when appropriate, and ask questions to find out more. The act of conversing and feeling heard could help the person calm down. Of course, sometimes angry people don’t want to be asked questions, and they might feel so angry they don’t believe anyone can really understand. All you can do is try your best; if the person isn't in the mood for a heart-to-heart, don’t force it."

      "title": "Validate the person’s feelings",
      "content": "Validate the person’s feelings . Everyone gets angry from time to time. Sometimes anger actually masks another emotion, like feeling hurt, embarrassed, or sad. Whatever the reason for the person’s anger, listen to them and respond by validating his feelings (without necessarily agreeing with them). You should also withhold judgment of the person, as judging will likely come through in your words or body language as a lack of support. An example of validating someone’s emotions is making statements like “that must be difficult” or “I understand how you could be frustrated.” Statements that are not as helpful include “you should let it go” or “I experienced the same thing and got over it.”"

[6] X Research source Empathy can take the form of understanding another’s perspective, feeling distress at the plight of another person, and being able to relate to the emotions of another. [7] X Research source Showing empathy towards someone who is angry may take the form of showing that you have been listening to him and know what he is saying. [8] X Research source Knapp, H. (2007). Therapeutic Communcation: Developing Professional Skills. Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publications. To empathize with someone who is angry, try paraphrasing the source of their anger back to them. You might say, “So, you are saying that you feel angry because you think you have to take on all of the household responsibilities alone.” You may be inclined to say, “I understand how you feel,” but know that this can sometimes make someone more angry. They may believe that no one really knows how they feel."

If the idea of talking it out just seems to make the person madder, give them some space and time instead. [10] X Research source Most people take at least 20 minutes to calm down from anger, but some may need even longer. [11] X Research source If you think someone needs some time alone, try saying, “I understand that you are angry, but I don’t feel like I am helping you feel any better, and I think you may need a few minutes to yourself. I’ll be right here for you if or when you feel ready to talk.”"

Theory and practice of counseling and psyhcotherapy (9th ed.). Belmont, CA: Thomson Brooks/Cole. In some cases, an angry person can’t be reasoned with in this way.
