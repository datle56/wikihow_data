      "content": "Identify the ring's metal. You may know that the ring is yellow gold, white gold, silver, or brass. However, you may not know the type of metal if you haven't bought the ring yourself. Take the ring to a jeweler, and they should be able to tell you how to clean the specific metals and gems that make up your ring. Silver rings : Silver typically tarnishes over time, developing a black coating. Regular polishing of your silver ring can prevent this. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or brushes, as they can scratch the silver surface. Gold rings : Usually there are white, yellow, and rose gold types of rings. Gold rings have stamps on them of 10k,14k, or 18k karat value. Gold is a delicate metal that picks up scratches easily, so avoid using abrasive cleaners. Platinum rings : Platinum is a heavy metal, and it is a popular choice for high-quality jewelry. However, as a heavy metal, it scratches easily. Use a soft cloth to clean these rings, and avoid harsh cleaners. Diamond rings : Avoid soaking certain diamonds in water or cleaners, as this can damage or weaken them and the metal they're set in. Clean them gently with a soft cloth. Diamonds often hold great material and sentimental value — handling them with care will help maintain their sparkle and ensure they continue to shine brightly."

Focus on areas where dirt and oils tend to build up, such as around the stone setting and inside the band. The swabs are pre-soaked in isopropyl alcohol, making them convenient for drying and polishing after cleaning. If your ring has minute, detailed designs or a stone setting, gently use the swab to reach into all the tiny corners. The alcohol will evaporate quickly, ensuring those areas dry thoroughly without leaving any residue behind."
