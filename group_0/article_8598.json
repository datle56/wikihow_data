      "content": "Dip a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol. The best way to disinfect beauty tools with a metal surface is with 70% isopropyl alcohol, which you can find at any drug store, dollar store, or supermarket. Saturate a cotton ball with the rubbing alcohol, then gently squeeze it to remove any excess. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a cotton ball, use a cotton pad, paper towel, or washcloth instead. Avoid using tissue, as it’s less sturdy and may fall apart while you’re cleaning."

      "content": "Wipe the curler all over with the cotton ball. Use the cotton ball to cover every surface of the eyelash curler, including all of the metal, the handles, and the rubber pad on the inside. As you’re cleaning the curler, keep rotating the cotton ball so you’re always using a clean surface. If you need to, switch to a second cotton ball. [2] X Research source Press the cotton ball down into the hinges and joints in the curler to make sure you don’t miss any spots where bacteria could be hiding."

      "title": "Rinse the alcohol away with cool running water.",
      "content": "Rinse the alcohol away with cool running water. Although the alcohol will dry on its own, leaving no residue, it can dry out the rubber strip on the eyelash curler. To avoid this, rinse the top of the curler thoroughly under running water after you wipe it down with the alcohol, especially around the pad. Avoid getting water in the metal joints on the curler, as this could cause them to rust. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Dry the eyelash curler with a soft, clean towel.",
      "content": "Dry the eyelash curler with a soft, clean towel. Once you've rinsed the alcohol off of the curler, gently pat it with a towel until it's completely dry. Turn the curler in different directions as you dry it, and try to shake out any water that might have gotten into the joints. [4] X Research source Allowing a metal eyelash curler to air-dry could cause it to rust. Try using a face towel, a washcloth, or paper towels to dry the curler."

      "title": "Remove stubborn gunk with a blowdryer and a soft cloth.",
      "content": "Remove stubborn gunk with a blowdryer and a soft cloth. If there’s makeup residue or another sticky substance on your eyelash curler, alcohol alone may not be enough to remove it. In that case, hold the curler by the handles and heat it for about 30 seconds with your blowdryer. Then, when the gunk starts to soften, wipe it away with a soft cloth or even another cotton ball soaked in alcohol. [5] X Research source This buildup can promote the growth of bacteria, so it’s important to remove it."

      "title": "Use the pointed end of an orangewood stick to get into crevices.",
      "content": "Use the pointed end of an orangewood stick to get into crevices. If there is any gunk stuck inside of tight crevices of the eyelash curler, take an orangewood cuticle stick and wrap a wisp of cotton from a cotton swab around the pointed end. Then, dip the cotton in a small amount of oil, such as olive or coconut oil. Insert the pointed end of the cuticle stick into the gunky areas of the eyelash curler and work it around to clean them out. Repeat as needed with a new cuticle stick to clean other gunky spots."

      "title": "Don't curl your lashes after you put on mascara.",
      "content": "Don't curl your lashes after you put on mascara. If you put on mascara before you curl your lashes, you’ll coat the curler in mascara residue. Not only will this make the eyelash curler harder to clean, but it’s also bad for your lashes. For best results, put on your eyeshadow and eyeliner first, if you wear them, then curl your lashes, then apply mascara. [6] X Research source Mascara can make your eyelashes brittle, so they’re more prone to breaking if you curl them with mascara on. If you wear liquid eyeliner, let it dry completely before you curl your lashes."

      "content": "Wipe down the curler with alcohol after each use. Even if you curl your lashes before you apply your mascara, some makeup residue might get on your eyelash curler, along with oils from your skin. To keep your curler clean, wipe it down thoroughly with a makeup remover pad or a cotton ball or tissue dipped in rubbing alcohol. Make sure to wipe down all of the metal, the rubber pad, and the handles. Don't clean the lash curler by spraying it with alcohol, as you may not fully sanitize the tool.

      "content": "Replace the rubber pad every 3-6 months. Even with regular cleaning, the rubber pad on your eyelash curler can be a hiding place for bacteria. To avoid an unpleasant eye infection, replace this strip at least every 6 months, although every 3 months is ideal. [8] X Research source You can purchase replacement strips from a beauty supply store that carries your brand of eyelash curler, or from the manufacturer’s website. Even if it has been less than 3 months and the pad looks cracked, replace it. Replacing the pad will help to reduce your risk of infection and prevent broken lashes."
