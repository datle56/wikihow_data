      "content": "Sort the beans. Slowly pour the beans into a large bowl. As you pour, examine each bean carefully. Sometimes bags of dried beans can have small rocks and other inedible debris mixed in. [1] X Research source Remove any suspicious looking beans as well. Old, wrinkled beans won’t soften well and may hurt your teeth."

      "title": "Bring some water to a boil.",
      "content": "Bring some water to a boil. Place a large cooking pot on the stove over high heat. Add about three cups (.7 liters) of fresh water to the pot and let it come to a boil. Always cook with cold tap water. Hot tap water can dissolve contaminants in pipe systems that will be carried into your food. [2] X Research source Add the salt. Yes, really. Despite myths to the contrary, salting only temporarily toughens the beans' skin. The salt actually speeds the cooking of the beans overall, and seasons more evenly if added initially."

    {
      "title": "Add the dried beans.",
      "content": "Add the dried beans. Add one cup (200 grams) of dried mung beans to the boiling water. Give the beans a good stir to help saturate them completely. Don’t worry if a few beans float on the top. As soon as these beans soak up enough water, they will sink to the bottom. If want to cook more than one cup of beans, use more water. For every cup of beans, you should boil three cups of water. One cup of dried mung beans will yield three cups of cooked beans, or approximately three servings."

      "content": "Simmer the beans for 45 minutes to 1 hour. After adding the beans, allow the water to return to a boil. Next, lower the heat to medium low. Let the soup simmer for 45 minutes to an hour or until the beans are soft. [3] X Research source To check if the beans are ready, remove a small spoonful and allow it to cool before tasting it. A simmering pot will release a few small streams of bubbles. If the surface of the liquid is bubbling too much, reduce the heat."
