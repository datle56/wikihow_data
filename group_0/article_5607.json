If possible, avoid calling out on days when important things are happening, like meetings or progress reports, which can be pretty suspicious, not to mention inconvenient for your coworkers. Instead, call in sick on a random, uneventful day in the middle of the week. Ultimately, though, DeOrnellas says to take a mental health day on whatever day you need; your mental health comes first. [1] X Expert Source Brandy DeOrnellas, PCC, ESQ. Career & Life Transition Coach Expert Interview. 15 December 2021. Don’t fake sick right after you’ve had an altercation at work, or after you’ve done a lot of grumbling. You don’t want your boss to see your fake illness as an insult. Faking sick after a coworker was just sick, or during flu season, can be especially convincing. Also, calling off on a Friday or Monday might make them think you just want a long weekend."

If you think your boss will be receptive and you're comfortable doing so, be upfront about your need for a mental health day. Usually, honesty is the best policy. If you want to take off multiple days, pick an appropriate illness. Faking a migraine or a bad case of gastroenteritis can get you off for 2 or more days, as they can last for a long time.

[4] X Research source First thing in the morning is often most convincing, since it’ll look like the illness was unexpected. Avoid calling in the middle of the night or super early in the morning, since that might just irritate your boss. If you call early, you may also be more likely to get your boss’s voicemail or to catch your boss when they're off guard and therefore more likely to let you off with no questions asked."

Different work cultures and policies allow for more casual forms of communication, so use whatever form of communication your job prefers. While most employees call off over the phone, some companies are receptive to or even encourage text or email. Call off via text or email if you don't want to speak to your boss directly, and call them on the phone if you want to chat with them about your sick day, what you'll be missing, and when they might expect you back. Email and text are convenient mediums for calling off since no acting is involved. You can also email or text in the middle of the night, when your boss will likely be asleep. Talking on the phone gives you an opportunity to answer any questions your boss might have and perhaps even show off your acting skills. If you call your boss after just waking up, your voice might be a bit husky, which will help you sound sicker."

Whether you're calling off over the phone, email, or text, don't get too detailed––just say that you're not feeling well and won't be coming in. If you're talking to your boss on the phone, be sure to act a little sick : sniffle or cough, and talk a little more slowly or softly to show that you don’t have your full strength. Open with a friendly greeting, but don't beat around the bush: try \"Good morning, Li, I've got some bad news...\" or \"Hi Iman, I'm sorry to do this, but I've got to call off today....\" Give just enough information for your boss to believe you, such as saying \"I was up all night\" or \"I'm having awful stomach problems.\" Without being too obvious, express how much you really hoped you would come to work: \"I should have said something at the end of the day yesterday, but I was hoping I would sleep this thing off.”"

Offer to work from home, or at least be on call if your boss or coworkers have questions for you about work you’re missing or anything else, which can make it a little less suspicious. When you reach out to your boss to let them know about your “condition,” clearly communicate your availability. \"I just can't make it in today. But if it's alright with you, I'd like to keep working remotely.\" \"I don't know if I have it in me to work a full day.

The best policy is to preemptively say that you think you're contagious, and that you've tried every remedy you can to no avail. Consider mentioning you've called your doctor's office and are waiting to hear back on an appointment time. During peak cold and flu seasons, it may be several days before they can squeeze you in for an office visit. If your employer demands a note after you get back, you can always say your appointment isn't until later in the week.
