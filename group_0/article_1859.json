      "title": "Own your reasons for wanting a bra.",
      "content": "Own your reasons for wanting a bra. Write down two to three valid reasons for wanting a bra. And try to make your reasons personal. If you do this, your mom will be more likely to sympathize and agree with you. Also, by identifying your reasons, you will have more confidence in communicating your needs to your mom. Just remember that your mom was a girl who needed a bra once, too. [1] X Research source For example, perhaps you play sports and you realize that a bra will provide you with the support you need. If you are developing and it's becoming noticeable, say \"I need support and coverage so that I don't show more than I want. People keep staring at me and I think it's because they can see I'm not wearing a bra.\" Try to avoid using the \"everyone else is doing it\" reason; parents don't usually see this as a valid reason."

      "title": "State your feelings.",
      "content": "State your feelings. It is natural to feel nervous or embarrassed about discussing sensitive topics, like wearing a bra, with your mom. Perhaps you are afraid your mom will misunderstand you, reject your request, or punish you for asking. But don’t let these feelings prevent you from talking with your mom. Instead, translate your feelings into words when you approach your mom about the topic. [2] X Research source For example, “I feel a little embarrassed talking about this, but I need to ask you something mom,” or \"Mom, can I ask you something personal? I wanted to know at what age you started wearing a bra because I think it is time for me to get one. I hope you understand.\""

    {
      "title": "Practice what you will say.",
      "content": "Practice what you will say. Write down three or four different ways of asking your mom for a bra. Say them out loud and see which one feels the most natural. Once you have nailed down what you would like to say, rehearse it out loud or in front of the mirror until the words come out naturally. [3] X Research source For example, you could say, “Mom, I need to ask you something. It is not anything bad, but it is a little embarrassing. I don’t know if you have noticed, but my body has been going through some changes lately. I think it is time for me to wear a bra. I think a bra would help me feel more comfortable and secure about my body.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Arrange a time to talk.",
      "content": "Arrange a time to talk. Try to avoid bringing up the topic when your mom is busy. If she is busy, she is less likely to listen to and hear what you have to say. Instead, give her a heads up by arranging a time to talk. This way your mom knows that you need to talk to her about something important, and she can give you her full attention. [4] X Research source You can say, for example, “Hey mom, I need to talk to you about something important. When would be a good time talk?” People are usually more open after eating a meal, so bringing up the topic after dinner may work as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask while you are out shopping.",
      "content": "Ask while you are out shopping. If you are uncomfortable asking your mom directly, then you can try suggesting the idea of wearing a bra. Arrange a time to go shopping with your mom. When you are approaching the bra department or store in the mall, ask if you two can go in together to check it out. Once you are in the store, ask your mom, “Do you think it is time for me to wear a bra? I kind of feel like it is time.” [5] X Research source As you approach the store you could also say, “Mom can we take a look in the bra section? I kind of think it is time for me to start wearing a bra.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Write a note or send a text.",
      "content": "Write a note or send a text. If you are afraid that your mom will be harsh or overly critical, or you just cannot get over your embarrassment, then try this strategy. Write a note detailing why you think you need a bra. Give her the note when she is not busy. Tell her to read the note, think about it and come talk to you afterwards. [6] X Research source Alternatively, you could write the note and then read it to her out loud while you are alone together; for example, while you are both alone in the car or on a walk."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remain calm.",
      "content": "Remain calm. If your mom doesn’t agree with you or tells you no, try not to argue, yell or whine. Instead, remain calm and keep your tone of voice friendly and understanding. Then ask your mom why now is not the right time. [7] X Research source For example, “When do you think the right time is?” or “When did you get your first bra?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Suggest an alternative.",
      "content": "Suggest an alternative. Do this if you are uncomfortable not wearing a bra, but your mom still says no. Suggest getting a training bra, sports bra or a camisole with a built-in bra to wear in the meantime. After wearing these for a few months, bring up the topic again. For example, “I have been wearing my training bra for six months. I think I am ready to wear a bra now."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to another trusted adult.",
      "content": "Talk to another trusted adult. Do this if your mom simply will not listen or does not understand that a bra will help you feel more comfortable about your body. Talk about the issue with a trusted relative, counselor, or teacher. They may be able to offer you some advice on how to approach the topic with your mom. [8] X Research source You could also ask them to discuss the topic with your mom for you."
