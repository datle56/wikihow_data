Find the difference between the beginning and ending time to find the total time it took to travel. In these instances, you will likely need to convert minutes traveled into seconds traveled by multiplying the number of minutes traveled by 60. [3] X Research source For example, you might know that Henry began driving at 6:00p.m. He drove 48,000 meters, and arrived at his destination at 6:30 p.m. The difference between 6:00p.m. and 6:30p.m. is 30 minutes. To find the number of seconds, calculate 30 × 60 = 1 , 800 {\\displaystyle 30\\times 60=1,800} . So, Henry traveled for 1,800 seconds.
