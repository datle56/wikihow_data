For example, suggest a time to meet for casual drinks or ask him to drop by your place. [1] X Research source Don’t be afraid to be a little flirty – maybe use a few flirty emojis to keep things light. Make sure to leave plans open-ended, which suggests you’re willing to see where the night takes you. If he says yes right away, he’s probably interested. For example, text, “I’m feeling kind of bored tonight... maybe you can help me fix that. 😏🔥” Another example is, “Don’t know about you, but I predict I’ll be parched after work Thursday. Drinks? 🍹😉”"

Basically, they'll have conversations, but they will always keep it on a friendly basis.” [3] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2020. Step out of the friendship zone, but you don’t have to say, “Come over to my place for sex.” If you want to entice a man into your home for intercourse without being so blunt, suggest something lightly physical or sexy. For instance, say something like, “We’ll watch Netflix on the couch, eat ice cream, and cuddle. 📺🍦🤗” This may not describe intercourse, but it implies that cuddling on the couch will lead somewhere more intimate. Or try something along the lines of, “It’s so cold tonight. Why don’t you come over and help me stay warm? 🥶🔥”"

[6] X Research source Just go for it and say, “Wanna hook up? 😘🔥” Or try, “I want to kiss you right now. Come over. 💋” Just saying, “Let’s have sex,” is pretty direct and can’t be confused as you implying anything else."

Being complimented on your looks is nice, but if someone only gives you appearance-based compliments, it might feel like that’s all they see. So, change things up with compliments on their personality, talents, or character. For example, say, “You have such a great sense of humor—every time we talk, you make me laugh. It’s pretty hot.😂🔥” Praise him for dinner and entertainment the previous night, “Had fun last night. Thanks again for feeding and entertaining me. 😉🍽️💖”"
