      "title": "Wipe between your dog’s folds with an anti-fungal wipe.",
      "content": "Wipe between your dog’s folds with an anti-fungal wipe. Because English bulldogs’ skin is layered in folds, it is susceptible to diseases like yeast intertrigo, a condition which leads to itchy rashes on the skin. Wiping between your dog’s folds one time each day will prevent this. Choose the right wipe for your dog’s skin. Use a nontoxic anti-fungal wipe. Try to choose one with many natural ingredients like cucumber and chamomile. Avoid wipes that have many chemicals and additives. If you have concerns, ask your vet for a recommendation as to which anti-fungal wipe is best for your dog."

      "content": "Begin cleaning your dog’s skin folds early. If you wait until your dog has already developed a rash within its skin folds, it will cause your dog pain when the skin is finally cleaned. Start daily cleaning with your dog from the time it is a small puppy. Familiarize your dog with the cleanup process by having it sit in the same spot every time you begin the cleanup."

      "title": "Make the cleaning process enjoyable for your dog.",
      "content": "Make the cleaning process enjoyable for your dog. If your dog comes to associate cleaning within its skin folds with pain, your job will be that much harder, and cause your dog undue stress. Give your doggie a treat both before you begin the cleaning process and after the process is complete. This way, the dog will come to associate having its skin cleaned with positive feelings and the knowledge that it will soon be rewarded. With one hand, part the folds and use your other hand to apply the wipe gently to the skin within. You will probably need to wipe the same area several times, moving the wipe in overlapping swipes along folds of your dog’s body. You may need several wipes to complete the job, but your dog will thank you and remain healthy. Be sure to wipe its back, tummy, legs, and face. Healthy bulldog skin is smooth and soft. Check your dog’s face for irritation. [1] X Research source Facial skin should be loose and wrinkly, but should not hang off the face. Check the belly for redness or signs of itching. If present, these may be signs of springtime allergies."

      "content": "Keep an eye out for signs of irritation. [2] X Research source If your doggie is having skin troubles, it will let you know. If you see your dog constantly scratching, rubbing, or biting itself, this is a sign that your dog’s skin is irritated. Nasty odors -- especially those emanating from the face, groin, ears, and stomach -- might also be signs of irritated skin. You might also observe a brown discharge coming out from between the folds of your dog’s skin. When you observe that your dog’s skin may be irritated, investigate why and take proactive steps to solve the problem."

[4] X Research source Of course, if your dog starts to smell or has a romp in the mud, bathing is the only option. Generally, though, avoid bathing your dog often. Use tear-free shampoo and work it into your dog’s skin folds when bathing. Lather the shampoo and let it sit for a minute or two before rinsing."

      "title": "Feed your puppy frequently.",
      "content": "Feed your puppy frequently. Young bulldogs need several small meals throughout the day. Your puppy may need to eat up to four times a day as a puppy. Your dog will increase its weight rapidly -- possibly by as much as seven to eight times its birth weight -- within its first twelve months of life. Puppies generally need about 20-70 calories per pound of body weight. For instance, if your pup weighs ten pounds, it will need between 200 and 700 calories each day, depending on its activity level. Don’t just leave food out for your puppy. Even though it needs to eat more frequently than an adult bulldog, it is still susceptible to overeating. Removing bowls of food after your puppy has finished will keep it healthy."

After obtaining your bulldog (of any age), wait at least two weeks before changing its diet. After two weeks, gradually introduce new foods into its diet and alternate new foods with its standard diet. Monitor your dog’s reaction. If it has soft or excessive stool, switch back to the old diet, then try again later to introduce a different new food after two more weeks.

      "content": "Feed your adult bulldog more as it matures. The caloric needs of your bulldog will depend on its age and activity level. After about 18 months, your bulldog should be treated nutritionally as an adult. Older dogs usually need about 937 calories per day. Typical adult bulldogs need around 1,145 calories each day. A very active English bulldog could need as much as 1,300 calories in a day. [7] X Research source While puppies require four meals each day, an adult will usually eat just twice each day. Use the nutrition label on your dog food to calculate how many calories your doggie is taking in. Adult bulldogs can weigh anywhere from 45 to 55 pounds, however, each dog's ideal weight varies depending on frame size. Learn to body score your dog so you can monitor the fat cover over the dog's rib and backbone, and decrease their ration if necessary. Talk to your vet about how much your pet should weigh."

[11] X Research source For instance, your bulldog might enjoy apple cinnamon drops. To make apple cinnamon drops, you’ll need a large apple, a quarter cup of honey, a half cup of water, a half teaspoon of cinnamon, one cup of oatmeal, one and a half cups of flour, plus another eighth of a cup of flour. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and mince the apple into small pieces. Combine the apple bits, water, oatmeal, and cinnamon into a dough by mixing together in a large mixing bowl. Place individual spoonfuls of the dough on an ungreased baking sheet spaced about two inches apart. Place the eighth of a cup of flour in a small bowl. Rub the bottom of a flat-bottomed cup in the flour and stamp the spoonfuls of dough down on the baking sheet. Bake for fifteen minutes, then remove and flip each apple cinnamon drop over.

To treat cherry eye, take your dog to the vet. They will recommend the best course of treatment for your dog, whether that's a surgical procedure, as is usually recommended, or simply showing you how to keep the gland lubricated.
