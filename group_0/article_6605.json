      "content": "Turn the thermometer off. For digital thermometers with one button, the power button often doubles as the control for changing from °C to °F. To start, make sure the thermometer is off. [1] X Research source Thermometers like this include the basic digital thermometers by Vicks, Walgreens, Omron, and more."

      "content": "Press and hold the power button. As you turn the thermometer back on, don’t lift your finger off of the button. This will let the thermometer know you are trying to change modes and not just turn it on. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Release the button after you see the temperature mode change.",
      "content": "Release the button after you see the temperature mode change. Check for an °F in the corner of the screen. Your thermometer may also beep after you’ve changed modes. [3] X Research source Rather than a blinking °F, your thermometer may display the phrase “F-SET” to show you’ve changed modes. If your thermometer flashes a °C or reads out “C-SET,” you’ve switched into Celsius. Repeat the process and it will switch back."

      "title": "Find the settings button.",
      "content": "Find the settings button. This button may be labeled with, for example, “MODE,” “SET,” or “MEM.” It may also be marked by a symbol, like a person or a speaker. Press and hold to change from °C to °F. [4] X Research source HoMedics, Equate, and other electronic thermometer manufacturers include labeled settings buttons on their products."

      "title": "Press the arrow or ‘+’ and ‘-’ buttons to switch to °F.",
      "content": "Press the arrow or ‘+’ and ‘-’ buttons to switch to °F. On some thermometers, pushing the settings button lets the user change multiple settings, not just °C and °F. In this case, press the button several times to open the temperature settings, then use the arrows or the ‘+’ and ‘-’ buttons to switch to °F. [5] X Research source You’ll know you’re in the temperature settings when the °C on the screen begins to flash or changes to an °F."

    {
      "title": "Push the “°C/°F” button.",
      "content": "Push the “°C/°F” button. Frontal scanning thermometers sometimes have a button specifically labeled “°C/°F.” Look on the front or the side of your thermometer to see if you have one. If so, use this button to freely change between Celsius and Fahrenheit. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Press the settings button.",
      "content": "Press the settings button. Most of the time this button will be labeled “MODE” or “SET.” Push it to change the temperature settings. Pushing the button once may be enough to change from °C to °F. However, you may need to press several times to open the temperature settings and change from there. [7] X Research source To know whether you’re in the temperature unit settings, check the screen. The current unit will be flashing. Change it by pushing the arrow keys. For some infrared thermometers produced by Klein Tools, Beurer, and other manufacturers, the settings button won't change the temperature unit. Instead, that button is used to set warning alarms, degree variation, and other modes. The temperature unit controls are in the battery compartment."

      "title": "If the setting button doesn’t work, open the battery compartment.",
      "content": "If the setting button doesn’t work, open the battery compartment. Look for the groove on the side of the thermometer handle. Slide your thumb into the groove and push forward to pop open the compartment. Infrared thermometers often have their temperature unit controls here. [8] X Research source If the battery compartment cover is too tight, slide the tip of a flathead screwdriver in the space between the cover in the handle. Then, wiggle the screwdriver enough to pop the compartment open. Don’t push too hard so that that screwdriver doesn’t break the plastic or come in contact with the batteries."
