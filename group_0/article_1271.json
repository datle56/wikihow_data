      "content": "Baka (ばか) Baka is a super common word in anime. But you may not want to use it in real life. It directly translates to stupid/idiot/fool, which can be extremely rude to call someone in real life, whether you know them or not.

      "content": "Dasai (ダサい) . Dasai means something is uncool or unfashionable. It’s useful for trash-talking, describing someone’s poor taste, or talking about something that was uncool, but it’s also pretty rude to use in the presence of that person.

      "content": "Kuso (くそ) You shouldn’t use this one for a variety of reasons. Not only does kuso translate to poop, it is also used to express frustration at an unpleasant situation, similar to how “dang it” or “damn it” are used in English. You may hear characters like Naruto Uzumaki or Ichigo Kurosaki use it regularly, but they also aren’t viewed as the most polite people in their universes. So, if you want to seem kind, polite, and not aggressive, don’t use kuso. [5] X Research source Avoid using chikushō (damn it) for the same reasons."

It translates to “shut up” and is extremely straightforward. If your mother or father is reprimanding you for something you did, or a police officer is giving you a warning, the last thing you want to do is say damare .

Even if you have a meal that isn’t the best or deal with less-than-quality service, using gomi to describe it may come off as extremely rude and impolite, so avoid using this one. If you’re having a private conversation with someone you’re close to, feel free to use gomi if you need to explain to them that something was bad, just be careful not to say they’re gomi ."

      "content": "Jotaro Kujo’s “Yare yare daze” Jotaro from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure is the laid-back protagonist, and he’s often surrounded by extroverted characters who push his buttons.

      "title": "Sasuke Uchiha’s “Usuratonkachi”",
      "content": "Sasuke Uchiha’s “Usuratonkachi” Despite how tumultuous their relationship can be sometimes, Sasuke Uchiha has a soft spot for Naruto Uzumaki in the popular anime, Naruto . This soft spot shows up when he calls Naruto usuratonkachi (ウスラトンカチ), which roughly translates to thin/light hammer. Although the term is derogatory, as it’s a way to say someone’s useless, it’s Sasuke’s way of being endearing to Naruto. Sasuke is cold and doesn’t typically show affection, so usuratonkachi is as endearing as he gets with Naruto. The only people Sasuke genuinely shows affection to are Sakura Haruno and Sarada Uchiha, his wife and daughter, respectively."
