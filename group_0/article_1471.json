      "title": "Style your mustache with wax",
      "content": "Style your mustache with wax . You can use standard hair wax, but you may also use a dedicated mustache wax product. These are often harder and less goopy than standard wax products. Rub the wax between your fingers until it is warm, smooth, and clump-free. For a more natural look, work a moderate amount of wax into your mustache and do not twist the ends. Try using a mustache comb to work it in. Blow-dry the wax on a high-heat, low speed to blend it in. For a more ostentatious look—say, a handlebar mustache—apply more product and twist the tips of your mustache into points. If you have a particularly long or bushy mustache, consider grabbing the hairs at the base of your mustache as you twist so that you don't rip any out. When the mustache is thoroughly waxed, work the tips into curls until they hold."

      "title": "Purchase hair wax.",
      "content": "Purchase hair wax. Read reviews of a wax product before you buy it. Some waxes are better for short hair; some are explicitly water-soluble; some are designed to be used on mustaches. Many commercial waxes are petroleum-based, although you can use natural products like beeswax, carnauba wax, and vegetable wax. Decide what you need from your hair wax and find an appropriate product. Many hair wax products leave behind a sticky, hard-to-remove residue. Many low-residue products, however, do not hold your hair in place as well as the stickier products. Look for a wax with a good balance of hair-molding capability and low-residue depositing. You can find hair wax in pharmacies, salons, and anywhere that sells hair-care products. You can usually order these products online. Make sure to compare prices and read the reviews before you make your purchase. Consider using a \"natural\" wax. Carnauba wax is extracted from the leaves of the carnauba palm tree, and beeswax taken from the hives of honey bees. Japan wax—also known as vegetable wax—is extracted from the berries of a type of sumac bush. In contrast, waxes derived from petroleum are called \"mineral waxes\" or \"cerosin waxes\", and they tend to be colorless and odorless."

      "content": "Apply hair wax to dry or slightly-damp hair. Wet your hair and towel it dry. As you dry your hair, try to shape it into an approximation of the hairstyle that you want. This will give you a base style that you can emphasize with the wax. When your hair is dry, you are ready to apply the wax. [2] X Research source Depending on the texture and length of your hair, putting wax on wet hair can cause the outline, form, and flow of the hair to change when it dries. If you apply wax when your roots are wet, you may lose hair volume. Hair wax is drier than many other hair-styling products, and it may hold better when you apply it to slightly damp hair. If you do dampen your hair, it should be almost completely dry when you spread the wax."

      "content": "Scoop out a bit of wax with your index, middle, and ring finger. You don't need much: a pea-sized amount of wax—about as large as the nail on your little finger—is usually enough for medium-length hair. If you apply too much wax at once, the wax will spread unevenly, making it hard for the wax to bond well with all of your hair. If you find that you need more wax, you can always scoop more. You can apply wax with one hand, or two. You may find it useful to keep one hand clean and wax-free, but you be able to cover more hair more quickly if you deploy wax with both hands. The wax may stick to your fingers more easily if you wet them beforehand. You should, however, avoid dripping too much water into the wax tin."

Do not wash the wax out of your hair; simply moisturize the wax to the point that you can re-shape it. If the problem recurs, consider carrying a small tin of wax with you for quick retouching sessions. You can fit portable wax tins into your purse, bag, or pocket, and you can restyle your hair anywhere with a mirror and a sink."
