      "content": "Make sure you have leverage. Getting a pay raise in most industries is hard to achieve unless you have some leverage. Leverage can consist of such things as getting another job offer performing above and beyond your job description consistently, effectively, and regularly. [1] X Research source If you are a \"star employee,\" a good company will often be able to find a bit extra to keep you satisfied. [2] X Expert Source Meredith Walters, MBA Certified Career Coach Expert Interview. 22 November 2019. Be aware that it is a fairly standard tactic to tell you that the business is already over its annual budget, to try to deter you from asking. [3] X Research source This means that you need to know your worth as assessed against objective criteria (see below) and be persistent. If you've already negotiated a pay deal with your boss, it may be harder to ask for more. Your boss assumes you're happy with the amount you're getting and isn't not likely to be favorably disposed to adding more financial burden to the company without good reason. Be careful about using another job offer as leverage. Your boss may call you on it; it's important to really have such a job offer and be willing to take it if you're rebuffed by your boss. Be ready to walk that plank!"

If your company is already \"over budget\" and suffering as a result of the recession, cut-backs, or any other reasons, you might be better off waiting until later. During a recessionary period, some companies will not be able to provide pay raises without also endangering your job. However, this doesn't mean that you should use this as an excuse to delay asking for a raise indefinitely."

It's easy to believe you're worth more, especially if you feel as if you're giving 110 percent every day, but you need to demonstrate this objectively by assessing your worth against that of others in the same industry.

Many employers say they don't give a raise until the employee does 20% more work than he did when he was initially hired.

While this may be something you took into account when you first negotiated your salary, your role and responsibilities probably have changed. Look at similar levels in the industry to see what others are being paid for similar work. Determine the usual salary range for those who do what you do in your region or area. Getting market data for comparable positions can empower you by helping you be and feel more knowledgeable when you talk with your boss. You can check out comparable positions at Salary.com, GenderGapApp, or Getraised.com. [5] X Research source While these things will be helpful when you build your case, they should not be used as the principal argument for getting a pay raise; they simply inform you about your potential worth, not your boss.

You should also keep your eyes on the horizon and regularly envision the path ahead for your company and for the industry. Make it a point to consciously set aside time at the end of each month to critically examine the path ahead.

The list will remind you of your own worth, make it concrete, and provide an objective basis for your demands. While some people believe it's helpful to write down accomplishments to present to your boss, others believe your accomplishments should already be evident and you should only need to highlight those to remind your boss of what he already knows and reinforce that knowledge. [8] X Research source It depends on what you know about your boss's preferences, your relationship dynamics with your boss, and your own level of comfort with reciting your accomplishments verbatim. If you choose to convince your boss verbally, memorize the list. If you choose to present a written copy to your boss for his or her reference, have somebody proofread it for you first."

This is about more than just doing your job well, which you're already expected to do, but about going above and beyond the duties of your job and, ultimately, it boils down to improving the company's bottom line. Some questions to consider when developing your case include: Did you complete or help to complete a tough project? And get positive results from it? Did you work extra hours or meet an urgent deadline? Are you continuing to demonstrate this type of commitment? Did you take initiative? In what ways? Did you go beyond the call of duty? In what ways? Did you save the company time or money? Did you improve any systems or processes? Did you empower others with your support and guidance or training?

Keeping an existing employee happy is also less of a hassle than conducting interviews and hiring a new one.

      "title": "Decide what level of pay raise you're looking for.",
      "content": "Decide what level of pay raise you're looking for. It's important not to appear greedy, but rather to remain realistic and reasonable. If you feel comfortable with your position, tie the salary increase to the increased revenue or profit that is tied to your past successes and expectations for the near future. If you anticipate being able to bring home a lucrative project or contract in the next few months, that may well fund your pay raise (and more). The implication that the next ten months of your year are all bottom-line profit does not have to be stated explicitly, but, if the case is made convincingly, the conclusion is inescapable. If your boss sees an easy way to justify the salary increase to superiors, you are in a strong position, indeed. The usual tactic of negotiating from a much higher point isn't as good an idea with salary increase requests because your boss might think you're trying to milk the company and push the boundaries. You can break the numbers down so they seem less imposing. For example, you can explain it as being an extra $40 a check rather than $2,200 for the year. [12] X Research source You can also negotiate for more than just a pay raise. Maybe you're happy to take other things in lieu of money, such as shares in the company, a wardrobe allowance, rental assistance, or even a more prestigious title. Ask for a company car, or for a better one. If appropriate, talk about increased benefits, more conspicuous job titles, and modifications to your responsibilities, management oversight, or assignments. Be prepared to compromise and haggle. Even though you haven't given your boss an unrealistic figure, you should expect some bargaining to go on if your boss is receptive to the request."

Compare their wages with your own and work out what you feel is fair pay.

      "content": "Don't be afraid to ask . Though it can be hard to get a pay raise, it's worse to fall into the mindset of not asking for a pay rise, ever. In particular, women are often afraid to ask for a pay raise due to a mindset that does not want to appear demanding or pushy. [13] X Research source See this as an opportunity to show that you care enough to develop a career trajectory that favors your workplace as well as yourself. Negotiation is a learned skill. If you are afraid of this aspect, take some time out to learn it and practice implementing it in a variety of contexts before approaching your boss."

      "title": "Choose the right time.",
      "content": "Choose the right time. Successful requests are all about good timing. Ask yourself what you have done within a demonstrable time period that has made you more valuable to the firm or organization. It doesn't make sense to ask for a pay raise when you've not yet demonstrated anything amazing for the firm -- regardless of long you've been there. The time is right when your value to the organization is clearly high. [14] X Research source This means seizing the iron while it's hot and asking for a pay raise off the back of excellent successes such as holding a highly successful conference, getting fantastic feedback, getting a big client signed on, producing outstanding work that outsiders have praised, etc. Don't choose a time when the company has just posted major losses. [15] X Research source Asking for a pay rise based purely on \"time done\" is dangerous because it makes you appear like a timekeeper rather than someone interested in the company's progression. Never say to your boss: \"I've been here for a year and I deserve a pay rise.” [16] X Research source Your boss will be likely to respond, \"And so what?\""

You don't have to give too much advance notice, but do seek privacy and a time you know you won't be interrupted. For example, when you walk in to work in the morning, say: \"Before you leave, I'd like to speak with you.\" Remember, a face-to-face request is far harder to turn down than a letter or email.

Here are the things that can happen: If it's an outright \"no,\" see the next section. If it's \"I need time to think about this,\" try to pinpoint a future time for reopening the discussion.

Things do go wrong: your boss might encounter resistance from the higher-ups or face budgetary problems, etc. Making your boss feel bad about reneging (for example, mentioning someone you know who asked for a pay raise only to have a boss take it back and how staff morale plummeted). This will have to be done subtly and with tact. Ask when your boss will implement the pay raise. A subtle way of doing this might be to ask if there is anything you need to sign to put it into effect. Go one step further and tell your boss: \"I guess that you'll have this arranged by the end of the month after you've approved the paperwork,” etc.; this puts a plan into action so that he or she doesn't have to."
