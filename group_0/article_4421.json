      "content": "Pull and trim the mane if needed. If your horse's mane is thick, \"pulling\" it with a mane comb will make it much tidier and easier to handle. If the mane is already thin, you can instead trim it to an even length with a blade. Manes are typically cut to no longer than a hand (about 4 inches, or 10 cm), although this is less important for button braids. Ideally, washing and pulling should be done at least a day before braiding."

Leave standing room to braid the mane on the right side of the horse, which is traditional for hunter and dressage competitions. For jumper competitions, you may braid the mane on whichever side it falls naturally. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Set up the area. Before you begin, there are a few steps that can make the process easier: Sweep hay and other ground cover away from the horse so you can find dropped objects, especially if you are using a needle. Place a stool next to the horse if you cannot reach the horse's neck easily. Working with the mane at waist level might be easiest. Put down a container for your tools, or wear an apron or overalls with a large pocket."

      "content": "Choose a braiding method. Continue on to any one of the sections below, or use these tips to decide which you want to try: The band method makes easy, dangling braids, best for short manes. The yarn method is harder, but makes sturdy, attractive looped braids. Sewing creates small \"button braids\" often used in dressage. You'll need to use bands or yarn first before you can sew these on. A running braid is quick and easy, but not suitable for competitions."

      "title": "Divide the mane into equal sections.",
      "content": "Divide the mane into equal sections. Using a mane comb, comb the mane into narrow sections. Start at the top and work your way down. As you get further down the mane, the hair gets thinner, so your sections will become gradually wider in order to ensure evenly sized braids. Secure each equal section with a loosely wound elastic band. For practice braids, choose a band color that stands out. For competitions, choose a band color that matches your horse's mane. Traditionally, an odd number of sections are used. Use more sections for horse's with short, wide necks, and fewer sections for horses with long, thin necks."
