Mix the water with a stirring utensil, like a spoon, or with your clean hands to distribute the soap through the water. Ear plugs that are regularly used should be washed whenever visibly dirty or every few days. Infrequently used plugs should be washed after using every time to prevent bacteria from breeding in the plugs while stored in their case. Using harsh cleaners or non-mild soaps could shorten the shelf life of your ear plugs or make them less effective. This cleaning technique can also be used for banded ear plugs. However, both banded and multi-use single-ear plugs should be replaced after 2 to 4 weeks for best performance."
