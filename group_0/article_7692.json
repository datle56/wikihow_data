Not only will this make your lenses feel uncomfortable, it also allows bacteria to collect in the damaged spot. During your inspection, look for visible dirty spots, as well. [6] X Research source For example, you might see a mascara streak on your contact. This is a visible dirty spot that can likely be cleaned away with extra rubbing]]. On the other hand, a tiny tear on the edge is damage that can’t be corrected. If your contact is torn or otherwise damaged, throw it away."
