      "title": "Understand your Hotworx membership.",
      "content": "Understand your Hotworx membership. When signing up for a Hotworx membership, you are initially enrolled in a 90-day initial membership term. After the first 90 days, your membership becomes month-to-month. Read the contract provided to you by Hotworx to see all of their terms and conditions. Hotworx's contract is not available online for reference."

      "title": "During the first 90 days, Hotworx will not let you cancel your membership.",
      "content": "During the first 90 days, Hotworx will not let you cancel your membership. After this initial period, Hotworx requires a 60-day notice for cancellation. You can cancel in person or via certified mail. This, combined with the three-month initiation period, means you must pay for a minimum of five months of Hotworx membership before you can cancel without fees."
    },
    {
      "title": "Submit your cancellation in person and via mail.",
      "content": "Submit your cancellation in person and via mail. To start the cancellation process, go to your Hotworx gym and ask for a manager. Once speaking with a manager, ask the manager for a membership cancellation form. While you only need to cancel in person, having multiple copies of your cancellation paperwork is useful for recordkeeping. If possible, take the form home and fill it out. Then, make one copy for your records, and one copy to send via certified mail. You can return the original, filled-out copy to your Hotworx location as an in-person cancellation. You may be required to pay the next 60 days of your subscription up-front if you submit a cancellation notice. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "A fee will be charged if you request an instant cancellation.",
      "content": "A fee will be charged if you request an instant cancellation. If you insist on canceling your membership before your 90-day initiation period is complete, Hotworx will charge a fee of $99. You also must submit your cancellation in person to cancel instantly."

      "title": "If you signed up for Hotworx and decide to cancel immediately, you may avoid fees.",
      "content": "If you signed up for Hotworx and decide to cancel immediately, you may avoid fees. If you attempt to cancel your Hotworx membership before midnight on the third business day after you sign up, you may be able to cancel your membership without fees. It's not clear if you can get a refund for your membership fees this way. Ask the manager of your Hotworx for more clarification. This method may or may not work, depending on the Hotworx location."

    {
      "title": "If you don't want to cancel immediately, you can freeze your membership.",
      "content": "If you don't want to cancel immediately, you can freeze your membership. Your membership can be frozen for up to three months. Frozen memberships cost $9 per month, and this fee is charged in place of your normal membership fee. You cannot access Hotworx while your membership is frozen."

      "title": "A doctor's note may be able to waive the cancellation fees for you.",
      "content": "A doctor's note may be able to waive the cancellation fees for you. If you have a note from your doctor explaining that they don't recommend you continue with Hotworx's workouts, you may be able to cancel your membership without fees. Unfortunately, as Hotworx has not posted their membership policies, a doctor's note may or may not work depending on your Hotworx location."
