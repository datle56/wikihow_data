      "content": "Upright, the 10 of Wands represents burdens and being overworked. You may be pushing yourself too hard or committing to too many projects or people at once, leaving you feeling drained, disheartened, or in bad health. You might be so caught up in your work or commitments that you no longer see the end goal of your struggles and are consumed with your responsibilities. [1] X Research source What to do: Look for ways to lighten your current workload. Delegate tasks or responsibilities to colleagues or teammates where you can, and consider saying “no” to requests to take on more work. If you feel consumed by one project or aspect of your life, try spending time doing something else you enjoy to find a better balance. In a “yes or no” reading, the upright 10 of Wands is a soft or conditional “no.” You’re already overwhelmed, so taking on more physical, emotional, professional, or other responsibilities may be unwise.

      "content": "Reversed, the 10 of Wands symbolizes being “crushed” by obligations. While the upright 10 of Wands indicates you’re stressed from being overworked, the reversed (upside down) card is a harsher warning that you need to release some responsibilities to avoid a breakdown or failure. [3] X Research source It’s a reminder that pushing yourself beyond your mental or physical limits is unhealthy for both your body and spirit. Alternatively, drawing this card may indicate that you’ve already done the work of easing some of your burdens. In this case, the reversed 10 of Wands is a good sign that you’re approaching the light at the end of the tunnel and can relax a bit soon! What to do: Take a break from your responsibilities as soon as you can. This might mean taking a day off work or rescheduling some meetings or events so you can practice self-care . Use your down time to brainstorm ways to lighten your workload in the long-term. In a “yes or no” reading, the reversed 10 of Wands is a hopeful or tentative “yes.” Things might be lightening up for you, allowing you to breathe and enjoy the world around you more.

      "content": "Upright The 10 of Wands upright might indicate that your relationship or love life has become more of a burden than a source of happiness. You might be in a karmic relationship , or perhaps you and/or the people you date are weighed down by outside responsibilities or social and cultural expectations. Or, if you’re in a relationship, you may have a demanding partner. In any case, communicate with your partner about what you need to feel more free. [5] X Research source If you’re single: Be wary of dating people who are weighed down by past baggage, as their burden could become yours. It’s not your responsibility to heal anyone yourself, so encourage potential partners to seek help from their loved ones or a therapist. Alternatively, this card might mean you’re too overwhelmed to take on a new relationship. For new or existing relationships: Your relationship may be overwhelming; maybe you rushed into your new relationship unexpectedly or became exclusive too soon, or perhaps a big change in your long-term relationship (like getting engaged or having a child) is causing you stress. Be transparent with your partner about how you feel, especially if you’re contributing more to the partnership than them."

      "title": "Reversed",
      "content": "Reversed Upside down, the 10 of Wands indicates that you’re approaching a lighter, more carefree phase of your love life. In tarot, the number 10 typically symbolizes completion; maybe things are looking up after a rough patch with your partner, or you’ve passed a milestone in your personal life and are ready to date more seriously now. Even though things are looking up, remember to communicate honestly about your wants and needs—relationships are about tackling problems together and sharing responsibilities, after all. [6] X Research source If you’re single: You’re likely in a place where you can enter a (mostly) carefree relationship. Before entering one, be honest and clear about what you expect from your potential partner rather than ignoring issues or hiding parts of yourself. For new or existing relationships: You and/or your partner may have recently overcome a heavy situation, such as a divorce, and are ready to release your emotional burdens and forge a more lighthearted relationship with shared responsibilities. Continue to share your feelings instead of bottling them up and internalizing your burdens, and remember that your partner is here to support you!"

      "content": "Upright An upright 10 of Wands could mean you’re feeling overloaded with your duties or tasks at work. The success of your team projects may rest too heavily on your shoulders, or you could be generally struggling to keep up with the demands of your career. [7] X Research source This may be due to the nature of your job, the attitudes of your colleagues, or because you struggle to say “no” or have a natural tendency to take on more than you can chew. What to do: Set aside some quiet time to reevaluate your priorities at work; you may be able to delegate tasks to some coworkers or speak to a career advisor about how to lighten your load or work more efficiently. Remember that tending to your well-being will also reflect positively in the quality of your work."

      "content": "Reversed Reversed, the 10 of Wands suggests it’s time to make some significant changes to your workload (or possibly even your career). You may be feeling extremely overburdened to the point you’re missing deadlines, falling behind, or jeopardizing your health. [8] X Research source If there are no changes you can make in your current position to reduce your responsibilities, it may be time to consider finding a new job that provides a healthy work-life balance or that better fulfills you spiritually. What to do: Have a conversation with your employer or colleagues about your stress to find possible solutions. Outside of work, focus on improving your work-life balance ; make your home a refuge and don’t answer emails or take calls after hours, and prioritize spending quality time with loved ones to refresh yourself and stay motivated."

What to do: Even though money is tight, remember that the most important things in life can’t be bought; practice gratitude for what you have while you make a plan to recover financially.

You may have lofty aspirations of being wealthy, but your habits—impulse buys, shopping sprees, indiscriminate spending—are only burdening you with debt and anxiety. [10] X Research source What to do: Instead of pretending like everything is fine, face your spending and financial problems head on. Challenge yourself to buy only what you need rather than what you simply want .

[11] X Research source You may be sleeping poorly due to worrying, skipping meals or exercise because you’re working so much, or perhaps even training your body too hard for an upcoming athletic challenge or because you feel obligated to fit a specific body standard. Mentally, you may just be burned out and unmotivated because you haven’t had time to rest. What to do: Take a moment to pause from your activities and revisit the basics of wellness; drink plenty of water, try to get 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night, and eat nutritious meals to fuel your body. Consider meditating to relax your mind and try to do some low-impact exercises, like walking or yoga to stay in shape without overexerting yourself."

This may be due to fear or because you feel you don’t have the time or freedom to take any time for yourself or to be ill. In either case, pulling this card is a clear sign to take a break and tend to your wellness needs, physically and mentally. [12] X Research source What to do: Prioritize yourself and stop avoiding or ignoring doctor visits, illness or injury symptoms, relaxation time, or emotional struggles you may be enduring. It’s better to take a break from your obligations and tend to these issues now than to continue working until your crash and burn."

[13] X Research source What to do: Don’t be afraid to ask for help to work through these emotional or spiritual obstacles—you don’t have to endure these challenges alone.

      "content": "The 10 of Wands depicts a man carrying 10 large, heavy wands or sticks. He’s bent over and struggling, indicating that carrying the wands is a cumbersome burden. In the classic Rider-Waite deck , he appears to be walking toward a small town in the distance. Under normal circumstances, this journey would be easy. However, his travels will be much more difficult considering the burden he’s carrying.

      "content": "The 10 of Wands represent a talented person who’s prone to overexertion. They’re hardworking and generous, preferring to put the needs of others before their own. This generosity is second nature to them, but may in fact be caused by a fear to express or face their own needs. They run the risk of shouldering too much responsibility, leaving themself burned out or neglected. [18] X Research source If you connect to the 10 of Wands personality, remember that balance is key. It’s great to be there for others (and it’s a wonderful trait), but practicing self-love and putting yourself first sometimes is important. The 10 of Wands may represent careers or jobs like service workers, firefighters, construction workers, or volunteers."
