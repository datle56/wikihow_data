      "content": "Choose a durable fabric for very sunny rooms. [1] X Research source The sun will eventually damage any fabric over time, but some fabrics are more durable than others against the sun’s rays. Faux silk, chintzes, brocades, and cotton canvas tend to be the sturdiest and least prone to sun rot If unlined, silks are particularly susceptible to sun rot. Avoid curtains with intricate or bold patterns, as they fade quickly and show sun fade more than solid prints. If you’re buying fabric to have your curtains custom-made, make sure to use decorator fabric specifically. The thread count is typically higher, so they last longer. Some brands of fabric are designed for sunny rooms, so choosing one of these brands is advised."

      "content": "Maximize natural light with sheer fabrics. [2] X Expert Source Karen Parziale Home Stager & Interior Designer [v161369_b01] 21 April 2020. If you enjoy lots of natural lighting, sheer fabrics are the way to go. They’re perfect for small spaces that you want to be sunlit, since sheer materials are thin and take up very little room. Sheers also provide natural ventilation. [3] X Research source If privacy is a concern, choose semi-sheers, which offer a subtle amount of privacy without sacrificing the natural lighting. If you have allergies, consider sheer fabrics. They are excellent at preventing pollen from entering open windows. Sheers come in a range of materials, including cotton, silk and synthetics. Cotton is the most cost-effective choice. You can add another curtain in a heavier fabric during the colder months, then remove it and just leave the sheers when the temperature warms up."

      "content": "Select a heavy fabric when you need a lot of coverage. When you need very long curtains to cover large spaces, choose a fabric that will hang heavily. Heavy fabrics like velvet, velveteen, suede, corduroy, tapestry, and wool-blends will stay put in front of your windows and shield the most light from the room. If cold winters are an issue, heavy fabrics will help insulate the room and increase the energy efficiency of your heating system. [4] X Research source Another option would be using cotton duck curtain lining, which is very heavy and thick. Keep in mind that heavier fabrics have a traditional look, so you may want to avoid these if your room has a modern feel."

      "content": "Try blackout curtains to reduce light and noise. [5] X Research source If light pollution at night is a problem for you, or if you’re having trouble sleeping in general, these specialty window coverings will effectively block all external light from coming into your bedroom. They will also decrease the sound of outside noise. Black-out curtains are usually made of very heavy polyester or Thermaweave, which is woven fabric that also provides insulation. Blackout curtains can also help insulate the room and keep hot or cold air from seeping in from outside. These specialty curtains can usually be found at any home furnishing store. They come in a wide range of styles, colors, and patterns. Seek out curtains that are labelled with terms like “blackout,” “room-darkening,” and/or “light-blocking.”"

      "title": "Consider the existing color scheme of the room.",
      "content": "Consider the existing color scheme of the room. Curtains should complement the décor of the room, so take a look at your current color palette. Don’t forget to take into account any patterns that appear in your wallpaper or on furniture fabric. In most cases, you will want to choose a hue that will tie your curtains in with the color palette of the room. As an alternative, you can create a unique vibe by choosing curtain colors that don’t tie in with the current color scheme. You don’t want the curtains to clash with the décor, but as long as the colors are complementary, they don’t have to exactly match. As an alternative to matching the color, you can match the texture. For instance, choose cotton curtains to match a sofa with a cotton slipcover."

Choosing patterns that feature contrasting colors to your furniture and walls can create even more energy and make a basic room far more interesting. You can also create height in a low-ceilinged room by choosing patterns featuring vertical stripes. Formal home interiors are best dressed with heavy, printed curtains. These create a dramatic effect. Go with thinner, more delicate printed fabrics for a casual vibe. Adding fun, printed curtains is an easy way to upgrade the décor of a room and helps create a polished feel."

      "content": "Create contrast by choosing a shade that stands out from your walls. Choose curtains that are at least one shade lighter or darker than the interior walls, as this will stop them from blending into the walls completely. To make the curtains stand out, choose colors that contrast and complement the colors of the walls and furnishings. Make a statement with a bold pop of contrasting color or give a neutral room a focal point with a vibrant curtain hue. You can also create contrast by layering curtains. For instance, put a curtain with a bold color or pattern on top of or next to a neutral-colored curtain. Alternatively, you can soften a room by blending with existing colors."

If a room already has a lot going on, avoid making it appear busier with patterned curtains. Dress the room down and balance the look with a more subdued fabric. Solid curtain colors will also help balance things out. Don’t be afraid to match patterns in some cases, however. If, for example, stripes are already a subtle theme in the room, you may want to consider striped curtains to match. Pattern mixing can also be effective if you are going for an offbeat vintage vibe. White curtains are always a great idea if you're looking for a nice clean look. [8] X Expert Source Karen Parziale Home Stager & Interior Designer [v161369_b01] 21 April 2020."

      "content": "Create drama with long lengths. Choose long lengths and hang the panels high to create a sense of height and intensity. At minimum, hang them 6 inches (15 cm) above the window frame. Go even higher to create a lavish, powerful effect. [9] X Research source For rooms with low ceilings, consider floor-to-ceiling drapes, which will create the illusion of more space. You can even get super long curtains that puddle on the floor for a dramatic, luxurious look."

      "content": "Avoid thick curtains in small rooms. Thick drapes will make a small room feel even smaller and create a stuffy, uncomfortable feeling. Go with breezy sheer materials or lightweight fabrics to create a more open feeling in small spaces. Avoid lining altogether, which serves to make the overall appearance of any curtains much heavier."

      "title": "Choose a length that falls flush with the floor to create a modern look.",
      "content": "Choose a length that falls flush with the floor to create a modern look. This creates a crisp, contemporary vibe and suits decor that is modern in nature. For a more traditional look, go with curtains that extend a few inches beyond the floor. This will create a very classic looking puddle effect. Choose shorter lengths if you have children and/or pets to prevent curtains from getting damaged. If you battle excessive dust in a particular room, go with curtains that don’t reach the floor. Otherwise they will get dirty very quickly."

      "content": "Extend curtain life by adding a protective lining. If you’ve chosen a fragile curtain fabric or if the curtains will be exposed to a lot of sunlight, you can prolong their life by using a protective lining. This will slow down the fading effect that the sun has on bright colors. Unless you plan on changing out your curtains often, use lining to lengthen the shelf life of your drapes."

      "content": "Coordinate curtain style with the room’s décor. Curtains affect the overall impact of a room in a big way, so you must think about the room’s current stylistic theme. Airy, modern spaces work best with thin, simple curtains. Formal rooms should be accented with layered panels or thick materials. Think about the current impact of the room and how you want the curtains to tie into that. For example, if the décor in a room is already busy, think about pulling a single background color out of your statement wallpaper design. Then use that as a monochrome curtain theme.

      "title": "Consider the size and function of the room.",
      "content": "Consider the size and function of the room. Avoid thick, heavy curtains in small rooms, which will make them feel cramped. Big, airy spaces look great with elegant floor-to-ceiling designs. Think about the functionality of each room and make sure the curtains make sense in that space. Don’t use the same window treatment in every room—each space is unique and should be customized. For instance, your bedroom and kitchen shouldn’t have the same curtains. Kitchens generally need more light than a bedroom and the fabric should be one you can wash frequently, like cotton. Bedroom curtains can be chosen for more aesthetic reasons, with less emphasis on light and durability. If privacy is an issue, make sure the curtains span the entire width of the window and can’t be seen through when they’re pulled closed."

      "content": "Choose a complimentary drapery header. The top treatment says a lot about the aesthetics of a room, so it should be chosen with the final ambiance of the space in mind. For contemporary rooms, consider a back-tab ripplefold. Grommet tops also accent a modern room well. [12] X Research source Pinch pleats look great and they best complement traditional décor. Goblet pleats accent formal rooms with elegance. Smocked headers can add a dramatic and elaborate flair to sophisticated décor. [13] X Research source If you’re unsure, consider the rod pocket. It’s is one of the most basic headers, and it compliments a variety of styles. [14] X Research source There are many other header options available, so make sure to explore them all. Ultimately, go with something that ties into your room’s style. Don’t forget to consider if the curtains are purely decorative or if they’re meant to be functional. You could choose stationary panels on the ends of the windows if you don’t plan to move them, or you could put a rod across the width of the window so the curtains can be opened and closed."

      "content": "Cater to your personal tastes. The details of the room, the fabric, the color, the curtain type, the length—all of these elements are incredibly important when choosing window treatments for your home. Making a choice can be daunting. However, don’t forget to also consider your own personal taste! The décor of your home, including the curtains, is an individual aesthetic choice that reflects your personal style. Most important of all, your window treatment choices should be visually appealing to you."
