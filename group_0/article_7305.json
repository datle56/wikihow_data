      "content": "Note the different kinds of smokeless tobacco. Different forms are used in different ways. [1] X Research source Chewing tobacco consists of loose, sweetened tobacco leaves that are sweetened. You put a wad of tobacco between your cheek and gum and hold it there, sometimes for hours at a time. It's also called chew and chaw. Snuff is finely ground or shredded tobacco leaves. It's available in dry or moist forms and is packaged in tins or tea bag-like pouches. A pinch of snuff is placed between the lower lip and gum or cheek and gum. Dry forms of snuff can be sniffed into the nose, and using snuff is also called dipping. Plug is chewing tobacco that has been pressed into a brick shape, often with the help of syrup, such as molasses, which also sweetens the tobacco. You cut or bite off a piece of the plug and hold it between your cheek and gum. You spit out the tobacco juices. Twist is flavored chewing tobacco that has been braided and twisted into rope-like strands. You hold it between your cheek and gum and spit out the tobacco juices. Snus (the \"u\" is pronounced like the \"e\" in \"news\") smokeless, spit-less tobacco product. It comes in a pouch or as a moist, loose form that you stick between your upper lip and gum. You leave it in your mouth for about half an hour or more without having to spit, then discard it. Dissolvable tobacco comprises pieces of compressed powdered tobacco, similar to small hard candies. They dissolve in your mouth, requiring no spitting. They're sometimes called tobacco lozenges, but they're not the same as the nicotine lozenges used to help you quit smoking.

      "content": "Be aware of the brands of chewing tobacco that are available. There are many brands of chewing tobacco on the market today, and they range in price and flavor. Some of the most popular are: [3] X Research source Copenhagen is premium tobacco made by the U.S. Smokeless and is the most expensive moist tobacco on the market. It comes in flavors like Natural, Straight, Bourbon, Whisky, and Smooth. Starting out with the Long Cut version of Copenhagen may be best for a beginner, as it packs more easily and will stay together in your mouth as you get accustomed to chewing. Skoal is known for its high quality and various flavors, including Apple, Peach, and Wintergreen. Fruit flavors are good for a beginner chewer as they are milder than the mint varieties. Timberwolf is value-priced, high-quality tobacco. It comes in flavors like Apple, Peach, Mint, and Cool Wintergreen. Grizzly is considered \"floor tobacco\" for its cheap price. It comes in Mint and Wintergreen and is not recommended for beginners because of its high nicotine content."

Smokeless tobacco contains several cancer-causing chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), poloniumâ€“210 (a radioactive element found in tobacco fertilizer), and nitrosamines. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Cancer Institute An agency in the National Institutes of Health focused on cancer research and patient support Go to source Chewing tobacco contains sugar, which leads to tooth decay and gum disease. It also contains salt (sodium), which raises blood pressure. Of course, smokeless tobacco products also contain the addictive substance, nicotine."

Packing the tobacco is important because it will make it easier to pinch it. If you are using a pouch, shake the pouch in an even up and down motion so the tobacco gets packed together in the pouch.

      "content": "Place the chew in one side of your mouth, between your lip and the bottom teeth. While you may eventually feel comfortable with the chew to place it between your cheek and back teeth, start with this placement as it is easier to keep in place. If you are having trouble keeping the tobacco in place, take an empty tea bag (or cut a tea bag open at the top and empty out the tea) and place the chew in the teabag. In effect, you are creating something like a snuff pouch but with chewing tobacco. Place the tea bag of chew in your mouth, between your lip and the bottom of your teeth. Using a tea bag will help the chew stay in place but lessen the flavor."

      "content": "Move the tobacco around so that you can chew it and release the nicotine. Be very careful not to swallow any of it. When you put it in your mouth, you will most likely salivate heavily. This is a normal reaction to the presence of the tobacco, as the oils from the chew interact with the saliva in your mouth. You need to chew the tobacco with your teeth to release the nicotine. Chew the tobacco lightly as you do not want to break up the leaves and accidentally swallow any of them. Chew for a little while to get nicotine out of the leaves, then push the tobacco back between your cheek and gums with your tongue. Repeat as needed. Getting tobacco in your throat or stomach will lead to vomiting and increase the chances of long-term health issues, so try to avoid swallowing any of the chew or chew-tainted spit. As you chew, you should feel the effects of the nicotine in the tobacco. You may feel light-headed, have a more rapid heartbeat, an overall buzz, and a tingling sensation in your mouth. You may also feel nauseous or dizzy during your first time doing chew. [9] X Research source"

[12] X Research source Most people who chew become addicted to it. Just as with smoking, withdrawal from smokeless tobacco can cause symptoms like intense cravings, increased appetite, irritability, and depression. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While chewing was very popular among many major league baseball players in the past, the league currently prohibits the use of chewing by players and strongly discourages clubhouse attendants from purchasing chew for players. [14] X Research source Outfielder Bill Tuttle is the most well-known professional baseball player to advocate against chewing tobacco. After 30 years of playing and chewing in the professional league, Tuttle had a tumor so big it came through his cheek and extended through his skin. Doctors removed the tumor, likely the result of his decade-long chew habit, and also had to remove much of Tuttle's face. Chew cost Tuttle his jawbone, right cheekbone, most of his teeth, gum-line, and taste buds. Tuttle eventually died from cancer in 1998 but spent his last years trying to steer people away from doing chew. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Recognize you are at a higher risk for mouth cancer, disease, and infection. Chewing tobacco greatly increases your chances of cancer, including esophageal cancer, as well as cancers of the mouth, throat, cheek, gums, lips, and tongue, and pancreatic cancer. [16] X Research source An accumulation of chew over an extended period will likely lead to tooth decay. Chew contains high amounts of sugar, which contributes to cavities, and also contains coarse particles that irritate your gums and scratch away at the enamel on your teeth, making your teeth weaker and more susceptible to cavities and infection. The sugar and irritants in chewing tobacco also cause your gums to pull away from your teeth, especially in the area of your mouth where you chew. This can lead to gum disease, which can be severe enough to destroy the soft tissue and bone that support your teeth and lead to tooth loss. Chewing tobacco also increases your risk of developing precancerous lesions in your mouth, called leukoplakia, that could one day become cancer. [17] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Each year, about 30,000 Americans learn they have oral and throat cancers, and nearly 8,000 die from these diseases. Only about half of the people diagnosed with mouth or throat cancer survive more than 5 years. [18] X Research source Some forms of smokeless tobacco, like chew, increase your heart rate and blood pressure. Studies suggest that long-term use of smokeless tobacco can increase your risk of dying from certain types of heart disease and stroke.

Some smokers switch to chewing in the hopes it will lessen their tobacco addiction, but this rarely works and can lead to a greater addiction to tobacco. [20] X Research source If you are trying to quit using chew, talk to your doctor about preventative methods like using nicotine gum, the patch, or other medications. [21] X Research source Smoking cessation programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, employers/worksites, and national organizations. [22] X Research source Using substitutes like gum, beef jerky, hard candy, or dried fruits instead of chew can also help to lessen your tobacco addiction by curbing the oral fixation.
