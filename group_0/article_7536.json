List the country first followed by a comma, then the specific government division that ratifies the treaty. Place a period at the end. [2] X Research source For example, in the US, the Senate ratifies treaties, so the Senate would be considered the author of the treaty. If you accessed a treaty through the Senate's website, you would list the author as \"United States, Senate.\" If the treaty wasn't authored by a specific country, start your Works Cited entry with the title of the treaty, rather than an author."

If it appeared in a book or on a website, include the name of that work in italics. If you accessed the treaty online, type a comma after the name and then copy the permalink URL for the treaty in regular font. Do not include the \"http://\" portion of the URL. Place a period at the end of the URL. [4] X Research source Example: United States, Senate. Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances.

For a bilateral treaty, state the 2 parties to the treaty. Otherwise, state that it is a \"Multilateral treaty.\" Place a period at the end of your description. [5] X Research source Example: United States, Senate. Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances. Congress.gov , www.congress.gov/114/cdoc/tdoc8/CDOC-114tdoc8.pdf.

      "title": "Use your in-text citation to direct your reader to the Works Cited entry.",
      "content": "Use your in-text citation to direct your reader to the Works Cited entry. For MLA in-text citations, you typically would place a parenthetical that included the last name of the author and the page number where the material appears at the end of any sentence in which you referenced the source. However, this formula may not work for treaties. In most cases, using the first few words of the Works Cited entry is sufficient for your readers to find the correct full citation. [6] X Research source For example, if you're talking about the Beijing Treaty, simply including \"United States, Senate\" wouldn't work by itself â€“ particularly if you've also used other treaties or government documents as sources. Instead, your parenthetical might be \"(United States, Senate, Beijing Treaty 12).\" If the copy of the treaty you used as a source is not paginated, do not include any number in your parenthetical citation. If you mention the name of the treaty in your text, you may not need a parenthetical citation at all. However, if the treaty is paginated, you would still need a parenthetical with the page number where the material you quoted or paraphrased appears."

If there are more than 2 signatories, you have the option of including them or omitting them. The standard rule is that if the U.S. is a party to the treaty, you list the U.S. first, followed by other signatories in alphabetical order. If the U.S. is not a party to the treaty, list the signatories in alphabetical order. Place a comma after the last country listed. [8] X Research source Example: Treaty Concerning Pacific Salmon, U.S.-Can., Appropriate abbreviations for geographical terms are included in Table 10 of the Bluebook. If you can't find a Bluebook at a local library, search online for citations to the treaty using an academic search engine, such as Google Scholar. Find a legal citation and copy their abbreviations."

Some of these sources have volumes and page numbers while others use item numbers. Place a period at the end of the information about the source. [10] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source If the source has an item number, type the initials for the source followed by the item number. For example: Treaty Concerning Pacific Salmon, U.S.-Can., Jan. 28, 1985, TIAS 11091. If the source has volumes and page numbers, type the volume number followed by the abbreviation for the source. Then type the page number on which the treaty starts. For example: Treaty Concerning Pacific Salmon, U.S.-Can., Jan. 28, 1985, 1469 U.N.T.S. 357. Major official sources include United States Treaties and Other International Agreements (U.S.T.), Treaties and Other International Acts Series (TIAS), and United Nations Treaty Series (U.N.T.S.)."

[11] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Example: (Treaty Concerning Pacific Salmon, 1985). If the title of the treaty is long, you may want to include it in the text of your paper rather than in a parenthetical, where it might be distracting for readers. If you list the full title of the treaty in your text, place the year in parentheses immediately after it. If you're writing a paper using the Bluebook method, include the full citation in footnotes. You typically don't have a reference list or bibliography at the end of a Bluebook paper."
