      "title": "Measure your waist and hips.",
      "content": "Measure your waist and hips. You’ll be able to find the proper size for your underwear across brands if you know your waist and hip measurements . Use a tape measure to measure your natural waist and the fullest part of your hips so you can choose the most comfortable size for your body. You can find your natural waist by bending sideways. A crease will form at your waist to help you identify it. Keep the tape measure parallel to the ground when you measure your hips."

      "title": "Double check your measurements to consult sizing information.",
      "content": "Double check your measurements to consult sizing information. It’s a good idea to measure both your waist and hips twice to make sure that you get the same measurement both times. Once you have your waist and hip measurements, you can consult the sizing information for any underwear you’re considering to ensure a proper fit. Checking your measurement is important, because sometimes you don't get it right the first time. If your measurements are different on the second try, measure them a third time. One of these sets should match up, so use that set of measurements when shopping."

      "title": "Look for firm elastic.",
      "content": "Look for firm elastic. No one wants to be pulling at their underwear all day to keep it from slipping or falling down. Choose underwear that has firm elastic in the waistband so you know it will stay in place. [1] X Research source While firm elastic at the waist is helpful in underwear, avoid styles with elasticized leg holes. They have a tendency to bunch up, which can be uncomfortable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid underwear that’s too tight.",
      "content": "Avoid underwear that’s too tight. Underwear that’s too tight doesn’t just lead to unflattering bulges and lumps beneath your clothing; it can also cause skin chafing and irritation from the friction. In general, any underwear that’s tight enough to leave marks on your skin is too tight. [2] X Research source Underwear that’s too tight also doesn’t breathe as well, so it can lead to health issues and leave you a little sweaty."

    {
      "title": "Check for bunching, rolling, or sagging.",
      "content": "Check for bunching, rolling, or sagging. Before leaving the house for the day, it’s important to make sure that your undies are lying smoothly against your body. Any pair that bunches, rolls, or sags under your clothing is going to be uncomfortable because you’ll be tugging at them to keep them from pinching your skin or falling down. [3] X Research source Not only can bunching underwear be uncomfortable in the long run, but it can also look messy and ruin even the best outfit. This is especially important with dresses and skirts! If your underwear is bunching, readjust it so that it sits properly on you. If it still bunches, switch to a different pair. Bunching, rolling, and sagging is often a sign of old, worn underwear; it means that the fabric has lost its stretch and is now too big for you."

      "title": "Look for cotton underwear.",
      "content": "Look for cotton underwear. Cotton is king when it comes to comfortable underwear because it is breathable. That means moisture won’t be trapped in the fabric so your undies won’t get as sweaty and you won’t have to worry as much about bacterial and yeast infections. [4] X Research source Because of the possibility of yeast infections, cotton underwear is a particularly good option for women. Cotton underwear is also less likely to cause chafing or rashes."

      "title": "Go with synthetic fabric for a slimmer fit.",
      "content": "Go with synthetic fabric for a slimmer fit. While cotton underwear’s breathability makes it more comfortable, it doesn’t always look smooth under clothing. For a slimmer, fit, opt for undies made from a stretchy, synthetic material, such nylon, Lycra, or spandex. Make sure that the crotch is lined with cotton, though, to ensure that you’re comfortable. [5] X Research source Consider the type of underwear labeled as \"seamless\" or \"no-lines.\" They don't have any elastic in the hips or leg openings, making them ideal for fitted garments. A cotton lining in the crotch is important for another reason: it's breathable. If the crotch lining is synthetic, then you risk trapping moisture, which can lead to infections."

      "title": "Save silk underwear for special occasions.",
      "content": "Save silk underwear for special occasions. Silk underwear definitely has a luxurious, sexy feel, but it doesn’t breathe as well as cotton. That means there’s a greater chance of moisture being trapped in your underwear, which can lead to infections. Only wear silk underwear on special occasions for the most comfortable feel. [6] X Research source This also goes for other types of fancy underwear, such as lace. While lace underwear does often have a cotton lining, it's not very comfortable or durable."

      "title": "Go with boxers for breathability.",
      "content": "Go with boxers for breathability. If you tend to sweat a lot or are prone to rashes or chafing, boxers allow for better airflow. For the best fit under clothing, choose a pair that has shorter, slimmer legs and a stretch-band waist. [7] X Research source Boxers aren’t the best choice if you wear a lot of slim-fitting pants, such as suit trousers or skinny jeans. Boxers offer little support, so be sure that’s not important to you before choosing them."

      "title": "Opt for briefs if you have larger thighs.",
      "content": "Opt for briefs if you have larger thighs. If you have thicker thighs, underwear styles with legs, such as boxer or boxer briefs, tend to ride up during wear. That can cause rolls that show through your clothing. Instead, choose briefs to keep the extra material away from your legs. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pick boxer briefs if you have a large backside.",
      "content": "Pick boxer briefs if you have a large backside. A cross between briefs and boxers, boxer briefs offer a slim fit and more support than boxers. They are especially comfortable for a larger backside because the stretch allows them to provide more coverage than briefs do so you won’t be tugging at your underwear all day. [9] X Research source Boxer briefs are also a comfortable option if you are tall because their higher waistband doesn’t slip down beneath the waistline of your pants when you bend over."

    {
      "title": "Select boxer trunks for a slim build.",
      "content": "Select boxer trunks for a slim build. Boxer trunks, or hipsters, are a shorter version of boxer briefs, which usually sit at the mid- to upper-thigh. They are a comfortable option if you have a slim build because there isn’t much bunching under your clothing. [10] X Research source If you have thicker thighs, boxer trunks aren’t usually a good option because they can ride up as you move."

      "title": "Choose bikini briefs for everyday.",
      "content": "Choose bikini briefs for everyday. With their lower waistline and moderate coverage, a bikini brief is usually the classic option when it comes to women’s underwear styles. They will be a comfortable option for most body types, so it’s a good everyday style of underwear. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Opt for high-waisted briefs if you have a large belly.",
      "content": "Opt for high-waisted briefs if you have a large belly. If you carry most of your weight at your stomach, underwear with a lower waistband can be uncomfortable because it may bunch and roll. Choose a high-waisted brief style, which will cover your belly so you don’t have to keep pulling your undies up all day. [12] X Research source High-waisted briefs can also be a comfortable option if you are curvy or have an hourglass figure."

      "title": "Wear a thong if you prefer slimmer fitting clothing.",
      "content": "Wear a thong if you prefer slimmer fitting clothing. There’s nothing more annoying than tugging at your underwear to keep it from bunching under skinny jeans and other tighter fitting bottoms. A thong can be the most comfortable option because it has a barely there feel in the back that won’t add any bulk under your clothing. [13] X Research source Thongs can be uncomfortable for some people, so test a pair out at home before committing to wearing them out for the day."

      "title": "Grab boy short underwear if you have a larger backside.",
      "content": "Grab boy short underwear if you have a larger backside. For a pear shape body, where most of your weight is carried in your lower body, boy shorts provide plenty of coverage for a large butt. Opt for a seamless pair, and you won’t have to worry about them showing up under clothing. [14] X Research source While they’re especially comfortable if you have a large backside, boy shorts work on nearly every body type."
