      "content": "Decide whether to use traditional forms. According to the Royal Family's official policy, you should be free to write in whatever style you like. Politeness and respect will make any letter more kindly received, but that does not necessarily equate to using formal terms. Stay sincere, and do not use the formal terms below if they make you uncomfortable."

      "content": "Conclude the letter with a respectful term. The traditional written conclusion is I have the honour to be, Madam, Your Majesty's most humble and obedient servant, followed by your name. If you find this conclusion distasteful due to the declaration of servitude, or the insertion of the letter u in honour , consider one of the following respectful conclusions instead: With greatest respect, Yours faithfully, Yours sincerely, If you make a request, end the letter with a thank you and write your name.

      "content": "Make a small curtsy, bow, or nod. Traditionally, women do a discreet curtsy and men bow from the neck when they meet the Queen of the United Kingdom. This is no longer required, but citizens of the Commonwealth usually choose to use this greeting. People who are not subjects of the Queen often prefer to use a slight nod instead. Do not bow from the waist."

      "title": "Wait for Her Majesty to address you.",
      "content": "Wait for Her Majesty to address you. A good general rule, in fact, is not to initiate an action or conversation until the Queen has addressed you directly. Needless to say, wait until the Queen finishes speaking before you reply."

      "content": "Address her as \"Ma'am\" for the rest of the conversation. For the rest of the conversation, say, \"Ma'am,\" pronounced to rhyme with \"jam.\" You may use the term \"Your Majesty\" again if you are asking her a question or introducing someone, but \"Ma'am\" will do most of the time."
