Because they didn’t believe it would work, they sent their friend Laura into the bathroom by herself. As she performed the ritual, a baby appeared and began scratching her arms. Suddenly, she saw something horrible in the mirror and screamed in terror. When the other girls heard her screaming, they tried to get into the bathroom but the door was locked. When they finally broke down the door, they found Laura lying dead on the floor. Her eyes had been scratched out. They tried to move her but couldn’t, as something invisible and heavy was pinning her down."
