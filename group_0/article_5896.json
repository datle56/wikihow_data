      "content": "Take hot sitz baths. A sitz bath is a warm water bath in which you sit upright in the bath in order to heal or clean the rectal area. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try to take a sitz bath after bowel movements. This cleans the anus without irritating it with toilet paper, allows spasms to relax, and increases blood flow to the anus. You can take a sitz bath by purchasing a special sitz bath seat. Your doctor may provide you with one if you tell her about the issues you're having with anal fissures. You can also purchase one at a medical supply store. Attach the sitz bath seat to your toilet and fill it with warm water. Make sure the water is not warm enough to cause pain by testing it with your finger or hand first. Most sitz baths have vents that allow water to drain out on occasion. If your bath does not have a vent, change the water periodically to keep it fresh and at a warm temperature. You should remain seated in your bath for 10 to 20 minutes. Try to sit still during that time, avoiding sudden movements that could prevent relaxation."

      "content": "Eat a high fiber diet. A high fiber diet can encourage regular bowel movements. A high-fiber diet results in softer stool that are passed faster. This can help anal fissures heal. [3] X Trustworthy Source University of California San Francisco Health Center Research hospital associated with UCSF, a leading medical university, providing innovative patient care and public health resources Go to source The National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine recommends women get 21 to 25 grams of fiber a day, depending on age. On average, most Americans only get 5 to 14. High fibers foods include fruits, such as berries, apples, oranges, raisins, figs, and pears. They also include whole wheat grains, such as whole-wheat pasta and bread, and breakfast foods like oatmeal, bran muffins, and bran flakes. Broccoli, green peas, potatoes, and brussels sprouts are good vegetable options. Certain nuts and legumes are high fiber, such as black beans, lima beans, and baked beans, as well as a variety of seeds. However, make sure your fiber intake is not comprised of too many foods that could prove difficult to digest. Avoid nuts, popcorn, tortilla chips, and other hard foods with sharp edges."

      "title": "Try topical anesthetics and steroids.",
      "content": "Try topical anesthetics and steroids. Topical anesthetics, used in conjunction with steroid cream, can be used before a bowel movement to reduce pain caused by anal fissures. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Xylocaine, lidocaine, tetracaine, and pramoxine are topical anesthetics. While some anesthetics are available over the counter, many require a prescription. Ask your doctor for a recommendation and, if needed, a prescription for an anesthetic to treat your anal fissures. Creams are applied gently on the rectal region before a bowel movement, with a clean paper towel or wipe. Some drug stores sell wipes specifically designed for applying such creams. A small amount of a steroid is often combined with creams and ointments. This helps reduce inflammation and numb some of the pain associated with bowel movements. If using steroids alongside aesthetics, you should not use the medication for more than 2 weeks. Using steroids for a longer period can thin parts of the rectum, resulting in further trauma to the area."

      "title": "Ask your doctor about nitroglycerin.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor about nitroglycerin. Some ointments contain a muscle relaxant called nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin can relax the sphincter muscles and reduce contractions and spams during bowel movements, and also help increase blood flow to the anus. This reduces the trauma around the rectal region, giving anal fissures the chance to heal. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Nitroglycerin should be applied using a cotton swab. Apply a small amount of ointment to the cotton swab and insert the cotton tip into the anus. Do not go farther than this, only inserting the cotton portion. The concentration of nitroglycerin in ointments is relatively low, usually only around 0.2%. Topical use of nitroglycerin for treating anal fissures is considered safe while breastfeeding. Side effects do occasionally occur when using nitroglycerin. The most common side effect is a headache or lightheadedness."

Make sure you walk the night after surgery, as this lessens the risk of blood clots, which can be potentially life threatening. Depending on the type of surgery, you should not return to work for 1 to 4 weeks. Avoid driving until you're done taking pain medications. Your surgery will leave a wound in the rectal area that needs treatment. Keep the wound clean and dry and take sitz baths baths 3 times a day. Bloody drainage will occur for a few days following the surgery, so the wound should be sealed with gauze."
