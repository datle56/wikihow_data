The length of one metre stick is equal to 1 metre. A metre stick is NOT the same as a yardstick. There are 3 feet in a yard, but there are about 3.28 feet in one metre. [2] X Research source You will know a measurement is in metres because it will be labeled m {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {m} } . For example, if the length of a floor is 4 metre sticks long, it is 4 m {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {4\\ m} } long."

      "content": "Find the number of partial metres you need to convert to millimetres. Often you will see metres stated in decimals. These means you have a partial metre to convert. If you are measuring, use the centimetre ( c m {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {cm} } ) or millimetre ( m m {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {mm} } ) units on the metre stick or tape measure. For example, if you measure something that is 4 metres long, plus 30 centimetres, it is 4.3 metres long, because there are 100 centimetres in 1 metre. [3] X Research source If you measure something that is 4 metres long, plus 30 millimetres, it is 4.03 metres long, because there are 1000 millimetres in a metre. [4] X Research source"

Since the metric system is based on multiples of ten, the easiest way to do this is by moving the decimal point to the right. [5] X Research source For example, if you are converting 4.3 m {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {4.3\\ m} } , write 4.3 {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {4.3} } and place your pencil on the decimal point."

[6] X Research source For example, if your floor is 4.3 m {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {4.3\\ m} } long, you would move your pencil three decimal places to the right, adding two zeros to the number. This gives you 4 300 m m {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {4\\,300\\ mm} } . You could also use a calculator or use the standard multiplication algorithm to calculate 4.3 ร 1000 {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {4.3\\times 1000} } ."

On a standard American ruler, millimetres can be measured with the smallest lines on the metric ( c m {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {cm} } ) side. Make sure you measure millimetres (small lines) and not centimetres (numbered lines). You will know a measurement is in millimetres because it will be labeled m m {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {mm} } . For example, the length of a pencil might be 155 m m {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {155\\ mm} } long."
