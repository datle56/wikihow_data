      "title": "Relax and keep your cool.",
      "content": "Relax and keep your cool. Take a deep breath and remember that buying condoms is perfectly normal and extremely responsible of you. So there’s no need to worry about being interrogated by the cashier or other customers about what you’re doing. [1] X Research source In reality, people aren’t paying that much attention to what you’re buying. After all, you’re not the first person who’s ever ventured into the store to buy condoms. There are no age restrictions on buying condoms. You don't need to be 18, and minors are free to purchase them. Also, you don't need to bring your ID."

      "title": "Decide which condoms you’re going to buy beforehand.",
      "content": "Decide which condoms you’re going to buy beforehand. Determine the brand, condom size, and material (e.g. latex, polyurethane, lambskin) you prefer. [2] X Research source Going into the store with a specific item in mind will keep you from spending extra time in the store and wandering awkwardly up and down the condom aisle. Pick out a few options in case the store doesn’t carry one of the brands you’re interested in buying. Find out how much the condoms will cost so you can go in prepared with the right amount of money to spend. Look for brands that are FDA approved. These include brands such as Trojan, LifeStyles and Ramses. [3] X Research source Search online for condoms and read reviews."

      "title": "Determine the condom size you need",
      "content": "Determine the condom size you need if you don't already know it. If you’re a male, measure your erect penis to help you choose the right size condom. Measure the width of the erect penis at its widest part using a piece of string or a tape measure. Condom sizes are determined by girth rather than length, so there’s no need to measure your penis’s length. [4] X Research source If your width is between 11.93 and 12.95 cm (4.7 and 5.1 inches), go for a “regular”-sized condom. If you’re less than 11.93 cm (4.7 inches) around, buy a small size. If you’re width is greater than 12.95 cm (5.1 inches), go and buy the large-sized condoms. Condoms can stretch to quite long lengths to accommodate different people. If you buy a condom that is too small, you’re at a higher risk of it breaking during sex. On the other hand, if you buy a condom that’s too large, you run the risk of it slipping off."

      "title": "Choose a store that’s not too close to where you live.",
      "content": "Choose a store that’s not too close to where you live. Purchasing from a store that’s 20 or 30 minutes away can keep you from running into people that you know. You may also feel calmer knowing that you probably won’t see your family, friends, or classmates. [5] X Research source Condoms are sold at most major stores. So head on over to any convenience store, drugstore, or supermarket. You can even try calling ahead beforehand to make sure that they carry them. Visit the store before you buy your condoms. Take a few minutes to see what section (e.g. family planning aisle, pharmacy, etc.) the condoms are located in. If the condoms are kept behind a counter, and you want to avoid as much interaction as possible, consider purchasing from a different store. However, if you don’t have any other options but to talk to the salesperson, have what you want to say already planned out. This includes the condom brand, type, and how many you want.

      "title": "Plan to shop during less busy hours.",
      "content": "Plan to shop during less busy hours. Visit the store when it's relatively quiet and there are only a few other shoppers. Stores are less busy in the early morning hours and very late at night. This way, you won’t have to worry about running into other people in the aisles. [7] X Research source The best time to buy condoms is well before you’ll actually need to use one. This way, if you get too nervous the first few times about walking into the store, you’ll still have plenty of time to try again."

      "title": "Think of condoms as just another item.",
      "content": "Think of condoms as just another item. Think of your condoms as just another personal care item that you’re buying, like toothpaste, shampoo, or deodorant. Changing your mentality can help you be less nervous. Simply include that aisle during your shopping trip, pick out what you are looking for, and continue shopping. [8] X Research source Appear calm and confident when you purchase the condoms. You might just draw extra attention to yourself if you’re acting nervous."

    {
      "title": "Buy a few other items.",
      "content": "Buy a few other items. While not necessary, you might feel more comfortable if you buy a few things and put them in your cart along with the condoms. That way, you’re not standing at the counter with just a box of condoms. Another tactic is to use the other items in your cart to cover up the condoms. That way other people won’t be able to look in your basket and automatically see the condoms."

    {
      "title": "Go to a convenience store to avoid crowds.",
      "content": "Go to a convenience store to avoid crowds. Convenience stores and gas stations often sell condoms as well. These stores are smaller and have fewer people. If you purchase from a convenience store, you may have to talk to the cashier and let them know that you need to buy condoms, since they’re usually located behind the counter. If you don’t mind interacting with the cashier but want to avoid large crowds, this may be an option for you. [9] X Research source Sometimes the bathrooms in these stores will have vending machines that dispense condoms and other small sex-related items. This is a super discrete way to buy condoms."

      "title": "Use cash and throw away the receipt to keep your purchase a secret.",
      "content": "Use cash and throw away the receipt to keep your purchase a secret. This is something to do if you don’t want anyone to find out about your purchase later on, such as a parent or friend. If your parents monitor your credit card/debit card spending, buy your condoms using cash. That way you won’t have to answer any questions about a charge on your card."

      "title": "Try self-checkout if you don’t want to talk to a cashier.",
      "content": "Try self-checkout if you don’t want to talk to a cashier. Instead of using the checkout line, buy your condoms from a store that has an automated checkout where you scan your purchases and bag them yourself. This will allow you to avoid talking to a cashier. Most grocery stores and large retailers have self-checkout stations. [10] X Research source If self-checkout isn’t an option, paying for the condoms at a more secluded register in the back (e.g. the hunting section or automobile section) is a good way to avoid crowds of people, and you can sometimes also avoid long lines."

      "content": "Buy in bulk to postpone future trips to the store. Just be sure to check the expiration date before you use the condom. If a condom is expired or damaged, it will not be effective. [11] X Research source If you’re trying to hide them from a family member, put them at the back of your closet, under your bed, or at the back of a drawer under some clothes. Just make sure they’re kept in a place that’s relatively cool and dry."

      "content": "Go to an adult store to buy condoms if you’re over 18. You likely won’t feel as out of place at an adult store because everyone there is buying sex-related items. Plus, the people who work at an adult store are usually very knowledgeable about the merchandise and can answer any questions you may have about the different condom options."

      "content": "Buy condoms online to avoid any human interaction. There are plenty of websites that will let you order condoms and have them delivered to your home. The condoms are usually delivered in plain, discreet packaging as well. They typically require payment by debit or credit cards, but they’ll usually use a much more discreet name on the bill. You won't have \"Jack's Sex Shop and Condom Store\" on any of your card bills. If you don't have a credit or debit card, go to a store to buy something like a Visa gift card . Use these kinds of prepaid cards anywhere that brand of card is accepted."

Teen clinics and HIV/STD prevention centers, Planned Parenthood, and some local health departments offer condoms free of charge with no questions asked. If you have questions, there will be people there who will be genuinely happy to help you out. Call the clinic or visit the website to make sure that they provide free condoms.
