      "content": "Recognize the role of criticism is to help you improve. It’s normal to receive constructive feedback from teachers, bosses, coaches, family members, and friends. At times, this criticism is going to seem negative because its purpose is to help you better your performance. Don’t view criticism as an attack because it’s really meant to help you. [8] X Research source Don’t just focus on the negative criticism. Hear the positives, as well. For example, your coach might point out that you're repeatedly making the same error during games.

[10] X Research source In some cases, seeing the criticism from the other person's perspective can also help you realize that they aren't attacking you. Being told that you need to improve on something can really hurt, but if no one ever gives you criticism, you'll never grow. Are they speaking from a positive place? If so, think about how you can use their criticisms to improve. If you think they’re speaking from a negative place, such as out of jealousy, you might decide their criticisms aren’t valid for you."

For example, after a presentation you might tell yourself, “I’m no good at public speaking.” You can replace this thought with, “Every speech I give gets better, and I’m proud of my progress.”"
