You can also make notes or comments on each part as necessary. Be very honest with yourself about your perspectives so that it’s easier to make changes. [2] X Research source You also need to think about how these perspectives shape you as a person. Do they tend to make you a negative person or make you less likely to take risks? For example, if you believe that a woman can’t be the head of state or a CEO, acknowledge this perspective and then consider how it influences and shapes you in every aspect of your life. You may discover that your perspective is clouding your judgment of all women. [3] X Research source"

Once you’ve had a chance to think about your perspectives and what informs them, envision how your life might be if you changed your perspectives.

Try the simple exercise of doing a handstand or laying in the grass and looking up at the sky. Both exercises can help you notice that life is not linear and there are many different perspectives from which to view the world. Ask yourself creative and deep questions about the world and consider “what ifs” to help you see how changing your perspectives may change you and the world around you. For example, think about what might happen if you believed that women can be heads of state or CEOs? Would you get along with your coworkers and other people better? Would it help you in your own career or life?"

Acknowledging that other people have perspectives that differ from yours will help you to more holistically consider your own views and begin changing them. You cannot begin to change your own perspectives without considering and acknowledging that your truth is not the only or right view. For example, if you believe that women can’t be heads of state or CEOs, understand that there are many people in this world who don’t share your view. Otherwise, countries like Norway or Great Britain or companies such as Yahoo wouldn’t have had women at their helms. A good exercise to help you understand different perspectives is to choose a cultural trait that you do not possess. Try to imagine how that cultural belief might impact your perspective on a number of issues."
