Try straightening, curling, or crimping it, or style your hair into beachy waves, a fishtail braid, a side ponytail, a messy bun... the possibilities are endless. If your hair is frizzy or dry and you don't have any time to do anything to it, try an anti-frizz spray, mousse, or a leave-in conditioner. Then, wear it however you wish. For example, you could wear it up in a ponytail, or down naturally."

Of course, everyone's skin is different, but for some, what works the best is to use an oil-free cleanser, (helps with oil) an exfoliating scrub, (helps with blackheads) and an oil-free moisturizer that won't clog your pores (helps with dry skin)."

      "content": "Enhance your face with makeup: In many ways, makeup can make you look gorgeous by highlighting your features and enhancing your face. For a great everyday look, read How to Apply Makeup for a Natural Look . Use concealer. Skip out on the full face foundation. Get a concealer that matches your skin tone as close as possible. Use this to cover up small imperfections such as pimples, discoloration, white/blackheads, and dark circles. Use eyeliner. Eyeliner is great! It defines your eyes, and makes them pop! Try to stick to a brown eyeliner. Black is dramatic, but brown gives you a more subtle, natural look. If you want your eyes to appear larger, you can use a lighter shade for the inner half of the eye and apply nude liner in your waterline. Use mascara. Mascara make your eyes look awesome, but be careful, it can also become very smudgy or clumpy, and completely ruin the look. Use a clear mascara, as it clumps less, and doesn't smudge noticeably. If you have sensitive eyes, opt for an ophthalmologically tested mascara with more natural or cleaner ingredients and a smaller wand that can help you avoid the product too close to your lash line. Try an eyelash-curler beforehand to make your eyelashes more curly (so mascara is less-likely to \"clump\") and stand out more. Care for your lips. Don't wear lipstick, as it would make you look older than you are. Instead, try lip gloss, petroleum jelly, lip butter, lip shimmer, etc. If you use lip gloss, put on chapstick with it, so that your lips do not become chapped."

      "content": "Wear clothes that accentuate you. We all have something that grabs other people's attention, whether it's a proof that you will have a great figure, maybe you own great legs, maybe you tan easily, or perhaps you're just one of a few that looks good in all colors. Try clothing stores such as Abercrombie, Hollister, Forever 21, Charlotte Russe, Delias, Aeropostale, Dillards, Target, or Kohls. However, if none of these are your style, you don't have to wear them! In fact, it's totally cool to just wear team jerseys with jeans. It's no secret that the way a girl wears her clothes can get her far in the girl world, so make sure your clothes fit and flatter you. Wear colors that look good on you. For shoes, skip heels and Crocs. Instead, try ballet flats, canvas shoes, T-strap sandals, or Uggs. Make sure your shoes are easy to walk in and comfortable. Don't feel as if you have to go to brand name stores to look pretty, as you can find plenty of really nice clothes for much cheaper. Try second-hand or vintage stores like Plato's Closet or BlueTique. They're much more affordable. You could get a brand new pair of Hollister jeans for $20, or you could get a used pair for around $10. Be humble. Don't wear skimpy clothing to be cool. In reality, it will just make people think badly about you. Instead, try wearing a fitted top along with loose bottoms, or a loose top with more fitted bottoms. Also, never stuff your bra, or choose a bra that is too big for you just to be \"hot\". People will see right through it. Wear one that fits you properly."

Within a period of time, you'll notice a big difference in your skin, health, and complexion. Get your beauty sleep! Most teens should get at least nine or ten hours of sleep. You have to be awake at every moment of the day, because you never know what great things during the day await you. If you're trying to exercise to become thinner, try running, dancing to fast music that you love, using an elliptical, using a treadmill, or even taking a bike ride. If you want to look more muscular and strong, and not \"skinny\", consider trying knee push-ups, sit-ups, wall sits, wall push-ups, or lifting weights or your own backpack. Focus mainly on your biceps and triceps."

You develop your own style and personality, and sometimes it can feel as if you don't fit in. Don't feel as if you have to fill some sort of mold. \"Fitting in\" is something that every middle schooler worries about at some point, but in the end, you'll laugh at yourself for believing in such a thing, and realize that \"fitting in\" isn't all that important. Stand up for yourself and others if you or the ones you care about get bullied. Laugh at your mistakes, but try to work to get better at them. Most importantly, don't let anyone else tell you how you should live your life. As Oscar Wilde said, \" Be yourself. Everyone else is already taken. \""
