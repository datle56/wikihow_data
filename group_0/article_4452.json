The basic method for breaking into a car with automatic locks without damaging anything is to wedge a space in the door and use a long poker to hit the lock button. It may be crude, but it's more or less exactly what a locksmith will do if you call one, except doing this won't waste you $80 bucks for five minutes of work. To do this, you'll need one wedge and one poker. Possibilities include: The best wedges can include putty knives and door stops, the thinner the better. Ideally, you want to open up only as much space as is necessary to insert your poker. Locksmiths use an inflating balloon to pump air and create space. [1] X Research source The best pokers include the antenna from the car, unscrewed, and a straightened wire hanger. [2] X Research source You might need a pair of pliers to straighten out the hanger, and consider doubling it up to have better control and pushing power when you get to the lock button. Pretty much any tool that is narrow enough to fit through the window crack and long enough to reach the lock button will work. These \"pokers\" are usually improvised tools to simulate the long reach tools sold in professional opening kits."

      "content": "Lasso the lock with a coat hanger. The biggest difference between breaking into a vehicle with manual locks is that you have to pull up on the locking pin once you get in if you want to do it manually. Follow the same directions, wedging and poking through the space you create, but then you'll have to carefully pull up to unlock the car. [3] X Research source Pushing a button is one thing, but lassoing the pin is much more difficult. You'll have to slip the loop over the head of the lock nub like a noose and pull up to unlock the car. It may take a few tries to get it."

      "content": "Consider using a slim jim, or fashioning your own. A slim jim, otherwise called a lockout tool, is a car tool commonly issued to police officers to help open doors with manual locks. [4] X Research source It's used by wedding into the door mechanism itself, between the window and the weather stripping, hooking the locking pin, and pulling it from the inside. If you've got access to a slim jim, it can be a quick fix. Create your own by straightening out a coat hanger, leaving only the curved (hook) end in its original shape. You may need to use needle nose pliers to unwind the coat hanger to straighten it out, and double it over to reinforce it. Note that this method is not recommended for cars with automatic windows and locks. Those cars have a lot of wiring in their doors, which might get damaged in this breaking in process."

The locking mechanism is generally lined up with the lock itself, usually toward the back of the door itself. With your fingers, peel back this rubber strip back from the window slightly to expose the gap between the window and the outer part of the car door. Gently insert your straightened coat hanger, curved end first, into the gap between the window and the weather stripping. [5] X Research source"

If you can look at the vehicle's shop manual, you'll be able to have a great sense of where the locking pin will be and how to access it. If you blindly dig around in the door, you do risk messing up the wiring and causing damage. Try to find out where the locking pin is before you insert the slim jim."
