      "title": "Cut the lumber for the tabletop.",
      "content": "Cut the lumber for the tabletop. You may use construction-grade lumber if you don't mind a rustic look, but choose boards with as little warp as possible. Measure and mark the cut lines first, then cut the lumber with a miter saw. Cut five 2x10\" boards to 69 inches (180 cm) in length. If the miter saw is too small to make one cut, cut halfway through, then rotate the board and cut again. Refer to the end of this article for a list of all lumber and supplies required. If you'd like to change the measurements of your table, draw a diagram first so you know how much lumber to buy."

      "title": "Arrange the tabletop on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Arrange the tabletop on a flat surface. Find the flattest surface you can, such as a garage floor. Lay out the five 69\" boards in a row, as flush as possible. A little warp is fine, but try a different order for the boards if there's a major gap."

    {
      "title": "Mark the pocket hole locations.",
      "content": "Mark the pocket hole locations. For each border between two boards, draw a series of marks along one side, spacing them 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) apart. This is where you'll drill pocket holes to hold the tabletop together. In addition, mark two spots on each end of each board, where you'll be attaching breadboard ends."

    {
      "title": "Adjust the Kreg Jig depth.",
      "content": "Adjust the Kreg Jig depth. Insert a drill bit into the depth guide on your Kreg Jig, until the step touches the 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) mark. Tighten the depth collar with an allen wrench. The step is the edge between the wide and narrow portions of the drill bit. Don't use the tip of the drill bit as your guide."

      "title": "Adjust the jig placement.",
      "content": "Adjust the jig placement. Manually loosen the screw on the back of the jig so you can move the hole guide. Raise or lower it until set to the 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) mark, then tighten the screw."

    {
      "title": "Drill the pocket holes.",
      "content": "Drill the pocket holes. Stand the edge of a board into the Kreg Jig, centered on one of your marks. Drill through the hole on top of the Kreg Jig to make a pocket hole in the board. Repeat with each mark on each board. It can help to rest the board on a 3/4\" spacer, to keep it level. Don't forget the marks on the end of each board. Stand the board vertically to drill these."

      "title": "Attach boards with 2.5 inch (6.3 cm) Kreg screws.",
      "content": "Attach boards with 2.5 inch (6.3 cm) Kreg screws. Place the screw into one of the pocket holes you just drilled, and drill it in to fasten the boards together. Keep the boards as level and flush as possible while you do this, and check afterward to make sure they haven't shifted. Repeat for each pocket hole between two boards. Clamp together the boards if possible. It also helps to weigh down the boards with heavy objects."

You'll need the following cuts of lumber to form the two ends of the table: [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Two 4x4s to 43\" length (end tops) Four 4x4s to 25⅜\" length, with ends cut parallel at a 10º angle (table legs) Two 4x4 at 36¼\" length, with ends cut not parallel at 10º angle (end braces)"

On a flat surface, lay out a table end as follows: Put down one of the 43\" \"end top.\" Position two 25⅜\" legs against the first board, leaning inward in the style of a picnic table. Place a 36¼\" board between the two legs as a horizontal base. Adjust the position of this piece and the legs until they are flush against each other, and centered under the top board."

      "content": "Put together the table ends. Drill in three 6\" torque screws at each point where two boards touch (twelve screws in all). Put together the second table end the same way you did the first. An impact wrench makes it easier to drill in the torque screws and reduces the chance of stripping the bit."

Wait a few hours for the finish to dry, or as directed on the finish instructions. You can make your own rustic finish by letting steel wool dissolve in white vinegar. This takes about two or three days in an open Mason jar. Filter the liquid through a paper towel, then wait a few additional hours until it turns an amber color. [5] X Research source"

Brush on two or three coats of polyurethane, letting the wood dry for 12+ hours between each coat. For best results, sand the table before each coat and wipe it off with a damp rag. Follow the safety instructions on the product. Work in a well-ventilated area or wear a respiratory mask. Use a well-made brush in good condition to avoid losing bristles in the polyurethane."
