Some of these medications, like ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory), does not require a prescription and can be taken several times a day. The following medications have been known to relieve the pain and inflammation caused by arthritis: [2] X Research source Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — otherwise known as NSAIDs, these types of medication include ibuprofen (e.g Advil) and acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol). Most NSAIDs are available in some form as over-the-counter medications, but you can also get a prescriptions for stronger versions of NSAIDS (i.e. Tylenol 3s and 4s, etc.) [3] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source Corticosteroids — mainly used to control inflammation.

[4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Analgesics — target only pain relief and do not control inflammation and include acetaminophen (i.e. Tylenol). Analgesics are also available in a cream form (e.g. Voltaren) and can be rubbed into the skin around the area that’s painful. Low level analgesics (like regular strength Tylenol) and a variety of the cream versions, are available over-the-counter. Stronger versions of analgesics are available by prescription.

      "content": "Splint your hands and/or wrists. Splints can also be used on your hands and wrists in addition to, or instead of, medication or injections. A splint will help support and stabilize your hand or wrist in order to reduce the stress placed upon it by certain activities. [10] X Research source Splints are normally worn for a limited time every day, as opposed to all day, every day. Most arthritis sufferers tend to use splints when performing specific activities which may cause them more pain, such as typing, driving, painting, gardening, etc."

      "title": "Consider surgery for your affected hand.",
      "content": "Consider surgery for your affected hand. Unfortunately medications and injections do not always work as well as we’d like. Another option to consider is hand surgery. The exact type of surgery will be catered to your specific situation, but the main goal of the surgery is to reduce the pain over the long-term. [11] X Research source [12] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source Surgery where the joint can be saved or reconstructed is always the first, and best, option. However, if it isn’t possible to save the joint as is, your doctor may perform a joint replacement or a fusion. Fusing the joint(s) together can significantly reduce the amount of pain you experience, but it will permanently remove any movement you have in that joint. The fact that the joint cannot move is how the pain is eliminated, as the joint can no longer rub together. Joint replacement involves replacing your original joint with a man-made joint. Man-made joints usually consist of plastic, metals or ceramic and can last a very long time. A joint replacement will not only eliminate the pain you’re experiencing, but it will allow you to continue to use your hand normally."

      "content": "Attend after surgery hand therapy. No matter what type of surgery you may have, you will need to perform hand therapy (a type of physical therapy) afterwards. Initially after surgery you may be asked to wear a splint full-time in order to limit the movement of your hand while it heals. You may also need to change the activities you perform until your hand or wrist is strong enough. [13] X Research source Most people can recommence normal activities approximately 3 months after surgery. However, the speed of your recovery is high dependent on the effort you put towards taking care of your hand or wrist."

In fact, many arthritis sufferers usually experience more pain in cold environments and find keeping their hands or wrists warm all the time (e.g. wearing gloves) can help relieve pain.

They have been shown to reduce the amount of pain and stiffness in people who have osteoarthritis, but they do not work on everyone. You may want to try taking these supplements for 2 months to see if they have a positive effect on your hand or wrist pain. If they do not give you any relief, there is no point in continuing to take them. Note that glucosamine and chondroitin manufacturers claim these supplements can help rebuild cartilage in your joints. However, there have been no scientific studies to confirm this is an accurate claim and these supplements are not approved by the FDA for that purpose."
