      "title": "Tell your parents that you will be celebrating your birthday at school.",
      "content": "Tell your parents that you will be celebrating your birthday at school. If you don't have a large allowance, your caretakers are the ones that pay for your birthday celebration. They will need to buy the decorations, cake/s, invitations, and other materials. Tell your parents beforehand of your plans so they don't need to rush to the store to buy things. Decide on what small goodies to give to your classmates, the decorations, the cake, the invitations, and other things you may need for your birthday. Make sure there are no possible foods that could give your classmates serious allergic reactions. Some allergic reactions can cause comas and death. Ask your teacher beforehand (a few weeks before the celebration) to see what classmates are allergic to. You'll need to buy milk-free, nut-free, egg-free, seafood-free, or other products that don't have your classmates' allergens. If you want to celebrate your birthday at lunchtime, foods like pizza, sandwiches, burgers, and other individual lunch foods are a good idea. You could also bring dessert along with lunch if you want. If you're not celebrating during a mealtime, you only need to bring desserts. You don't need to bring lunch and dessert. Put small items like bracelets, pencils, mini slime kits, pens, fidget spinners, small sticker kits, necklaces, erasers, mini notepads, fidget cubes, toy race cars, mini Play-Doh jars, mini Lego kits, small dolls, and other small items into goodie bags. Goodie bags are supposed to be small, so put items that will fit into the bags. You can also add candy bars and lollipops into the goodie bags. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Tell your friends about your birthday.",
      "content": "Tell your friends about your birthday. If you have good friends (not toxic ones) it's a good idea to tell them about your birthday. If you have told them what day your birthday is, you don't need to do this step. If you haven't told them, you should tell them a few weeks beforehand for them to be prepared, or at least eagerly waiting. Slightly hint at your birthday in conversation. Say something like, \"Wow, it's August! That means my birthday's coming soon! I'm pretty excited for it.\" or \"Time really does fly. I'm turning 14 in a few weeks.\". You don't need to spill the beans and talk about your birthday celebrations beforehand. Just calmly let your friends know that your birthday's coming soon."

      "title": "Talk to your teacher about your birthday.",
      "content": "Talk to your teacher about your birthday. The school you go to usually collects your personal info, like your name, birth date, gender, and caretakers. Your teacher may or may not know your birthday. Talk to your teacher about your birthday beforehand so the teacher can make accommodations in the school schedule. Tell your teacher the time to celebrate your birthday, what you will do to celebrate it at school, and other needed details."

      "title": "Bring in the supplies when the scheduled time for your birthday celebration comes.",
      "content": "Bring in the supplies when the scheduled time for your birthday celebration comes. Chances are that you have gotten food, drinks, and goodies to bring to school for your birthday. Bring these in by yourself, ask a classmate for help, or help your parents bring in the supplies to celebrate (if your parents are at your school). If you scheduled your celebration for 10 AM, bring the supplies in the classroom or outside, depending on the break time. Set the food, goodies, and drinks on a table. If there isn't a table, you can ask the teacher to bring one."

      "title": "Tell your teacher to let your classmates sing \"Happy Birthday\" to you.",
      "content": "Tell your teacher to let your classmates sing \"Happy Birthday\" to you. The \"Happy Birthday\" song is a perfect song for birthdays. You can tell your teacher this beforehand, before the main celebrations take place. Let your classmates and best friends join in in singing \"Happy Birthday\" to you! Sometimes, students like adding a funny phrase at the end of \"Happy Birthday\". This is usually a phrase like, \"Eat more cake!\". Allow them to do this if it doesn't get too far (it doesn't get to bullying or mocking you)."

      "content": "Serve each student one piece of food. If you have individual small pieces of food. Serve one piece of food for each classmate. If you have a large piece of food, cut it up into small slices. If there are leftovers, you can ask classmates if they want seconds. For now, don't serve more than one to each student."

      "title": "Bring in drinks if there are any.",
      "content": "Bring in drinks if there are any. Many students buy drinks to celebrate their birthday. These are refreshing to drink after the main meal/dessert. The type of drink depends- many students choose soda or fruit juice. You could also bring plain bottled water for a healthier option. Give each student one drink. Unless they are really thirsty, there's no need to give them more."

      "content": "Bring goodie bags to your classmates. Many students do this during their birthday. You can get presents on the weekend or after school. For now, bring the goodie bags to your classmates. Give each classmate one goodie bag. If some of your classmates don't like the goodie bags, don't worry. They are the ones being impolite and ungrateful. Besides, you can't please everyone. No one has the same thoughts, and some people are harder to please than others."

      "title": "Plan a bigger birthday party on the weekend.",
      "content": "Plan a bigger birthday party on the weekend. School still can't give you a large birthday party, since you still have to learn. School isn't an ideal place to party and do fun things. You probably don't have time to play party games and hang out during the school day. So, plan your birthday party on the weekend in addition to the small celebration at school. Invite your classmates. Invite your best friends and other good classmates to socialize and have an awesome time! Avoid inviting mean or rude classmates. You can tell if they are mean or rude if they criticized you during your birthday party celebration at school."
