      "content": "Gather eight 8 ft (2.4 m) logs that are about 12 inches (30 cm) thick. These will be the main, floating logs that make the raft's body. Great choices of wood include cottonwood, poplar, and spruce. Don't use heavy, dense woods, such as oak, or they won’t float. [1] X Research source Find your logs in a forest or buy them from a logger. If you're in a forest but can't identify trees, choose logs that feel lighter compared to others. Use a handsaw to cut down longer logs until they are about 8 feet (240 cm) long. You can also use a hatchet to chop down saplings. Don’t use logs that feel heavy. It means that they are waterlogged and won't float as well."

      "content": "Find two 9 ft (2.7 m) logs that are about 6 inches (15 cm) thick. These will be the connecting logs, which you'll be placing across the body of your raft. You need the extra length so that you can secure the ropes to them. Use the same type of wood that you did for the main logs."

      "title": "Remove the knots and bark with a hatchet.",
      "content": "Remove the knots and bark with a hatchet . While removing the bark is not absolutely necessary, removing the knots, stubs, and smaller branches is. If you don't do this, then the raft won't fit together as nicely. [2] X Research source Use a hatchet to hack off the little knots, stubs, and branches stemming off of your logs. If you are camping, consider saving the bark and knots for kindling."

    {
      "title": "Cut notches into the logs if you have the time.",
      "content": "Cut notches into the logs if you have the time. This is not completely necessary, but it is highly recommended because it will help the logs fit together better. Use a hatchet to make 2 in (5.1 cm) deep notches into both ends of each log. Make sure that the notches span the width of the log and are about 1 to 1 1 ⁄ 2 feet (30 to 46 cm) from the ends. Make sure that the notches are on the same side of each log, sort of like those you'd use to make a log cabin. Alternatively, flatten the entire side of each log with a hatchet.

    {
      "title": "Varnish the logs",
      "content": "Varnish the logs , if desired. This will help make the wood water-tight and keep it from rotting. Use a brush to apply 3 to 5 thin coats of varnish, allowing each coat to dry to the touch before applying the next. After you've applied the last coat, wait for the varnish to dry and cure completely. This may take a few days. [4] X Research source You don’t have to do this, but it can help make your raft last longer, especially if you plan on using it more than once."

    {
      "title": "Bring your logs into the water.",
      "content": "Bring your logs into the water. You need to go far enough from the shore so that logs can float; about calf-deep should be fine. Not only will this make it easier to assemble the logs, but you won't have to drag the completed raft across dry land. Roll the logs towards the body of water. You can also drag them by hand, or pull them with rope. If the logs are too heavy for you, ask a friend to help you bring them into the water. You don't have to bring all of the logs into the water, but have them close by so that you can easily grab them."

Orient them horizontally so that they make an equals (=) sign. [5] X Research source Make the logs about 8 feet (2.4 m) apart. You are using your 8 ft (2.4 m) long, 10 to 12 in (25 to 30 cm) thick logs for this."

Place these logs about 12 inches (30 cm) from the ends of the floater logs. Move the floater logs closer or further from each other until the ends of the connector logs stick out by about 6 inches (15 cm). If you flattened 1 side on each log, make sure that the flat sides are touching. [6] X Research source If you cut notches into the logs, then make sure that the notches are facing each other so that they fit."

Cross it over the longer end of the rope to create a slant. Bring it under the connecting log, then pull it under the slanted rope. Give it a pull to tighten the knot. [7] X Research source The short end of your rope needs to be long enough to wrap around the circumference of your connecting log 2 to 3 times."

You may have to slide them a little to the left or right so that they are not crooked."
