      "title": "Develop your interest in high school.",
      "content": "Develop your interest in high school. Maybe you have always been fascinated by numbers and how formulas explain the world in which we live. If you think mathematics might be something you want to pursue further, focus on your math courses in high school. Ask your teachers for extracurricular activities you can participate in to hone your math skills, such as quiz bowl or mathletes. Try to solve this classical problem: A Pythagorean triple is three whole numbers a,b,c with a 2 + b 2 = c 2 , such as 3,4,5 with 3 2 = 9, 4 2 = 16, 5 2 = 25, and 9 + 16 = 25. Find other examples; find a formula to generate more and more of them; finally find all possible such a,b,c. Make the problem not something you learn about, but something you understand for yourself (along with friends). Compete in mathematics competitions such as the International Mathematical Olympiad.

      "content": "Be persistent. Math is not a subject that you can just sit down and memorize. Many of the concepts take time to fully understand. Do not be discouraged if you don’t comprehend right away. [4] X Expert Source Daron Cam Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 29 May 2020. If you are easily discouraged by complex problems, mathematics may not be the right field for you. [5] X Research source When learning math, don’t just memorize formulas. Think about the problem itself and try to figure out a way to solve it. At a higher level, you can't rely on memorizing question formats and regurgitating facts—rather, you need to understand why principles work and apply your skills to new and abstract scenarios. Think of math not as a set of isolated formulae but as a deeply interconnected discipline."

      "content": "Seek out a small study group or private tutor. [6] X Expert Source Daron Cam Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 29 May 2020. There are some very easy concepts in math and there are some very difficult ones. While self-study and online tutorials are helpful, you cannot become a mathematician all on your own. Find a like-minded group of peers that you can study with or study one-on-one with a professional math tutor. If you are still in high school, ask one of your teachers if they know of any groups that you can join. If you are at the college level, find a math club or society to join."

    {
      "title": "Read mathematical journals and books.",
      "content": "Read mathematical journals and books. While it is important to stay current on what is happening today, it is equally as important to read about the history of mathematics and how it developed. Study the original papers and proofs that were developed hundreds of years ago to obtain a solid foundation in the subject. [8] X Research source Many mathematical proofs and concepts have evolved and been simplified over time. Reading the original paper will help you understand how it has been streamlined to the form in which it exists today."

    {
      "title": "Be passionate about math.",
      "content": "Be passionate about math. In order to stay properly motivated, you must have a passion for what you are doing. If you are not motivated by the idea of discovery or working through a problem, you will be easily discouraged in your studies. Don’t try to force your passion. If it’s not something you truly love, it is not likely to magically become something you love. On the flip side, you may be passionate, but lack inherent skill. Math may not come easily to you, but if you love it and are willing to put in the necessary time and effort, you can become a good mathematician."

      "content": "Take a walk. When you have encountered a particularly difficult concept, oftentimes, it is best to put it to the back of your mind for a bit. Let your brain chew on the problem without pencil and paper and see if you can come up with an interesting solution. [11] X Research source Even if you don’t come up with a groundbreaking new theory, taking some time out of your day to enjoy nature is a productive use of your time."

      "title": "Question everything.",
      "content": "Question everything. When looking at something that is said to be true, see if you can prove it. If someone tells you something is true, ask them to prove it to you. Trying to prove something to yourself will help you exercise your math brain and start thinking about all math problems in this way. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Study logic.",
      "content": "Study logic. Logic is the foundation of a mathematical argument and necessary to developing a proper proof. There are self-study guides online or textbooks you can purchase to study logic. You can also sign up to take a logic course at the local college. Spend time working through logic problems and cultivating that type of thought process. Logic will help you write proofs in an ordered way that people won’t be able to find error with."

    {
      "title": "Write in sentences.",
      "content": "Write in sentences. Although it may seem strange to use sentences to explain equations and numbers, a proper mathematical proof is written out in a grammatically correct sentence. If you can’t write your argument in a sentence, you may not fully understand what you are trying to say and need to think about it more. [13] X Research source When writing a proof, always write in full sentences. Study old proofs to get an idea of the proper format to use."

      "title": "Rewrite statements with the contrapositive.",
      "content": "Rewrite statements with the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement “If A, then B” is “If not B, then not A”. As an example, the contrapositive of the statement “If I’m from New York, I am American” is “If I am not American, I am not from New York”. The contrapositive is always true which can sometimes be difficult to wrap your head around. [14] X Research source Always rewrite statements with the contrapositive to exercise that thought process."

      "title": "Ask yourself about the converse of a statement.",
      "content": "Ask yourself about the converse of a statement. The converse of a statement such as “If A, then B” is “If B, then A”. The converse is not necessarily a true statement. When studying a problem, always ask yourself if the converse is true and then try to prove it. Even if it’s not true, it’s a good exercise to keep in mind when thinking about problems.
