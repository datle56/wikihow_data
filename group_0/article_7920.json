      "content": "These floor treatments can damage vinyl. Spirit solvent waxes may seem like an ideal solution for a greasy vinyl floor. These products are designed to break down oils and grease while also giving your floor an attractive sheen. Unfortunately, these waxes are unsafe for use on vinyl. If you want to clean your vinyl floor with a wax-based cleaner, check the label to make sure it doesn’t contain spirit solvents. Some floor waxes are safe to use on a vinyl floor. Look for a water-emulsion wax, or one that’s labeled for use on vinyl, PVC, or “resilient flooring.” Some spirit solvents, such as mineral spirits, are okay on their own for minor cleanup jobs. However, they’re damaging to vinyl in leave-on products like floor waxes."
