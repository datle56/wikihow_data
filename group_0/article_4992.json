      "title": "Determine the final size.",
      "content": "Determine the final size. This will make a big difference in your construction, materials, and of course, cost. Also consider that a full-sized replica will be incredibly heavy, so you'll want to build it in place. For this article, the measurement used is referred to simply as \"units\" rather than inches or meters. For example, instead of 1 inch or 1 cm, the article uses the abbreviation 1u . This will be the basis for all the relative dimensions you will need to calculate the final sizes. If your TARDIS is to be 4 cm square, then everything is multiplied by 4. For example, say that the vertical posts on each corner are 2u high by .1u square. Multiply everything by 4, and the final dimensions will be 8cm x .4cm x .4cm."

For the balance of this article, it is assumed that you're building a scale replica. If you wish to build the full-sized version, be sure to build securely, using screws and braces as necessary."

If it’s going to stay where you build it, make sure the ground is level and not subject to moisture. Lay down a tarp if necessary. Base = 1u square x .2u high."
