      "title": "Build a bonfire.",
      "content": "Build a bonfire. Lighting a bonfire is one of the most honored Samhain traditions. The fire symbolizes the welcoming of a new season--winter. Choose a place that is far away from buildings and trees to light your fire. Make sure the area is free from debris and sheltered from gusts of wind. The bonfire can be the beginning of your evening of communing with your departed loved ones. Invite friends and family to join you, and hold hands around the fire. You can also sing and dance. This invites the spirits into your celebration. You can also tell stories around the campfire. This is a great time to share memories of your loved ones who have died. Check with the local authorities to make sure the location you have chosen is a place where bonfires are legal. If you can't build a bonfire in your area, you can use candlelight to observe the ritual of lighting a fire to welcome the new season."

      "title": "Have a silent supper.",
      "content": "Have a silent supper. A silent, or \"dumb\" supper is part of Samhain celebrations around the world. This dinner honors the dead, and the participants are mainly silent. This dinner is one of the more somber aspects of Samhain celebrations. Make your dining area a sacred space. You might want to smudge the room with sage. You should also remove cell phones, televisions, and other electronics. Many people choose to leave younger children out of this part of the celebration, as they typically have a hard time remaining silent for an entire meal. Set a place at the head of the table but do not have one of your guests sit there. Reserve this place for the spirits you wish to honor. You and your guests should remain silent throughout the meal until you all leave the dining room."

      "title": "Honor the dead.",
      "content": "Honor the dead. The main purpose of Samhain is to remember the departed and acknowledge that everyone will eventually face death. In addition to a silent dinner, there are several ways that you can honor the dead during your Samhain celebration. One way is to create an altar. A ritual altar is somewhere that you can place items dedicated to the deceased. Some common items are photographs or personal items of the person you are honoring. You might also choose to offer apples or pomegranates. To Wiccans, apples are the fruit of death, while pomegranates are the fruit of life. This represents the balance between the two that Samhain celebrates."

      "content": "Hold a divination ceremony. Many Wiccans seek divine guidance through a variety of methods. Samhain, with its inherent spirituality, is the perfect time to practice your favorite form of divination. You can use Tarot, runes, or Scrying to seek guidance.

Or find out if there is a local Wiccan ritual that you can join. Today's modern celebrations often include giving back to others. One popular idea is to have a Samhain coat drive.
