      "title": "Four-Seam Fastball Grip",
      "content": "Four-Seam Fastball Grip The four-seam fastball is one of the fastest, straightest pitches in a pitcher’s arsenal. Hold the baseball so your the tips of your index and middle fingers rest across either side of the horseshoe-shaped seam, with the curved part of the horseshoe facing your ring finger. Place your thumb on the bottom of the baseball—ideally, in between the horseshoe seams. [1] X Research source Grip tip: For this pitch, hold the ball loosely, like it’s an egg. The less friction that your hand creates on the ball, the faster it will go. Try to leave a little gap between the ball and your palm. For the throw: Try to “yank” down on the ball right before you release it. This is what creates backspin, which means the ball spins from bottom to top. [2] X Research source Change it up: In a standard grip, your index and middle fingers will be about 1 in (2.5 cm), but some pitchers prefer a closer grip (with the fingers touching) or a wider grip (with the fingers spread as wide as possible)."

    {
      "title": "Two-Seam Fastball Grip",
      "content": "Two-Seam Fastball Grip To throw a two-seam fastball, place the tips of your index and middle fingers on the parallel seams, right at the spot where they’re narrowest. Place your thumb between the narrow seams on the bottom of the ball. [3] X Research source Grip tip: Keep the ball a little deeper in your hand than you would for a four-seam fastball. Change it up: Try moving your thumb a little further up the side of the ball, or rotate the ball so your middle finger rests on the seam. [4] X Research source Ball action: This pitch has more movement than a four-seam fastball, usually drifting toward the side of your throwing hand. It’s also a little slower than four-seamers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slider Grip",
      "content": "Slider Grip Sliders are the fastest pitch after fastballs. The grip for throwing a slider is almost identical to throwing a two-seam fastball—place your index and middle fingers on top of the ball and your thumb underneath the ball. But hold the ball slightly off-center, so you’re gripping the outer third of the ball. When you throw, keep your wrist steady. Grip tip: Try to push the ball off the thumb side of your index finger to increase the spin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Curveball Grip",
      "content": "Curveball Grip Price says, “for a basic curveball grip, hold the ball so your middle finger is along and on top of one seam and your thumb is on the ball making contact with the opposite seam.” When you’re just starting to learn the curveball, leave your index finger straightened. When you throw the ball, snap your hand so your middle finger points downward and your index finger points at the batter. [5] X Research source Grip tip: According to Price, “the key to throwing a good curveball is to have a tight grip on the baseball.” Ball action: Curveballs have topspin, so they move downward. Level up: Price says you may get a better break with a spiked curve (also called a knuckle curve). He says to “dig the fingernail of your index finger into the seam in front of it. This will give you three fingers all gripping the ball tightly on the seams, which will give you a tighter spin when you throw the pitch.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Sinker",
      "content": "Sinker To throw a sinker , Price says to start the way you would to throw a two-seam fastball, with your index and middle fingers on top of the ball and your thumb on the bottom. Then, he says, “rotate the ball slightly counterclockwise, so your middle fingertip crosses over one seam and your index fingertip is not on any seams. Put pressure on the seam with your middle finger, so when you throw it, the ball will rotate on that single seam.” Grip tip: “Make sure your fingers stay on top of the baseball when you throw it,” instructs Price. “This will give the sinker the proper spin it needs to drop. If you end with your fingers on the side of the ball when you release it, you won’t be throwing a sinker—you’ll be throwing a rolling curveball, which is a lot easier for a hitter to square up.” Ball action: Sinkers are a fast pitch, but not as fast as a four-seam fastball. However, they drop more, so they’re more likely to force the batter to hit ground balls. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Cutter Grip",
      "content": "Cutter Grip To throw a cutter , hold the ball like you would for a fastball, but with your middle and index finger toward the side of the ball. If you’re right-handed, place your fingers toward the right side of the ball, and if you’re left-handed, toward the left side. [7] X Research source Ball action: When thrown properly, a cutter will “cut” away from the hitter, which means it moves toward the pitcher’s glove side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Three-Finger Changeup Grip",
      "content": "Three-Finger Changeup Grip To throw a three-finger changeup, place your ring, middle, and index fingers on top of the baseball and your pinky and thumb on the bottom. Hold the ball deep in your hand. [8] X Research source Grip tip: Touching your pinky and thumb together at the bottom of the ball can help you get a good feel for this grip. Ball action: Even though you’ll use the same arm mechanics as you would for a fastball pitch, this pitch is much slower, which can throw off a batter. Level up: Once you get the hang of this pitch, try rotating your hand like you’re giving a thumbs-down while you throw."

    {
      "title": "Circle Changeup Grip",
      "content": "Circle Changeup Grip To throw a circle changeup, make a circle with your thumb and index finger so the tip of your index rests just below the first knuckle on your thumb. Tuck the baseball into your other three fingers, then use the pad of your thumb to grip it into place. [9] X Research source Grip tip: As you throw, imagine that you’re throwing the circle made by your thumb and index finger at the batter. Ball action: Like a three-finger changeup, your arm mechanics are similar to a fastball, but this ball goes slower—which just might strike out a batter if they’re expecting the ball to come in hot."

    {
      "title": "Splitter Grip",
      "content": "Splitter Grip To throw a splitter—or a split-finger fastball—place your index and middle fingers on either side of the horseshoe seam, with your thumb and ring finger resting on the bottom of the ball. Squeeze the ball firmly. When you throw, keep your index and middle fingers upward, directing the inside of your wrist toward the batter. [10] X Research source Grip tip: The splitter is considered an advanced grip because you need to have big hands to hold the ball this way. Ball action: Splitters have a downward movement as they travel toward the plate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Palmball",
      "content": "Palmball “For a palmball,” says Price, “reach into your glove like you normally would to grip the ball. But instead of holding it with your fingers, move the ball back into your palm so your fingers don’t make contact with the ball.” Grip tip: In a palmball grip, try to center the ball between your middle and ring fingers. Use your index and ring fingers for balance. [11] X Research source Ball action: Price says that “a palmball is a very effective changeup-type pitch.” Like other changeups, this one goes slower than a batter might expect."

    {
      "title": "Sweeper Grip",
      "content": "Sweeper Grip There are some variations of this grip, but it’s usually held like a traditional two-seam fastball. As you throw, rotate your hand to put side-spin on the ball. This one can take some practice to master. [12] X Research source Ball action: A sweeper is a type of slider, but it has more horizontal movement."

    {
      "title": "Knuckleball",
      "content": "Knuckleball Knuckleballs are a fairly rare pitch—they’re hard to throw, but when thrown properly, they’re even harder to hit. To throw a knuckleball , curl your fingers so your knuckles grip the ball, rather than your fingertips. If that’s uncomfortable, dig your fingernails into the ball so your knuckles are just above the leather. [13] X Research source Ball action: Knuckleballs don’t have much spin, which can cause them to move"
    },
    {
      "title": "Forkball",
      "content": "Forkball Forkballs are one of the rarest pitches in baseball. To throw a forkball, wedge the baseball as deep as you can between your index and middle fingers. Snap your wrist downward as you release. [14] X Research source Ball action: Forkballs have a significant downward motion."
    },
    {
      "title": "Screwball",
      "content": "Screwball Along with forkballs, screwballs are considered one of the rarest baseball pitches. To throw a screwball , grip the ball like you would for a two-seam fastball. But as you throw, snap your wrist so your palm faces your glove side. This can be an awkward movement and is pretty tiring on a pitcher’s arm, which is probably why it isn’t thrown more often. [15] X Research source Ball action: When thrown properly, a screwball will have similar movement to a curveball, but going in the opposite direction. Change it up: This one is more about the arm action than how you hold the ball, so play around with the grip to see what works for you. For instance, some pitchers prefer to wrap their whole hand around a ball for a screwball."

      "title": "Minor adjustments in how you hold the ball can affect how it moves.",
      "content": "Minor adjustments in how you hold the ball can affect how it moves. Understanding exactly how to tweak your grip can be difficult, which is one reason it’s so important to work with a good baseball coach if you want to master pitching. But when you’re practicing on your own, try to notice how the following affect the speed, rotation, and movement of the ball: Tilt and ball position: The way your fingers rest on the ball will have a big impact on how it leaves your hand. If you’re gripping the seams, you’ll generate more friction, which can slow the ball down or add more spin. If you’re holding the leather, the ball will leave your hand more smoothly. Fingertip pressure: The pressure from your fingers will also impact friction. If you’re trying to create a lot of spin, you might dig your fingernails into the seams, but if you’re trying to throw a fastball, holding the ball gently will allow it to leave your hand with more speed. Thumb position: Moving your thumb slightly up on the ball when you’re throwing a fastball can create more spin, although it may slightly decrease the speed. [16] X Research source Finger positions: You may find that it’s more comfortable to hold the ball with your middle and index fingers closer together or spread further apart. Practice to see what gives you the most control over the ball."

      "content": "Practice as much as you can. “If you want to be a good pitcher,” Hess affirms, “start by practicing basic mechanics. Pick your knees up, keep your elbow up, and follow all the way through the throw.” Don’t be afraid to experiment. Hess says that “there’s no one right way to grip a baseball. You can have multiple grips, and there are variations on every grip.”"

      "title": "Try exercises to build up your pitching arm.",
      "content": "Try exercises to build up your pitching arm. Hess explains that “resistance bands are what most pitchers use to take care of their pitching arm.” He recommends the following exercises: Front raises: “Grab the resistance band with your palm facing inward,” instructs Hess, “then lift your arm from your thigh straight up in front of you.” Side raises: “If you’re working your left arm, hold the band, then lift your arm straight up and to the left,” says Hess. For the right arm, lift your arm straight up and to the right. Sword draws: Hess says to “put the band under your right foot and grab from your right hip pocket. Then, bring it up and to the left of your body like you’re taking a sword out of its holster.”"

      "content": "Study the grips used by pros. When you’re watching baseball, pay attention to how your favorite pitchers hold the ball. If there’s a throw you really want to master, look carefully at the grip the pitcher uses, then try to copy it when you’re practicing. As you advance in the game, you can also record yourself practicing, then watch the film to see how to adjust your grip and arm mechanics."

      "title": "When in doubt, start with a fastball.",
      "content": "When in doubt, start with a fastball. Every pitcher needs a good fastball—they’re fast, accurate, and tough to hit. This will be your primary pitch. Experiment with a two-seam fastball and a four-seam fastball to see which you’re more confident with. Even though you’ll pitch mostly fastballs, it’s a good idea to master one or two other pitches, like a changeup and a curveball. That way, you can alternate your pitches so the batter won’t know what to expect."
