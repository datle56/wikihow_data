      "content": "Calculate work. In mechanical physics, work is the amount of force needed to move something over a selected distance. The formula for work is: [1] X Research source Work = Force ∗ Distance {\\displaystyle {\\text{Work}}={\\text{Force}}*{\\text{Distance}}} To understand this concept, think about a 100 pound cement block. Moving that block 2 feet requires twice as much work as moving the same block 1 foot. This is also the same amount of work required to move a 200 pound block for a distance of 6 inches (1/2 a foot)."

Moving that block 2 feet in 10 seconds requires twice as much power as moving the same block for the same distance in 20 seconds. Moving the same object faster requires more power."

      "content": "Determine the units you're using for work and power. You need to determine whether you are measuring work and power in traditional English units or in metric units. The English unit for work is the “foot-pound.” This comes from multiplying the distance measured in feet by the force measured in pounds. The unit for power comes from dividing by time, in seconds. The power unit is the “foot-pound per second.” A more familiar term is the “horsepower,” which is defined as 550 foot-pounds per second. [3] X Research source 1 Horsepower = 550 foot-pounds sec. {\\displaystyle 1{\\text{ Horsepower}}=550{\\frac {\\text{foot-pounds}}{\\text{sec.}}}} The metric unit for work is a joule. A joule is equal to one Newton-meter, which is the amount of work needed to move a 1 Newton force a distance of 1 meter. When you divide work by time, you get power, measured in units of joules per second. This is also called a Watt. 1 Watt = 1 Joule Sec. = 1 Newton-Meter Sec. {\\displaystyle 1{\\text{ Watt}}=1{\\frac {\\text{ Joule}}{\\text{ Sec.}}}=1{\\frac {\\text{ Newton-Meter}}{\\text{ Sec.}}}}"

      "content": "Collect the available data. Whether you are solving a physics problem in class or are actually calculating power from a real-world application, you need to collect certain information first. You can learn the information that you need by reviewing the measurement units. For example, suppose you want to calculate in the following problem: A student doing chin-ups lifts his 150 lb. body a distance of 1.5 feet in 2 seconds. How much power is the student exerting? Force = 150 lbs. {\\displaystyle {\\text{Force}}=150{\\text{ lbs.}}} Distance = 1.5 feet {\\displaystyle {\\text{Distance}}=1.5{\\text{ feet}}} Time = 2 sec. {\\displaystyle {\\text{Time}}=2{\\text{ sec.}}}"

[4] X Research source Power = Force ∗ Distance Time {\\displaystyle {\\text{Power}}={\\frac {{\\text{Force}}*{\\text{Distance}}}{\\text{Time}}}} Power = 150 lb. ∗ 1.5 feet 2 sec. {\\displaystyle {\\text{Power}}={\\frac {150{\\text{lb.}}*1.5{\\text{feet}}}{2{\\text{sec.}}}}} Power = 225 ft-lb 2 sec. {\\displaystyle {\\text{Power}}={\\frac {225{\\text{ft-lb}}}{2{\\text{sec.}}}}} Power = 112.5 ft-lb sec. {\\displaystyle {\\text{Power}}=112.5{\\frac {\\text{ft-lb}}{\\text{sec.}}}} Since 1 horsepower equals 550 ft-lb/sec., this is about equal to one-fifth of a horsepower."

      "title": "Rewrite the formula for power.",
      "content": "Rewrite the formula for power. The original formula for power focuses on work, as a force times distance, and divides by the time it takes to do that work. Another way to consider the same components is as follows: [5] X Research source Power = Force ∗ Distance Time {\\displaystyle {\\text{Power}}={\\text{Force}}*{\\frac {\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}}} By grouping the terms differently, in this way, you should recognize that Distance Time {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}}} is another way of representing velocity. Therefore, you can conclude that: Power = Force ∗ Velocity {\\displaystyle {\\text{Power}}={\\text{Force}}*{\\text{Velocity}}} Consider a 2000 pound car. Moving that car at a speed of 50 miles per hour takes twice as much power as moving the same car at a speed of 25 miles per hour."

      "content": "Convert the units as needed. The units of power are generally calculated in either Watts, which are Joules/sec. or Newton-meters per second, or in horsepower (hp) or foot-pounds per second. Recall that 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/sec. If your situation or problem presents data in different units, you will have to convert. Some of the most useful conversion factors are: 1 mile = 5280 feet 1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds 1 kg = 9.8 N (force) For the moving car problem, the data is provided in miles, hours and pounds. You need to convert 50 miles into 50*5280=264,000 feet, and convert hours into 3600 seconds. Then you can restate the problem as calculating the power of moving a 2000 pound car at a velocity of 264,000/3,600 = 73.33 feet per second."

The voltage tells you how much electrical charge is being passed through a circuit. Just as moving a heavy block of cement requires great mechanical power, moving a high voltage requires a large electrical power output. Voltage is measured in units calls volts, abbreviated V. In equations, the voltage is represented by the symbol E. [7] X Research source [8] X Expert Source Daniel Stoescu Master Electrician Expert Interview. 16 August 2021. If you are reading a circuit diagram, the voltage will be written somewhere on the diagram. If you are building an actual circuit, the voltage is the power coming from the battery source. For example, a single 9 volt battery provides 9 volts to the circuit."
