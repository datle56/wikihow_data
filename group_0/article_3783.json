In order to be accepted in the military, you will need a high school diploma, although you might have an easier time advancing to a higher position if you have a college degree. If you want to become a police officer, you may need only a high school diploma, but an associate's or bachelor's degree in criminal justice or a related field might make you a more competitive candidate. College degrees are required in some jurisdictions, so check with your local department. A bachelor's degree is typically required in order to be considered for a job with a federal agency. There is no specific major required, but you should think about how your studies will benefit you in your future career. Possible majors include psychology, criminal justice, and international studies. [6] X Research source Even if a college degree is not needed for your chosen career path, it might benefit you, especially if you want to continue to advance in your career.
