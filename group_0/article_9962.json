      "content": "Purchase your misua noodles fresh or dry. Depending on whether you want to boil the noodles, you can purchase them dry or already cooked. Fresh noodles are already cooked, whereas dry noodles will need to be boiled before serving. [1] X Research source If the shop does not sell misua noodles, you can use Japanese somen noodles as a replacement. Fresh misua noodles do not need to be boiled and generally have an expiration date of several days or weeks after purchase. You can add them unboiled to most dishes."
