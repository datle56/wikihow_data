These component parts are usually expressed with a notation similar to that used to describe points in a coordinate system (e.g. <x,y,z>, etc.). If these pieces are known, adding or subtracting vectors is just a simple adding or subtracting the x, y, and z components. [1] X Research source Note that vectors can be 1, 2, or 3-dimensional. Thus, vectors can have an x component, an x and y component, or an x, y, and z component. Let's say that we have two 3-dimensional vectors, vector A and vector B. We might write these vectors in components as A = <Ax,Ay,Az > and B = <Bx,By,Bz>, using x y z components accordingly."

Vectors can be said to have a \"beginning point\" and an \"end point\". The \"sharp point\" of the arrow is the vector's head and the \"base\" of the arrow is the tail.

Whether you are adding/subtracting two vectors or a hundred, the vector stretching from the original starting point (the tail of your first vector) to end point of your final added vector (the head of your last vector) is the resultant vector, or the sum of all your vectors. [8] X Research source Note that this vector is identical to the vector obtained by adding the x,y, and perhaps z components of all the vectors separately. If you drew all of your vectors to scale, measuring all angles exactly, you can find the magnitude of the resultant vector by measuring its length. You can also measure the angle that the resultant makes with either a specified vector or the horizontal/vertical etc. to find its direction. If you didn't draw all vectors to scale, you probably need to calculate the magnitude of the resultant using trigonometry. You may find the Sine Rule and the Cosine Rule helpful here. [9] X Research source If you are adding more than two vectors together, it is helpful to first add two, then add their resultant with the third vector, and so on. See the following section for more information."

As noted above, assuming you drew your vectors accurately, your new vector's magnitude is its length and its direction is its angle relative to the vertical, horizontal, etc. Use the units of your added or subtracted vectors to choose the units for your resultant vector's magnitude.

      "content": "Use trigonometry to find a vector's components. To find a vector's components, it's usually necessary to know its magnitude and its direction relative to the horizontal or vertical and to have a working knowledge of trigonometry. Taking a 2-D vector first: set or imagine your vector as the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose other two sides are parallel to the x and y axes. These two sides can be thought of as head-to-tail component vectors that add to create your original vector. [12] X Research source The lengths of the two sides are equal to the magnitudes of the x and y components of your vector and may be calculated using trigonometry. [13] X Research source If x is the magnitude of the vector, the side adjacent to the vector's angle (relative to the horizontal, vertical, etc.) angle is xcos(θ) , while the side opposite is xsin(θ) . It's also important to note the direction of your components. If the component points in the negative direction of one of your axes, it is given a negative sign. For example, in a 2-D plane, if a component points to the left or downwards, it is given a negative sign. For example, let's say that we have a vector with a magnitude of 3 and a direction of 135 o relative to the horizontal. With this information, we can determine that its x component is 3cos(135) = -2.12 and its y component is 3sin(135) = 2.12"

[14] X Research source When you've found the components of all of your vectors, simply add their magnitudes together to find the components of your resultant vector. First, add all the magnitudes of the horizontal components (those parallel to the x-axis) together. Separately, add all the magnitudes of the vertical components (those parallel to the y-axis). If a component has a negative sign (-), its magnitude is subtracted, rather than added. The answers you obtain are the components of your resultant vector. For instance, let's say that our vector from the previous step, <-2.12, 2.12>, is being added to the vector <5.78, -9>. In this case, our resultant vector would be <-2.12+5.78, 2.12-9>, or <3.66, -6.88> ."

Since the triangle formed by our resultant vector and its components is a right triangle, we can use it to find our vector's length and therefore its magnitude. With c as the magnitude of the resultant vector, which you're solving for, set a as the magnitude of its x component and b as the magnitude of its y components. Solve with algebra. To find the magnitude of the vector whose components we found in the previous step, <3.66, -6.88>, let's use the Pythagorean Theorem. Solve as follows: c 2 =(3.66) 2 +(-6.88) 2 c 2 =13.40+47.33 c=√60.73 = 7.79"
