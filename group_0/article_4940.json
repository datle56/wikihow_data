      "title": "Leave your snake alone for the first week you have it.",
      "content": "Leave your snake alone for the first week you have it. When snakes are first introduced into a new home, it takes them some time to acclimate to their environment. Leave the snake in its tank while it takes the time to adjust. After a week, you can start interacting with your snake. If you’ve waited a week and your snake is still acting aggressive, wait for 3-4 more days before trying again."

      "title": "Rearrange your snake’s tank occasionally so it gets used to your presence.",
      "content": "Rearrange your snake’s tank occasionally so it gets used to your presence. Move its water dish, home, and any branches around the tank so your snake gets comfortable with you in its environment. Be careful not to touch your snake while you’re moving things. Use slow and deliberate movements so you don’t scare your snake. This will help it learn that you aren’t going to cause any harm. If your snake makes an S-shape with its neck while it’s looking at you, it may be getting into striking position. Pull your hand out slowly so your snake doesn’t try to bite you."

      "title": "Hold your hand in front of your snake’s head so it gets used to you.",
      "content": "Hold your hand in front of your snake’s head so it gets used to you. Snakes recognize things by smell, so your snake needs to get comfortable around your scent. Try holding your hand about 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) away from your snake’s head so it can smell you. If it gets into striking position, slowly move your hand out of the way. If your snake doesn’t react, try moving your hand closer. If you’re worried about bites and your snake is aggressive, consider wearing thick gloves as a layer of extra protection."
    },
    {
      "title": "Touch your snake while it’s still inside the tank.",
      "content": "Touch your snake while it’s still inside the tank. Once your snake is acclimated to its new environment, try lightly touching the back of its body near the tail. Put your hand in from the side rather than directly over the snake so it’s more comfortable. Slowly work closer to touching close behind its head. Avoid trying to touch the snake’s head right away since it might get scared and bite. Never try to grab your snake by its tail since it will most likely try to spin around and strike you."

      "title": "Continue familiarizing yourself with your snake for 1 week.",
      "content": "Continue familiarizing yourself with your snake for 1 week. Rearrange the tank once per day, and hold your hand in front of your snake 3-4 times at different times. Over a week’s time, your snake will get used to your presence and is less likely to strike or bite you when you try to handle it.

      "content": "Scoop your snake up by the middle of its body. Slide your hand underneath your snake’s body halfway between its head and tail. [3] X Expert Source Jeff Jensen Reptile Specialist Expert Interview. 8 April 2021. Squeeze your snake lightly until you have a firm grip around its body. Slowly and confidently pick the snake up and out of its enclosure, using your other hand to support the rest of its body. Don’t try to act nervous or timid while you pick up your snake because it will be able to sense your body language. Instead, stay consistent and firm so your snake gets used to being handled."

      "title": "Intertwine the back third of your snake around your arm or fingers.",
      "content": "Intertwine the back third of your snake around your arm or fingers. While supporting the middle of the snake’s body with one hand, let the back end rest on top of your arm and in your hand. Wrap larger snakes around your arm and smaller snakes in between your fingers so it doesn’t flail around while you’re holding them. [4] X Research source If you have a constrictor snake, such as a ball python or a boa, let it wrap around your arm so it feels comfortable. If you have a thinner snake, like a garter or corn snake, keep the back of the snake wrapped between your fingers so it's less likely to slither away. If your snake is larger than 4 ft (1.2 m) long, have another person help hold it for every additional 3 ft (0.91 m)."

      "title": "Point the snake’s head away from your body.",
      "content": "Point the snake’s head away from your body. Snakes may try to strike anything that moves quickly in front of their heads, so avoid keeping your snake pointed towards your body when you first start handling it. Guide the snake’s head in the opposite direction by pushing on its neck with your arm. Use slow and confident movements so your snake gets used to the behavior. [5] X Research source As your snake gets more comfortable around you, it’s okay to let your snake look in your direction. Just make sure to watch for any striking behavior."

      "content": "Sit near your snake’s tank often so it can get used to your scent. When you aren’t handling your snake, try to spend time in front of its tank so it stays familiar with your scent. This will help your snake grow accustomed to you so it will know not to strike while you’re around. The more familiar you are with your snake, the less aggressive it will be over time. Make sure to spend at least a few minutes near your tank each day."
