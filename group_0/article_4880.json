      "title": "Cut the joists to the intended width of your shed.",
      "content": "Cut the joists to the intended width of your shed. Joists are the cross-beams that will lie on the ground and hold together the outer framing of the floor. Use 2x6 lumber for the joists. For example, if you’re building a 12 by 16 feet (3.7 m × 4.9 m) shed, cut each of your joists to 16 feet (4.9 m). Use a circular saw to cut the joists. [1] X Research source If you’d rather not cut the joists yourself, you could have the lumber cut at the hardware store from which you bought the lumber. Take safety precautions when using a circular saw. Wear protective eyewear, always cut away from yourself, and never set the circular saw down while the blade is still spinning. Use treated lumber for the joists since the lumber may be in direct contact with the earth."

      "title": "Lay out the front and back beams of the floor.",
      "content": "Lay out the front and back beams of the floor. Use 2x6 treated lumber for these beams as well. The front and back beams will provide the outline of your shed’s floor. [2] X Research source If the beams aren’t already the intended length of your shed, use a circular saw to cut them to the shed’s length, e.g., 16 feet (4.9 m)."

      "title": "Fasten the joists to the floor beams using 3 ½-inch galvanized screws.",
      "content": "Fasten the joists to the floor beams using 3 ½-inch galvanized screws. Lay out each of your cut floor joists between the front and back flooring beams. Leave 14 inches (36 cm) between each of the floor joists. Once the joists are laid out, use a screwdriver to drive a 3 ½-inch screw through the front flooring board and into each joist. Then, drive screws through the back flooring board into each joist. [3] X Research source If you’re struggling to insert screws directly through the joist boards, drill a pilot hole to screw each screw into. The number of joists you’ll need will depend on the total length of your shed. If you’re building a shed with a width of 8 feet (2.4 m), you’ll only need 6 or 7 joists. If you’re building a larger shed with a width of 16 feet (4.9 m), you’ll need 13 or 14 joists."

      "title": "Attach 4 skid beams to the floor.",
      "content": "Attach 4 skid beams to the floor. The skid beams should be made of 4x4 treated lumber. Each skid beam should run the full length of the shed, e.g., 16 feet (4.9 m). This means that each skid beam will be the same length as the front and back floor planks. The photo shows the skid beams on top of the floor joists, but once attached they should be underneath supporting the entire weight of the shed. Cut the skids if necessary, and attach them across the joists using metal connectors. [4] X Research source Use treated lumber for the skid beams since the lumber will be in direct contact with the earth. Skids sit under the floor joists and provide a stable foundation for the shed to rest on. Skids rest directly on the earth, or on concrete foundation blocks. Either attach the skid beams as shown and then flip the entire floor over (HEAVY - this is at least a two-person operation), or lift up one side of the floor framing and slide the skid beams into position before attaching."

      "title": "Cover the framed floor with ¾-inch plywood.",
      "content": "Cover the framed floor with ¾-inch plywood. The plywood will form the flooring of the shed. Cut your ¾-inch plywood sheets so that they’ll fit together and seamlessly cover the framed flooring. Then, attach the plywood to the joists with 1 5/8-inch screws. Drive 1 screw into each skid beam every 1 foot (0.30 m). [5] X Research source Use treated or sealed plywood so that you don’t get splinters in your bare feet when walking on the flooring."

      "content": "Frame the shed’s 4 walls from 2x4 lumber. Frame each wall by nailing together 2 2x4 beams for the top and sides. The bottom of the wall should be a single 2x4 beam. Be sure to measure each beam before cutting or nailing them together so that the walls will be properly framed. [6] X Research source For example, let’s say you’re building a 12 by 16 feet (3.7 m × 4.9 m) shed. You’ll need to frame: 2 192 in × 81 in (490 cm × 210 cm) side walls. 1 144 in × 81 in (370 cm × 210 cm) back wall. 1 144 in × 81 in (370 cm × 210 cm) front wall"

      "content": "Attach joists at 22 inches (56 cm) intervals within each framed wall. Use a circular saw to cut the 2x4 beams to the correct height of 81 inches (210 cm). Then, attach the wall joists to the doubled-up 2x4s of the frame using 2 ½-inch screws. Drill a pilot hole before screwing in the screws to make them slide in a little easier. [7] X Research source The framed wall should approximately resemble the framed floor (before the plywood was put on)."

      "content": "Leave a 21 in (53 cm) gap in the front wall for your door . Regardless of the size of your shed, leave enough room for a standard-sized door so you won’t need to alter the size of the door. Double up 2 2x6 boards on either side of the door opening so that the gap will be reinforced. The doubled-up studs will also give you material to screw the doorframe into. [8] X Research source Once your shed is assembled, you can hang a door in the gap you’ve created in the front wall."

Lift up the 2 side walls and set them in place on the 2 sides of the framed floor, making sure that the edges and corners of the walls align with the edges of the floor. Then, drive 2 ½-inch screws through the bottom beams of the walls. Drive the screws directly into the floor. Space each screw 8 inches (20 cm) apart. [9] X Research source Use a level and a carpenter’s square throughout this process to ensure that the walls are level and all corners are square. [10] X Research source"

Raise the walls and set them in place in between the 2 side walls. Drive 2 ½-inch screws into the sides of the front and back walls where they butt up against the side walls every 8 inches (20 cm). Drive screws through the front and back walls’ bottom boards at the same distance. This will attach the front, back, and side walls all securely together, and also anchor the walls firmly to the floor. If you like, you can add vintage stained glass windows to make it look stylish.

Measure the final dimensions of each wall, and cut the siding to size using a circular saw. Then attach the cut siding to the walls with 2-inch nails. [12] X Research source Space the nails out by about 12 inches (30 cm), and drive them directly into the joists on each wall. Purchase siding at a local home-supply store or hardware store. You can choose the color of the siding. Since lean to sheds are primarily used for storage, you shouldn’t need to insulate the shed walls."

Since a side wall of the shed will be higher than the other side, you’ll need to construct a small add-on wall for the side. The add-on wall should be 192 inches (490 cm) wide, but only 34.75 inches (88.3 cm) tall. Frame the top, bottom, and sides of the wall using 2x4 lumber, and attach joists between the top and bottom every 22.5 inches (57 cm) using 3 ½-inch screws.

Then, use the circular saw to cut a 1 by 3.5 inches (2.5 cm × 8.9 cm) notch 10.25 inches (26.0 cm) from the top of each rafter. Cut another 1 by 4.25 inches (2.5 cm × 10.8 cm) notch 11.75 inches (29.8 cm) from the bottom of each rafter. [15] X Research source Use a circular saw to cut your rafters, and make sure that they’re all uniform. If you’re building a 12 by 16 feet (3.7 m × 4.9 m) shed, you’ll need 9 rafters."

Then, drive another 2-3 nails into the vertical joists on the side wall add-on. These ties will hold the rafters in place and also stop them from exerting downward pressure on the side walls of the lean to shed.

Use 1 5/8-inch screws to secure the plywood sections firmly in place. Drive screws straight down through the plywood and into the rafter beams. Space each screw out by 8 inches (20 cm). [20] X Research source To use gravity to your advantage, start nailing plywood to the roof at its lowest point. This way, gravity will pull the higher plywood sections into place. If you were to start nailing plywood at the highest point of the roof, gravity would pull lower portions off of the rafters."
