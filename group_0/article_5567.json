      "content": "Know how much the call will cost. International calls cost more than local ones do. Most phone carriers have information on their websites specifying how much it costs to call different countries/regions, but they won’t always tell you up front that you are making a more expensive call. Don’t forget to check with your carrier to avoid an unexpectedly high phone bill. Some phone carriers offer special plans to make international calls. If you’re going to make many calls to Kenya, ask your carrier if there are any such options. Several people benefit from buying prepaid cards for international calls. These cards come with a set amount of money loaded, so you know how much you’re paying and how long you have to call. Per-minute rates are often considerably cheaper on prepaid cards."
