Keep your back and neck straight and relaxed. [1] X Research source If you feel unstable while squatting, put one knee on the ground to steady yourself. Never bend at the waist to pick up your toddler. This can cause unnecessary strain on your back and makes lifting much more difficult."

      "content": "Use the muscles in your legs to stand and lift them off of the ground. Engage your leg and core muscles to slowly return to a standing position. Be sure to keep your back straight, and hold the toddler close to your body as you're standing up. [5] X Research source If you can, ask your toddler to hold onto you with their arms on your shoulders and legs around your waist awhile you stand. This will help keep them in place, and will allow you to use one of your hands to stabilize yourself with a wall or piece of furniture if necessary. Try to avoid twisting your back or torso while standing, which can cause an injury."

The easiest way to carry a toddler is at the front of your body, with their weight resting on your chest and arms. Keep your arms around their back and under their backside. [7] X Research source Having your child face backwards over your shoulder is a great position to soothe a toddler who is getting ready for nap time or bedtime. [8] X Expert Source Jessie Davidson Child Care Specialist Expert Interview. 7 July 2021. You can face your toddler forwards by supporting under the toddler’s bottom with one hand and putting your other hand across their chest. This position is great for playing with a toddler by pretending they are driving a car or flying an airplane. [9] X Expert Source Jessie Davidson Child Care Specialist Expert Interview. 7 July 2021. For extra support, ask your toddler to hold onto you with their legs. If possible, try to keep them from wrapping their arms around your neck, which can cause you to bend forward. If you need to shift your toddler to one side, wait until you're in a standing position, and use your arms to move them. Avoid twisting your back or torso to shift them to your side."

[10] X Expert Source Jessie Davidson Child Care Specialist Expert Interview. 7 July 2021. [11] X Research source The advantage of carrying your toddler on your hip is that it's easy to gently rock the toddler by swaying back and forth.

      "content": "Try on a few slings before purchasing one that is safe and comfortable. When searching for a sling at a specialty store or supermarket, look for a sling with a metal ring and sturdy fabric, such as cotton, wool, or tri-blend. Be sure to check the packaging and make sure your toddler is within the height and weight limit. If you're able to, try on the sling in the store with your toddler in it. [13] X Research source As a general rule, a well-fitting sling will be tight, and you will be able to look down and see that your toddler is close enough for you to kiss them. Their back should be well-supported and their head should be up with their chin off of their chest. Bring your toddler to the store with you and try out several slings with them to find the one that is the most comfortable for you both."

      "content": "Hold the ring of the sling with your non-dominant hand. Pick up the sling in your non-dominant hand as you hold the toddler to one side with your dominant arm. Make sure they're secure and in a comfortable position while you're getting ready to put the sling on. [14] X Research source If your toddler is squirmy or doesn't want to be held, wait until they calm down to put on the sling. You'll only have one arm available to hold them, which can be dangerous if they're trying to get to the ground."

      "content": "Put the ring over your head and onto the shoulder of your dominant hand. Position the sling so that it's draped across your body like a sash. The ring should be on the same side of your body as the toddler, while the bulk of the fabric rests on the opposite hip. [15] X Research source Using this technique, your toddler will be positioned on the side of your non-dominant hand, leaving your dominant hand free. If you'd prefer to have your non-dominant hand free, place the ring on that shoulder."

      "title": "Shift the toddler to the side of your body where the fabric of the sling is resting.",
      "content": "Shift the toddler to the side of your body where the fabric of the sling is resting. Using your arms, move the toddler across your body to the side where the fabric is resting. The fabric should dip below their backside, and their legs should be positioned in front of the fabric on the front of your body. [16] X Research source Try to keep both of your toddler's legs in front of your body to make positioning the sling easier. Once they're in the sling, they can adjust their legs to a position that is more comfortable."

      "title": "Reach your dominant hand through the sling and pull their feet through.",
      "content": "Reach your dominant hand through the sling and pull their feet through. Slide your hand under the fabric on the front of your body, and reach under your toddler's legs to pull the fabric out from underneath their body, and position it behind their backside. Use your non-dominant arm to help guide their legs through the loop in the fabric. [17] X Research source If your toddler isn't cooperating with this step, try slipping the fabric under one leg and then the other, rather than both at the same time. Try to keep the fabric bunched while you're sliding it out from under the toddler. This will make the process easier and prevent you and your toddler from getting tangled in the fabric."

      "content": "Use your hands to spread the fabric from the toddler's knees to their back. Once the sling is wrapped around both of you, pull the fabric up your toddler's back until it's just below their shoulder blades. Make sure the bottom portion is positioned behind their knees to offer the most support. [18] X Research source Leave the bottom half of your toddler's legs and feet outside of the sling so they can find a comfortable position."

Make sure you know the proper way to position the carrier, and where your toddler is supposed to sit. [20] X Research source The instructions can also include helpful tips for getting a comfortable fit and walking with the extra weight of a toddler on your back. There are a few different types of carriers. A carrier for hiking will require a different position than one for day-to-day use. It's best to try out several carriers with the toddler in the store before selecting one."

Use your arms to position them with the side of your body without a shoulder strap. Make sure the toddler has one leg in front of your body and one behind it. [22] X Research source Try not to twist your torso or back as you're moving the toddler. You can loosen the carrier or strain your back with too much movement."

      "content": "Lean forward and move the child between the carrier and your back. While you're bending at the waist, slowly push the child onto your back. Pull one of their legs to the side of the carrier with the strap on your shoulder as you move them with your free arm. Make sure their leg is through the hole on the strap side of the carrier. [23] X Research source It may be helpful to ask the child to hold onto your shoulders or neck for stability as you move them.

Pull the other strap over your shoulder, and make sure their legs are on out of the carrier on either side of your body. Use your hands to smooth the panel along their back, and bounce them slightly to move them higher onto your back.

Then, slowly straighten your back to shift the toddler's weight into the carrier. [25] X Research source The lower strap of the carrier should be secure around your waist, and should hit just below the toddler's backside. If they're lower in the carrier when you stand, lean over again and bounce them a few times to push them higher on your back. Then, tighten the waist strap and stand up."

      "content": "Use the shoulder straps to adjust the position of the toddler on your back. When you're standing, pull on the loose ends of the shoulder straps to tighten them and bring the toddler closer to your back. If you want them to lean away from your back slightly, pull on the buckles to loosen the straps. [26] X Research source As you walk, you may need to tighten or loosen the shoulder and chest straps. Never unbuckle the waist belt when your toddler is in the carrier, as this can cause them to slip out of the carrier."
