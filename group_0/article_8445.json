      "title": "Rinse and place your pipe in a sealable plastic bag or container.",
      "content": "Rinse and place your pipe in a sealable plastic bag or container. First, rinse the pipe, one hitter, or bong out with hot water to knock away any loose debris or resin. Then, carefully put your pipe into a zip-top plastic bag or a container with a sealable top. The bag or container must be sealable so the alcohol and salt mixture doesn’t leak out. [1] X Research source If your pipe or bong can be disassembled, take it apart and put the pieces, like the stem and bowl, into separate containers. You might also give it a quick initial scrub with a cotton swab or pipe cleaner to help the process along. This cleaning method works with any kind of glass or metal pipe. Don’t use it for acrylic, glass, wood, bone, ceramic, or plastic pipes."

      "content": "Cover the pipe with alcohol and add 2-3 tbsp (17-51 g) of table salt. Pour isopropyl alcohol, which helps loosen resin and kills bacteria, slowly into the bag or container until your pipe is completely submerged. Then, add a couple generous spoonfuls of table salt, which acts as a gentle abrasive. Give the container a gentle shake to make sure the liquid and salt enters the pipe. [2] X Research source Feel free to use rubbing alcohol as long as it contains at least 70% isopropyl alcohol by volume. You might also use hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, or specialized pipe cleaning solutions instead of alcohol. Kosher or epsom salt work best, since these have coarser, large grains that are better at scrubbing."

      "title": "Seal the container and shake it for 1-2 minutes.",
      "content": "Seal the container and shake it for 1-2 minutes. Close the zip-top of the bag or snap the container’s lid into place to seal your pipe and the alcohol and salt mixture inside. Shake the bag or container back and forth vigorously for 1-2 minutes, so the salt starts to scrub the surfaces inside your pipe. [3] X Research source If your pipe is particularly dirty and has a lot of resin on the inside, feel free to shake it for longer to help loosen it. You won’t do any harm by shaking the mixture around more, but your arm might get tired! Be cautious if your pipe has any delicate pieces. For example, if it is a glass pipe with thin ornamental pieces of blown glass on it, shake the mixture very gently."

      "title": "Let the pipe soak for at least 1 hour, then rinse and scrub it.",
      "content": "Let the pipe soak for at least 1 hour, then rinse and scrub it. Leave the pipe alone in the mixture for about 1 hour, or up to 24 hours if it’s especially dirty. After, rinse it out again with hot water for 2-3 minutes to clear away the alcohol, and use a cotton swab or pipe cleaner to scrub away any stubborn gunk or resin. [4] X Research source Pour the alcohol and salt solution down the drain; it’ll be too dirty to reuse. Repeat this process once or twice for a more thorough clean, or if your pipe is still dirty after the first cleaning. Once your pipe is clean, let it sit on a towel and air dry for about an hour before use."

      "title": "Use only hot water and gentle scrubbing on non-glass pipes.",
      "content": "Use only hot water and gentle scrubbing on non-glass pipes. Pipes made from latex, acrylic, plastic, wood, bone, or ceramic may be nifty, but they’re a bit fussier when it comes to cleaning. Harsh chemicals or firm abrasives like salt can degrade or scratch the material, leading to bacterial growth. For these, simply rinse them out with hot water and scrub them as best you can with cotton swabs or pipe cleaners. [5] X Research source For a more powerful clean, use mild dish soap, but stay away from other chemical cleaners. For ceramic or stone pipes, like tobacco pipes, feel free to use a cotton swabs or pipe cleaners soaked in alcohol, but avoid soaking the pipe itself in a liquid cleaner. You may be able to find acrylic, plastic, or latex cleaning solutions at head shops, but hot water and some elbow grease usually gets the job done."

      "title": "Rinse your pipe after each use, and scrub it if there’s buildup.",
      "content": "Rinse your pipe after each use, and scrub it if there’s buildup. Ideally, you’re smoking from a sparkling clean pipe every time. To achieve this, rinse out the pipe and let it dry after every use. If there’s still gunk in it, soak and agitate it in a cleaning solution, like the one we outlined here, before you use it again. [6] X Research source As a rule of thumb, if you wouldn’t drink water from your pipe or bong, you shouldn’t smoke from it, either. Dirty pipes can harbor mold or bacteria, which can cause illness if ingested through your mouth and into your lungs."
