Or, get really creative and add an engaging design around the date. Your goal is just to make sure your guests don’t miss it! [1] X Research source [v161267_b02]. 11 February 2020. Keep it simple with an “RSVP by” or “Please RSVP by” at the bottom of your invitation. Or, get fancy and write out the RSVP acronym: “Répondez s'il vous plaît.” In French, this means “Please reply.” If \"RSVP\" isn't your thing, write “Reply by,” or “Kindly reply by” instead. To account for late responders, set a \"soft\" deadline on your invitation and have a real deadline for following up with them."

      "title": "Explain how guests should RSVP.",
      "content": "Explain how guests should RSVP. To save you and your guests the headache, make it super clear how you’re collecting RSVPs. Are they mailing in an RSVP card, going to your website or Facebook page, or giving you a call? Some guests might be more comfortable sending an email, while others might enjoy the convenience of a text response. So, if you have the time, give your guests multiple ways to RSVP to help ensure more responses. [2] X Research source When adding an RSVP card to your invitation for formal events like weddings, anniversaries, and reunions, include a return envelope that’s pre-addressed to your address. All the guest has to do is make their RSVP selection and put the envelope in the post. For a more formal wedding or party, provide spaces for guests to check “Accepts with pleasure” and “Declines with regret.” If your party or wedding is more casual, make your RSVP fit your vibe! Write RSVP choices like “Yes! Wouldn’t miss it for the world,” and “No, and this is the worst decision of my life,” or “Can’t wait to put on my dancing shoes!” and “Sorry, party on without me!” Reader Poll: We asked 190 wikiHow readers how they preferred to respond to an informal dinner invitation, and only 4% of them said an in-person conversation. [Take Poll] People would much rather send a text or email RSVP for an informal occasion than have an awkward in-person conversation."

      "content": "Ask your guests to only respond if they can’t come as an alternative. If you have a large guestlist or just want to make handling RSVPs easier, write \"RSVP regrets only\" instead. This tells your guests that they only have to RSVP to your event if they are not able to attend. If you’re going this route, make the words \"RSVP regrets only\" prominent and clear on the invitation. This way, no guest accidentally RSVPs no when they meant yes!"

If there is too much text or confusing wording on your invitation, your guests might misinterpret the purpose of your invitation or think you’re only informing them about the event. Get creative and make your invitations fun and personable, but keep the information to the point. Limit your invitation to only necessary information like: [3] X Research source Who is holding the event, what the event is for, where the event will be, when it will be, and why it is being held.

Let your guests know about your event as early as possible so they have plenty of time to clear their schedules and mark their calendars. If gifts are involved or they need to bring party supplies, this also gives them time to go shopping. For forgetful guests, sending the invitation early enough helps remind them about it whenever they check their schedules. [5] X Research source [v161267_b02]. 11 February 2020. For weddings , send your invitations about 6 to 8 weeks before your wedding date. [6] X Research source For birthday parties and graduations , send your invitations about 2 to 4 weeks before your event. [7] X Research source Most wedding planners recommend sending out a \"save the date\" card about 6 months before the date. This is then followed up later by the formal invitation."

      "content": "Set the RSVP date for 1 week before your party, depending on the event. RSVPs are super important for getting an accurate guest headcount. The number of guests attending your party tells you how much food you need, how many seats you need to plan for, and ultimately, how much you’ll be spending for the event. Setting the RSVP deadline a little before the day of your party leaves your guests with plenty of time to make their decision, and gives you some leeway to make the final headcount. [8] X Research source For formal events like weddings , make your RSVP deadline 2-4 weeks before your date. The venue and caterer typically want an official guest headcount 1 to 2 weeks before your date, so this gives you an extra few weeks to track down guests that haven’t responded.

So, wait to send your invitations during your lunch break or after work hours in the evening. Or, plan to send off your invites on the weekend. Sending an invitation very early in the morning or late at night is more likely to bring it to the top of your guests’ inboxes and make it more visible."

[10] X Research source [v161267_b02]. 11 February 2020. Writing why you need a response in the invitation, such as providing enough food or party favors, might tap into your guests’ scarcity mindset, making them more likely to respond! Depending on the event and whether it’s casual or formal, write something like: [11] X Research source “To ensure there is enough food and drink for everyone, please send a response to this invitation.” “So we can prepare enough seating for everyone, please reply whether or not you can make our party.” \"Please respond so we have enough cupcakes for your children.\""

Plus, if they’re getting something free, they might feel a little more obligated to respond. Your gift doesn't have to be extravagant at all, though! Simply add a personable touch to your invitation by including things like: [12] X Research source A pin from the dollar store. A balloon. A sticker. A handwritten note."

Again, your prize doesn’t have to be expensive—a small gift will do just fine. For example, offer up: [13] X Research source A bottle of wine. A $5 gift card Extra party favors."

Just use the caterer or venue as an excuse! [14] X Research source “Hi Hannah! We wanted to make sure you got our wedding invitation for May 1st.
