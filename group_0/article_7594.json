      "content": "Remove grease spots with a commercial cleaner. Buy a solvent-based cleaner online or at a local hardware store. Make sure the cleaner is safe to use or made specifically to use on aluminum. Obvious grease spots and stains should be treated with a commercial cleaner. [2] X Research source Refer to the instruction manual for precise instructions. Most cleaners should sit on the stain for a set amount of time before being wiped off. Make sure to completely rinse the cleaner off the aluminum once it has set. Look the safety instructions on your cleaner as well. Gloves or goggles may be advised."

After applying a commercial cleaner to the stains, give the whole frame a scrub with a paste made of 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of lemon juice and ¼ cup (45 g) of baking soda. [3] X Research source"

The precise time this will take depends on the current climate in your area. [4] X Research source Make sure you apply the paste to the entire window frame. Do not neglect cracks or crevices in the window. If you need a smaller tool, such as a scrub brush, to get into certain places, use that to apply the cleaner."

Make sure to follow package directions, especially any safety instructions, before applying paint thinner. Then, work the paint thinner into the frames using a steel wool sponge until the stains come off. [10] X Research source Be gentle when using steel wool to avoid scratching the frames. Some steel wool pads have soap built in that can help you clean."
