      "content": "Gemini men love trendy and cool outfits. A person in a sharp ensemble will grab a Gemini guy’s attention from across the room. These dudes are often interested in novelty and you’ll be much more likely to keep their elusive attention if you try to change up your look day-to-day. [1] X Research source Gemini men will be more attracted to your confidence and unique sense of style than to the showiness of your outfit, so don’t feel pressure to wear something that makes you uncomfortable. It’s like the old saying goes, “It’s not about what you wear, but how you wear it.”"

      "content": "A strong gaze will grab a Gemini man’s interest. Your Gemini guy needs to feel like he’s the center of your attention, and no words or touches will make him feel that way more than a long look into his curious eyes. Plus, eye contact is sexy in any situation! [2] X Research source Throw on a pair of glasses if you have them to hype up your “brainy” look. A Gem man won’t be able to resist the combination of beauty and intelligence."

      "title": "Geminis never stop talking.",
      "content": "Geminis never stop talking. Ever. Stay up-to-date on current events, the news, gossip, and random fun facts so you always have a conversation topic up your sleeve. He wants to know a little bit about everything, so the more you can bounce around between different ideas and subjects, the better. A quick flow is more interesting to him than a deep discussion, and he’ll go wild for anyone who can keep up with his mile-a-minute mouth. [3] X Research source Stimulating his mind with new ideas and topics is the first step toward attracting a Gemini man. Be prepared to talk a lot on your journey to reel him in. Reader Poll: We asked 697 wikiHow readers if they think Geminis are generally attracted to people who are curious, and 50% of them said yes. [Take Poll] So, be open to talking about any subject with him."

      "content": "A Gem man can’t keep his focus on one person for too long. Reeling in a Gemini man takes a lot of flirtatious determination, so get ready to lay it on thick. He thrives on attention, so engage him on social media to let him know you’re thinking about him and show that you know how popular he is. Tell him he’s interesting and fascinating outright—the more shameless the flirting, the more responsive he’ll be. [4] X Research source Even though your flirting is unabashed and direct, keep your personal self a little mysterious . Geminis don’t like head games, but they’re attracted to a little puzzle."

      "content": "The Gemini sign rules over arms. That means your Gemini man’s arms are a sensitive, sensual place for him. Rest your hand on his forearm or lightly run a finger along his bicep while you flirt to stimulate his senses. Plus, what guy doesn’t like to think that his arms are sexy? [5] X Research source Try touching his tricep or the underside of his arm for an unexpected and sensitive sensation."

      "content": "A Gemini man’s hands are an erogenous place for him. A lot of Gems talk with their hands, so playing with them is almost like continuing your conversation physically. Hold or rub his hand, kiss his palm, or play with his fingers to channel his chatty energy into his body language. He’ll be extra stimulated and responsive to a hand massage . [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Geminis are probably the best sexters in the Zodiac. They’re hard to offend, and their signature sense of humor applies to all things sexy, too. Send him your raunchiest jokes and innuendos without fear because he'll definitely eat it up. A Gem man’s mind and body will both be aroused by flirty and offbeat messages, and he’ll appreciate having the concrete knowledge that, yes, you are into him. Gemini men love written communication because their ruling planet is Mercury—so they won’t be turned off if you blow up their phone now and then. Keep your texting and sexting light and funny. If the conversation turns too serious or emotional too soon, he’ll start putting distance between you. Geminis are very “dual-minded about things,” shares Vedic Astrologer Tara Divina. So asking them questions like “‘Hey, do you prefer this or that?’ would make for a very entertaining conversation with a Gemini.” Try engaging this side of them by starting a fun text game of This or That or Would You Rather!

A Gemini man’s sexuality is cerebral, so play some fun mind games and engage him in rapid-fire, flirty banter to rev up his brain and build sexual tension . Some teasing mind games will turn him on and up his attraction to you more than any revealing outfit or a trail of rose petals will. [9] X Research source Your Gem man finds it fun to exchange sexy thoughts. He’s a generous lover and will use whatever information you give him during your banter once you’re in bed."

      "content": "A Gemini man is curious about what turns you on. Geminis are playful and romantic in bed, but they care about their partner’s experience first and foremost. So even if you’ve already got your Gem dude into bed, his mind will keep searching for new ways to please you. Keep the lights on and have a mirror nearby so he can see how the two of you look together. [10] X Research source Give him some breadcrumbs about what you want him to do, but don’t tell him outright—he’ll get a thrill out of solving the puzzle on his own."

      "content": "Boredom and monotony are a Gemini man’s biggest turn-offs. Gemini loves spontaneity. He’s an active guy who loses focus easily, so keep him engaged with surprises like last-minute dinner plans at a restaurant he’s never been to, thrilling dates like zip lining or hiking an unknown trail, or even just a random night out at the bars when he wasn’t expecting one. When he sees how adventurous and fun you are to be around, his physical attraction to you will grow stronger. [11] X Research source Spontaneity will help get your Gem into bed, but you’ll need to keep the surprises coming to keep him there. Play with new toys, positions, or role-playing to keep things fresh. Geminis feel shackled by routine, so be flexible with when (and even where) the two of you get intimate."

      "content": "A Gemini man wants to feel wanted but not needed. He’ll start to pull away from a potential lover the second he thinks his freedom is getting stepped on.

      "content": "Gemini men have incredibly short attention spans. They’ll lose interest in you if you don’t keep them mentally engaged and wondering what you’re going to say or do next. Skip the small talk and ask him out for drinks sooner than later, or even just flat-out tell him that you’re attracted to him after you’ve gotten to know him a little bit. Geminis are communicators, and they’re attracted to people who talk to them clearly and directly. [18] X Research source Geminis don’t respond well to partners who play hard-to-get.
