      "content": "Pick an appropriate joke for your audience. Being able to read a room is a big part of being funny and telling jokes. Pay attention to the mood of the people around you. Muñoz suggests being very careful about telling any type of joke in serious situations like work events, funerals, and weddings. He recommends that you always pay attention to the reactions to any jokes you tell. Listen to the kind of things the people around you are talking about. Are they having light conversations about fun topics? Lighter conversations can suggest that appropriate funny jokes are welcome. For some serious events, there might be times that are more appropriate for jokes than others. For example, a joke that isn’t welcome in the middle of a wedding ceremony might be perfect for the reception."

      "title": "Take a short pause before delivering the punchline.",
      "content": "Take a short pause before delivering the punchline. Comedic timing is key to getting a laugh when you tell a joke . Adjust how fast you talk and use a “pregnant pause” right before the punchline to use timing to heighten the humor of your joke. Pausing before you deliver the punchline helps build tension and makes your joke funnier. [9] X Research source A classic joke by legendary funny man Henny Youngman uses misdirection and a “pregnant pause” to make it funnier. He sets the joke up by saying, “Take my wife,” like he’s going to tell a story about something his wife did or said. Then, he pauses before saying, “Please.” This changes the meaning of the setup to a plea to take his wife away. However, try not to let the pause go on too long. The most hilarious joke can fall flat if your audience has too much time to think about it."

You just have to be confident and believe in yourself and your sense of humor, Payne shares."
