It takes a confident woman to get his attention, but once he takes notice, he can’t get enough. There are some who say feminine confidence is like an aphrodisiac to Aries guys. Don’t worry if you have trouble feeling confident – and getting a word in edgewise – when you’re talking with someone with an Aries-sized personality. They can also appreciate a woman who listens to their stories and laughs at their jokes. However, if you’re a good listener who also projects confidence , he’ll be putty in your hands in no time."

Make an effort to develop your sense of humor to win his heart. This could be as simple as paying closer attention while watching comedies or stand-up routines to see what makes people laugh."

If you want them to hang around, don’t give in to their blistering charm too soon. If you’re too easy to win over, they’ll be off to the next conquest before you’ve had a chance to catch your breath.

[11] X Research source He doesn’t just like to work out; he needs to, or he’ll get restless and snappy. “Aries is ruled by the planet Mars, the god of war, so any way to get their aggression out is where you will find Aries,” Garbis advises. The Aries man loves sports and outdoor activities like rock climbing and hiking. They also have a habit of throwing themselves into strenuous DIY home improvement projects to work out some of that boundless energy. You don’t have to take up mountain climbing, but be open to trying new things, like taking a hike or going for a jog , to show your Aries man you can keep up with him."

This doesn’t mean he wants you to let him win. His competitive spirit won’t be satisfied unless he beats an opponent fair and square. Whether you’re playing a board game or racing him to the top of the hill, fight hard to the very end, and your Aries man will love you even more."

An Aries man might rush into and out of a relationship with blinding speed, but when he realizes he’s in love, he’s in it for the long haul. In fact, these guys have a habit of putting the women they love on a pedestal, so be prepared for him to treat you like a goddess. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Aries men like to fight.",
      "content": "Aries men like to fight. These guys love passionate debates a little too much. If a Ram gets really into a heavy conversation, his competitive nature and brash manner of speaking can tip it over into a full-blown argument. It’s not all bad, though. Garbis says, “If an Aries is fighting with you, then they fiercely love you but may need to find better ways to understand or express it.” He really needs a partner with a cool head who isn’t afraid to stand up for herself.
