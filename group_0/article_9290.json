      "content": "Determine your essential appliances. Figure out what appliances you can’t live without, like lighting, medical equipment, fridges, etc. A petrol-driven generator with a rated power of about 3500W will serve for lighting, TV, fans, and a fridge or freezer. The rated power is usually written on the body of the generator and is the amount of power the generator can deliver continuously for an average of 12 hours on a single tank of fuel. [1] X Research source The power ratings of generators are typically expressed in Kilo Volt Amperes or KVA. Stoves, air conditioners, and tumble driers use too much power from a typical portable generator."

      "content": "List the electrical devices you plan to use and check their wattage . A typical microwave, for instance, uses 1500 watts, while a whole circuit of lights with CFL (compact fluorescent lamp) bulbs may only require 150 watts. Refrigerators use around 1200-1500 watts but have a starting capacitor that increases the wattage momentarily when the compressor starts. Televisions use less the 1000 watts depending on the type and size. A small room fan may use about 500 watts, and so on."

      "content": "Choose a wiring system. Contact your local Department of Labor and Industries, Planning Department, or Power Company to learn about regulations, necessary permits, and the legal wiring system of your area. Don’t consult the internet to determine which system is legal in your area, as many unqualified sources offer inaccurate, unsafe advice. Wiring laws can vary significantly between countries, states, and even cities, making it that much more important to contact your local department first. [2] X Research source Several different wiring system options are used to connect a generator to a house, the two most popular wiring systems being the following: Manual transfer switch. This is a slightly more expensive piece of equipment requiring professional installation. However, it’s the only guaranteed legal option and the safest. A professional installation will keep you from accidentally electrocuting someone else or yourself and ensure your portable generator runs as best it can. Interlock kit: These are fairly simple to install and the cheapest option. However, they are illegal in many areas and can be very unsafe. Interlock kits must be installed with the utmost care and correctness. Additionally, safe installation requires that you have several extra spaces in your existing breaker box or that you install a new one, which must be done professionally. It is a strict requirement that you get a kit approved for your specific breaker box (the same company should make it). [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Install an inlet box hookup. An inlet box hookup will go outside your house, have a recessed male connector (prongs that stick out rather than holes you plug into), and connect to whichever panel system you installed inside your house. A professional should install the inlet box to keep you safe and ensure your system remains up to code. [4] X Research source If you don't have this installed by a professional, your insurance may be unable to cover your home, the city you live in could enforce a heavy fine, and you are very likely to hurt either yourself or someone else (in a hospital-if-you're-lucky kind of way)."

You’ll find plenty of inaccurate, dangerous advice and instructions on the internet that can put you at risk for injury, electrocution, or a fire. Always check with your city specialists before installing wiring and connecting your generator to determine the safest and most suitable method. Some common don’ts include: [5] X Research source Don’t connect your generator directly to your breaker box without an approved transfer switch. Don’t connect your generator to a washing machine or dryer outlet. Don’t run a generator in your home or garage. Don’t allow children or pets anywhere near your generator."

Place the generator as far away from your home as possible with the cable it comes with, or at a minimum of 10 feet (3 m). This is to prevent your home from catching fire should something go wrong with the generator and avoid carbon monoxide poisoning from the generator exhaust, which can be deadly. [7] X Research source Placing your generator at least 10 feet (3 m) away from your home is a critical and necessary safety precaution."

Never plug a generator directly into a wall outlet or your home’s wiring. Be sure to unplug and turn off all appliances before operating your generator. [8] X Research source"

You may need to preheat the engine with the glow plug (a heating element that heats incoming fuel and air) if it’s under 32 degrees (0 C) where you live.
