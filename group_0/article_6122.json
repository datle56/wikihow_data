      "title": "Provide your iguana with lots of light.",
      "content": "Provide your iguana with lots of light. To thrive, iguanas need access to certain types of light. Most importantly, iguanas need ultralight light that is in the UVB spectrum. Without this sort of light, your iguana could suffer from a deficiency of vitamin D, be unable to absorb calcium, and have other health problems. Purchase UVB light bulbs that are specifically labelled for reptiles. Those made for reef tanks and plants don't provide enough UVB rays for your iguana. Make sure your lizard breed naturally adapted to this temperature. While UVB light should reach the entire habitat, make sure to place a light 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm) above the iguana’s basking area. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Install a heat source for your iguana.",
      "content": "Install a heat source for your iguana. Since most climates are cooler than environments where iguanas thrive, you’ll need to install a source of heat in your iguana’s habitat. This is important, as your iguana will not thrive if it is too cold. The coolest area of your iguana’s habitat should be between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 27 degrees Celsius). Keep the “basking area” between 95 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit (35 to 38 degrees Celsius). [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Install thermostats in the habitat.",
      "content": "Install thermostats in the habitat. Place a thermostat in the middle and on the edge of the habitat. This way, you’ll be able to monitor the temperature in different parts of the habitat. Ultimately, this will help you make sure that the temperature and climate is right for your iguana.

    },
    {
      "title": "Create a basking area.",
      "content": "Create a basking area. The basking area is an area of your iguana’s habitat where your iguana can enjoy heat and light. This area is fundamental to making your iguana happy. Without a basking area, your cage won’t simulate the iguana’s natural environment. Basking areas should have: [4] X Research source A large flat area for your iguana to lay. Direct light from a UVB light. A close proximity to a heat rock or another source of direct heat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Purchase a large cage.",
      "content": "Purchase a large cage. Use a cage at least 8 feet by 3 feet by 6 feet (2.4 meters by .9 meters by 1.8 meters). As a rule, the larger the cage, the better. Without enough room, your iguana won’t be able to thrive and may wind up sick or depressed. [5] X Research source Wire cages are suitable if you live in an area that is consistently hot and humid. Otherwise, you will need a large glass tank or enclosure to make sure you can maintain your iguana's environmental conditions. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Spread substrate across the bottom of the habitat.",
      "content": "Spread substrate across the bottom of the habitat. After you pick your cage or enclosure, place substrate across the bottom of it. Use specially designed reptile carpet or flat or shredded newspaper. Avoid bark, woodchips, treated wood, or plastic. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide things for your iguana to climb.",
      "content": "Provide things for your iguana to climb. Because iguanas live in heavily wooded areas, your iguana will need lots of space and different types of things to climb on. Do this by placing a variety of large branches or specially designed platforms in the habitat. In addition, provide a variety of rocks for the iguana to climb on. [8] X Research source Make sure any branches or structures you place in the habitat are large and strong enough to support the iguana. Provide ramps for your iguana to climb to different levels of its habitat. Opt for smooth/flat rocks that your iguana can comfortably lay on."

    {
      "title": "Create a hiding area.",
      "content": "Create a hiding area. A box or cave-like area will allow your iguana to hide when it feels threatened or scared. Ultimately, a hiding area is an important part of any iguana habit. Without one, your iguana will feel vulnerable and may not thrive. [9] X Research source Place a small wooden box under some rocks."

    {
      "title": "Place small plants in the habitat.",
      "content": "Place small plants in the habitat. Small plants will help transform your iguana’s habitat into a more interesting environment that better simulates the wild. Depending on the plants you place, your iguana may eat them or hide in them. Some plants to include are: Acacia Aloe Bamboo Thistle Jade plant Dandelion [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Give your iguana vegetables.",
      "content": "Give your iguana vegetables. Iguanas need greens and enjoy chopped veggies as healthy treats. Some appropriate greens include collards, mustard, dandelion, or turnip greens. In addition, your iguana will eat kale and different types of lettuce. Chopped veggie choices can include broccoli, bok choy, green beans, and squash. Ultimately, your iguana will spend a lot of time consuming vegetables. [11] X Research source Most lettuces, like iceberg and hearts of romaine, won’t provide enough vitamins and nutrients to sustain your iguana. Choose colorful lettuces that have more nutritional value. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Provide your iguana with fruits.",
      "content": "Provide your iguana with fruits. In addition to leafy vegetables, your iguana will enjoy snacking on and eating a variety of fruits. Some good fruits to give your iguana include strawberries, blueberries, bananas, apples, cantaloupe. Ultimately, most berries and melons will make a good addition to your iguana’s diet.

      "title": "Give your iguana commercially formulated iguana food.",
      "content": "Give your iguana commercially formulated iguana food. Iguana food is often in dry pellet form. Mix iguana food with fruits and vegetables in a fruit bowl or serve them separately. Many vets recommend wetting them slightly before giving them to your iguana, as this will make it easier for your iguana to eat. Remember, though, give store-bought food only as a supplement to fruits and vegetables. [14] X Research source Follow the directions on the product you purchase."

      "title": "Buy reptile vitamin supplements.",
      "content": "Buy reptile vitamin supplements. Many iguanas don’t get all the nutrition they need in captivity. Because of this, your iguana may benefit from reptile vitamin supplements. These supplements come as powder and can be mixed with your iguana's food. They provide vitamins and minerals like calcium and vitamin D3, which are critical to your iguana’s health.

      "title": "Avoid relying on insects.",
      "content": "Avoid relying on insects. Iguanas are herbivores and don’t really eat meat in the wild. As a result, avoid providing them insects like crickets and mealworms that other reptiles often eat. Ultimately, too much protein could hurt your iguana. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Place several large water bowls in your iguana’s habitat.",
      "content": "Place several large water bowls in your iguana’s habitat. While your iguana will get most of the water it needs from its food, you should also provide several water bowls in its habitat. This way, your iguana will have access to a lot of clean and fresh water if it is thirsty. In addition, providing water bowls will help increase the humidity level of your iguana’s habitat.

      "content": "Do not house multiple iguanas together. Generally, avoid housing multiple iguanas in the same cage. If you house iguanas together, they could get into a fight and injure each other. You can house multiple iguanas in the same room or area as long as they are in separate cages. If you are for some reason considering placing more than one iguana in a single cage, talk to your vet first."
