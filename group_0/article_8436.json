      "content": "Insert the flat end of a pen through the bristles beneath the hair. Start from the handle end of the brush, pushing the pen toward the top of the brush. Try to nudge the pen beneath the majority of the hair clump so it’s easier to remove. Don’t slide the pen tip beneath the hair, as you don’t want to get any ink on your paddle brush."

      "content": "Tug the hair clump upwards, until it’s visible above the plastic spikes. Pull the pen up to force the hair to the top of the plastic bristles. Depending on how tangled the hair is, you might have to work in short, quick motions to successfully pull it up. Continue tugging upward with the pen so the clump is resting on top of the plastic bristles. If there’s a lot of hair stuck in your brush, you might not be able to pull it all to the brush’s surface at one time. If this is the case, feel free to work in chunks."

      "content": "Cut down the center of the hair clump with a pair of scissors. Separate the large, raised hair ball into 2 sections by slicing the middle. As you go, cut in small, careful sections to prevent the scissors from cutting the plastic bristles. Make sure that you’re starting from the handle end of the brush and working towards the wider end.
