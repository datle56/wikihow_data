      "title": "Talk with a pastor.",
      "content": "Talk with a pastor. Reach out to one or more Christian pastors or leaders in your community. You can find one by entering “Christian church” and your city into a search engine. Then, sit down individually with each of them and discuss your thoughts regarding conversion. Ask them for advice. See if you can sit in on a sermon or congregation meeting. Be prepared to meet with religious leaders multiple times before coming to a final decision. [1] X Research source Don’t be shy about approaching these religious officials. Many of them will be more than happy to guide you through the conversion process. For example, Methodists consider meeting with a pastor to be a critical first step towards conversion.

      "title": "Talk with a Christian missionary.",
      "content": "Talk with a Christian missionary. If you live in an area with missionaries, you might attend one of their gatherings or ask a missionary to visit you at home. You can discuss their particular Christian beliefs, such as their understanding of salvation and sin. Or, you could ask about how their denomination treats new converts. Missionaries come from a variety of Christian denominations, so you may need to talk with multiple people before moving forward with a conversion. [3] X Research source For example, you might ask, \"How did you become a Christian?\" Or, \"How did you know that this particular denomination of Christianity was the right one for you?\" You can expect a missionary to be excited about the opportunity to speak with you. They are usually individuals who sometimes have moved far away from their home and are trying to spread the word about their faith and potentially convert others. Be aware that once you reach out to a missionary they may expect continued contact with you, even if you decide to convert to another Christian group."

      "title": "Get together with Christian friends.",
      "content": "Get together with Christian friends. Ask them about their beliefs and what draws them to Christ. Discuss their memories of the conversion process, if they went through it. You can also go online and find communities of Christians who can discuss conversion with you. Find a group that piques your interest by entering “Christian conversion support” into a search engine. [4] X Research source Online groups are also a great place to ask any questions that came up as you read through the Bible or other Christian texts. For example, you might be curious as to whether or not you will need to attend church every Sunday or not."

    {
      "title": "Familiarize yourself with the Bible.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the Bible. Purchase a physical or digital edition of the Bible and begin to read through it. Highlight any passages that you are particularly interested in. Write down any questions that you have and make sure to bring these up with your Christian religious leader. You may also find it interesting to read through Christian hymns. [5] X Research source Be aware that there are many different printed versions of the Bible. For example, you can buy a copy that has all of the passages directly pertaining to women highlighted in red. Talk with your Christian spiritual adviser to determine which text will work the best for you. Sometimes it also helps to buy an annotated edition with explanations in the margins. A Bible editor might use these annotations as a way to provide historical context, for example. Annotated Bibles often come with additional space in the margins for your notes as well."

      "title": "Choose a Christian denomination.",
      "content": "Choose a Christian denomination. After you’ve talked with a number of Christian ministers and friends, sit down at your computer to do some additional research. Visit a variety of websites affiliated with the denominations that catch your interest. For example, if you enter “Baptist” into a search engine, you will pull up a number of websites. Pay particular attention to any statements of faith that you see. You can expect some variations between various congregations. Try to focus on the similarities that you see across each denomination."

      "title": "Be patient.",
      "content": "Be patient. The conversion process can sometimes takes years to complete. It is very much based on the individual and how they choose to proceed. It will likely involve a great deal of thought and conversation with other people regarding your choices. Don’t rush the process and instead look at it as an opportunity to make sure that you are making the right choice for you. [6] X Research source Some converts have said that reading about the religious struggles experienced by those people found in the Bible helped them to cope with their own conversion process. Many Christians believe that the conversion process never truly ends. It is an effort that you must make day after day. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Understand the exact requirements.",
      "content": "Understand the exact requirements. Talk with the minister of your potential congregation about what you will need to do in both the long and short term. You can talk about whether or not a baptism is necessary. Or, if you will need other Christians as sponsors. You can also request that they lay out the timeline of necessary events. For example, in the Catholic faith, you must express your desire to be baptized and take on the label of “Catechumen.” You will then begin the process of learning about Catholicism, a period which can last for months.

      "content": "Take a new members class, if offered. Almost all Christian denominations embrace the idea of a “learning period” for those persons pursuing conversion and many churches even offer classes aimed at new members. In a class of this type, you would continue to familiarize yourself with the Bible, while also learning more about your church’s membership requirements. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Repent your sins. Your Christian denomination may require that you write down your sins in a book, speak with a minister, or simply contemplate your sins on an everyday basis. This will help to pave your way to salvation through the process of repentance. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Develop and affirm your personal relationship with Jesus Christ.",
      "content": "Develop and affirm your personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Again, this will be something that you’ll need to do privately. However, you may also be asked to verbally affirm your beliefs and commitment, sometimes in front of the entire congregation. For example, the minister might ask you, “Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the savior?” You would then answer in the affirmative. [12] X Research source You may also perform this affirmation as a group alongside other new members. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Get baptized.",
      "content": "Get baptized. You will need to be partially submerged or touched with holy water as part of a baptism. This reflects you being purified and you will usually become a full-fledged Christian and church member at this point. In the case of Catholicism, you may also be asked to receive the Eucharist. You may receive a Christian name as well. [14] X Research source A baptism can be a private event between you and your priest or may take place in front of an audience, such as the entire congregation. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Recognize any Hindu-Christian similarities. As you read through Christian texts, you might notice a number of commonalities to Hindu readings. You might see that both religions emphasize love and surrender, for example. The idea that God is ever-present is another similarity. As you come upon these similarities, make note of them because they can help you weather the transition process. [17] X Research source For example, Hindus often emphasize the idea of long-standing devotion to God, including the surrender of one’s body and mind. Christians often teach the same beliefs.

As you go through the conversion process, you may want to ‘feel out’ your Hindu friends to see how they feel about your choices. If they are supportive, you may be able to open up to them about your struggles. If they are resistant, then you may need to get some distance from them and try to rebuild your relationships later.

[22] X Research source For example, in India many personal religious changes must be logged by a local oath commissioner."
