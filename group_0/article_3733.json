      "content": "Find a center where you can volunteer. The \"busy season\" for wildlife centers starts in the spring. This is when baby animals are born, and the boom continues through the summer. Most places have limited acceptance periods, so they can have a trained staff on hand for spring. Think about volunteering at a couple different places to see which kinds of animals you’d like to work with. [1] X Research source"

These courses would give you a background in the way animals function and their environment."

Keep up with these people as you look for a job. If you want to work at one particular location, keep in contact with them until they have an opening, and always let them know that you are ready to help at any time."

      "content": "Work hard rehabilitating wildlife. Most wildlife rehabilitators work closely with a veterinarian to care for wild animals in their care. As a wildlife rehabilitator, each day is likely to be different as you care for a variety of hurt and sick animals. You will be caring for traumatized or wounded animals, new babies whose parents cannot care for them, animals who are disabled in some way, all of whom are wild and undomesticated. Each case will require strong knowledge of animal behavior and biology as well as a medical expertise to make a diagnosis and create a treatment plan."

Think about whether you want to stay in your current position, or if you want to change in the future -- perhaps to open your own center once you’re an experienced wildlife rehabilitator.
