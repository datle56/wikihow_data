Discuss this with the girl, and see if her parents would be okay with having you over for dinner. [1] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Relationship Advisor Expert Interview. 1 October 2020. Having their pre-approval will help relieve some of the tension. [2] X Research source She might say, “Mom and Dad, can Jared come over for dinner Wednesday night? He'd really like to get to know you guys better and talk to you about us going on a date.\" This will give her parents some time to think about this so you don’t spring a complete surprise on them. If you have already spent some time at her house and established yourself as a respectful and trustworthy person, her parents will likely be more open to the suggestion. Understand that going in without her parents having any prior knowledge of you is going to be difficult — no matter how polite you are or how well you dress, you will still be a stranger."

      "content": "Introduce yourself. Say your name, smile genuinely , and shake their hands . Call her parents by their titles and surnames, for example Mr. and Ms. Johnson, until they indicate otherwise. If you have met them before, say something like, \"Hi, Mr. and Ms. Johnson. It's really nice to see you again. Thank you for having me for dinner.\" If this is your first time meeting you, you could say, “Hi, Mr. and Mr. Johnson. I’m Josh Green. It’s nice to meet you.” Use a firm, confident handshake, and make eye contact as you say hello. Stand up straight and tall. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Let them lead the conversation. Her parents will likely have plenty of questions for you. Try not to be overly eager to tell them about all your achievements.

[5] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Relationship Advisor Expert Interview. 1 October 2020. They will likely ask about your family and friends, goals, and interests.

I’m going to start teaching swimming lessons next month at the park district.”"

      "title": "Be polite but genuine.",
      "content": "Be polite but genuine. Don't treat this like a formal job interview. Answer all their questions in a friendly, warm voice. Make sure you show interest in their lives by asking some questions, too. Showing genuine interest in other people leaves a positive impression when you meet someone for the first time. [6] X Research source Questions you can ask her parents include things like, “How long have you lived here?” or, “Did you grow up in this area?” You could also look for things you may have in common. For example, “Mr. Johnson, did you coach softball with my dad a few years ago?” Make sure the conversation is a two-way street. Neither party should be doing all of the talking or asking all of the questions. Don’t get distracted by your phone during your conversation. Looking at your phone while someone else is talking can be seen as extremely rude. Silence it, and keep it in your pocket as you are talking to her parents. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Tell the truth.",
      "content": "Tell the truth. If you think you have a negative reputation with her parents, talk to them about it. Be honest with them, even if you have to admit to something you’d rather not. They will respect you far more for telling the truth than for lying to them. Lying to them will make them not trust you. [8] X Research source If they ask you about a poor past decision, for example, make sure you tell them what you have learned from it, and how you are different now. For example, you could say, “Yes, I was one of the kids who got suspended last year for the cafeteria prank. I feel really embarrassed about that now because I know how much extra work we made for the janitors. We sent them an apology card.”"

You could say, “Lucia told me that she knew how important it was that you meet people who wanted to go out with her.

You could say, “I wanted to get your permission to go on a date with your daughter, but I also understand that it’s up to her, too. If she’s not interested anymore, I understand.”"

She is fun to talk to. I think we bonded over our love of science fiction movies.” Do not say anything about her physical attributes. Only talk about her personality.

[12] X Research source You could say, “I really would like to get to know your daughter better, and I think she feels the same way about me. Do we have your permission to go out on a date?” You could say, “I was thinking about taking Emily to the school play next week, then going out for dessert afterward. We’d probably be home by 9:30. Would that be okay?” If they seem reluctant to let you go on a one-on-one date, you could ask if it would be okay to go on a group date with the daughter. Make sure they know the other people in the group. You could say, “A few of us in my youth group are going out to dinner next week. I think you know Laura and Maya?

I have a 10 o’clock curfew. Does that work for you, or does she need to be home earlier?” If this is their first time meeting you, they may say they'd like to get to know you better. You might say, \"We have a test coming up next week. Maybe I could come over Sunday afternoon and we could study here?\" If they say no to everything, you could ask, “Do you think we could talk about this again in a few months?” Accept that you may need to wait a little bit to date, but you may still have other ways to see their daughter in a school, extracurricular, or social setting."

If you told them you are going to see a movie, be at the movie theater watching the movie you said you were going to see at that particular time. Don’t go to another movie or be somewhere else entirely. If her parents find out you are lying about your whereabouts, that will likely put a stop to your relationship. Be on time. Bring her home when you say you are going to. If you absolutely can't avoid being late (for example, you're caught in an unexpected traffic jam), let the parents know as soon as possible. Then try to avoid circumstances that would cause you to be late again, such as going somewhere within walking distance rather than driving. Have safe and reliable transportation. Let her parents know how you are getting there and back. If they are not comfortable with you driving, for example, propose alternatives without argument."
