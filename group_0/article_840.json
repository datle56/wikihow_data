      "content": "Buy a SATA internal hard drive for your computer. If you don't already have a SATA hard drive that you want to install, buy one before proceeding. [2] X Research source You'll generally want to buy a hard drive made by the same company which made your computer (e.g., HP). Some hard drives aren't compatible with certain computers. Before buying a hard drive for your computer, search for your computer's model and the hard drive's name (e.g., \"HP Pavilion compatible with L3M56AA SATA\") to see if they'll work together."

      "content": "Turn off and unplug your computer. You should never attempt to alter your computer's internal components while the computer is running, as you may seriously harm both yourself and the computer. Some desktop computers will take a couple of minutes to finish running after unplugging them. If this is the case for your computer, wait until the computer's fans have stopped running before proceeding."

It should fit into a slot next to the primary hard drive's cable. [4] X Research source If your computer's motherboard only supports IDE connections, the slot on the motherboard will be a couple of inches wide. You can buy a SATA to IDE adapter that plugs into this slot, at which point you can plug your hard drive's cable into the adapter's back."
