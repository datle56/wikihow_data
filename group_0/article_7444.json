      "content": "Most women chose the bear when asked the viral man vs. bear question. The man vs. bear question is, “Would you rather be alone in the woods with a bear or a man?” The question is primarily targeted at women and asks if they would feel safer if they were alone with a bear or a random man. It’s not about the threat of bears in the forest. It’s about the dangers women face living among men. [1] X Research source The question is meant to highlight women’s perception of danger by giving them a fictional choice to see what their first response would be. For the most part, the question was asked and answered in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek manner with the reasons women would choose a bear over a man being more serious. The man vs. bear question was intended as a hypothetical situation to help explain how women feel in the presence of men."

      "content": "Women theorized the worst a bear would do is kill them. Most women who responded to the questions gave their reasons. These reasons focused on how the bear would act vs. how the man would act and how society reacts to bear attacks vs. gender-based violence. When the question was asked in a street interview video posted on TikTok by @screenshothq, a few of the comments included: “No one’s gonna ask me if I led the bear on or give me a pamphlet on bear attack prevention tips.” - @celestiallystunning “Bear won't traffic me” - @stephanieedd “Worst thing bear can do is kill me” - @mattislikesrain “People would believe me if I was attacked by a bear” - @laxsrn “Bears don't lock you in a basement” - @lemons9678 “A bear people aren't gonna ask me what I was wearing when it attacked me” - @imnot.rude “A bear wouldn’t attack me & then tell his friends that I liked it” - @zoe.ebarb"

[2] X Research source One woman stated the man vs. bear question was really, “Are you afraid of men?” She then related that she didn’t feel afraid, but she was always vigilant when she ran into a man in the wilderness.

Others responded with mocking comments or violent drawings portraying how a bear could hurt a woman. A few men reacted to women’s answers to the hypothetical question in the @screenshothq video with explanations about how dangerous different types of bears are. [4] X Research source A few examples of comments included: “Y’all the regular man isn’t a grapist 💀💀💀” - @big_randy694200 “U wouldn’t have to see the man at family reunions either and bold of u to assume you’d have a chance of surviving the bear there’s a video on YouTube with the recorded dying screams of being mauled” - @mahdi.a42 “Clearly never seen a hungry grizzly bear in person” - @rods.22 “Go watch the bear scene from the revenant it will change all of your minds😭” - @zombie_eat_me “whoever picks the bear has never lived in an area populated by bears and it shows by their arguments” - @sabthealien “the chances are only lower on the bear bc there are less bear encounters” - @lucas_70910 “The point is, you have no idea what you are taling about. If really you'll have to choose, i'm pretty sure you'll choose the man” - @kipitilnick “Fr it’s 10x better to have your lungs ripped out as you are still alive it’s just the obvious answer” - @_kaze_999"

Women talked about how they are taught to go places in groups and put keys between their fingers to make a weapon to stay safe at night. [5] X Research source Not only does this lead to a mistrust of men, but it also puts responsibility for a crime on the victim instead of the criminal. [6] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Other sexual assault avoidance advice that’s often targeted toward women includes: Don’t wear headphones when jogging. Don’t wear a ponytail because they’re easy to grab. Look under and in the back seat of your car before you get in. Always pour your own drink at a party and bring it with you to the bathroom. Only check in on social media apps when you leave a location. When you move into a new home, check for hidden cameras. Take self-defense classes."
