      "title": "Clean the surface.",
      "content": "Clean the surface. Removing any dirt or oil from the surface is very important. Making a clean surface will allow the decal to adhere properly. Leaving dirt or oil behind will cause the decal to adhere to them, rather than the wall. Remove dirt and oil for best application. Remove dirt with a damp sponge. Use a small amount of soap to remove oil. Be sure the wall is dry before placing the decal."

      "title": "Adjust the placement.",
      "content": "Adjust the placement. Double check the decal is going to look great in the place you have selected. Removing a decal is possible, but most will not be reusable.

      "content": "Finalize the placement. Get your ruler and a pencil ready. Use your initial placement of the decal to help you as you draw a light guideline.

      "title": "Finalize the application.",
      "content": "Finalize the application. Using a squeegee, smooth the surface and remove any air bubbles that may be present. Leaving air bubbles can cause an uneven finish and improper adherence to a surface. [2] X Research source Work from the middle and move outwards.

Removing the paper backing will let you see the final and full effect of the decal on your space. Peel paper backing from decal slowly and carefully. Dampen the paper with water if you are having trouble removing it. If the decal pulls off with the paper backing, stop, and carefully reapply that area."
