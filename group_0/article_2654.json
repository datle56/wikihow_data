Trace the natural shape of your eye on the upper lash-line, and put a little \"flick\" at the end, it's a classic, always gorgeous look. Find your exact shade of concealer, and use that under your eyes if you have dark circles, and anywhere you may have scars etc. Use foundation if you need extra coverage or if your skin tone is uneven. To make your face appear more feminine, use a facial highlighter and apply on the high points of your face: your brow bone, your cheekbones, and the bridge of your nose. Curl your lashes and apply mascara. Using two eyeshadow colors, apply the lighter one all over the lid and the darker one in the crease. Find a lip color that works for you and use it, make sure you use a moisturizer before applying lip color. Choose one or the other if you plan on applying heavy makeup--eyes or lips."

However, avoid bright colors because they tend to fade and look cheap. Your hair should be always shiny and healthy.

Instead, use a good moisturizer for your hands at night and throughout the day as needed, paying special attention to the cuticles. Paint your nails when you can. When the paint starts to chip, take it off. Avoid false nails, or if you choose to wear them, keep them short and natural in appearance. You may also use a nail buffer to keep your nails shiny without polish."

You don't want to mix a modern looking skirt with a vintage top or anything like that, as a general rule. While sometimes you can make it work and work well, it is easy to make it look off. A good example is if you go running, wear a matching velour tracksuit, with sneakers that fit, and maybe a cute (matching) graphic tee underneath. It shows that even on your lazy days you are trying, or maybe you are so rich that this was the slouchiest outfit you could put together!"

Don't wear clothes that are too big and hang off your frame, or clothes that are too small and create bulges. You also want to avoid pants with a waist that is too low, as your bum will spill over when you move around and this will destroy your glamorous look. When you try on clothes, take three different sizes of the same item with you, one up and one down (even if you're sure of what your normal size is). Never be afraid to grab more sizes if those don't seem to work."

Don't wear clothes with holes or stains. Keep them clean, wrinkle-free, and looking sharp. Wear nice looking clothes even if you're doing things like running to the gym or doing errands.

For whatever you're going out to do, shoot for dressing just a little bit nicer than what would be normal for the situation. Don't go over the top though, wearing a ball gown to a dinner party is way too much. This will just make you come across as clownish. Try the old Hollywood glamour look. Think Marilyn Monroe and Sophia Loren—wear medium-length dresses and skirts, diamond earrings, and fur (or faux) coats paired with a red lip and short-to-medium length wavy hair. Or, go for urban chic glamour . Think Audrey Hepburn—wear trench coats, black tights, stiletto heels, little black dresses, business suits, and simple, delicate jewelry. Neutrals like black, white, and beige are your go-to, but bright colors in small amounts work too. Avoid jeans and accessorize with big sunglasses, big handbags, a watch, and natural makeup. Opt for opulent diva glamour . Wear glittery dresses, (faux) fur, diamonds, opulent gowns for the evening, metallic colors, high heels, animal prints, gold, and precious gems. The more expensive and rich-looking it is, the better (as long as it's not too tacky)."

Wear earrings that are dramatic and have some sparkle or shine, but make sure that they fit the size and shape of your neck and face. You don't want them to look too big or too small. A small, fancy necklace to wear all the time is good because it can make even casual outfits look more dressed up and intentional. A diva-ish pair of sunglasses will never go wrong. Large sizes, like those popular in the 60s, look especially glamorous. A shiny watch is almost mandatory! Just make sure it fits and if you have to, get links removed or added. Also, make sure it is a color that goes with everything in your closet and matches your skin tone. Buy a few bags that go with most of your outfits. Look for black leather bags with metallic details or white bags with golden details. Metallic bags also scream glamor. Try to avoid low-quality materials like fake leather or shiny plastic."

[11] X Research source If you want to be perceived as glamorous and fit in, you'll need to look like you love yourself and are comfortable in the skin you're in. You don't have to actually be confident but you do have to act like it [12] X Research source (although you should learn to love yourself, and the rest will fall into place.) Most people, even if they seem really self-confident, actually are not, so don't feel bad. Don't constantly apologize or defer to other people. Don't criticize yourself or put yourself down. A little self-deprecating humor is okay though. Speak up for yourself, be kind and compassionate (not stuck up or offensive), have good posture, and don't be afraid to do things that make you stand out, like talking intellectually, or about things you are passionate about."

Speaking meaningfully, like acting confident, will help create the perception of glamour. The smarter you speak, the more classy and elegant you will seem. An accent isn't necessary to make yourself seem more glamorous, so don't try to fake one. Instead, use the best grammar and vocabulary that you can. Practice speaking when you're alone, if that helps you to overcome bad habits."

Stay away from multiple different patterns, it will be too loud and distracting. The key is to look classic and fairly modern with your décor. Watch old movies to get ideas. You can also go to your local antique store and find pieces that you like."
