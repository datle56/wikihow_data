      "content": "Set an alarm to wake up about 5 hours after you fall asleep. The Wake Back to Bed (WBTB) technique helps you control your dreams by waking you up during your REM sleep cycle. This is the period of sleep where your brain is highly active and most vivid and lucid dreams occur. Simply set an alarm so you wake up about 5 hours into your sleep. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It can take a lot of practice to control your dreams using the WBTB method. If you’re having trouble growing aware that you’re dreaming, change when you wake up. REM sleep typically occurs between 4 to 6 hours after you go to sleep."

The belief is that by disrupting your REM cycle, you’ll dive back into your dreams and be aware that you’re dreaming. [3] X Research source The WBTB technique is usually most effective when it’s combined with other dream controlling methods, like the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD).

      "content": "Wake up 5 hours after falling asleep. Before you go to bed, set an alarm to wake you up about 5 hours later. This ensures that you wake up during your REM sleep cycle, which is when most dreams occur. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD) technique works similarly to the Wake Back to Bed method. By waking up during your REM sleep cycle, you’re likely to go straight back into dreaming when you fall asleep again."

      "title": "Recite your intention to have a lucid dream as you fall back asleep.",
      "content": "Recite your intention to have a lucid dream as you fall back asleep. When you wake up, repeat a mantra like, “Next time I’m dreaming, I will remember I’m dreaming” or “When I start dreaming again, I’ll be aware I’m dreaming.” Just keep reciting the mantra and focusing on your intention as you relax and lull back to sleep. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The MILD technique is believed to work through the power of suggestion. By setting your intention to have a lucid dream, you’re more likely to be aware that you’re dreaming when you fall back asleep. You might not grow aware that you’re dreaming on your first try with the MILD method. Just keep practicing each night until you do!"

      "content": "Ask yourself if you’re dreaming throughout the day. Make it a habit to ask yourself, \"Am I awake, or am I dreaming?\" several times every day. Spend a moment to take in your surroundings and notice if anything is out of place. [7] X Research source The belief is that by making your reality checking a habit, you’re more likely to ask the question in your dreams. When you ask the question in a dream, you’ll realize you aren’t awake, allowing you to take control of your dream. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Set an alarm or reminder on your phone for every 1 to 2 hours so you remember to do a reality check. When you reality check, pay attention to behaviors and situations that are impossible. For instance, trees can change colors and clocks can move backward in a dream, but they can’t in reality.

      "title": "Do physical reality checks daily, like reading or turning on the lights.",
      "content": "Do physical reality checks daily, like reading or turning on the lights. Physical tests are another way for you to make reality checks a habit and tell the difference between real life and dreams. For instance, make it a habit to read a sentence every few hours, close your eyes, and see if the sentence changes. In reality, the sentence won’t change. In your dreams, the words will change, allowing you to realize that you’re dreaming. [10] X Research source Sleep medicine and psychiatry professional Dr. Alex Dimitriu says reading is a great reality check because “you can't read print in a dream.” So, when you catch yourself reading in a dream, “you can realize that you're sleeping.” [11] X Expert Source Alex Dimitriu, MD Sleep Specialist Expert Interview. 16 October 2019. Try other physical reality checks, like: [12] X Research source Turning on a light switch: In real life, the lights come on. But in your dreams, nothing might happen or your hand might pass through the switch. Looking in the mirror: In reality, you’ll see your face looking back at you. In your dreams, your reflection might change or distort. Press your fingers into your hand: In real life, your fingers can’t pass through your palm. In your dreams, they might pass through or morph together."

Try to contain your excitement so you don’t wake up and simply observe what’s happening in your dream. When you calm down, start changing and controlling the content of your dream. [13] X Research source Start with small activities, like cooking food, jumping, climbing a ladder, or skateboarding. Simply imagine and concentrate on what you want to do or see. Gradually work your way up to bigger changes so you don’t accidentally wake yourself up. Use the same imagination and concentration technique to change the scenery in your dream, conjure up people and things, or fly."

Be as specific as possible, focusing on what you were doing, what you saw, where you were, who you were with, and how you felt. [14] X Research source Date each dream and note anything visually striking that you experienced. Write down if there were any conflicts or problems, too. Writing down your dreams trains your mind to better recall your dreams. This can help you grow aware that you’re dreaming.

Look for any repeating objects, people, symbols, or situations between your dreams. Being aware of the patterns in your dreams can help you notice specific symbols while you’re dreaming, triggering you to realize you’re dreaming. [16] X Research source Reflecting on how the dream relates to emotions and situations you’re experiencing in your real life can also help you grow aware of your dreams. For instance, you might notice that a lot of your dreams feature a green frog. Knowing that frogs often show up in your dreams can help you look for them in your sleep and take control of your dreams."

Spend a few minutes before bed writing down what you want your dream to look like, what you want to do, where you want to go, and who or what you want to see. Get as detailed as possible and include even the smallest of things you want to experience. Read through your ideal dream a few times after you jot it down. Write down the plot or narrative you want to experience in the dream, too. Drawing pictures of how you want the dream to look is also super helpful.

[22] X Research source To walk through your dream , imagine: The setting and objects you see. Add more details as you focus harder on the dream. The sounds you hear. Listen for sounds related to the setting you’re in or people you expect to talk to. What you physically feel.

How you mentally feel. Visualize yourself being relaxed, happy, excited, or however you expect to feel in the dream. Stay focused on your dream.
