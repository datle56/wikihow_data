      "title": "Add more context.",
      "content": "Add more context. Give ChatGPT some more information about your last query. If your prompt was vague, ChatGPT may not know how to answer it and may respond with an error. Add some more context to what you are asking to see if ChatGPT can understand what you are looking for."

      "title": "Split up longer conversations.",
      "content": "Split up longer conversations. ChatGPT may glitch if the conversation is too long. ChatGPT's hidden character limit may be the culprit. If you're providing an especially long prompt or requesting a very long output, you might see \"conversation not found\" in the middle of your conversation. Your prompt and ChatGPT's reply count toward the limit of about 3125 words, so make sure your interaction doesn't exceed that limit. Try breaking your prompts up into pieces, or ask for shorter responses. If ChatGPT cuts off in the middle of a sentence during a reply, you can respond with \"go on\" or \"keep going\" to continue the reply."
