Getting outdoors and focusing on nature can be even more helpful. Taking a walk will help you burn off some of that negative energy instantly and can help you get away from the problem.

      "content": "Control your first impulse. If you're prone to fits of anger, then it's likely that your first impulse is not a good one. Maybe you want to kick your car, punch a wall, or scream at someone. Instead of acting on this initial impulse, ask yourself if what you want to do is a really good and productive thing to do. Take a minute to understand how you should really act and to consider what would calm you down the most. Your first impulse may often be violent, destructive, and completely irrational. Don't make things worse for yourself by giving in to this kind of impulse."

If this method really works for you, then you can even pick your go-to dance song to play every time you feel yourself getting overwhelmed by anger."

Try to keep your body calm while you do this, so that the only thing you have to worry about are the numbers. Focusing on this simple and concrete task will keep you from being overwhelmed in the moment and will make you face your problem with a more even head. If you're still angry, repeat the exercise, or even count back from 100."

[4] X Research source Therefore, if you are feeling as though you are going to lose control of your temper, give yourself a little mental vacation through meditation.

[5] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Take slow, deep breaths. Maintaining this breathing will likely bring down your elevated heart rate. Your breaths should be deep enough that your belly extends on the “in” breath.

Making a habit of meditating every morning, even when you're not angry, will make you feel more calm in general."

      "content": "Turn on your positive thoughts. You can help reduce your anger by trying to focus more clearly on your positive thoughts.

      "content": "Use cognitive restructuring. This means changing the way that you think about things. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source It can be easy to focus on the things that are making you angry to such an extent that you will begin to believe irrational things, like that everything in your life is bad. Cognitive restructuring encourages you to use rational and positive thoughts to have a more positive view of what is going on in your life. For example, you might think “everything that happens to me is bad.” However, if you think rationally about things that happen to you, you may realize that a mix of good and bad things happen: you could get a flat tire, find a dollar on the ground, get in trouble at work, and get a surprise gift from a friend all in one day. This is a mix of good and bad, and if you spend more time focusing on the good in the group, you may feel better about your life. Another example of replacing negative thoughts with positive is changing \"This always happens, and I can't stand it anymore!\" to \"This has happened a lot, and I've dealt with it successfully in the past; I will get through this.\""

You may be making yourself more angry by instantly saying the first thing that comes to your head, which may lead you to fire yourself up, make the other person more angry, and generally to make the situation look and feel worse than it really is.
