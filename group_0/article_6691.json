      "content": "Practice gratitude. Start by writing a gratitude list of perhaps 5 things that you're grateful for. Each day, strive to add another 5 things to that list. By continually searching for things to be grateful for, you'll start to automatically focus on the positive side of things that happen in your life, rather than the negative side. [1] X Research source Remember that even though you might have little control over something that's happened in your life, you do have control over how you interpret and respond to that thing. For example, if you're having to deal with a difficult or toxic person, you might think about how grateful you are to have people in your life who are comforting and supportive."

Repeat this affirmation to yourself 3 times a day for about 5 minutes at a time. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if you struggle with public speaking, you might create an affirmation like \"I am intelligent and have important things to say.\" Watch out that you're not overly positive though—you have to believe your affirmation for it to work. Certified life coach Sydney Axelrod recommends positive affirmations as \"another avenue of strengthening a new belief or a new perspective that's really supportive for you... it's just a practice of believing something that's more supportive about yourself.\" Love and transformation coach Jennifer Butler adds, \"I always have an active and alive intention that I am using to help me stay focused on where I am going next. This intention helps me make choices and guides me to know what I need to learn and where I need to grow in my daily life as this intention becomes realized in my life.\""

The practice encourages you to dig deep and explore the inner beliefs you have and the stories you tell yourself so you can identify the problematic ones and work to change them. [3] X Research source Start this practice by setting aside 5 to 10 minutes a day to just write about something that's on your mind. After you've written your journal entry, you might take another 5 to 10 minutes to reflect on what you've written."

      "content": "Engage in mindfulness exercises. Through mindfulness, you start to do things consciously with intention, rather than going through life on autopilot. Starting a regular meditation practice is a great way to work toward becoming more mindful . The best part is this practice only takes a few minutes a day and can jumpstart big changes in your mindset and your life that you'll probably notice pretty quickly. [4] X Research source Doing breathing exercises is a great way to pull yourself back into the present when you find yourself slipping out of mindfulness.

You might make a list of things you're proud of accomplishing or a list of things that you're really good at. Then, allow yourself to celebrate those things rather than constantly criticizing yourself for your perceived faults. [5] X Research source Celebrating your strengths doesn't mean that you don't acknowledge your weaknesses. It just means that you see those weaknesses as opportunities for improvement rather than reasons you're not good enough."

Let go of any assumptions you might have and ask questions that help you better understand someone else's perspective. Then, allow yourself to internalize that perspective and learn from it to expand your own consciousness and view of the world. [7] X Research source If you feel like this is going to be tough for you, start with small, relatively inconsequential things. For example, if a friend of yours likes a band that you're not too keen on, you might ask them what they enjoy most about that band or how the music makes them feel."

[10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source There are also ways that you can incorporate activity into your normal routine, such as parking further away from your destination so you can get some steps in, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator.

For example, if you don't think you can walk 5 flights of stairs to your office, you could start by walking up 2 flights and then taking the elevator the rest of the way."
