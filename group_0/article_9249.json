Look for the trapezoid-shaped \"HDMI\" label that's most likely on the back of your TV and fit the cable securely into the socket. [1] X Research source This is the highest quality connection for audio and video and is typically found only on modern DVD players. If you are attempting to connect a Blu-Ray or 4K UHD player, you will almost certainly find an HDMI port on the back of the device."

      "content": "Ensure that both HDMI connections are secure. An HDMI connection only requires one cable that carries both audio and video signal, and it does not matter which end of the cable goes where. But if the cable is pulled too tightly, or one of the connections is loose, you may not get a good signal. You can buy a new HDMI cable at many retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, and Amazon."
