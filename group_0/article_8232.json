      "content": "Hold saline-soaked gauze against the piercing for 5 minutes. Dip clean gauze or paper towels into homemade or store-bought saline solution and gently press it on the piercing for 5 minutes. This should loosen any crusty bits of skin near the piercing and they'll come away when you pat the piercing dry. Don't pick off the crusty bits when the skin is dry or you could irritate the skin. Some medical professionals recommend gently turning the jewelry while your skin is wet to help the saline work into the piercing. Never twist the jewelry while your skin is dry or you could slow the healing process. If your body piercing can be submerged, lower it into homemade saline solution and soak for about 5 minutes. To submerge your piercing, fill your tub with a few inches of water and stir in salt until it's diluted. You could also use a sitz bath to soak genital piercings."

      "content": "Clean your piercing 2 times a day until the piercing has healed. Although you may think that cleaning your piercing even more can help it heal faster, cleaning too often can dry out your skin. Plan on cleaning the piercing just twice a day until the piercing is completely healed. Healing time will depend on what type of body piercing you got. For example, pierced ears take up to 4 months to heal while a naval, genital, or nipple piercing takes up to 6 months. Most oral or facial piercings will heal within 8 weeks."
