      "content": "Place the crabs into the ice bath using long metal tongs. Crabs’ claws are sharp and, before you submerge them, the crabs are likely to be active. Be careful not to get pinched. Submerging live crabs in ice water puts them into a dormant state. [2] X Research source This makes the boiling process more humane and also makes it easier to place them into the pot to boil."

      "content": "Leave the crabs to sit in the ice bath for 5-10 minutes. This is enough time to put the crabs into their dormant state. [3] X Research source Before you remove them, however, you’ll want to make sure that they are inactive. Use long metal tongs to pull one crab out of the ice bath. If it is still moving around, put it back in and add more ice if necessary."

      "content": "Remove the crabs from the ice bath only when you're ready to boil them. You’ll want to make sure the crabs are still in a dormant state when you submerge them in boiling water, so it’s important to have your pot of water ready to go when you take them out of the ice bath.

      "content": "Fill a large stockpot with water until it’s about ¾ full. You don’t want to overcrowd the crabs, so it’s important to use enough water to submerge them with a little room to spare while they cook. [5] X Research source A 5 or 6 gallon stockpot is ideal.

      "content": "Add ½ cup of sea salt, 2 sliced lemons, and 3 tbsp of Old Bay seasoning . Stir these ingredients in with the water. This will provide added flavor to the crab and the salt will also increase the boiling point of the water, helping to cook the crab more thoroughly.

[8] X Research source You should also be able to stir the water without disturbing the boil. You’ll want to keep this rolling boil going while you add the crabs and throughout the entire cooking process. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Lower the crabs headfirst into the water carefully to avoid splashing. [10] X Research source The best way to do this is to take the crabs out of the ice bath one by one using long metal tongs, and gently drop each one into the pot of boiling water. This process is much easier because the crabs are already in a dormant state. Put the crabs in a boiling basket and lower it into the water. That way, it's easier to pull them all out when they're finished cooking. [11] X Research source [​​v162186_b01]. 16 October 2022."

You’ll want to cool the crabs off as quickly as possible to make sure they don’t continue to cook in their shells after you’ve pulled them out. You can use the same bucket or sink you used when you put the crabs to sleep. Simply add more ice, and then use tongs to transfer the crabs from the boiling water to the ice bath.

If you’re in a casual setting, laying down newspaper can be a great way to protect your table and make cleaning up easier. [16] X Research source If you’re in a more formal setting, you can always lay newspaper down under a fancier table cloth."
