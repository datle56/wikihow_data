      "content": "Purchasing more basic eggs can help. The more bees you have in your hive, the more pollen you will get per second. You can also unlock more places, such as the pro shop, with more bees. Bees can also help you attack so you can get rewards from rhino beetles, ladybugs, and more. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Tiny glowing bees (fireflies) will come down to a random field at night. They will settle someplace on the ground, and if you walk on top of them, you can get many rewards. Usually, they will also leave at least one moon charm. If you have 100 moon charms, you can use them to make one moon amulet, which can give helpful buffs. There is also a chance of a Vicious Bee spawning! You can get stingers by defeating it, which you can use to get a Vicious Bee after you get 250."

      "content": "If you have 20 bees and an ant pass, you can do the ant challenge! Everything you collect there instantly converts into honey, so you can get a lot of honey quickly. You have to fight ants as a bar gradually goes higher until you go to the next round. You have a few minutes to do it. After you finish, you get tons of rewards.

Using a star jelly can transform a bee into a randomly gifted bee, and using a star treat turns a bee gifted. Be careful on what you use star jelly and star treats on as they are very rare. Try to use star treats on a bee that already has good stats so you can improve them even more."
