      "content": "Listen to your parents. It's important to remember that your parents have more life experience than you; therefore, they know more than you. [1] X Research source In fact, there's a saying “Father knows best.” So, no matter how much you think you know, your parents will know more and will know what's best for you. By paying attention to your parents, you are letting them know that you care about hearing what they have to say. [2] X Research source There are some things that you can do to show your parents that you're not only listening, but you're actually hearing them. Give your parents your undivided attention. You are demonstrating to your parents that you're open to communicating with them and you respect what they have to say. Don't try to talk over your parents while they are talking. This is a sure sign that you're more interested in talking rather than listening. Don't be rude by talking back to your parents or by interrupting them with rude remarks. Making rude comments creates tension and things can quickly escalate. Avoid pouting, whining, throwing a tantrum, or making gestures and faces to indicate your irritation with your parents. Don't ignore your parents when they are talking to you or asking you to do something. By ignoring your parents, you're showing them that what they have to say doesn't really matter, which may cause them to become agitated and upset."

Remember that they are your parents and not your friends. If they ask you to do something, make sure that you do it even if it doesn't make sense to you or you don't feel like doing it. Make sure that you do your chores. It's best if your parents don't have to keep asking you to do your chores. If you know what you have to do, whether it's daily or weekly, make sure that you get it done. Don't be lazy. One of the best things that you can do for your parents is to be helpful. Not only is it important to do your personal chores, but you can offer additional help with things like yardwork, putting the groceries away, preparing meals, doing the laundry, walking the dog, and washing the car."

      "content": "Avoid arguing with your parents. It's common to think that your parents are wrong and you're right. Even if you are right, you don't have to prove you're right by arguing with your parents. There's a saying “You don't want to win the battle and lose the war.” It's okay to disagree with your parents, but by constantly arguing with your parents, you run the risk of shutting down future communication between you and your parents. Be patient throughout your conversation with your parents. Avoid raising your voice by calmly stating your point of view. Allow your parents an opportunity to share their point of view. This doesn’t mean you can’t ask questions! If you don’t understand what they’re asking you to do—or why they’re even asking in the first place—respectfully ask for more info."

      "content": "Use proper manners when interacting with your parents. The way that you respond to your parents demonstrates how much you truly respect them. It's important that you speak to them in a respectful manner. It helps to use phrases like “yes, ma'am,” “no, sir,” “please,” and “may I” when addressing your parents, as well as using a respectful tone. Avoid screaming and yelling at your parents, even if you feel like they don't hear you. Don't make demands to your parents. Remember they are not obligated to do what you want them to do. The slang that you use when you address your friends is not the same language you should use when you address your parents. So, terms like “dude” or “chick” and “girlie” should not be used with your parents. Whenever you're ending a phone call with your parents, make sure that you say “goodbye.” Never just hang up without saying anything."

It’s okay to express yourself and say how you feel so long as you’re respectful. Determining what you want to achieve from the conversation can help you stay focused on what's important. [3] X Research source Maybe you are unclear about your parents expectations of you. Don't be afraid to ask them, and be willing to listen without interrupting. If you simply need to tell them about something that's bothering you, and you don't necessarily want their advice, make sure that you communicate that in the beginning. When your parents notice that something is bothering and they ask you, be honest and tell them exactly what's wrong. Don't deny it; it will only fester inside of you."

Don't challenge their authority. Never try to manipulate them into giving you what you want. If you ever want to state your case after being told “no,” try writing it out in a letter.
