      "content": "Group stickers by color for an aesthetically pleasing laptop. It's totally fine to start applying stickers at random, but your laptop might look chaotic or disorganized. To decorate your laptop with a balanced look, choose stickers in shades that harmonize, and group similarly-colored stickers together. [1] X Research source For example, you may want to stick with black and white stickers, but add a few green stickers so they really stand out. Have fun with color! You could use stickers in just one color so it really stands out. For example, get stickers in bright yellow, pale yellow, and neon yellow."

      "content": "Distance big stickers away from each other, and fill in gaps with little stickers. Play around with positioning the stickers to find a balance you like. This is really important if you've got stickers that are of different sizes. To make a balanced aesthetic, lay a few large stickers on each side of the case before you unpeel the stickers. These make the background. Then, arrange smaller stickers around them to fill in the space. Once you're happy with the arrangement, peel the backs off the stickers and apply them."

      "content": "Show off unique shapes by sticking them on top. Got stickers with cool shapes? Don't crowd them or overlap stickers—you want to see the distinctive shape. Instead of laying down the unique shape first, stick it on last so it's on top and really visible. For example, if you've got cool hexagonal-shaped stickers, try arranging them in a honeycomb pattern. This way, they're not overlapping and you can clearly see the fun shape."

      "content": "Stickerbomb your laptop if you want complete coverage. Get lots of stickers so you can overlap them. Sticker bombing is fun! You just need a lot of stickers—you can buy big packs online or in novelty stores. Look through the package to choose which stickers you want to put on the laptop. Then, practice laying them out so they overlap, or just go wild. Put the stickers you really want to showcase on last so they're not covered. To make your sticker-bombed case look polished, take a craft knife and carefully slice along the edges of the case to trim stickers that are poking out."

      "content": "Place stickers inside the laptop for private decoration. Stickers can be really personal! You may not feel like explaining your choice of stickers to strangers whenever you set up your laptop in public. If you want a little extra privacy, just stick them on the flat surfaces to the sides of your built-in mousepad. This is a great way to cover up stickers that were already on your laptop when you bought it."

      "title": "Limit the number of stickers with quotes or words.",
      "content": "Limit the number of stickers with quotes or words. It's completely fine to have a few stickers with quotes—just try not to overdo it. Too many quotes are hard to read and can make your laptop look crowded or messy. The same goes for stickers with slogans or single words."

      "title": "Apply the stickers so the bottoms are toward the hinge of the laptop.",
      "content": "Apply the stickers so the bottoms are toward the hinge of the laptop. This will make it so other people see them right-side up when the laptop is open. This definitely isn't a requirement, but most people prefer to place their stickers this way! Or, position them so that they’re right-side up when the laptop is closed and facing you, so you can enjoy them more. You might also choose to make it a mish-mash of stickers facing all different directions, for a bit of organized chaos."

      "title": "Choose stickers that show your interests.",
      "content": "Choose stickers that show your interests. Collect stickers of your favorite hobbies, destinations, bands, or art. Your favorite businesses or companies probably sell stickers that would look awesome on your laptop! If you're not into promoting businesses, find stickers that show your unique personality through quotes, art, food, popular characters, pop culture, or places you've been. For example, you might have a sticker with a favorite quote, stickers from bands you've seen, or stickers from teams you follow. A lot of people put a sticker on their laptops to show where they're from. You might find that this is a great icebreaker—someone may come up to you and talk about your hometown! Etsy is a great place to find stickers, or order laptop stickers in bulk from Amazon."

      "title": "Wipe away oil and dirt on the laptop with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Wipe away oil and dirt on the laptop with rubbing alcohol. If you're like most people, you probably don't clean your laptop as often as it needs it. IT professional Jeremy Mercer says to use rubbing alcohol on your electronics. To help your stickers stay attached, dip a cloth in rubbing alcohol and gently rub it over the outside of your laptop where you'll be putting the stickers. If you've got sticky adhesive stuck on your laptop, you may need to rub it a little harder with your cloth or try a gunk and adhesive-removing product. Avoid soaking the laptop with alcohol; a slightly dampened cloth is all you need. Also, remove stickers the same way: peel them off as best you can, then use rubbing alcohol to wipe away the gunk."

      "content": "Lay stickers on the surface, then rub them with your thumb. When applying stickers, start by laying down one edge of the sticker, then roll the rest on, like you’re peeling it off in reverse. This can help avoid bubbles. Then, use your thumb to rub the sticker onto the surface, making sure it sticks. Avoid the temptation to peel off and reapply stickers. It can work, but the adhesive is weakened. Stay zen about it, even if it bugs you."

      "content": "Avoid covering ports or vents with stickers. It's easy to get carried away with covering your laptop, but be careful! If you cover outlets and vents, your laptop can overheat and stop working, or gunk might get into the ports. This may even happen if you apply thick layers of stickers on the laptop's smooth case because the stickers act as insulators. [2] X Research source Not sure if you're putting too many stickers on? When in doubt, stop putting stickers on and pay attention to how your laptop functions. If it's fine, go ahead and add a few more stickers."
