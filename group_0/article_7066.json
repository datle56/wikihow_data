Run your fingers through your cat’s fur and part it so you can see the skin underneath. Examine their fur and skin closely to look for fleas or other signs of infestation, like skin irritation, hair loss, or crusty bumps. Check your cat’s entire body, paying special attention to their belly and the base of their tail. [1] X Research source A great way to secure your cat is by setting them on a white sheet or pillowcase. The white fabric will allow you to see any fleas or flea dirt you might dislodge. Fleas are dark brown, wingless insects about 1-2 mm in length. They may jump away as you work."

The flea comb will catch and trap fleas, flea eggs, and flea dirt that are in your cat’s coat. Pay particular attention to the back of the neck, the base of the tail, and the insides of your cat’s legs. [2] X Research source Be sure to use a flea comb and not a regular pet comb. Flea combs are specifically designed to trap fleas because the comb’s teeth are so close together the fleas cannot escape."

Even if you don't find jumping fleas, you may find flea eggs , which resemble grains of salt or sand, or flea dirt (excrement), which resembles black pepper. To determine if a fleck is flea dirt or just regular dirt, place it on a damp paper towel. Flea excrement contains blood, so it will turn red when wet.

[5] X Research source Even cats that are not allergic will experience irritation and itching from individual bites. This triggers excessive grooming behavior. Your cat may clean itself so often and thoroughly that it removes patches of hair and some adult fleas, which is why it’s possible for your cat to have an infestation even if you can’t find them. It may also be harder to spot fleas since they hop onto the cat to feed and then hop off again."
