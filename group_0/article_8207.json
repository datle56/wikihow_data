      "content": "Clean the inside of the film chamber using a blower. A blower is a small, rubber device that puffs air out of it when you squeeze it. Open the film chamber and turn the camera so the film chamber is facing downward. Angle the blower so it’s pointing inside the film chamber and then squeeze it to puff air out and blow away any particles. [2] X Research source You can find a blower at most stores that sell cameras and camera equipment, or online."

      "title": "Use the blower to remove any particles on the outside of the camera body.",
      "content": "Use the blower to remove any particles on the outside of the camera body. Go around the entire exterior of the camera with the blower, blowing away any dust or particle buildup. It’s important to do this before wiping down the camera with a cloth, as any leftover particles could be dragged across the camera’s surface when you’re wiping it down, leaving scratches.

      "content": "Use a cloth soaked in a cleaning solution to wipe down the camera. Use a cleaning solution and a cloth specifically designed for cameras. Make sure the cloth you’re using doesn’t have too much solution on it; you don’t want liquid dripping onto the camera and seeping into the cracks. If you don’t have access to a camera-cleaning cloth, use a cotton swab or wrap a toothpick in a cotton pad. [4] X Research source"

Then hold the blower close to your lens and squeeze to puff out air and blow away any particles. [9] X Research source Avoid using your mouth to blow air onto your camera lens. The saliva from your mouth can coat and damage the lens."

Avoid using facial tissue or your t-shirt to wipe your lens down. For the best results, use a cleaner designed for camera lenses. You can also use reagent-grade isopropyl alcohol or de-ionized water. [11] X Expert Source Cory Ryan Professional Photographer Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. Always apply your lens cleaner to a cloth or tissue and not directly on your camera lens.

      "content": "Avoid over-cleaning your camera lens. Camera lenses are durable pieces of glass, but over-exposing them to cleaning chemicals and physical contact can lead to unnecessary damage. Avoid touching your camera lens when you’re taking photos so you don’t have to clean it as often. Don’t clean your lens every time you see a few specks of dust; some dust is OK and will not impact the quality of your images. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Store your camera and lens in a case when you’re not using them. Use a case specifically designed to hold a camera. Keeping your camera and lens in a proper storage container will keep them dry and prevent any dirt or grime build up.
