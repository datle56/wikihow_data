      "content": "Flip your hair over and blot it dry in sections. Use your fingers to gently pull apart strands of hair into separate sections, leaving your natural waves as intact as possible. Use a soft microfiber towel to blot each section of hair dry, starting at the roots and working down to the tips. When you let your hair air dry without separating it into sections, the mass of wet hair tends to clump up as it dries instead of separating into well-defined curls. Don't towel your hair dry roughly, since this can cause it to get frizzy. Just gently blot your hair dry to the tips."

      "content": "Apply curl-defining gel or lotion. Instead of running it through your hair from the roots to the tips, rub some product between your palms and cup your hair from the bottom, gently scrunching each section of hair from the bottom and using your fingers to apply it to the length of your hair. This will help your curls stay bouncy instead of weighing them down. As you apply the product, squeeze your hair gently to help lift up the curls."

After it has air-dried to the point where it's no longer dripping, flip your hair upside down. Use the diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair in sections, pointing up from the bottom instead of drying from the top down. Lift the section you're drying onto the diffuser and gently push up with the diffuser to help define your curls. Continue section by section until your hair is mostly dry. Drying your hair without the diffuser will blow out your curls, so make sure you use the attachment. At this point, handle your hair with your fingers as little as possible; let the diffuser do the work. Handling your hair too much will lead to frizzing."

      "title": "Wash your hair sparingly.",
      "content": "Wash your hair sparingly. Curly or kinky hair tends to be a little drier and coarser than straight hair. Since it has a spiral shape, the natural oils produced by the scalp don't make it all the way to the tips, resulting in hair that isn't naturally as conditioned as straight hair. Curlier hair requires a different sort of treatment from straighter hair, and that starts with washing it less often. [2] X Research source If you wash your hair every day, try cutting back to just two times a week and see if you notice that your curls are less dry. Everyone's hair texture and oil level is a little different, so experiment and see what works for you. It might take a few weeks before you figure out how many times a week you need to wash your hair to keep it clean but also well conditioned."

      "content": "Consider washing with conditioner instead of shampoo. Many people with curly or kinky hair have switched from regular shampooing to the co-wash method. They have found that washing with conditioner instead of shampoo gets it just as clean without drying it out. [3] X Expert Source Bianca Cox Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 9 May 2019. Conditioner moisturizes coils and keeps them in good shape, rather than pulling them apart. Look for a conditioner that does not contain silicones. These make your hair shiny at first, but eventually they build up and leave curls looking weighed down and dull. If you choose to use shampoo, get one that's sulfate-free or is labeled as moisturizing or nourishing. Sulfates are a cleansing agent that dry out hair, cause frizz, and they wreak havoc on a curly head."

You can actually use your normal conditioner as a deep conditioner; just leave it in your hair for a few hours before rinsing it out. If you're up for experimenting, try adding different different deep conditioning treatments to find one that works with your curls. Here are a few common natural conditioners: Honey. Mix 2 tablespoons of honey with 2 tablespoons of water. Work the mixture through your hair section by section. Let it sit for an hour, then rinse it out. OIive oil or coconut oil.

This type of hair never really needs to be brushed. If you need to detangle your hair, finger-comb it section by section, or use a wide-tooth comb if you don't have tight coils. If your hair is more wavy than curly, you can use a boar-bristle brush to brush your hair, but only when it's dry. A boar-bristle brush is made with bristles that are similar to the texture of your hair, so it won't damage your curls. It's used to help move your scalp's natural oils down the length of your hair."

When it's done the wrong way, you can end up with a style that just doesn't look right with your hair texture. Do some research to find a stylist who's experienced in cutting curly hair. Look online for reviews, or ask your curly-haired friends for a recommendation. Tell the stylist you want to avoid triangle hair, and see what he or she says. Anyone experienced in cutting curly hair knows what this means. Triangle hair is when the heavy curls grow in the shape of a triangular helmet. A good stylist will be able to cut the curls in such a way that they have better shape and movement. If a stylist wants to \"thin\" your hair with thinning shears, that's a red flag. Thinning shears can cause curly hair to frizz."

It's better to let your curls air dry or diffuse on a low setting so your hair retains its bounce and stays hydrated. Finger-comb your curls section by section, then let them air dry so they stay bouncy and sleek.
