      "content": "Program your calculator. Write a program the day before the test. Under the \"program\" function on your calculator, type in formulas or cheat notes. Lots of teachers now check the programs on calculators. So you could also put your notes under the \"Vars\" (Variables) button in one of the 10 Strings listed. Putting your cheat notes in different sections of the calculator will make it harder for your teacher to locate them if they search. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Send a text via your smartphone to a friend.",
      "content": "Send a text via your smartphone to a friend. Send a quick text with the question to a friend you trust - and who is good at math! It's probably best to try someone not currently in the test with you, who could send you formulas and answers as needed."

      "title": "Send a text via your smartphone to a tutoring service.",
      "content": "Send a text via your smartphone to a tutoring service. Try \"Text a Tutor\", a service that gives you access to a real math tutor via your smartphone. You can send in your questions via a text message or email in pictures of the questions. [2] X Research source Response times are usually within 10 minutes. If you think you'll need a quicker turnaround time, get in touch with the service in advance to book the time. \"Text a Tutor\" has an app that you can download to your Android phone. For iPhone and other smartphone users, you can still use the service even without an app."

      "title": "Use the PhotoMath app on your phone.",
      "content": "Use the PhotoMath app on your phone. The app takes a picture of the equation and solves it immediately. [3] X Research source This app is especially good if your test requires you to show the steps in solving a question, as you have the option to see the different steps (rather than just the answer). This app isn't just for cheating; it's also good for studying. You can use it as a learning tool and understand how to solve math problems step-by-step."

      "title": "Find the answer to the question online.",
      "content": "Find the answer to the question online. You could use a general search engine like Google or, better yet, type the question in WolframAlpha.com. Wolfram Alpha is a computational knowledge engine; in other words, the site answers questions using data it has already sourced. Unlike a standard search engine, then, this site provides you with an answer, rather than a list of web pages that could have the answer. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that using a cell phone is a very obvious way of cheating. There is an increased likelihood that you will be caught, as teachers and instructors are on the lookout for cell phones during the test. In many testing situations, you are required to put your phone away in your backpack or at the front of the room, meaning that this method won't work at all for you."

      "title": "Whisper or pass notes.",
      "content": "Whisper or pass notes. Engaging in contact with a friend during the test is definitely a potential way to cheat, but it's a high risk method. In most testing situations, whispering, talking, and passing notes between test-takers is not permitted. It's also pretty easy to catch from a distance."

    {
      "title": "Use the tapping method.",
      "content": "Use the tapping method. This method is an updated version of Morse code, which involves communicating with another person with predetermined signals. Find a friend in your class who be a good partner for this. This should ideally be someone who isn't very far from you (ideally next to you) and someone who knows the subject well. Develop a tapping code. For example, tap 5 times for number 5. If it's a number like 2647, tap your pencil on the desk 2 times, pause for about 3 seconds, and then tap it 6 times and so on. If it's a multiple choice test using the alphabet, try coding A, B, C, D, E, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively. You could also try different versions of this method that operate on the same principle. Instead of tapping, cough or sneeze to communicate an answer. You could also use sign language - especially fingers for methods - to communicate with a friend."

      "title": "Engage in misdirection.",
      "content": "Engage in misdirection. Have a friend create a distraction while you cheat (or vice versa). Your friend, for example, might pretend to feel sick so that the instructor's attention is diverted away from you and other students and placed solely onto him or her. This will give you a bit of time to consult notes or other aids you've prepared to help you cheat."

    {
      "title": "Use a pen.",
      "content": "Use a pen. Get a pen that can be unscrewed and stuffed with notes. A good pen for this would be one that you can unscrew for removing and replacing ink cartridges. Empty the pen and write small notes that you then roll up tightly and fit inside the pen. You could use a mechanical pencil. You can also buy barrel pens. These are pens with a small window that click to rotate messages. You could also purchase a special pen that has a roll of paper included in its side that you just roll out and roll back in. You might want to pull out the notes while taking a bathroom break. There's less of a chance of getting caught this way! Get rid of notes. Once you're finished with the notes, throw them away, preferably somewhere not close to the location where the test was. If you do throw them away in the classroom, shred the paper to cover your tracks."

      "title": "Use your shoes.",
      "content": "Use your shoes. Tape notes to the bottom of your shoes. During the test, rest on your outer foot and turn your head down at angle so you can see the notes. Try not to look to obvious doing this; make it look like you are just stretching your neck. You could put cheat sheets or notes into your shoes and take them out as needed. Keep in mind, though, that notes are hard to remove from your shoes during a test without attracting attention. This method might work if you take a bathroom break, however."

      "title": "Write notes on your clothes.",
      "content": "Write notes on your clothes. Write formulas and other material that wil help you on the inside of your sleeve (on the underside of your wrist). Then, wear a sweater over top of that shirt. This will help not make it too obvious when you pull back the first sleeve to see the notes written on the inside of the second. You could also tape pieces of paper into a hood or hat liner."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write on your body.",
      "content": "Write on your body. Using an ink that is close to your skin tone, write notes onto ankles, legs, arms and hands - basically anywhere that is visible to you but not too visible to the outside eye. You could also try wearing shorts or a skirt and writing the formulas just above the line that your shorts cover. Lift them slightly if you get stuck, and then cover them back. Instructors and teachers might be too embarrassed or worried about confronting you if you cheat this way because it would involve them having to investigate your body."

      "content": "Write on the desk. Write notes on the desk in pencil and then remove and wipe away after you're finished to get rid of the evidence."

      "title": "Use tape.",
      "content": "Use tape. Write your formulas on tape, place the tape on your leg, place another piece of tape on top so it doesn't bleed, and voila! This works best for people with long pants/skirts."
