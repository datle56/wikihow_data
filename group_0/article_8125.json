      "content": "Sweep out loose food with a paper towel or a soft brush. A toothbrush with soft bristles is great for sweeping the crumbs that aren't stuck on out of the waffle iron grooves. But a paper towel works just as well if you don't have an extra toothbrush handy! [2] X Research source To clean mini waffle irons or irons with narrow grooves, wrap a paper towel around the end of a chopstick or toothpick. Then use the chopstick or toothpick to push the paper towel through the grooves and scoop out pieces of food."

Then, using a spoon or a soft toothbrush, spread the paste wherever you see stuck-on food or stains on the waffle iron grid. Use this deep cleaning technique whether your waffle maker irons are removable or fixed inside the appliance!"

They'll scratch the waffle iron's non-stick coating and ruin the appliance's finish. For the same reason, don't use metal utensils like forks or knives to pry cooked waffles out of the waffle maker. A spatula made out of silicone or rubber is a better choice. [8] X Research source"

So go ahead and lightly oil it regardless. [10] X Research source"
