      "title": "Evaluate your current social situation.",
      "content": "Evaluate your current social situation. Are you a wallflower, an outcast, or an outgoing girl? Knowing where you stand can help you gain perspective on what you need to do to gain preppy status. Typically, preppy girls are outgoing and extroverted. They like to be popular but still remain in a medium to large group of friends rather than being the center of attention."

      "title": "Opt to learn and do well in school.",
      "content": "Opt to learn and do well in school. Always strive to get good grades in school. Listen to the teacher, take short but effective notes, ask questions, and always do your homework If you can't attend a private school, at least try to take advanced placement (AP) or accelerated courses in almost everything you can. If your school offers electives, choose preparatory vocational training classes (such as culinary, architecture, or agricultural science) rather than an \"easy A\" class. Taking a student council or a physical education class is also good. Try to focus your high school career on getting good grades and participating in clubs, sports, and organizations. It's okay to have fun sometimes, but it's important to realize that school is important. Use your school's resources (pre-ACT/SAT classes, tutoring, library, etc.) and try your best to earn scholarships! Take a foreign language if your school offers it. Many universities require 2-3 years of a foreign language for admission, and you will look very educated. Preps take education very seriously, and can always hold up a conversation about any topic; be very well-rounded. Reading is very classy and helps you expand your vocabulary and learn more stuff. Make it a goal to read at least 2 books a month."

      "title": "Have good manners and class.",
      "content": "Have good manners and class. This is definitely the most important aspect of being preppy. Real preps are always polite and kind. Preps are never rude, mean, or unpleasant. They are never bullies, and should always be able to make others feel good about themselves. Don't get too obnoxious when around strangers, just say a simple and polite \"Hi.\" When eating dinner with others, make sure to keep clean and not make a huge mess after you're finished. Preps do little to no cursing. They treat adults with respect and follow their rules. They surround themselves with positive, kind people, much like themselves. They are people you can go to with a problem, and they will help. Try not to swear or do anything unhygienic in public. Always say please and thank you, and greet your elders. Stay somewhat reserved and considerate."

      "title": "Expand your vocabulary.",
      "content": "Expand your vocabulary. Slang words and curse words are not polite or classy. You don't have to use extremely complicated words for every sentence, but it's good to know some classic language that most don't use nowadays. You can do this by reading and listening to people who have a wide vocabulary talk."

      "content": "Learn how to hold a good conversation. Don't talk about partying, drugs, smoking, or anything rebellious. Talk about casual stuff like homework, what you're doing next week, what books you've been reading/what music you've been listening to, etc. Try to be a good conversationalist. Be a good listener and make eye contact. Try to listen more than you talk."

      "title": "Be kind and courteous to those around you.",
      "content": "Be kind and courteous to those around you. Classy people are intelligent and elegant, but they aren't unapproachable or arrogant. Learn when to stand up for yourself or others and be assertive, but never be bossy or rude. Avoid people who say bad things about you and avoid disloyal friends. Always offer honest compliments and smile, and offer to do favors with nothing in return."

      "content": "Keep clean. Dirty and smelly girls are very unattractive and seem trashy. Take a shower or bath every day, and use a light-scented body wash. Apply a light-scented body lotion. Use deodorant when you're out and are sweating and smelly. Brush your teeth twice a day and floss once at night. Wear clean clothes and wash your hair when it starts to smell and look very greasy and unappealing."

      "title": "Be healthy.",
      "content": "Be healthy. Classy girls look naturally flawless. Eat well and take care of your body. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables for fiber, and also eat lots of protein like chicken, fish, eggs, tofu, and nuts. Only eat junk food once or twice a week. Take up a school sport such as tennis, track, golf, dance, lacrosse, polo (any type of English riding), rowing, swimming, soccer, or whatever else your school offers. Exercise at least 5 days a week for at least 20 minutes. Drink lots of water and sleep for at least 8 hours a night. Your body does not have to be perfect; being preppy shows more in how you act and treat others around you, but participating in preppy sports never hurts."

      "content": "Have natural, clean, shiny hair. Unnatural colors or weird haircuts are not preppy at all. Your hair should always be clean, shiny, and well-groomed. Wear your hair in a bun, waves, straight and smooth, or braid. Get a trim if your hair is damaged. Wash your hair every other day to every 3 days and use dry shampoo if your hair can't go a day without being very greasy. Squeeze some excess water out of your hair after showering/bathing. Gently pat your hair with a towel and let it air dry. Avoid using heat on your hair or dyeing your hair too often."

      "content": "Apply light makeup (if wanted). It's completely fine to go all natural. For foundation, get something with SPF protection from Lancome or Clinique. Use primer and moisturizer. Try to use neutral and nude colors. Mascara, eyeshadow, lip gloss, and blush should be used lightly. On special occasions, wear a little bit of eyeliner and red lipstick. Makeup does not have to be from expensive department stores; if makeup from the drug store works well for you and makes you look good; use it! It's all about making you look your best and making you feel good; makeup is not about brands."

Depending on the look you are going for, you can get name-brand clothes like Hollister, Abercrombie, and Aeropostale, or find equally cute outfits at thrift stores. No one knows how many previous owners your clothes have had unless you tell them. If you are low on cash, check out discount stores such as Goodwill and Plato's Closet. They will almost always have designer clothes for a fraction of the cost!"

Try family heirlooms, such as your mother's silver bracelet or your grandmother's diamond necklace. A simple charm bracelet (preferably gold in color) or sparkly headband should do the trick. Try to look simplistic, never gaudy."
