A statute mile is equal to 5,280 feet. [1] X Research source A nautical mile is usually used to measure distances that are across open water or space. A nautical mile is equal to 6,076 feet. Knots are determined by how many nautical miles are being travelled per hour. 1 knot = 1 nautical mile per hour. [2] X Research source"

Converting to feet per hour: 20 × 5 , 280 = 105 , 600 {\\displaystyle 20\\times 5,280=105,600} . Converting to knots: 105 , 600 6 , 076 = 17.38 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {105,600}{6,076}}=17.38} .

Simply multiply, or use the formula 0.869 x = y {\\displaystyle 0.869x=y} , where x {\\displaystyle x} equals the rate in miles per hour, and y {\\displaystyle y} equals the rate in knots. 25 ( 0.869 ) = 21.725 {\\displaystyle 25(0.869)=21.725} So, wind blowing at 25 mph is blowing at about 22 knots."

To convert how fast the blue boat is travelling in mph to knots, multiply by the number of miles per hour by 0.869: 0.869 ( 17 ) = 14.77 knots {\\displaystyle 0.869(17)=14.77\\;{\\text{knots}}} The red boat is travelling at 15 knots; the blue boat is travelling a little less than 15 knots.
