      "content": "Practice cooking at home to build your skills. Pick recipes that you find appealing, then make them yourself. As you get better at cooking, try recipes that include new skills that you haven’t yet tried. Don’t be afraid to experiment with recipes to make them your own. [1] X Research source Play around with different types of cuisine to see what fits your style and taste. For example, you might make Italian food one night, Mexican food the next night, then your own twist on hamburgers."

      "title": "Experiment with food to create your own recipes.",
      "content": "Experiment with food to create your own recipes. Part of the fun of being a chef is making your own special dishes. Once you’re familiar with common ingredients, start playing around with recipes to make them your own. Take risks so you can create something totally new! [2] X Research source Start by making changes to an existing recipe to make something different. Then, try mixing ingredients without following a recipe. Some of your creations will be a success, while others might be inedible. This is normal, so don’t give up."

      "title": "Cook for other people to get feedback on your cooking.",
      "content": "Cook for other people to get feedback on your cooking. While it’s scary to open yourself up to criticism, feedback can help you grow as a chef. Make dishes for people as often as you can, then ask them what they liked or didn’t like about what you made. Incorporate the feedback that makes sense to you. [3] X Research source If you can, serve your food to people who enjoy the type of cuisine you like to make. They’ll be able to provide a better opinion. For instance, let’s say you enjoy making Indian food. You’ll get better feedback from someone who enjoys Indian food."

      "title": "Watch other chefs to learn their techniques.",
      "content": "Watch other chefs to learn their techniques. You can learn a lot from watching others. Watch cooking shows and online tutorials to see how other chefs work. Additionally, observe chefs or chefs-in-training who you know. Try to learn from the way they work. Read recipe books if you find them interesting - there have been chefs much longer than there's been internet so doing some research off line may open you to new ideas inspired by older ones. [4] X Research source Don’t worry about copying the way someone does something. You want to have your own style; However, it helps to watch how they perform certain skills and how they get creative with ingredients."

      "content": "Get a job at a restaurant to build your skills and resume. While it would be awesome to start out as a chef, it takes time to work your way up the career ladder. Start with a low-level restaurant job that will help you learn the skills you need. Apply for any restaurant jobs that you see advertised locally.

      "title": "Enroll in a culinary arts program for a comprehensive education.",
      "content": "Enroll in a culinary arts program for a comprehensive education. While attending a culinary school isn’t required for chefs, it may help you get a job.

Research culinary programs, then apply to your top 3-5 choices. [6] X Research source Programs are offered at trade or vocational schools, colleges, and culinary institutes. You may be able to earn a certificate in culinary arts from a trade or vocational school in 6-9 months.

Additionally, you can earn a 4-year bachelor's degree in culinary arts from a college, university, or culinary institute. Look for a program that offers classes in business, management, and human resources if you think you might open up your own restaurant someday."

      "content": "Train at home if you plan to be a self-taught chef. While going to a culinary school helps you learn the skills you need, you might choose to teach yourself what you need to know. Practice cooking in your own kitchen every day. Cook meals for your family or host events in your home to get more practice. Push yourself out of your comfort zone to help you learn the skills you need. [7] X Research source Volunteer to cook for parties and events if people buy the ingredients for your recipes.

      "content": "Find an internship at a restaurant to build your resume. While an internship isn’t very glamorous, it can open up doors to the job you want. Contact local restaurants to ask about available internships. If you can’t find one, ask a local chef or restaurant owner if they’d consider taking you on as a short-term intern. During this time, watch the chef, sous chef, and line cooks to learn new skills. Additionally, follow all of the instructions they give you exactly. [8] X Research source Some culinary arts schools have relationships with local restaurants that offer internships for students. Your internship will likely be unpaid.
