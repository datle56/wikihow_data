      "content": "Network with other bankers. If you don’t want to wait until the manager of your bank retires, you’ll want to network with other bankers in your area, particularly those in our same company if you work for a large bank. That way, when a position comes up, the people doing the hiring will think of you. Join a professional network like the Career Banker Association or the Bank Administration Institute. [13] X Research source Use career development courses to learn, but also to make contacts. Attend civic events like the opera, speeches, or balls. Tap into your alumni network and attend alumni events. Choose an important local non-profit to get involved with and use it as a means to connect with both the community and possible contacts."

      "content": "Get the most out of your network. Simply handing out and gathering up business cards at these functions isn’t enough. To get the most out of your contacts, you’ll have to cultivate them: Keep a list. Make a spreadsheet with the contact info of people you respect and would want to work with professionally in the future. Depth is more important than breadth. Save these spots for people who want to help you as much as you want to help them. Schedule follow-up. Put entries in your calendar reminding you to follow up with contacts every two or three months. Ask them how they are doing, and if you can help out in any way. Being helpful is the best way to cultivate contacts. Stay in touch in other ways. Pass along blogs or news stories you think your contacts would like. Connect to them on LinkedIn and keep track of their status. If they are promoted, congratulate them. If they are laid off, offer support. If you have a recreational activity in common, send them articles about it. Thank them if you take their advice and it helps."

Ideally, your network will alert you of any jobs opening up, but to make sure you have all your bases covered, you should also check the job banks regularly or set up an alert to notify you when jobs of interest come up. The best job banks can be found on sites that cater specifically to the banking industry, like American Bankers Association or the Bank Administration Institute."
