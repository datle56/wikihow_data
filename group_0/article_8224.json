Then, use the cloth to wipe away any soil, dust, or loose dirt on the footbeds.

      "content": "Apply leather soap to the footbed with a damp microfiber cloth. Squeeze a small amount of leather soap (e.g., Castile soap , saddle soap ) onto a damp microfiber cloth. Unless your leather soap’s package instructions give specific directions, you can usually apply the leather soap by rubbing it onto the footbed and working it into a lather. Work in small circles, covering the entire surface of the footbed. [2] X Research source If you don’t have leather soap, mix a solution of 1 teaspoon liquid laundry detergent, 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar, and 1 cup (240 mL) warm water. Dip a microfiber cloth into the solution, then use it to scrub the footbeds. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Leather straps Slightly dampen a microfiber cloth and wipe away dust or loose dirt on your straps. If any mud is clinging onto the leather (or clog), allow the mud to dry before brushing it away with a dry cloth and wiping the stain with a damp cloth. Then, purchase a commercial shoe polish that matches the color of the leather straps. Follow the shoe polish’s package directions to spread it onto the straps, being careful to avoid the cork or rubber soles of the shoes. [6] X Research source Next, apply a leather conditioner to your cloth and rub it over the strap with small circular motions. Take a clean, dry cloth and gently buff out the straps. Finally, let your straps sit to air dry in a cool area for at least 30 minutes. If your Birkenstock straps are made out of patent leather or waterproof latex , you should still begin by wiping off dirt with your damp microfiber cloth. Dab a small amount of petroleum jelly onto the straps to buff away scuff marks. Then, spray your cloth with glass cleaner and apply it to the straps to restore their shine. If the straps of your Birkenstocks are stained by rock salt (the salt put down on roads in the winter), dip a microfiber cloth into a 1:1 combination of cool water and distilled white vinegar. Wring out the cloth until damp, then wipe down the straps and allow the sandals to air-dry in a cool area."

Then, brush over the straps with a suede or soft-bristled brush , brushing in opposite directions to avoid working dirt further into the material. You can leave the straps as they are, or remove spills and stains with these tips: [7] X Research source Wet spills: Blot wet spills ASAP with a paper towel, then allow the area to dry completely. Then, use an art gum eraser to rub away the stains and scuffs before lifting the nap of the suede with a suede brush . Oily stains: Sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder over the stained area and let it sit for at least 4 hours, then brush it away. Repeat until the oil is gone. Sticky stains: Place an ice cube in a plastic bag and hold it over the sticky stain until it’s hardened. Once hardened, use the edge of an old credit card to pry the sticky substance away from the suede. Buff out any remaining traces with an art gum eraser , then brush over the strap with a suede brush. Kim also recommends using “suede gum or soft sandpaper to remove the stains, then using suede cleaner with a suede cleaning brush or toothbrush to rub the surface.”"

[10] X Research source Then, dip an old toothbrush into the solution and gently scrub it into the sole, working in one small area at a time.

For the footbed, apply a cork sealer if your footbed and sole are made of cork. Any commercial brand of cork sealer will work on a Birkenstock shoe—simply follow the package directions to apply sealer around the outside of the footbed, then allow it to dry for 30 minutes. Be careful to avoid applying any cork sealer to other parts of the shoe. [11] X Research source For nubuck leather or suede Birkenstocks, cover the footbed with paper and spray the upper leather of the sandals with a colorless waterproofing spray , following package directions. Apply three layers, letting each layer dry before the next application. [12] X Research source For natural leather Birkenstocks, grease the upper level of the sandals with a small amount of leather grease , following package directions. Cover the footbed with paper during product application. The Birkenstock brand also offers its own versions of these protective products, like the Birkenstock Water & Stain Repellent and the Birkenstock Cork Sealer ."

      "title": "Clean your Birkenstock sandals every 2-3 weeks.",
      "content": "Clean your Birkenstock sandals every 2-3 weeks. Birkenstock sandals can get dirty easily, so it’s best to clean them at least every few weeks. In fact, you may want to clean your Birkenstocks’ footbed every two weeks since this is typically the dirtiest part of the shoe, then clean the straps and soles every 2-3 weeks. Or, you can just clean the whole shoe at once! [13] X Research source However, there’s no need to clean your Birkenstocks if they’re not dirty. If you don’t wear the shoes often, it’s probably not necessary to deep clean them regularly. But you should still brush off loose soil and spot-clean stains after each wear!"

Check to see if the cork footbed is deteriorated or if the suede lining is extremely worn or odorous. [14] X Research source On average, Birkenstocks can last anywhere from a couple of years to over a decade. If you’re wearing your Birks nearly every day, however, it’s more likely that they’ll need to be replaced within 1-2 years. [15] X Research source"

Birks aren’t meant to be water shoes, so they definitely shouldn’t be immersed in water or stored in a moist environment. When it comes to washing Birks, avoid immersing them in water and never place your sandals in a washing machine. [16] X Research source Some styles of Birkenstock are “water-friendly,” so these types are more water-resistant than others. However, they still shouldn’t be submerged or immersed in water."

      "content": "Can you clean Birkenstock footbeds with baking soda? Lots of people recommend cleaning your Birkenstock footbeds with baking soda, but the jury’s out on whether or not you actually should . Baking soda is abrasive, so scrubbing it onto your sandals may harden and dry out the material, ultimately damaging the footbed of your Birks. Baking soda is also not included among the cleaning methods recommended by the Birkenstock brand themselves. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Can you clean Birkenstocks with Dawn dish soap? Yes, you can clean Birkenstocks with Dawn dish soap, but you should avoid using it on any suede or leather parts of the sandal. Dawn dish soap can be too harsh for suede, so it’s best to only use it on the straps and non-leather components. [18] X Research source If you do choose to use Dawn on Birkenstocks, dilute a small amount of it with warm water and dip a microfiber cloth into the solution. Wring out the cloth, then gently wipe the dirty areas on the shoe in circular motions. Rinse the cloth with clean water, then use it to wipe away any soap residue. Let the shoes air dry for at least 24 hours in a cool, shaded spot."

      "title": "Why do Birkenstocks turn black?",
      "content": "Why do Birkenstocks turn black? The footbed of Birkenstocks may turn black due to accumulated dirt, oils, and sweat from the bottoms of your feet. If you store your Birkenstocks in a humid or moist area, this environment may also contribute to the discoloration on the sandals. By cleaning your Birkenstocks regularly, you’ll help to prevent them from turning black. [19] X Research source"
