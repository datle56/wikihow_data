      "title": "Wipe down the outside.",
      "content": "Wipe down the outside. Use a damp washrag to wipe down the exterior of your steamer. This should be strong enough to clean off any minor dirt and grime that has built up during use. Be sure to use warm water when you dampen the washrag. If this doesn’t seem to work, you can add a few drops of white vinegar to the damp washcloth to give it a more powerful cleaning."

      "title": "Flush the hose attachment.",
      "content": "Flush the hose attachment. If your steamer has a hose attachment, you should clean that, too. Simply detach the hose and flush it with water. You can do this outside with a garden hose, or carefully in the kitchen sink or shower. Flush the hose several times, or until the water runs clear once it filters out of the hose attachment. You should also clean out any debris that has lodged itself in the bristles of the hose. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a cleaning mixture. Combine 1 ½ ounces of baking soda with 4 c (950 mL) of water. This will be your cleaning solution. [2] X Research source Make sure the baking soda dissolves into the water before you begin."

      "title": "Pour the cleaning solution into the machine.",
      "content": "Pour the cleaning solution into the machine. Locate the water cup on your steamer and empty out any remaining water. Pour your cleaning solution into the water cup and return it to the steamer machine. The water cup is usually located on the steamer base. You may want to perform this cleaning activity outside (or in the garage) to avoid making a mess on the floor of your home."

    {
      "title": "Let the solution sit for several hours.",
      "content": "Let the solution sit for several hours. Once the cleaning solution is in the water cup of the steamer, you’ll need to let it stay in there for 3-4 hours while it does its job. Sit the steamer on a solid surface during this time so it won’t tip over or spill the cleaner. Be sure not to run the steamer (or even turn the machine on) while the cleaner is inside the machine, as this could potentially damage items it comes into contact with."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dump out the cleaning solution.",
      "content": "Dump out the cleaning solution. Remove the water cup from the steamer and dump out any remaining cleaning solution. Rinse out the water cup to make sure it’s fully clean and doesn’t have any residue left inside. Be sure to dump the cleaning solution out in the sink or shower. Don’t dump it outside as this could ruin your grass."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flush with clean water.",
      "content": "Flush with clean water. Once you have completed the cleansing process, pour water back into the water cup and turn the machine on. Let the machine run so that some of the water comes out and filters out the rest of the machine. Repeat this process several times, or until the water being rinsed out doesn’t look dirty anymore. If your rinsing water continues to look dirty as you pour it out, you may need to repeat the process with the cleaning solution another time."

      "title": "Wipe down the outside regularly.",
      "content": "Wipe down the outside regularly. Buildup of grime and dirt can, over time, cause your steamer machine to function less effectively. If you simply take a few moments to wipe down the outside of the steamer with a damp washrag, this can help prevent future damage and extend the life of your steamer. Try to remember to wipe down the exterior of the steamer after every use for best results. You should also wipe the steamer down if it has been stored for a long period of time without being used."

      "title": "Rinse the steamer with fresh water after each use.",
      "content": "Rinse the steamer with fresh water after each use. After you use the steamer, you should rinse the machine out with fresh water. This will help prevent sediment buildup on the inside of the steam cleaner and keep your machine fresh for longer. Do this after each time you use the steamer to make sure your machine stays as clean as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store the steamer properly.",
      "content": "Store the steamer properly. Whenever you aren’t using the steamer, you should store it in a cool, dry place to prevent any mildew or mold from forming. You should try to cover the steamer with plastic so that the amount of dust that settles on the machine is minimal. Storing your steamer properly will help prolong the life of your machine."
