      "content": "Acknowledge that you can control your thoughts. Many people feel that their thoughts are beyond their control. While we're never in complete control of our feelings and emotions, there are things we can do to direct our thoughts. While you cannot always change your circumstances, you can work on adjusting your own perspective. [1] X Research source Remember, you can control your attitude. In any given situation, you can control how you choose to see and perceive what's occurring around you. Try to take responsibility for this throughout your day-to-day life. For example, if you're unhappy with your current company, you do not have to see your situation as wholly negative. If you keep having thoughts like, \"This is terrible. I hate my job,\" pause and think of other ways to view the situation. You could, for example, think about positives like your family and social circle. You could also see your disdain for your current job as motivation to get your career on track, or view your position as a stepping stone toward your dream job."

      "content": "Accept changes as they occur. The only sure thing is change. No matter where you're planted, situations and circumstances will change with time. If you want to learn to bloom despite any circumstances, it's important you learn to calmly embrace change. [2] X Research source Learn to cultivate mental flexibility. You can do this by not being too rigid in your habits and being open to new experiences. Remember, change is necessary to progress. If things always stayed the same, there would be no personal growth or forward motion. If something has changed recently, adapt instead of feeling upset or uneasy about the changes. Be on the lookout for opportunities and ways you can change your current situation. If you're in a situation that's not ideal, there are likely ways to change it or yourself for the better."

      "title": "Value what you do have.",
      "content": "Value what you do have. If you're feeling negative about your life overall, this can affect your overall energy level. A negative mentality makes it difficult to bloom. Instead of wishing for ideal circumstances, look for things you can appreciate right now. This can help you develop the positive attitude necessary to bloom. [3] X Research source If you're unhappy with where you're planted, negativity can consume your thoughts. It's easy to forget the good things about life when you're faced with difficulties every day. Try to make a conscious effort to focus on what you do have. For example, maybe you don't love your job, but do you have coworkers you like? Are you learning skills you can use later on? Are there other things about your life, such as relationships, that make you happy? Focus your energy here."

      "title": "Try to learn lessons from your circumstances.",
      "content": "Try to learn lessons from your circumstances. One great way to bloom in any circumstances is to always be on the lookout for life lessons. Look at where you're at right now. Ask yourself what you can learn. How can you make your present experiences and situation into a life lesson? [4] X Research source Even bad situations come with lessons. If you, say, relocated for work and hate your current town, think about what you could learn. Maybe this will be a lesson in resiliency. You may learn a lot about yourself. If you're, say, lonely in a new town, this is a chance to get to know yourself and learn how to stay entertained and fulfilled when alone. It's not always easy to see the lesson if circumstances are bleak, but a lesson often becomes more clear later on. If you can't find a lesson right now, try to remind yourself you will learn something from your experiences some day. Do not think of the present moment as a waste."

      "content": "Practice radical acceptance. Radical acceptance means learning to accept your current situation, and everything you cannot change, as it is. This can help you bloom where you're planted as you will not waste time indulging in \"what if\" scenarios. Try to wake up every morning with a sense of acceptance about what you cannot change. [5] X Research source Remember that suffering is optional. The way you interpret the situation determines whether or not you will suffer. Radical acceptance is about accepting your current reality with all it's ups and downs. However, accepting does not mean agreeingâ€”you can choose to change things. Practice acceptance with little things at first. For example, traffic is heavy and you will be late for work. You cannot change this, so do not get upset. Try to accept it and not let this setback interfere with your attitude at the office. As you practice accepting small things, you will begin to learn how to accept bigger setbacks. For example, you do not get a promotion at work despite trying very hard. This can be a devastating blow, but if you've learned to accept circumstances as they come you'll bounce back from this quicker."

There are always areas to change and improve in any situation. In order to bloom where you're planted, you need to look for opportunities in your present situation. Learn to identify areas where you could change things for the better, even if your circumstances are less than ideal. [7] X Research source Avoid complaining about unfavorable circumstances. If you don't like something, see if you can change it instead of being negative. For example, say you're not a huge fan of your current job. Instead of complaining about work, try to improve your skills for the job you do want or actively send out applications to other employers. The key is to not develop a victim mentality."

      "title": "Stay in the present.",
      "content": "Stay in the present. Thinking about what could happen in the future, or what you could have done differently in the past, can distract you from blooming in the present. Even when you're frustrated, try your best to stay in the present moment and accept things for what they are. [8] X Research source Try to work with what you do have rather than what you wish you have. You may, for example, feel you would be in a better job if you had gone to a better school or applied yourself more during college. However, you can't change that now. Focus on what you can do to make the present better. If you feel you haven't applied yourself enough in the past, apply yourself now. Work as hard as you can now so, in 5 years, you won't still regret your past."

Even if you're current situation is not great, relationships can help you bloom and grow. Try to interact with those around you. You never know what opportunities a strong relationship with a co-worker, friend, or boss could lead to in the future. [10] X Research source Expand your network as much as you can. Stay in touch with people in your field, such as past bosses and co-workers. At your current job, try to form solid working relationships with those around you. Be polite, courteous, and hardworking and avoid bad mouthing colleagues."

      "content": "Take risks. [11] X Expert Source Adrian Klaphaak, CPCC Career Coach Expert Interview. 18 December 2018. Risk taking can help in any situation. Rather than viewing your current circumstances as defining, see them as something you can rise above. No situation is ever completely stagnant. There is always room to take risks and grow as a person. [12] X Research source Life begins outside your comfort zone. If you never step outside your comfort zone, then you will never really see what's possible. Even if a risk does not work out, you will have learned a lesson about putting yourself out there. Also, something like your employer may appreciate a risk taker. Down the road, your risk-taking may pay off even if it doesn't in the present."

You can bloom in small ways throughout the day by having a positive impact on others. Bringing people up rather than down improves the world around you. It also improves your own attitude, which can allow you to have the energy and attitude to thrive. [14] X Research source Work to become more selfless and do things for others without expecting praise or anything else in return. Serving others will make you feel better in addition to making a difference in your community. Do small things to bring people up. Smile at a cashier, for example, or help someone who's lost with directions. Try to be pleasant even if you're feeling down. For example, go into your job with the goal of being nice to everyone, even if you're having a bad day."

However, you can learn to work with the tools you have at your disposal. Try to see opportunity for growth everywhere. [17] X Research source For example, maybe you just graduated college with a creative writing degree and are working in a coffee shop while searching for a better job. While you may not see opportunity here, there's something you may be missing. A low-key, part time job can provide you with the opportunity to work on your writing. You can also observe people at your work, providing inspiration for stories."

Try to see how your current situation relates. This will motivate you to get back on track and keep trying in the present. [18] X Research source Once you have direction, you will begin to notice the resources at your current disposal to help you get to your destination. Your mind will naturally focus on opportunities that may help you reach your goals."
