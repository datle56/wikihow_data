      "content": "Let your friends sign it. Pens and pencils won't show up very well on fiberglass casts. To make it easier for your friends, carry at least one permanent marker with you. If you've chosen a light-colored cast, make sure your marker is dark. Black or dark blue is a good choice. If your cast is a darker color, have a silver or other light-colored marker ready. Sharpie is the best known brand of permanent markers. You can buy them in a variety of sizes and colors. [9] X Research source If you have a small cast but lots of friends, stick to a marker with a thinner nib so that everyone can fit their signatures. If you have a larger cast, you could go for a marker with a thicker nib. Avoid washable markers, which can smear if you get your cast wet. You should also avoid highlighters, which won't show up very well."
