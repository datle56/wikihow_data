      "content": "Ask her in person. While it may be tempting to ask her out via phone, text, or the Internet, doing so will block vital nonverbal communication. These indirect approaches can lead to miscommunication that may ruin your chances at a romantic relationship. Instead, simply ask her the next time you see her. When you get a private moment, ask her by saying something like this: \"I was wondering if you were free this Friday night? I'd like to get together just the two of us and check out [restaurant]. Are you interested?\" If you rarely see her, then asking her out through a call or message may be necessary. A sample message you can send would be: \"Hey! This is [your name] from [where you know her, like a particular class]. You seem like a really cool person, and I'd like to get to know you better. I was wondering if you'd like to go to [restaurant] this Friday at around 6:00 pm?\""

Your friend may have some tips or insights about what she likes. Your friend may also be willing to help \"set you up\" or in some other way help you to ask her out. Even though a mutual friend may make things easier, do not expect your friend to ask her for you. To broach the subject, try saying something like this to your friend: \"Hey, you know [girl's name]? I kind of want to ask her out. Has she said anything about me? Do you think she'd be interested?\""

Likewise, don't ask a girl out if she is somehow \"trapped\" with you in a location, such as elevator or cornered in a room. A good way to make her feel safe is to talk to her with other people nearby and visible. Don't make any kind of physical contact unless she does so first.

Something you could start with would be: \"Hey, I really like your shirt. [Whatever is on the shirt] is great!\" Then wait for her response. Follow up with: \"My name is [your name], by the way.\" If she ignores your greeting, it's best to back off.

There's this [type of food] restaurant called [restaurant] I've been meaning to try, and I was hoping you might be interested in joining me?
