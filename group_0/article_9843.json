      "content": "Put the quinoa into a pan with 1 3 ⁄ 4 cups (410 ml) of water and salt. Dump the rinsed quinoa into a medium-sized saucepan and pour in 1 3 ⁄ 4 cups (410 ml) of cold water. Then add 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) of salt. For extra flavor, substitute vegetable or chicken broth for the water."

    {
      "title": "Bring the water to a boil.",
      "content": "Bring the water to a boil. Turn the burner on to high and leave the saucepan uncovered as the water heats. Keep heating the quinoa in the water until the water begins to boil vigorously. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cover and simmer the quinoa for 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Cover and simmer the quinoa for 20 minutes. Turn the burner down to low and put the lid on the saucepan. Then, leave the quinoa to simmer until it's absorbed the water and become tender. Resist the urge to lift off the lid and check the quinoa as it simmers since this will release steam and increase the cooking time. Keep in mind that black quinoa takes about 5 to 6 minutes longer to cook than white quinoa."

    {
      "title": "Drain the cooked quinoa.",
      "content": "Drain the cooked quinoa. Turn off the burner and set a fine mesh strainer in the sink. Carefully spoon the quinoa into the strainer so excess water drains into the sink. [3] X Research source Draining the quinoa will give it a fluffy texture that's not gummy or sticky."

    {
      "title": "Put the quinoa back in the pan and let it rest for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Put the quinoa back in the pan and let it rest for 15 minutes. Spoon the drained quinoa back into the saucepan and put the lid on it. Leave the quinoa for 15 minutes so it finishes cooking and dries out. [4] X Research source You can prepare dressing or other ingredients to serve with the quinoa while it rests."

    {
      "title": "Fluff the quinoa with a fork before you serve it.",
      "content": "Fluff the quinoa with a fork before you serve it. Remove the lid and use a fork to toss the quinoa gently. Then, mix in any dressing you like and serve it with your choice of sides, such as roasted vegetables, chickpeas, or herbs. For a heartier meal, eat the black quinoa with seafood, a roast, or kebabs. [5] X Research source Refrigerate leftover black quinoa in an airtight container for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze the quinoa for up to 2 months and thaw it overnight in the refrigerator."

      "content": "Fluff the quinoa with a fork and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Wear oven mitts to take the bowl out of the microwave and remove the lid. Use a fork to fluff the quinoa and then put the lid back on. Leave the quinoa to sit for 5 to 10 minutes so all of the water is absorbed. [10] X Research source If there's still liquid visible at the bottom of the bowl, microwave the quinoa in 30-second increments until it's absorbed."
