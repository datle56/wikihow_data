This will make the cleaning process much easier. [7] X Research source Try not to rinse a ton of coffee grounds down your drain to avoid clogging it. A little bit here and there is fine, but if there is more than 1 tbsp (15 g) of grounds in your filter, try to scrape them into the garbage instead of your sink."

Make sure the bowl is deep enough to hold your entire filter without it sticking out at all. [8] X Research source For example, try using 1 cup (240 mL) of vinegar and 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of water. If you don’t have a big enough bowl, consider filling up your sink with water and white vinegar instead.
