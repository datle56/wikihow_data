      "content": "Challenge the beliefs that you learned from others to find your truth. You’ve probably absorbed a lot of rules about life from the people around you, like your parents, teachers, or religious leaders. Some of the beliefs will feel true for you, but others may not. Think about the beliefs you learned from others, then question whether or not they feel true for you. In some cases, you may want to talk to other people or do some research to learn more about the topic. Finally, adopt beliefs that fit with your personal values. [6] X Research source For example, your parents may have taught you that the only way to be successful in life is to get a high paying job. However, this might not feel true to you. Instead, you may prefer to pursue your passion for teaching dance. Similarly, let's say your family taught you not to trust people who are a different religion from you. After thinking about it, you might decide that you don't like judging people based on labels and want to treat everyone equally."

Instead of looking at your flaws as a bad thing, view them as a balance that helps you recognize your best qualities. Then, try to stop criticizing yourself and focus on being your best self. [7] X Research source For example, you might feel like your feet are too big or you might wish you could sing better. Chances are, you're the only one who notices these \"flaws.\" Either way, they help make you unique, so try to accept them. It’s okay to work on improving your flaws if they bother you. For instance, let’s say that you get tired after you try to run a mile. You might set a goal to improve your fitness level if this bothers you. Similarly, you might want to attend tutoring sessions to help you do better at math if you're struggling in class. However, you don't need to feel bad about these things."

[8] X Expert Source Kirsten Parker, MFA Mindset & Action Coach Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. For example, your inner critic might say, “People will think you look stupid.” This fear might stem from getting teased in middle school. Tell yourself, “People who criticize me feel insecure about themselves, and I’m not going to let them drag me down with them. I’m creative and strong, so I’m going to show that off.”"

[12] X Research source You might say, \"I'm not going to let their negativity hold me back,\" or \"I'm stronger than their words.\" For example, let's say you've entered your school's talent show and people start spreading rumors about how you don't have talent. This can be a really painful experience, but it says more about them than it does about you. They're probably envious that you're following your dream, and making fun of you is the best way to get you to stop trying. Don't let people hold you back from doing what you want. When you feel yourself getting discouraged, tell yourself, “My life must be more interesting than theirs if they’re so worried about what I’m doing,” or “I’d rather be different than invisible.”"
