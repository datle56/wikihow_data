      "content": "Consider painting the box or covering it with fabric. You can paint the box using spray paint or acrylic paint. You can also cover it with glue and fabric. Apply acrylic paint using a wide paint brush or a foam brush. To reduce brushstrokes, apply the paint in thin layers. Let each layer dry before applying another one. If you are spray painting the box, go outside or work in a well-ventilated area. Be sure to cover your work surface with lots of newspaper. To cover your box with fabric: Cut five pieces of fabric. Each one needs to be large enough to cover each side of the box. Cover the box with glue, and press the fabric down onto it. Work on one side at a time."

      "content": "Consider draping a curtain over the front opening of the box. Cats love dark, private places. Cut a piece of fabric that is the same with as your box, and about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) taller. Draw a ½ inch wide line of fabric glue along the top edge, closest to the opening. Press the edge of the curtain down into the glue. Consider gluing a ½ to 1 inch wide ribbon all the way around the edge of the box opening. This will not only hide the top edge of the curtain, but also give the box some contrast."

Cats will not go through anything they can't get their whiskers through. [1] X Research source The doorway can be any shape you want, but make sure that it is as close to the bottom edge as possible. Here are some ideas to get you started: Set circle and paw print shaped doors about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) up from the bottom edge. Use a plate to trace the circle or paw pad. Use a small cup to trace the \"fingers\" of the paw. Set arched, square, and triangular doors right against the bottom edge."

If you left some of the legs unpainted, those legs should be facing the longer/bare part of the rectangular table. If you are using wood glue: paint the bottom of the square table's legs with a thick layer of wood glue. Place the table down on top of the rectangular table and let the glue dry. If you are using metal brackets: Take four L-shaped metal brackets, and screw them to the inside of each of the square table's legs. Set the table down on top of the rectangular table.

Paint the leg with a few more inches/centimeters of glue, and wrap more rope around it. Keep painting glue and wrapping rope until you cover the entire leg. Repeat this step for the other leg. Consider wrapping some of the legs on the rectangular table as well. You can wrap whatever legs you want. They don't have to be right next to each other, like with the square table.

They don't need a bottom as they will be stacked on top of each other. The smallest box needs to be large enough for your cat to curl up inside. For a standard-sized cat, start with18 inches (45.72 centimeters) as your largest box. The other three boxes are as follows: 16 inches (40.64 centimeters), 14 inches (35.56 centimeters), and 12 inches (30.48 centimeters). If you have a large cat, such as a Maine Coon, you will need bigger boxes. The boxes can be made out of wood or cardboard. Wooden boxes, however, will be more durable. You can buy the boxes, or build them yourself using cheap wood or particle board. Use nails or wood glue to put the boxes together."
