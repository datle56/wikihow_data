      "title": "He has an open stance with a friendly smile.",
      "content": "He has an open stance with a friendly smile. If a guy is interested in and happy to be around you, then he’ll probably stand with a friendly and inviting posture. He’ll uncross his arms, stand with his feet apart, and turn his entire body toward you. He’ll probably put a wide smile on his face—after all, he’s happy to see you! [1] X Research source"

      "title": "He slowly gets closer and closer to you.",
      "content": "He slowly gets closer and closer to you. Did your date suddenly lean forward to bring your faces closer together, or is he slowly scooting nearer to you in your shared restaurant booth? If your man is inching closer and closer to you throughout the night, then he may be testing the waters. [2] X Research source If you move away, for instance, then that gives him a clear sign that you’re not interested. If you match his closeness, however, you’re showing him that you want to kiss him as well."

    {
      "title": "He seems nervous and fidgety.",
      "content": "He seems nervous and fidgety. If a guy wants to kiss you but is too scared or nervous, he may start stumbling over his words (or his feet!). Watch for fidgeting with his hands, pockets, or whatever he’s holding. Licensed psychologist Sarah Schewitz, PsyD, adds that a guy who’s interested in you “might get red or flushed or start moving a part of his body or touching or scratching a part of his body. [He might also] clench his jaw, and you'll see his jaw muscle moving.” Not only do these physical signs show that your man likes you enough to be nervous, but they also show that he’s on the edge of his seat with excitement to kiss you!"

    {
      "title": "He initiates physical contact through “accidental” and non-accidental touches.",
      "content": "He initiates physical contact through “accidental” and non-accidental touches. When a man is attracted to you , he’ll start to build up sexual tension through little touches, brushes, and feels. For example, a guy who wants to kiss you might pick something up at the same time as you, brush his leg against yours, or wipe some food off the corner of your lip. [3] X Research source If he’s being a bit more forward, he might brush the hair out of your eyes or kiss you in less-intimate places like your hand, cheek, or forehead."
    },
    {
      "title": "He makes consistent eye contact with you.",
      "content": "He makes consistent eye contact with you. If your man can’t stop gazing into your eyes, then that’s a pretty good sign that he wants to kiss you. Not only is he probably mesmerized by your beauty, but he may be trying to seem more confident by asserting flirtatious eye contact . All signs point to a smooch in your future! [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "He keeps glancing down at your lips.",
      "content": "He keeps glancing down at your lips. When he’s not staring into your eyes, this guy might constantly be shifting his gaze to your lips. He may be doing this subconsciously, or he may be pairing his downward glances with a mischievous look to let you know that his mind is on your lips. [5] X Research source If you’re looking for signs that a guy wants a kiss over text , he might send kissy-face or lip-related emojis over text. Since he can’t glance at your lips in person, these flirty emojis are his way of saying that he’s thinking about kissing you. 😘🫦💋 [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He licks his lips while making eye contact with you.",
      "content": "He licks his lips while making eye contact with you. One of the most convincing signs that a man wants to kiss you is him repeatedly licking his lips while looking at you. He may be doing this subconsciously to add moisture to his lips—as he’s already visualizing kissing you in his mind. Or, he may be licking his lips to send you a signal that he wants a kiss. Either way, you can be fairly certain that there’s a smooch in your future. [7] X Research source You may also catch him applying Chapstick while making eye contact with you—applying moisturizer to his mouth may be his way of letting you know that his lips are prepped and ready to go!"

    {
      "title": "He softens and lowers his voice.",
      "content": "He softens and lowers his voice. Because bass-like voices are typically associated with masculinity, some men may subconsciously deepen their voices when they’re trying to be more seductive and sensual. [8] X Research source A soft voice is also connected to intimacy and proximity. So if your man’s voice takes on a soft, deep, and husky overtone while you’re talking, then he may be trying to put the moves on you. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He checks his breath or pops a mint.",
      "content": "He checks his breath or pops a mint. This sign may be hard to spot since most guys will check their breath once you’re turned away or occupied with someone else. However, if you do notice him raising a hand to check his breath or randomly chomping on a piece of gum, then he may be preparing himself to kiss you. Green flag that he doesn’t want you to experience any stinky garlic breath!"

      "title": "He turns on the charm and dials up the flirtiness.",
      "content": "He turns on the charm and dials up the flirtiness. Guys may always throw out sweet compliments and cheesy pickup lines, but they’ll lay the flirtation on thick in the moments leading up to a (hopeful kiss). Your guy will probably start complimenting your physical attributes in a forward and genuine way. For example, he may say flirty lines like: “Every time I see you, your smile brightens my day.” [10] X Research source “I love that lip gloss on you.” “Your skin looks so soft and smooth.” “Sorry if I seem distracted, I really can’t stop looking at your eyes.” “You look so stunning that it’s making me nervous.” If you’re looking for signs that a guy wants a kiss over text , he may send similar compliments over instant messaging to hint that he wants to kiss you the next time he sees you."

    {
      "title": "He notices little things about you, like your perfume or nail color.",
      "content": "He notices little things about you, like your perfume or nail color. Stereotypically, men aren’t particularly known for their high attention to detail. However, if your potential peck partner is commenting on little things about you (like your fragrance, nail color, shoes, or hairstyle), then his focus is definitely all on you. [11] X Research source And if you’re all he’s thinking about, then at least some of those thoughts likely involve a kiss! If you’re looking for signs that a guy wants a kiss over text , this same meaning might come through in behaviors like sending you long texts or responding really quickly to your messages. Basically, you’re his top priority, and he’s only focused on you."

    {
      "title": "He starts to get quiet.",
      "content": "He starts to get quiet. If you’ve been having a lively and flirtatious conversation when your guy suddenly goes quiet, then this may be a sign that he wants to kiss you. After all, you can’t lock your lips while those very same lips are busy yapping away! He may be working up the nerve to kiss you , or he’s attempting to create a lull in conversation that’ll give him the opportunity to lean in and go for it."
    },
    {
      "title": "He lingers or delays his departure.",
      "content": "He lingers or delays his departure. If you’re on a date with a guy and the night is wrapping up, he might awkwardly linger after saying his goodbyes. This awkward pause is likely caused by him trying to decide whether you’re open to a kiss—but he definitely wants one. You can make your position clear by giving him a light touch and telling him you want to kiss him or saying goodnight and walking away. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "He sets the mood with sexy music or lighting.",
      "content": "He sets the mood with sexy music or lighting. If a guy is really wanting to kiss you, he may go the extra mile to romance you first. For example, he might invite you on a date and bring you to a romantic or sentimental setting. He may further set the mood by bringing you flowers, lighting candles, or putting on mood music.

    {
      "title": "He tells you that he wants to kiss you.",
      "content": "He tells you that he wants to kiss you. And finally, the clearest sign that a man wants to kiss you is that he tells you directly. He may come right out and say, “I really want to kiss you,” or “Can I kiss you?” He might also say something more indirect like, “I’ve been thinking about kissing you all night.” [14] X Research source If he makes one of these statements, there should be no doubt left in your mind that he wants to kiss you! If you’re looking for signs that a guy wants a kiss over text , then this same rule applies! If a guy texts you something like “I really want to kiss you” or “I can’t stop thinking about our next kiss,” then he definitely wants to give you a smooch."

    {
      "title": "Decide if you want this guy to kiss you, then act accordingly.",
      "content": "Decide if you want this guy to kiss you, then act accordingly. Even if a man is showing all the signs that he’s dying to kiss you, you still get to decide whether or not you want to kiss him . If you do want to kiss him, go for it! Initiate the kiss yourself or invite him to with a teasing “Are you ever gonna kiss me?” or a more direct “Do you want to kiss me?” If you don’t want to kiss him, simply say “no.” You don’t need to give him a reason. If he tries to pressure or persuade you into a kiss, continue to say “no” and remove yourself from the situation as soon as possible. [15] X Research source If you’re not sure about the kiss, you could ask him more questions about his intentions before making your decision. For example, you could ask him why he wants to kiss you or what kind of kiss he’s thinking of (e.g., a French kiss or a chaste peck)."

    {
      "title": "Give him flirty signs like touching his hands or talking about kissing.",
      "content": "Give him flirty signs like touching his hands or talking about kissing. You can always just tell a guy directly that you want him to kiss you, but some subtler options may be more your speed! If you want to give a guy the cue to kiss you, touch him gently by stroking the back of his hand, playing with his watch, or moving close enough for your hands to “accidentally” brush against one another. [16] X Research source While you’re touching (or almost touching), make eye contact and soften your gaze. Then, move your gaze down to his lips and back up to his eyes to clearly express your desires (this is called the Triangle Method !). If these tactics don’t work, be a little bit more forward by purposefully reapplying your lipstick or lip gloss in front of him. Or, work the word “kiss” into your conversation by asking him about his first kiss or telling him that he has great lips (so he’s probably a great kisser). If the date night is ending and your man still hasn’t made a move, linger for a moment as you say your goodbyes, look up at him, and lean in slightly. If he still doesn’t kiss you, you can ask him directly if he wants to or just let it go for now."
