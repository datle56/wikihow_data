      "content": "Ask her about what she is interested in. Don't be nosy though, that can really bug your teenage daughter. Also, if she seems like she doesn't want to answer your questions, stop asking and wait for another time, teens can get moody, just like the rest of us. Some examples of questions to ask are: What is your favorite book? What is your favorite movie? What is your favorite color? What is your favorite song/album/singer/band? What do you like to do in your spare time? Where's your favorite place to shop? What is your favorite animal? What is your favorite or least favorite food? Or you can just make up your own questions."
