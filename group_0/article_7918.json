      "content": "Turn off your phone. This will make it easier to see where the leftover glue is. Plus, this will eliminate the risk of accidentally calling your boss or liking a crush’s Instagram post. Powering down will highlight where you need to clean the screen so that it’ll look like new again. [1] X Research source Depending on how thick your phone case is, you may also want to remove it. If it’s super bulky, it could be hard to clean the edges of the screen thoroughly."

      "content": "Use a clean lint-free or microfiber cloth to wipe down the screen. Sometimes, the glue may come away just by gently rubbing it back and forth with a soft cloth. If nothing else, this process will remove any smudges or streaks so that all you’re left with is the glue you need to clean off. [2] X Research source You should never use paper towels or tissues to clean your screen . They can leave behind little bits of lint or could even potentially scratch your screen. If your screen is cracked, be careful not to cut yourself on the broken glass. Putting tape over the cracks can help protect yourself. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Dip a lint-free cloth in cooking oil and rub it into the adhesive. Cooking oil is gentle and won’t harm the natural protective layer on your phone. Plus, the oil is good at loosening sticky adhesives. Use your pointer finger to gently rub the areas that are sticky until they start to come clean. [4] X Research source When applying the cooking oil to the cloth, just a little dab will do. You don’t want to use a dripping-wet cloth and risk getting oil into your speaker or charging port."

      "title": "Try using rubbing alcohol if cooking oil doesn’t lift the glue.",
      "content": "Try using rubbing alcohol if cooking oil doesn’t lift the glue. Don’t pour rubbing alcohol on your phone—instead, dip a corner of a lint-free cloth into the rubbing alcohol. Gently work the rubbing alcohol into the adhesive until it starts to come away from the glass. If the alcohol on the cloth dries out, apply a little bit more. [5] X Research source You can use nail polish remover instead of rubbing alcohol if you prefer."

      "content": "Loosen up the adhesive with a 15-second blast of heat from a hairdryer. This is optional and you can do it at any point during the process if you feel things aren’t progressing very well. Hold the hairdryer about 12 inches (300 mm) away from your screen and move it back and forth for 15 seconds. [7] X Research source Don’t hold the hairdryer against your phone or point it at one spot for too long."

      "content": "Test each corner of the screen protectors to find one that is a little loose. Gently pry at the corner with a fingernail to see if it’ll start coming away from the screen. You could also use the corner of a credit card or a very thick piece of paper. [8] X Research source You may also find it useful to use a toothpick. Just be sure to angle the toothpick up so that it doesn’t scratch the screen when it slips under the protector."

      "content": "Work your way around the edge of the screen to loosen the protector. Especially if your screen protector is made of tempered glass , you don’t want to just rip it up as soon as you find a loose edge. Instead, go around the entire protector with your finger, a credit card, or a toothpick and separate the screen from the sheet. [9] X Research source Doing this slowly should also help prevent the adhesive from sticking to your screen."

      "title": "Peel the protector off slowly and remove it from your phone.",
      "content": "Peel the protector off slowly and remove it from your phone. Try your best to keep the protector as even as possible so it doesn’t bend and break. If you want to use it again, set it to the side, adhesive-side up. [10] X Research source If you notice adhesive sticking to your screen, try gently pushing the protector back into place and removing it even more slowly. The hope here is that the adhesive will stay with the protector instead of your screen."
