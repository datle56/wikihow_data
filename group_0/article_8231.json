      "content": "Kill the crab humanely before you remove the shell. If you’re using a live blue crab, submerge the crab in a large bowl of ice water for 2-3 minutes to stun it. Then, remove the crab from the ice water and lay it on its back. Use a knife or ice pick to stab the crab through its shell 1 inch (2.5 cm) below its mouth. [1] X Research source You can also boil the crab for 1 minute to kill it. Numb the live crab in the freezer for 15 minutes before boiling. Then, remove the crab from the freezer and drop it in a pot of boiling water. Let the crab boil for 1 minute with the pot uncovered. After 1 minute, remove the crab using tongs and submerge it in a bowl of ice water so it stops cooking. [2] X Research source"
