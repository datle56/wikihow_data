The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends waiting until 6 months of age to start solid foods, but some babies are ready earlier than others. [1] X Expert Source Sarah Siebold, IBCLC, MA International Board Certified Lactation Consultant Expert Interview. 30 January 2020. Giving your infant cereal too early increases the chance of choking or inhaling the rice cereal mixture into his or her lungs. Early exposure to cereal can also increase your baby's risk of developing food allergies. [2] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source Your baby may be ready to try rice cereal at 4 months of age. Your doctor can help you decide what is best for your baby. It may be alright to introduce rice cereal before 4 to 6 months of age if your baby has reflux issues. Talk to your pediatrician before you try this though. Your baby should also be able to eat from a spoon before you introduce rice cereal to his or her diet. Feeding your baby solid foods too early can cause your baby to become overweight."

      "content": "Be sure your infant has met the necessary developmental milestones. In addition to being old enough, your infant should meet certain developmental milestones before you introduce cereal. Your infant should be able to sit with support, have head and neck control, push up with elbows from a lying position, place hands or toys in his or her mouth, and lean forward and open his or mouth when hungry or interested in food. If your child is 6 months of age, but has not met these milestones, you may need to delay the introduction of rice cereal. [3] X Research source Waiting for these milestones is important. They help ensure that your infant can safely swallow the rice cereal. Infants also have an extrusion reflex that causes them to raise their tongue and push against objects that are placed between their lips. [4] X Expert Source Sarah Siebold, IBCLC, MA International Board Certified Lactation Consultant Expert Interview. 30 January 2020. This reflex is usually gone by 4 to 6 months of age. Trying to spoon feed your child cereal with this reflex can be frustrating and difficult."

This is the time for you to ask questions and mention any concerns you have about solid foods. In some cases, your infant's intestinal tract may not be fully developed or your baby may not be able to fullness, leading to potential overfeeding.

This is typically only done to treat infants with gastroesophageal reflux (GER).

[7] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source To reduce reflux, keep your infant upright (i.e. on your shoulder) for 20 to 30 minutes after a feeding. Try a premixed,\"anti-reflux\" formula. These formulas contain rice starch. Try a hypoallergenic formula that does not contain cow milk or soy milk and see if your infant's reflux improves. Try this for one or two weeks.

This may help your baby sleep longer because the baby's stomach will feel fuller. Cut a larger hole in the nipple of the bottle because the mixture is thicker than formula alone. [10] X Research source Don't give your baby rice cereal at every feeding. Rice cereal is mostly carbohydrates and does not provide the same nutrition that formula or breast milk does. Giving your baby rice cereal at every feeding may decrease the amount of nutrients the baby is getting. You can either cut a small \"x or \"y\"\" in the nipple of the bottle or go up to a larger nipple size to accommodate the rice cereal formula."

If the mixture is too thick, your baby will have difficulty getting it down and may become tired during the feeding. Notice if your baby becomes constipated or starts gaining too much weight. These are common side effects of drinking rice cereal. Adjust the amount of rice cereal you are giving your baby based on your observations. If the rice cereal makes your baby constipated, you may want to try oatmeal instead. If you are trying to treat your baby's reflux, you should start seeing results in 2 or 3 days. If you see no improvements in that amount of time, rice cereal may not be a good solution for your baby."

Give your infant one teaspoon (5 ml) of the mixture at the end of breastfeeding or bottle feeding at first. Gradually build up to one to four tablespoons (15 to 60 ml) of the mixture two times a day. This process will give your infant time to develop his or her ability to swallow.

Your infant may intermittently spit out some cereal with his or her tongue as a natural reflex.
