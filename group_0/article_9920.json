      "content": "Catch your grasshoppers. The easiest way to obtain grasshoppers is simply to catch them yourself. They are easiest to catch in the morning when it's colder and they are lazier. You can simply grab them off the ground with your hands, if you're fast enough, or use a net to catch them. You can also create some of these more elaborate traps: Dig a hole in the ground and place a Mason jar with some bait, such as oats, apples, or carrots, in it. Either place some soil around the jar or tip it on its side -- the next morning, you should find grasshoppers in the jar. Just place the lid over it and you've caught your grasshoppers! If you want 'em alive, poke some holes in the lid. Take a shoot of green willow that's about three feet long and flick it down lightly on the grasshopper. This should pin it in place.

      "content": "Be sure to cook them. Grasshoppers are delicious and safe to eat, but you have to cook them first. This will keep you safe and will kill any parasites that they might be carrying. Don't attempt to eat them raw or you may suffer health issues. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the legs and wings.",
      "content": "Remove the legs and wings. The legs of grasshoppers aren't edible; although you won't be hurt from eating them, it's best to remove them before you begin to cook them. The same goes for the wings. Some say that freezing the grasshoppers for 10-15 minutes or boiling them for a few minutes makes the legs easier to pop off. This also has the benefit of killing them. Some people also pull the head straight off, which removes the guts (including the stomach). This tends to remove certain kinds of parasites (and could reduce the risk of eating the grasshopper raw, but it's still better to cook it). You can then insert a stick into the cavity and cook it over a fire."

      "title": "Clean your grasshoppers before you eat them.",
      "content": "Clean your grasshoppers before you eat them. Make sure to run them under cold water until they are clean and free of dirt. You can pat them down with a paper towel and then freeze or boil them, depending on the recipe."

      "title": "Make dry-roasted grasshoppers.",
      "content": "Make dry-roasted grasshoppers. This is probably the easiest way to cook grasshoppers. Here's what you have to do to cook them: Freeze your cleaned grasshoppers for an hour or two. Spread them out on a paper towel on a cookie sheet. Preheat your oven to 200°F (93°C) and cook the grasshoppers for 1-2 hours until they're nice and dry and crunchy. Try to crush them in with a spoon a bit to test their level of crunchiness. It's up to you -- just make sure they don't get burned in the process. If you like, you can cover them in just a bit of olive oil and season them with salt and pepper to taste."

      "title": "Make grasshopper skewers.",
      "content": "Make grasshopper skewers. This is a creative dish that is not only delicious but has a beautiful presentation. Here's what you've got to do to make it: Make the marinade. To do this, mix together all of the ingredients except for the grasshoppers, the bell pepper, and the onion. Do this in a non-reactive baking dish. Marinate the grasshoppers. Submerge them in the marinade and let them sit there for at least an hour. For best results, you can marinate them overnight. Remove the grasshoppers from the marinade and pat them dry. Make the skewers by placing the grasshoppers, bell pepper, and onion on them in an alternating pattern. Brush your grill lightly with olive oil. Cook each skewer 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) above the fire. Turn them every 2-3 minutes and continue to baste them in olive oil if needed. Cook for about 8-9 minutes, until crunchy and ready to eat."

Remove the garlic, onion, and chile, and sauté the grasshoppers in the remaining juice for around 8-9 minutes, or until they are crunchy and brown. Serve. Squeeze some lemon or lime juice over the grasshoppers and enjoy them on their own or in tortillas or tacos."
