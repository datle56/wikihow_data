Click Environment Variables… Under \"User Variables,\" select the Path variable and click Edit .

[7] X Research source Alternatively, you can rename the python.exe file in your Python 2 directory to python2.exe , and just use python2 when you want to use the Python 2 interpreter. When you installed Python 3, the installer also created a file called python.exe in your Python 3 install directory. This means that once you rename the Python 2 version of python.exe, typing python should automatically launch Python 3 as long as your Python 3 installation path is correct. Double-check your Python 3 installation path to make sure you have a file called python.exe there. If not, copy python3.exe and rename the copy python.exe for the same effect."

[11] X Research source This ensures that running the python command always uses the Python 3 interpreter instead of other installed versions. On other versions (or if you don't want to install a package), just create a symbolic link that makes the python command start python3 instead: Use ls -l /usr/bin/python* to see all symbolic links for python. If /usr/bin/python is linking to anything other than your preferred version, you can change the link. To change the link, use the command sudo ln -fs /usr/bin/python<Version> /usr/bin/python .
