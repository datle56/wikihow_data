      "content": "Set goals. Before you can set yourself on the path of being successful in your personal life, it’s a good idea to set goals for yourself. By tangibly establishing what your aims are in the short, mid, and long terms, you have an easy way to remind yourself of what you’re working towards. Write your goals on paper. Having a visual cue reminds you of and reinforces your goals. For example, you could write the following: “My short term goal is to find a nice partner and finish my Master’s degree. My mid-term goal is to get engaged and find an exciting job. My long term goal is to get married and have a family while being a successful financial planner.” Update your goals as you meet them. Once or twice a year, reevaluate your goals to make sure they’re still realistic and attainable. Setting unrealistic goals will not only cause you unnecessary anxiety, but can also hamper your success and the ability to meet other goals.

Two characteristics of a successful person is that they not only have confidence in themselves, but also that they believe in their ability to succeed. [4] X Research source By cultivating and projecting confidence in yourself and to others, you set yourself on the path for success. Confidence comes from many sources, including knowing that you have a good education and training, good relationships, or even that you look good. If you are lacking confidence in certain areas, take proactive steps to boost it. For example, if you don’t feel confident because they your friends are more successful professionally, then work towards garnering more professional success through education or even a promotion. If your appearance leaves you feeling not confident, improve it. Something as simple as revived hair color can do wonders. It’s important to know that even if you are confident and successful, that failure is a part of the equation. [5] X Research source Disappointment and failure are components of success. [6] X Research source Even someone like author J.K. Rowling experienced failures before they hit it big."

As you strive to meet your goals, be confident and believe in your success, it’s important to not expect perfection from yourself or those around you. In fact, trying to be perfect often hampers your ability to perform well and can alienate those around you. [7] X Research source Perfectionism doesn’t mean that you’re not trying to be your best, it means you’re reaching towards an unattainable goal. [8] X Research source For example, if you are trying to have the “perfect” body, any minor setback may hinder you from enjoying yourself. It’s best to love yourself the way you are and work from there. Expecting perfection from others can seriously and negatively affect your relationships, even causing them to break.

Part of fostering meaningful relationships is that you reciprocate the support and love you receive. Expressing gratitude is a key feature of having meaningful relationships. It’s important to show anyone who helps you along the way how much you appreciate them.

By controlling your financial profile, you can not only boost your confidence, but also afford yourself opportunities such as education that may come up. It’s important to budget. Knowing where your money is coming from and how you’re spending it will help you control your finances more effectively. [15] X Research source Part of this equation is using credit wisely [16] X Research source and not making impulse buys that you can’t really afford. [17] X Research source For example, you wouldn’t want to rent an apartment that cost $1500 per month when you’re only making $2000 per month. Make sure you’re saving money routinely. If something catastrophic happens, you will need a reserve to get you through the hard times. But you may also want to save it for something special, like a big vacation, which is important to helping you recharge and, if you go with others, connecting with them. [18] X Research source"

By tangibly establishing what your aims are in the short, mid, and long terms, you have an easy way to remind yourself of what you’re working towards. This will also help you formulate a plan to achieve those goals. Write down your goals on paper. It’s a good idea to have a visual reminder of your goals. For example you could write: “My short term goal is to do an internship as an editor, my mid-term goal is to get a Master’s in English, and my long-term goal is to work as the Editor-in-Chief of Vogue.” Make sure to update your goals as you meet them. Once or twice a year, reevaluate your goals to make sure they’re still realistic and attainable and set new ones as necessary. It is often useful to discuss these with a colleague or even your boss. Don’t set unrealistic goals for yourself. This will not only cause you unnecessary anxiety, but can also hamper your ability to meet other goals.

      "content": "Get as much education and training as you can. Having an education and job-related training is integral to being successful professionally. But you also want to make sure that you continue your education and training throughout your career so that you stay valuable to your workplace or are marketable if you choose to change jobs. There are many ways to get education for your job. It’s a good idea to research the requirements for your chosen profession. For example, if you want to be a university professor, you’ll need a PhD and some training for being in the classroom. If you want to be a wedding planner, on the other hand, you’ll need more on the job education and training than actual degrees. Training and the type of education that comes from practical experience is also very valuable when you’re marketing yourself professionally. For example, working as an editorial assistant at a magazine can help you get a job as an editor. Knowing that you have the right education and training is also helpful because it will build your confidence and make you more attractive to employers or potential employers."

However, this doesn’t mean making reckless decisions, rather that you should take a calculated risk. [25] X Research source The idea is to take a calculated risk, not something that could ultimately hinder your goals. For example, maybe you love your current workplace, but have hit the glass ceiling. When an opportunity for a promotion at another company comes up, weigh the advantages and disadvantages of taking the job and assess how much risk the switch could have on you personally and professionally. Either way you decide, you’re taking a calculated risk."

      "content": "Be an effective communicator. As the work place increasingly shifts towards more team-based work, greater customer contact, more diversity, and ever-higher employee expectations, the ability to effectively and positively communicate with colleagues is absolutely integral to your professional success. Being an effective communicator demands everything from being a good listener to being polite and having the ability to express your gratitude. Be a good listener to anyone associated with you professionally. The ability to listen to someone’s needs or problems will not only help cultivate your relationship with the person, but also may help your own goals down the road. Always be polite to people, even if they aren’t. The truism “you win more bees with honey than vinegar” is something you can apply to your professional life. Leaving a bad impression on colleagues or associates can have lasting consequences for you professionally. [26] X Research source Being polite extends to when you have to deliver bad news to someone professionally. For example, if you have to fire someone, say something positive to the person, followed by the negative, and then sandwich that in without another bit of positive feedback. Express gratitude to your colleagues. The ability to recognize when someone has supported you is important to maintaining good working relationships. Not only will it make the person feel appreciated and show them that you respect their contributions, but you will gain personal capital among your colleagues."
