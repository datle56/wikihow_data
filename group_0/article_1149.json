[1] X Research source Alpha males are often seen as the most “successful” person in a group in terms of the traditional financial and professional hierarchy. They have an ambitious streak, so they’re typically high-earners that seek to climb the ladder at high-profile and even glamorous companies. Alpha males also like control, so they tend to gravitate toward leadership roles that give them an air of success and power. A true alpha male is committed to becoming the best version of himself , inspiring others to follow his lead.

      "content": "Generally, women are attracted to men who are both assertive and kind. According to expert dating coach Lisa Shield, “many women want an alpha male.” But not all! Research shows that the “ideal” man is someone who is confident, assertive, easygoing, and sensitive—without being demanding, dominant, aggressive, quiet, shy, or submissive. [16] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source A man who is genuinely kind and passionate is highly desirable for both short-term affairs and long-term relationships, so don’t beat yourself up if you’re not considered an “alpha male.” But it can be difficult for some types of women to make a relationship with an alpha male work, even if that’s what they want. “A healthy alpha male is looking for a woman who’s very much in touch with her feminine side,” says Shield. “She can let him take the lead and not have a bunch of power struggles, which isn’t going to work out.” Alpha men “want women who have strong boundaries and know who they are but who…also really understand men with where their boundaries are,” observes Shield. Ultimately, both men and women are attracted to partners for a variety of reasons, and being your authentic self is the foundation for a healthy relationship. Hierarchical thinking contributes to the harmful idea that someone’s worth and social status should be determined by their masculinity. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect, so don’t obsess over a made-up hierarchy."

      "content": "Male personality types gained popularity in the manosphere in the 1990s. Alpha, beta, gamma, omega, sigma, and zeta males are pseudoscientific terms that are based on early studies of wolf packs, where one dominant wolf stood out as the pack leader. The initial studies on “alpha wolves” were later debunked because they were based on wolves held in captivity, not in the wild. However, the idea of “alpha” and “beta” males continued to gain traction on websites and forums focused on men’s issues and self-improvement. [17] X Research source The idea of male personality types is especially popular in far-right spaces, and some people feel it’s used to push what they deem to be regressive views. Men often use the 7 male personality types to rank themselves based on social dominance and attractiveness to women. Although it’s easy to describe yourself as a “type,” male personality types are not based in science and can be detrimental to your health in the long run. [18] X Research source"

The most “attractive” male is a blend of characteristics, and it’s totally normal not to fit the description of a specific personality type. Instead, reflect on who you are as an individual and work on becoming the best version of yourself—it will help you create the most satisfying life in the long run.
