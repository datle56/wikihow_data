In the short term, this may mean telling the person you’re speaking with that you need to take a quick break. If you’re with company, politely excuse yourself for a moment. Get to a quiet place away from what’s upsetting you and focus on calming thoughts."

      "content": "Re-focus your senses. When we're anxious, upset, or angry, our bodies go into \"flight or fight\" mode. Our sympathetic nervous system kicks our bodies into high gear by activating hormones like adrenaline. These hormones boost your heart rate and breathing, tense your muscles, and constrict blood vessels. [1] X Research source Take a break from what is causing this stress response and focus on what your body is experiencing. This can help you stay in the present and reduce what's known as \"automatic reactivity.\" [2] X Research source \"Automatic reactivity\" happens when your brain forms habits of reacting to stimuli, such as stressors. You brain activates these habitual pathways whenever it encounters that stimulus. Studies have shown that breaking the circuit of this reaction by refocusing on what your sensory experiences actually are can help your brain make new “habits.” [3] X Research source Don’t judge your experiences, just acknowledge them. For example, if you’re really angry about something someone just said, your heart is probably beating faster, and your face may be flushed or feel hot. Acknowledge these sensory details, but don’t judge them as being “wrong” or “right.” [4] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

Focusing on breathing deeply and evenly has a host of benefits. It restores oxygen to your body, regulates your brain’s brainwaves, and decreases the level of lactate in your blood. These things help you feel calm and relaxed. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source [6] X Research source Breathe from your diaphragm, not your upper chest. If you place your hand on your belly just below your ribs, you should be able to feel your abdomen rise when you inhale and fall when you exhale. Sit upright, stand, or lie flat on your back to help your chest stay open. It’s harder to breathe when you’re slouched. Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of 10. You should feel your lungs and belly expand as they fill with air. Then, slowly exhale through your nose or mouth. Aim for 6-10 deep, cleansing breaths per minute. Focus on the rhythm of your breathing. Try not to let yourself get distracted by anything else, including how upset you might feel. You can count your breaths if you feel yourself getting distracted, or repeat a calming word or phrase.

You may literally feel “wound up.” Progressive Muscle Relaxation , or PMR, can help you consciously release the tension in your body by tensing and then releasing particular muscle groups. With a little practice, PMR can help you bust stress and anxiety very quickly. [8] X Research source There are several free guided PMR routines available online. MIT has a free eleven-minute audio guide to PMR. [9] X Research source Find a quiet, comfortable place. It should be relatively dark. Lie down or sit comfortably. Loosen or remove tight clothing. Focus on a particular muscle group. You can start at your toes and work up, or start with your forehead and work down. Tense all the muscles in that group as hard as you can. For example, if you’re starting with your head, raise your eyebrows as far as they will go and open your eyes wide. Hold for 5 seconds, then release. Squeeze your eyes shut tightly. Hold for 5 seconds, then release. Move to the next muscle group and tense those muscles. For example, purse your lips tightly for 5 seconds, then release. Then, smile as wide as you can for 5 seconds, then release. Progress through the rest of your muscle groups, such as neck, shoulders, arms, chest, stomach, buttocks, thighs, lower legs, feet, and toes."

In many cases, it’s not one big event that makes you lose your cool but a mountain of small annoyances and irritations that have built up over time. [36] X Research source Try to distinguish between primary and secondary emotions. For example, if you were supposed to meet a friend at the movies and s/he never showed, you might immediately feel hurt. That would be the primary emotion. You might then feel frustrated, disappointed, or angry. These would be the secondary emotions. Having an idea of the source of your feelings can help you figure out why you’re experiencing these feelings. More often than not, you’ll feel more than one thing at once. Try to sort through what you are feeling and give each experience a name. Once you have named your emotion, you will have a better sense of how to handle it. One common reason people feel upset is that they believe things ought to go a certain way (usually, their way). Remind yourself that you will never be able to control everything in life -- nor should you want to.

For example, imagine that a coworker who often has anger issues yells at you for something. This is understandably upsetting. It’s not appropriate behavior. Now you have a choice: you can react automatically, or you can stop and think about what might really be going on. An automatic reaction might be “Joe must really be angry with me. What did I do? I hate this!” While understandable, this reaction doesn’t really help you calm down. A more helpful reaction could look like this: “Joe yelled me. That sucked, but I’m not the only person he yells at, and he flies off the handle pretty easily. He could be responding to something else in his life. Or he could just be an angry person. I don’t think I did anything wrong in this situation. His yelling isn’t fair, but it isn’t my problem.” These statements acknowledge that you feel upset, but focus on a way to avoid obsessing over it. Note that watching out for personalization is not the same as accepting abuse. It would be perfectly appropriate to talk with your boss about Joe’s angry behavior.

You all can continue to discuss it, but I’m going to need to step away.” If you truly can’t leave the situation, you can mentally retreat from the conversation.
