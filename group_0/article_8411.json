Then, gently scrub the mortar and pestle to clean off any stubborn food residue. [1] X Research source Use an unscented dish soap to prevent the taste and smell of the soap from seeping into the marble. Note : Some mortar and pestle manufacturers don’t recommend using dish soap to clean marble mortar and pestles. Always follow the manufacturer’s guidelines to clean your mortar and pestle safely."

Then, squirt a few drops of unscented dish soap onto a firm and abrasive scrub brush . Use it to remove any stubborn and stuck-on food residue. [3] X Research source It may take a bit of elbow grease to scrub and work out all of the residue on the mortar and pestle. Scented dish soaps can potentially seep into the granite and leave behind a soapy aftertaste. So, stick to using an unscented formula. Note : Some manufacturers advise against cleaning granite mortar and pestles with dish soap and recommend just using water. Consult the instructions that came with your tool for the best way to wash it."

Then, use a firm kitchen brush to scrub off stuck-on debris. [5] X Research source Molcajetes are traditional Mexican kitchen tools that work similarly to mortar and pestles. They’re typically made out of volcanic rock. Note : Volcanic rock is very porous, so many manufacturers don’t recommend cleaning molcajetes with dish soap. The soap can get trapped in the stone and leave behind an unpleasant taste. [6] X Research source"

If any stubborn residue is on the mortar and pestle, Mendes asserts that “scrubbing…should do the trick.” Just use a new and unused scrub brush or abrasive sponge to lift off stubborn and set-in food debris. Keep the scrub brush or sponge you use on the mortar and pestle separate from the cleaning brushes you use on dishes. Using separate tools prevents you from contaminating your mortar and pestle. Note : Most experts don’t recommend using dish soap for glass, metal, and ceramic mortar and pestles, either. The soap can seep into the material and leave a soapy smell or taste.

Then, Mendes says to use your pestle to roughly grind the rice into the mortar until it becomes a dark color. The rice acts as an abrasive and gets into the small grooves of the mortar, lifting up stubborn debris and removing odors. Repeat this process until the rice stays white. Remove the old rice powder, add 2 tbsp (22 g) of uncooked rice, and grind it into a powder. Make sure your mortar and pestle are completely dry before grinding rice with them."
