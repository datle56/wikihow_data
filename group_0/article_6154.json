      "content": "Cut a lid into the top of the pumpkin with a serrated knife . You can use a serrated knife from your kitchen or the largest serrated tool in a pumpkin carving kit . Draw a circle with about a 2 in (5.1 cm) radius from the stem with a washable marker. Tilt the blade at a 45-degree angle toward the stem and push it into the pumpkin. Saw along your outline with the knife until you can pull the lid off. [2] X Research source Cutting at an angle prevents the lid from falling inside of your pumpkin. Make sure your hand can easily fit inside the hole so you’re able to scoop out the seeds. Try cutting a hole in the bottom of the pumpkin instead. That way, you can just set a candle or light on the cut-out base and put the pumpkin on top instead of reaching inside to light it. [3] X Research source"

Then, scrape the inside walls of the pumpkin with any large stiff spoon, ice cream scoop, or scraper from a carving kit. Keep scooping out the pulp until the pumpkin is about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) thick. [4] X Research source Save and cook the pumpkin seeds for a tasty fall snack."

If you want to let loose and really get creative, let your imagination run wild and draw your design right onto the pumpkin skin. If you don’t like your design or want to make a change, just wipe the marker off with a damp paper towel and redraw it. [5] X Research source Mark the sections you want to cut out with an X so you don’t accidentally carve out the wrong piece. You could draw a spooky face with sharp teeth, the silhouette of a cat, or a scary ghost."

      "content": "Poke holes in the pumpkin with push pins to outline a stenciled design. If you have a printout stencil or a design that came with a carving kit, tack it onto the side of the pumpkin you want to carve with push pins or tape. [6] X Expert Source Amy Guerrero Arts & Crafts Specialist Expert Interview. 9 October 2020. Use another push pin or a fork to poke holes every 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) along the outline of the stencil to use as a reference for your design. When you take your stencil off, all you’ll have to do is connect the dots while you’re carving. [7] X Research source A pumpkin carving kit usually comes with a sharp tool you can use to poke holes. Sprinkle a little baby powder onto your pumpkin and rub it into the holes so they’re easier to see."

      "content": "Cut along your outlines with a serrated knife. Start carving your pumpkin near the center of your design and work toward the edges. Push the knife straight into the pumpkin along the outline of your design. Use an up-and-down sawing or rocking motion to cut through the skin. Start by making rough cuts to remove large sections and go back to clean up the edges. [8] X Research source Always cut away from your body so you don’t hurt yourself if your knife slips. If you’re working on a small or intricate design, switch to a paring knife instead. You can throw away the pieces of pumpkin you cut out or feature them in your design. You could attach them with toothpicks to make ears or horns. If you’re carving names or letters that have cutouts like an “O” or “A,” cut the piece out and reattach it to the pumpkin with a toothpick."
