      "title": "Treat others with kindness.",
      "content": "Treat others with kindness. Adorable people possess generous hearts and spirits and are always giving people the kindness and care they deserve. Be kind and compassionate to other people, whether we're talking about your best friend, your mother, or perfect strangers. Don't be rude or snappy, even if you're in a bad mood. Adorable people are supposed to enjoy life and to be loved by others, and you can only achieve those things with a healthy dose of kindness. Ask people how they feel and how they're doing. This doesn't just apply to being kind to humans. Be kind to cats and dogs, too! Better yet if you're always hanging out with your pet. People say owners end up taking on the characteristics of their pets, and pets are usually adorable!"

      "title": "Maintain a positive attitude.",
      "content": "Maintain a positive attitude. Adorable people haven't lost their zest for life or their youthful hopefulness. This means that they generally maintain a positive attitude and are optimistic and fun to be around. You don't have to completely fake it if you've had a bad day, but you should aim to be as positive, cheerful, and upbeat as possible so people have a good time when they're in your orbit. You can't picture an adorable person who is always whining, moping, or expecting the worst, can you? Adorable people haven't been beat down by the world and expect the best to happen. And the more you expect the best to happen, the more that it will. If you want to be a positive person with a good attitude, then you can't go around gossiping about people behind their backs. You should work on saying mostly positive things about people or you'll get a bad reputation. An adorable person can also help other people see the world in a more optimistic light during difficult situations."

      "title": "Be curious about the world around you.",
      "content": "Be curious about the world around you. Adorable people have an innate curiosity about life and want to know everything about the world; it goes back to being a little kid on your father's lap, pointing at everything and asking, \"What's that?\" That's the attitude you have to maintain if you want to be adorable and stay excited about life. Stay awake and alert and continue appreciating all of the news things the world has to offer. If your friend got a new job, ask all about what he does; if you see an item on the news, read up on it so you get what's going on. If a friend mentions a band you never heard of, ask what they're like -- and if you can go to one of their concerts."

      "title": "Flirt a little bit.",
      "content": "Flirt a little bit. Adorable people can be a little flirtatious because they are warm and friendly people. So, make a habit of being just a little bit flirty when you talk to someone of your romantic interest, or even to \"friend flirt\" a little bit, just by teasing people, being playful, and keeping things light. You don't want to overdo it and look more sexy than you intended; just a bit of flirtation is just fine. Talk a little more softly than you normally would. Make eye contact and then break it every once in a while when it gets to be too much. Play with your hair. This gesture can be interpreted as being flirtatious."

      "title": "Maintain your innocence.",
      "content": "Maintain your innocence. This doesn't mean that you have to be a prude or to act like you have no idea what's going on. However, if you want to be adorable, then you don't want to be a crude person who wants to talk about the cruelest, grittiest aspects of life, either. You want to stay a little bit wide-eyed, curious, and affronted by anything that is overly vulgar and offensive. You should avoid cursing too much or just sounding like a frat boy or you won't be adorable for much longer. Be as innocent as you can without being a perfect angel. It's a tricky balance. You don't want people to think that you're so innocent that they can't say anything around you. On the other hand, you don't want people to think your mind is in the gutter, either."

      "title": "Laugh.",
      "content": "Laugh. Adorable people are always laughing and smiling and having a good time (remember the part about staying positive?). You should have a great sense of humor and shouldn't be afraid to laugh when you think something is funny, however silly or corny it may be. You should always be seen with a smile on your face, or heard laughing from the other side of the room. Adorable people have their hearts open for humor, and are often found laughing or telling jokes. This goes back to maintaining that youthful innocence and fun demeanor. Little kids unabashedly laugh at anything they find funny; when they grow up, they are made to feel ashamed about their laughter and slowly begin to conform to grown-up standards of humor. If you want to be adorable, then you have to throw those expectations out the window and be true to the things that really make you laugh."

      "title": "Have a good hairstyle.",
      "content": "Have a good hairstyle. If you want an adorable hairstyle, then you should avoid anything that looks too complicated or modern. You can have long, wavy hair, shorter curly hair, or a cute bob that falls just below your ears. If you have the right attitude, you can make your hairstyle look truly adorable. You should also consider getting bangs or a fringe, which can make almost any haircut look more adorable, as long as they flatter your face shape. You can wear your hair down, half-way up, put it in loose pigtails, a high ponytail, or in a headband. You can even add a cute hair barrette into the mix for an extra adorable look."

      "title": "Apply makeup that accentuate your features.",
      "content": "Apply makeup that accentuate your features. For girls who want to wear some makeup to be more adorable, the key is not to wear too much. Just some light lip gloss, subtle eye shadow, and a bit of mascara should do the trick. Your look should look natural, not like you spent hours trying to look like a runway model. And if you don't normally wear makeup, then keep rocking your simple, cute look. Keep your lips soft by applying lip balm or lip gloss every few hours."

      "title": "Maintain your hygiene.",
      "content": "Maintain your hygiene. Remember that no one has ever been too clean. If you want to be adorable, then you have to keep your teeth sparkly white, bathe every day, and use soap that smells subtle but nice. Put on some lotion to make your skin soft, and wash your hair at least every other day, if you can. Wash your face every day and night and keep your fingernails clean too. You should also smell nice and fresh without smelling too perfumed or strong."

      "title": "Wear comfortable and well-fitted clothes.",
      "content": "Wear comfortable and well-fitted clothes. If you want to be adorable, then you have to rock adorable clothes. That means you should avoid anything too tight, too revealing, or which just looks a bit too racy. You can wear simple-colored clothes, or clothes with polka-dots or simple patterns. Make sure they fit you well and that they look clean and fresh at all times. Some adorable clothes include baby-doll dresses, overalls with a cute tank top, strappy sandals, big sweaters with leggings, or button down shirts that are pastel colored. You can try wearing a graphic tee with an image from your child hood on it, like My Little Ponies(this is really cheap, as you can get really cute graphic tees and sweatshirts from the juniors section at Walmart). This will do the trick of looking both ironic and adorable at once. Have adorable accessories too. If you want to be adorable, then you can add a few accessories to your outfits. You don't have to do anything major. Just simple silver or gold earrings, chunky bracelets, or rings with pretty stones will do."

      "title": "Work on facial expressions.",
      "content": "Work on facial expressions. Your face also has to look adorable. This means that you shouldn't be seen scowling, looking generally miserable, or furrowing your brow too much. Instead, you should look like you're happy to be alive and that you could break into a smile at any second. Your eyes should be alert and curious. You can even bite your lip occasionally, since this can make you look cute. When you talk to other people, make sure that you really look into their eyes and follow along. This will show that you truly care about them, which is definitely adorable."

      "title": "Display decent body language.",
      "content": "Display decent body language. If you want to be adorable, then keep a straight posture without hunching over, be sweet and friendly with your gestures, and look up instead of down at the ground. You can also fidget with your hands or the bottom of your shirt a bit, since this can betray a nervousness that can be seen as adorable. Don't cross your arms over your chest or you'll be seen as closed off instead of adorable and open to what the world has to offer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be helpful",
      "content": "Be helpful . Adorable people can always be found helping others, whether you're helping an old lady cross the street, helping your little brother with his homework, or helping a puppy find a new home. Look out for opportunities where you can help people, whether they are people you know or strangers in need of help. When you're talking to one of your friends and it obviously seems like he has a problem, then you should offer to help even if he hasn't asked you for it. This doesn't mean that you should get taken advantage of by always helping your friends and getting nothing back. If you help your friends, then they should help you. If you volunteer your time, then the universe will get you back."

    {
      "title": "Be youthful.",
      "content": "Be youthful. Being youthful is different from acting young or being completely immature. It just means that you shouldn't be world-weary, or look so tired and downtrodden that you've forgotten the fun, playful person you were as a child. Remember what it was like to have fun all the time, to be fascinated by the world, and to seize new opportunities. Laugh at corny jokes, try a dance class, or just chase your best friends around a park. You can be wise while still choosing to be young at heart. Youthful people don't complain about having to walk or to do something they don't want to do; they're too busy being in awe of life to slow down to complain."

    {
      "title": "Have good manners.",
      "content": "Have good manners. Adorable people always know when to say \"please\" and \"thank you\" and keep everything upbeat and positive. They are always polite, respectful to their elders and people in the service industry, and they hold doors for people and avoid burping or belching in public. They put napkins on their laps before they eat, know how to be kind over the telephone, and clean up after themselves. If you want to be adorable, then you definitely have to hone your manners."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be sweet.",
      "content": "Be sweet. Adorable people are also very sweet. Being sweet means being kind, joyful, and generally gracious to others. If you're sweet, then you want to make other people feel loved and special, and to show people that you really care about them, even if you're just getting to know each other. This shouldn't be faked or forced, and you shouldn't be sweet one minute only to be mean behind someone's back the next second. Being sweet takes practice, but you can learn to show love for people if you work on it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be playful",
      "content": "Be playful . Adorable people are playful because they're curious about life and love exploring things. They like kicking a soccer ball around a beach, they like getting piggyback rides, and they like teasing their friends and having a good time. If you want to be playful, then you have to be open to new things, not be afraid to look at the world like a kid, and to find new uses for old things. If you want to be adorable, then being playful will help you keep up your sweet, fun image."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be friendly and warm.",
      "content": "Be friendly and warm. Treat everyone with warmth and friendliness. They wave to people they know (or sometimes, people they don't know), they remember people's names, and they compliment people when they deserve it. They ask people questions about their lives, show them that they care about what they think, and they even invite people to go out to the movies or throw parties for their close friends. Warmth is a vibe you give off; you want people to feel your kindness, positive energy, and genuine spirit radiating all around you. Even if you're a bit shy, you could always work on being a bit more friendly. Friendly people are also always making new friends and introducing them to their old friends. They aren't afraid to be nice to people who are pretty different from them. Warm people are welcoming; when people meet them, they just want to be around them as much as they can."
