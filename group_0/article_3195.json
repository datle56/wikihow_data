      "content": "Ask yourself if porn is the right industry for you. On the outset, porn seems like the perfect career for adventurous, sexually-active actors. You get paid to have sex almost every day, and the pay is actually pretty good once you get started. But porn comes with a series of risks as well, and they may outweigh the perceived benefits. Things to remember include: Your image, once filmed, will be online forever, even if you try and switch careers. You need to take the time every day to stay in shape , eat well, and keep clean and hygienic. You are not having sex for fun, you are doing it for your job. Expect the intimacy and spontaneity of sex to disappear during a 4-hour video shoot. Maintaining a committed relationship while in porn can be almost impossible, as jealousy is only natural.

This is a heavily enforced rule in the porn industry because breaking it can lead to years of prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. Even if you are a consenting, willing participant, you must be 18 or older to be in porn in the United States.

      "content": "Ask how much you will be paid. The average rate for a straight porn star in Brooklyn, NY, is $500-600 for one video shoot. Gay porn stars, however, make three times that, no matter the gender. The general rule of thumb is that the weirder it is from “average,” the more you will get paid. So a straight, guy-girl scene might make $800 while an intense bondage or novelty scene can make $2,000 or more. [5] X Research source The average female porn star averages $50,000 a year, but can make upwards of $350,000. Top male performers can make more than $100,000 each year, but average far less.

[7] X Research source That said, most videos are not location specific, making it impossible to determine where it was shot, so producers will often make videos anywhere. There is a porn industry in many major cities, but to have the best chance of breaking in you need to move to LA. Some major hubs include: Los Angeles, San Fernando Valley, California. This is the porn capital of the world. [8] X Research source New York City, New York Orlando, Tampa, and Miami, Florida [9] X Research source San Diego and San Francisco, CA Portland, OR"

      "content": "Realize that it is very difficult to become a porn \"star. \" The porn industry is inundated with young talent that flocks to Los Angeles hoping to make it big. The sad reality, however, is that not everyone can be a well-known, marketable star in any industry. If the only reason you want to be in porn is to be famous, pulling in a six-figure salary every year, you will be sorely disappointed. The porn industry is at its most competitive thanks to the explosion of internet porn, so be ready to work hard to make a name for yourself. Porn is not a lavish lifestyle, it is a job, and you need to treat it as such. While no one should ever force you to do something, having wider preferences and being willing to try more things will lead to more gigs and greater success."

      "content": "Remember that all body types are beautiful, and lucrative, in porn. One of the most interesting facets of porn is how inclusive it is. Since there is a desire for almost any type of man or woman on the internet, almost any type of man or woman can find a niche in the porn industry. What matters most is confidence on camera, not your look. That said, make sure you show your best side for the camera. Exercise , a healthy diet , and a good posture will all help you go far on camera."

      "content": "Take flattering photographs , both nude and clothed. Producers are most concerned with your look as they cast porn, so they need to see if you will fit in their next video. Capture as much of your body as you can, showing off your best assets whenever possible. If you have an incredible chest, puff it out slightly and make it the center of the photograph. If you are proud of you booty, curve your body so that it is in the frame. The shots you absolutely need are: Full body, clothed scantily (tight t-shirt and shorts, lacy tops, etc.) Full-body, nude. Men should have a full erection. Headshot."

Any porn shoot you get will demand a current (under 30-days old) STD test to make sure no one contracts a dangerous disease while shooting. You can get an STD test at: Your local Planned Parenthood. Your physician. The hospital or health clinic. The CDC has a free search engine to find clinics across the country that will test you for HIV and STDs free of charge. [10] X Research source"

Keep this in mind as you book gigs, as it will help you stay happy and healthy as your career begins. Know your limits and “no-go” areas and be honest with producers before taking a gig. Some of the most common types of porn include: Fetish: Fetish porn is made to fit a specific, often odd, desire. It can feature almost anything, from costumes of famous TV shows to a predilection for feet. BDSM: Standing for “Bondage, Discipline, and Sado-Masochism\", this extreme variety of porn features various power dynamics. It is widely known for whips, chains, handcuffs, masks, and black leather. Sexual Acts: There is a variety of sexual acts and specialty porn genres out there, and you need to know what you are signing up for before showing up. When in doubt, do your research on the large list of porn terms and vocabulary."

Online forums, found easily with an online search for “Adult Modeling Forums,” allow you to post your pictures and search for casting calls. Never give your real name or address on these forums, and instead wait until you are contacted back by a producer who is interested in you.

You need to protect yourself against scams, and the best way to do this is to have a partner to watch your back. [11] X Research source For detailed information, classes, and up-to-date changes on laws in adult education, you should sign up for a free National Association for the Advancement of Science & Art in Sexuality (NAASAS) membership online. If a gig seems too good to be true (paying 1,000s of dollars for minimal work) or does not give you concrete details (what you’ll be doing, where, for how long, and for how much), don’t take the gig."

      "content": "Be ready to perform. An audition will be more than just showing up and snapping a few pictures. You need to be ready to get in the sack and be professional and cooperative. If you’ve booked an audition, you need to know that you’ll be on camera for your first gig. Prepare accordingly. Look nice – wear clean clothes, shower, and groom your private areas. Be on time. Have proof of age and a recent (2-weeks old or less) STD test. If you’re a man, show up with a girl. Ron Jeremy famously said that the only way to get into porn is to bring a woman with you. Make sure she is willing to take part as well. [12] X Research source"

The site MakeLoveNotPorn.tv, for example, lets you post your videos online and make 50% of the profits when people download it. This can be a great way to get comfortable on camera, test your limits, and gain traction in the porn industry. [13] X Research source Focus on what makes you happy.

While there is no law saying you cannot use your real name, it is usually easier to keep your career under wraps if you make up a new name, or ‘’nom de porn.’’ While you can choose anything, from the normal sounding Ron Jeremy and Jenna Jameson to the more absurd Moe the Monster or Brick Steel, you should try and keep things relatively simple. The most common first names are Lisa, Angel, Nicole, Jessica, and Vanessa (female), or David, Tony, Mike, Steve, and Jason (male). The most common last names are Love, Star, Foxx, Rose, and Sweet (female), or Lee, James, Stone, Steel, Black, and Williams (male). [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Be a professional on-set.",
      "content": "Be a professional on-set. Much like a typical movie shoot, porn requires an enormous amount of coordination between cameramen, directors, sound engineers, lighting crews, and actors to succeed. Don’t walk in expecting to be a king – you should be ready for a full 3-4 hours of shooting, re-shooting, and posing. You may have to shoot the same scene 5 times, and you need to deliver and lines and show up at the right place every time. This will be harder than you think after 3-4 hours of near constant performance in the bed. Hit your placement – there is usually a place on the ground, marked by tape, that you have to find and stand on without looking down. Show up on time, with the proper paperwork documenting your age and STD test. Be open and honest on set. Tell the producers your limits beforehand and ask for some time if you have trouble getting it up, getting in costume, or setting a scene."

      "content": "Know that you will have to conform to someone else’s standards. Porn is entertainment for other people, and the director, writers, and producers will all have a vision for what is the most appealing scene. You need to be flexible and willing to change, whether that means putting on costumes, working frequently, or using shots and pills to enhance your “goods.” This won’t always be pleasant, but is necessary to develop a strong, lasting career."

      "content": "Diversify your options. A straight male or female who only does one type of porn is, unfortunately, not going to get a lot of work. The porn industry is constantly changing and evolving, and it requires actors who are flexible, eager, and willing to try new things. While you should always respect your boundaries , test out new gigs as you become comfortable in the industry to take your career to the next level. Remember, the weirder the shoot, the more you usually get paid. Scenes with multiple or same-sex partners often pay the most."
