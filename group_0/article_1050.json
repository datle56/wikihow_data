Some dog breeds are more energetic than others. If you are a sedentary person who enjoys quiet activities, it would be ill-advised to adopt breed of dog known for its high energy, such as Boxer or a Jack Russell Terrier. Instead, look at quiet breeds like Pekingese or Shih Tzus. Take your living area into account. Think about adopting a dog on the smaller side if you live in an apartment. Larger dogs can live in smaller areas, but special care should be taken to ensure they receive the proper amount of exercise. On the other hand, some small dogs may feel overwhelmed or in a dangerous environment at a home with acres of land. Determine your time constraints. If you adopt a puppy, you may have to do all the training. Older dogs may already be housebroken and have some training. Additionally, some dogs simply need more stimulation throughout the day. Consider how much time you have to give to your new dog."

      "content": "Look at special needs dogs. Consider whether you would like to adopt a special needs dog. Special needs dogs come in many forms, from those needing extra vet care and those who have physical disabilities to those who may have been abused and have behavioral or emotional issues. Ensure you understand the needs of the dog before you commit to adopting it. A dog that has a chronic condition may require frequent trips to the vet. Make sure you can handle that expense if that is the kind of care your special needs dog requires. Set aside some extra time for the dog. Many dogs are nervous when they are first brought to a new home, and that can be compounded for special needs dogs. Make sure you have extra time set aside when you first adopt the dog to familiarize it with you, anyone else in your home, and the new space. Ask the shelter or rescue, “What specifically will I need to do and to supply in order to properly care for this dog?”"

[2] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Consider looking at the shelter’s website before you visit. Many shelters have information regarding adoptable pets both in their shelter and in their foster home program.

Put your name on the shelter's call list if you are looking for a very specific type of dog, such as a rare breed. Most shelters will give you a call if a certain type of dog is brought to them. Contact your local breed rescue. If you want to adopt a certain breed of dog or desire a purebred, look online or in the phone book for numbers to a breed rescue."

      "content": "Find a vet. You likely don’t need to set up a patient profile with a vet before you adopt your dog, but shelters often ask you to find a veterinary practice you want to use before you bring your dog home. This ensures that you are prepared from the moment you bring your dog home. Contact local vets and ask about their experience with your kind of dog. If you are adopting a certain breed, ask the vet if they are comfortable working with that breed. If you are getting a special needs pet, ask the vet if they have experience caring for your dog’s particular needs. Ask about a wellness plan. Many vets do puppy and dog wellness plans that include a certain number of visits and services, such as vaccines and heartworm tests, a year. Ask your vet if they offer packages at a discounted rate to help keep your new dog covered."

Once you have found a dog you like and you have prepared yourself and your home for their arrival, start the adoption process by filling out the necessary paperwork with the shelter or rescue. Let the shelter know that you are ready to adopt, confirm the dog you want is still available, and ask them to send you a copy of the adoption paperwork. Adoption paperwork can be a lengthy process. It may require not only your name and address, but contact information for your vet, personal references, and even statements regarding why you want to adopt and what you have done to prepare. Understand that shelters are trying to ensure that the dogs find loving, caring, permanent homes that will be able to provide for the dog throughout its life.

Most shelters or rescues charge an adoption fee that helps cover the cost of rescuing and caring for the dog, including spaying or neutering the pet and providing vet care after rescue. Fees vary depending upon the dog’s age, breed, and needs, as well what type of care and training the shelter provided. [6] X Research source Make sure your method of payment is accepted at your shelter. You may not be able to adopt, for example, if you were planning on using a credit card but the shelter only takes cash or check.

Will it be a day visit, or will it be overnight? Will the shelter provide food, a bed, and some toys? What do you need to supply?

Set up a time to pick up your pet from the shelter and bring them to their new, permanent home. Make sure you have proper transportation. Even if your local public transit systems allow pets on board, it may be a scary or confusing trip for your dog, and they could lash out. Make sure you have a car or a ride lined up to get your pet home quickly and with minimal stress. Arrange to pick your pet up on a day where you will be able to stay with it the whole day. Your new dog will likely be confused and a little scared. Leaving them alone for extended periods right after you bring them home won’t help that.

Rescue animals can be shy or cautious. It is important to offer the opportunity to socialize, but do not force them into any action. This could cause harm to both your dog and whomever they interact with. Start with exposure to friends and family in the home. Allow your dog to meet new people in familiar surroundings before leaving them with new people for any extended period of time. Try a dog park to get your dog socializing with other dogs. If you believe your new dog may be too aggressive to socialize with other dogs or people, work with a behavioral specialist to help train them. This often comes from previous training, or a place of fear within the dogs. Proper training can help them learn proper behavior with positive reinforcement."
