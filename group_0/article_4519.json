      "content": "Let him know before everyone else does. It's fine to ask a friend or two for advice, but once someone knows you're planning a breakup, it won't stay secret forever. Don't delay once you've made up your mind. You won't earn any nice points if your boyfriend finds out from someone else. Whatever you do, don't have a friend pass on the information for you."

      "content": "Meet in person and in private. [2] X Research source Breaking up over text, email, or anything besides a conversation is a terrible idea. Meet in person, and meet somewhere you can talk in private, where he won't be embarrassed by the possibility of strangers overhearing. If you're in a long-distance relationship, call him when he's at home and alone. If you are scared that he might react by physically hurting you, meet in a quiet but public place, such as the corner of a park or a mostly-empty cafe."

Don't give false hope by saying you want more free time, or that it's just a bad time in your life. You're losing him because the relationship isn't working out, and he needs to know that. Try to keep your reasoning about you, rather than about him to preserve feelings. Use \"I\" statements like, \"I think we're better as friends\" or \"My feelings for you have faded.\" [5] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 7 July 2020.

If he brings up his behavior, personality, or appearance during the conversation, use your judgement to proceed. Most of the time, you should deflect the question by saying \"I've already said my reasons.\" If it's an actual, obvious problem (such as him being unfaithful, or something that's been the topic of frequent arguments), admit that \"it doesn't help.\" Be especially careful around topics that are common sources of male anxiety in many cultures: Physical appearance (avoid saying \"I'm not attracted to you\") [6] X Research source Sexual performance Emotional sensitivity or lack of \"machismo\" Ability to provide financially"

If you say it's yours, you'll feel guilty or he'll try to convince you you don't need to break up.
