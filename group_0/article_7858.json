      "title": "Choose a water-based, pH neutral conditioner.",
      "content": "Choose a water-based, pH neutral conditioner. Look for a high-quality leather conditioner that does not contain petroleum distillates, silicone, or waxes. The goal of the conditioner is to replenish the natural oils in the leather, so choose one with top-quality ingredients. Cheaper leather conditioners may cling to the leather and have a greasy finish."
