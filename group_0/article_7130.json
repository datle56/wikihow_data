      "content": "Make sure the pork is at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. The pork will need to be thick enough for you to leave the thermometer probe inserted throughout cooking, so some cuts of pork may not be appropriate for a continuous read thermometer. Anything one inch or thicker should be fine. [1] X Research source Thin cuts of pork are not well suited for leaving a thermometer inserted throughout cooking. Ribs and bacon may be too thin to use a thermometer."

      "content": "Prepare the pork to be cooked. A continuous read thermometer is meant to stay in the pork throughout its cooking time, but you’ll want to do any preparations, brines, and the like before inserting it. [2] X Research source You can insert the thermometer first, but it may get in the way of your preparations."

      "content": "Insert the thermometer in the thickest part of the meat. You’ll want to stick the thermometer in the middle of the cut of pork, because that’s the last part that will reach proper temperature. [3] X Research source Keep the thermometer away from bone in the pork, as it may affect its readings. If the pork is less than an inch thick, you may be able to insert the thermometer from the side, otherwise, it may be easiest just to insert it from the top."

      "title": "Wait until the thermometer reads at least 140 °F (60 °C).",
      "content": "Wait until the thermometer reads at least 140 °F (60 °C). According to the USDA, pork needs to be cooked to between 145 °F (63 °C) and 160 °F (71 °C) in order to be safe to eat. However, you can take the pork out of the oven a few degrees prior to the 145 mark to avoid overcooking. [4] X Research source The internal temperature of the pork will continue to rise once you take it out, regardless of whether you cooked it in the oven or a slow cooker. Never eat pork that hasn’t had its internal temperature brought up to at least 145 °F (63 °C). With ground pork, 160 °F (71 °C) should be treated as the lowest number, rather than 140 °F (60 °C)."

      "content": "Take the pork out of the oven and let it sit. Although you may remove the pork a few degrees before it reached the recommended temperature, heat from the outside portions of the meat will continue to spread into the middle, raising the temperature even out of the oven. Let a thick cut of pork (1 inch (2.5 cm) or bigger) rest for 15 minutes before eating, but thinner ones will take less time. Keep an eye on the thermometer to ensure it passes the 145 °F (63 °C) mark before serving. If it doesn’t, keep cooking it."

      "content": "Cook the pork with the thermometer handy. An instant thermometer isn’t meant to be left in the cut of meat as it cooks. Instead, you will need to periodically insert the thermometer probe into the pork to check its internal temperature. [5] X Research source Unlike a continuous read thermometer, an instant thermometer must be inserted and removed each time you check. Do not use an instant surface thermometer, as it won’t tell you internal cooking temperatures."

While some people may want to check the temperature of the pork without pulling the whole pan from the oven, the high temperatures inside the oven make doing so unsafe. [6] X Research source Even if you’re not using an oven, remove the pork from the heat source before checking its temperature. Checking the temperature while still on the stove or in the oven may also affect the thermometer’s reading."

Like a continuous read thermometer, you’ll want to insert your instant thermometer into the thickest portion of the cut of meat. Keep it away from any bones as that can have an effect on its reading. If the meat is less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, you may want to insert the thermometer probe horizontally instead of from the top. Be sure to remove the thermometer again before putting the pork back on or in its heat source."

If you’re using a recipe, it may offer guidance as to how long the pork needs to cook, but you should not rely on the timeframe provided. Check the pork periodically and continue cooking it until it hits a minimum of 140 °F (60 °C), or 160 °F (71 °C) for ground pork.

Once the pork is about 5 °F (−15 °C) below the preferred internal temperature, remove it from the heat source and let it sit for a few minutes before serving.

A temperature of 160 °F (71 °C) is usually considered well done. You don’t need to let ground pork sit after it’s done cooking."

Although thermometers are the best way to determine if your pork is done cooking, you can gauge the doneness of pork by the color of the juices that come out of it when you poke a hole in it with a knife or fork. [9] X Research source If the juices that come out of the pork run clear or are very faintly pink, the pork is done cooking. If the juices are not clear, continue cooking the pork and check again later."

If you are slow cooking the pork, it will reach the necessary internal temperature long before the meat is as tender as you may intend. Use a long knife or a skewer to puncture the middle of the pork and assess the resistance it gives you as you press it in. [10] X Research source If the knife or skewer slides in and out easily, the center of the pork has become tender. If you hit resistance, allow the pork to continue to cook and try again after a few minutes."

Cut a slit into the thickest part of the pork, then pull it apart with a knife and fork to gauge its internal color. [11] X Research source The pork should be opaque (solid in color) and may have a slight pinkish tint when done. Very thin cuts of pork like sliced bacon can be checked without cutting into them."

      "content": "Compare the pork’s firmness to the palm of your hand. For cuts of pork like chops and steaks, you can usually assess the meat’s doneness by pressing firmly into it with your tongs or fingers. Properly cooked pork will feel firm and quickly spring back into shape after you pull your fingers away. The pork should feel as firm as the center of your outstretched palm. If any juices squeeze out, they should be clear when the pork is done cooking. If the pork feels soft to the touch, it needs to keep cooking."
