[1] X Research source While the FBI accepts applicants with degrees in a variety of subjects, as of September 2018, the agency is especially interested in applicants who’ve earned degrees in either finance, computer science, engineering, or international studies. All potential FBI agents must qualify for 1 of 5 Special Agent Entry Programs: Language, Law, Accounting, Computer Science, or Diversified (for those lacking the specialized skills of the other entry programs). If you’d like to qualify for any of the first 4 programs, you’ll need to pursue a degree in a relevant field (e.g., computer science)."
