      "content": "Check the user's info before downloading. Soulseek users often have their own idiosyncratic rules for downloading from them. Before downloading, right-click or control-click the user's name (from a search) and select Get User Info . If the user doesn't provide info, a reasonably safe way to avoid being banned is to not download more than one album per day from a particular user. If that user has a lot of material that you'd like to download, add them to your user list so you can easily find them in the future. To add someone to your user list, right-click or control-click their name and select Add user to list ."

      "content": "Don't queue up tons of files from the same user. Some Soulseek users may not mind if you download a few albums or movies from them at once, but many prefer you stick to one or two albums or videos at a time."

      "title": "Keep your files organized.",
      "content": "Keep your files organized. While less common, some more particular users might ban you if they browse your files and find a bunch of unorganized, untagged music in a single folder. Even if you don't like to download entire albums, create folders for artist names, genres, BPM , or any other organizational method that shows you want to make it easy for people to download from you."

      "title": "Check your internet connection.",
      "content": "Check your internet connection. If your connection is so slow that it takes hours to download files that others could download in minutes, they might ban you so you don't hog their upload slots. Check your internet speed and make sure you have high enough bandwidth to download files. If your internet is slow because too many people are downloading from you at once, there are ways to optimize Soulseek for better performance."

      "title": "Keep sharing more files.",
      "content": "Keep sharing more files. If you're newer to file sharing on Soulseek, you may find that you're being banned because you're not sharing enough files (\"You have been banned for sharing less than 5000 files\"). As you download, be sure to move your downloads into your sharing folder and then click Rescan Shares to make them available to others."

      "content": "Put all your music files into a folder. Before you share music on Soulseek, make sure your music files are all in the same location and that no other types of files are in the folder. People often accidentally share their Documents or Downloads directories, both of which often contain personal or sensitive data. For example, you can create a folder called Music Files that contains sub-folders organized by artist and album. People on Soulseek really appreciate a well-organized music file structure!"

Click Check Ports to see if it's open, and a Soulseek page will open in your default browser.

Temporarily turn off your VPN, close and restart Soulseek (be careful not to just minimize it– actually close the program and reopen it), go to Options > Login , and click Check Ports to try again. If the port is now open, your VPN is blocking it. Your VPN must support port forwarding to use it with Soulseek, and not all do."
