      "content": "Make a slit into the plastic casing around the wire. Use a fine cutting tool like a razor blade to make a slit in the plastic casing that's around the wire. You can also use a wire stripper or pliers with a blade. Make a slit that goes completely around the casing of the wire. [2] X Research source Use thick gloves to avoid cutting yourself when cutting the copper wire. Be careful not to cut all the way through the copper wire when you cut the casing."

      "content": "Separate the plastic from the copper wire. Slide the casing that's been cut and remove it from the copper wire. You should be able to separate the plastic portion from the wire by pulling on it. If there are portions of the plastic that aren't coming lose, go over them with a razor blade again.

      "content": "Boil the copper wire in water for 10 minutes. Bring the water to a rolling boil. Carefully place your wires into the pot with the plastic casing still attached. The heat will warm up the plastic on the wire and make it easier to remove. [5] X Research source Never burn your copper wire casing. It hurts the environment and reduces the value of your wire. Use thick gloves when handling hot metal."

      "content": "Pull the plastic casing away from the wire. It's important that you don't allow the plastic to cool or else it won't be soft enough to pull apart. Simply grab onto on end of the soft plastic and pull it away from the copper wire. If it's hot enough, it should slide off."
