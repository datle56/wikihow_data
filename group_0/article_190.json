      "content": "Place an apostrophe before the last 2 digits of a year to abbreviate it. Say you want to shorten the year 2022 in a sentence. Instead of writing 2022, you can abbreviate the year as ’22, using an apostrophe in place of the 20. [1] X Research source Check out these examples: A sentence about 1998: Bob Smith was class president in ’98 . A sentence about 2009: If I remember correctly, Kanye West stole Taylor Swift’s microphone in ’09 . Keep in mind that an apostrophe (’) and closing quotation mark (‘) are not the same. Make sure the thicker end of your apostrophe is up, not down. Get the correct punctuation while typing by hitting the apostrophe key twice and then deleting the first apostrophe.

[4] X Research source Avoid extra spaces, and check to make sure you’re using an en dash (–) and not a hyphen (-). Here are some examples: The 1914–18 war officially started after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. In the years 1997–2006 , we released 5 albums, but none were successful.
