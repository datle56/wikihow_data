      "content": "Google usually crawls and indexes sites automatically. However, here are some reasons why Google won't index your page: The website is too new. Crawling and indexing can be very fast (within a few hours) to very slow (a few weeks). You can help Google realize that it needs to crawl and index a new site by adding it to the Google Search Console . Your website is missing a domain name. In this case, people can only get to your site using an IP address ; Google also won't be able to find your site to index it. To resolve this issue, make sure you have the site correctly set up through WordPress, Wix, or whatever site manager or host you're using. There was a recent redesign. Altering your brand or website significantly may impact how Google indexes your site. If you want Google to crawl your new website immediately, use the Google Search Console to request a recrawl by clicking Request Indexing next to your site's name. You're missing a sitemap. A sitemap is a blueprint of everything on your site, including pages, videos, files, and how everything is shared between your pages. You want to include a sitemap in an XML format in the search console to hasten the time for your page to get crawled and indexed by Google. Your site has a poor structure. If it's difficult to navigate around your site, it's going to be hard for users to find the information they need or explore for more information. Google is also negatively impacted by a poor site structure and will be unable to crawl and index your site. This includes things like Orphan Pages , which are pages that aren't linked to your main site. Fix this by linking the orphaned page on your main page – internal links will also help resolve this issue. Your site isn't mobile-friendly. More than half of searches are made from a mobile device, which is why Google prioritizes sites that are mobile-friendly. Avoid this by using adaptable design, compressing large images, and improving load times. Your site isn't ADA compliant. Google wants your site to be accessible and will check for that when it crawls your pages. Keep these ADA-compliant issues in mind when creating your site: Making images available via Alt text Making sure text is readable and comprehensive (avoiding grammar and spelling errors) Making sure users can navigate the site with keyboard-only commands. Low-quality content . Thin, scammy, or outdated content, or pages stuffed with random keywords, are generally left out of indexing. You want to generate content that is unique, accurate, and up-to-date. Avoid stuffing your site with keywords. Instead, make sure you're using relevant keywords. Googlebot is blocked. If your robots.txt file contains the line \" User-agent: *Disallow: /\" , the bot is blocked from crawling your site. Remove this to get rid of the \"noindex\" rule. [1] X Research source There's a redirect loop. If your site has a page that links to another page that links back to the main page, the Googlebot may get lost in the redirect loop. Make sure this isn't happening by opening your .htaccess file or HTML sources for your website and looking for redirects. You've exceeded the crawl budget. Google doesn't have the resources to crawl every site an unlimited number of times. So you have a numerical limit to how many times Google can crawl your page. Check your crawl limits by visiting the Crawl Status Report on Google Search Console. If you have a really large website, you can consolidate pages or add code to instruct Google not to crawl specific pages. Your site has hard-to-read code. Your raw and rendered HTML should be easy for Google to read. Practices called cloaking, as well as hiding text or links, are red flags that can prevent Google from crawling and indexing your site. Check any JavaScript or CSS to make sure there isn't code preventing Googlebots. In addition, any sites that rely heavily on JavaScript can prevent Google from indexing your site, as crawling through JavaScript takes more time and effort. You received a Google penalty. Factors like unnatural links, malicious webpages, and sneaky redirects can earn you penalties. You can review any penalties from the Google Search Console. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Adhere to these tips to maintain a high presence on Google. Use the right keywords. Identify the keywords or terms used in the niche you're creating content for to ensure that your website appears in Google's search results. Don't target high-volume keywords that don't have any relevance to your niche; you'll miss the opportunity to gain an authoritative voice on keywords that actually represent and help the niche you're targeting and will instead attract junk traffic or useless traffic to your site. Create relevant content . Organic traffic comes from content that is helpful, informative, and highly relevant to your audience. Search engines prefer content that delivers in-depth topical information that's easy to navigate. So make sure that the content you're offering is relevant, on-point, and helps your audience find answers to their questions easily. Optimize page titles and descriptions. Keep the targeted keyword or phrase in mind when you're creating these elements, since they give a brief introduction of your page to search engines. These are usually the first things users see when they visit your page, so let them know they're in the right place by using the same keywords. Keep your page title to 50-60 characters (spaces included) and your description to 150-160. Optimize images. You can leverage image search with more visually attractive images and get more visitors that way. Here are a few pointers for optimizing images: Add subtitles to your images and use keywords. Use alt text to describe your images. Avoid using crowded/cluttered pictures. Use high-resolution images, but be careful not to use an image that's too big. Use internal links. Linking to other pages on your site improves your Google ranking by showing search engines how information is organized and how users can easily explore more content. Avoid linking errors, as they can have a negative effect on your SEO ranking. Optimize URLs. A well-performing URL tells search engines about the contents of the page and how it relates to the main domain name. Focus on creating URLs with concise, logical, and keyword-targeted language. URLs can be like breadcrumbs from the domain name, helping users decide if your site is helpful for them. For example, a site URL /pets is much more helpful than a string of random letters and numbers."
