      "content": "Try bopping your hip for an easy, sexy move. You can dance by bopping your hip both with and without props. Stand with your body to the side. Bend 1 knee and keep only your toes of that foot on the ground. Bring your hip up and down to the beat of the music. Try to bounce your weight into your heel and back out again as you move your hip to create a bopping motion. [1] X Research source If you aren’t using a prop, bend your elbow and place your hand on the hip that you’re bopping. If you’re using a prop such as a chair, hold onto it with your hand that is on the same side of your body as the hip you’re bopping. Try switching the side that you’re facing outwards to change up this simple bopping move."

Release your glutes and your stomach as you move your hips and pelvis behind you again. [3] X Research source You can either keep your hands on your hips as you perform this step or keep your arms open and roll your wrists gently as your hips move. It can be helpful to imagine that you have a hula hoop around your hips and that you need to follow the circular shape."
