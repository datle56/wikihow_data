      "title": "No, you can’t officially baptize yourself.",
      "content": "No, you can’t officially baptize yourself. Baptism is the process of being immersed in water as a public display of loyalty to God. According to the Bible, when someone’s baptized, they repent their sins and promise to do God’s will, putting them on a path of everlasting life. [1] X Research source In the church, baptism is only considered official or legitimate if it’s administered or witnessed by another Christian. When someone is baptized, the administrator guides them into the water and then pulls them out. This symbolizes the Christian ideal that people cannot bestow God’s grace on themselves, but that it must be given to them. The Bible doesn’t mention who must administer a baptism, as long as they’re a believer of God. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Self-baptism is when you accept the Holy Spirit into your life. While you may not be able to baptize yourself officially in terms of the church, you can invite the Holy Spirit into your life yourself—after all, baptism is an inward change. [3] X Research source If you’re hesitant about joining the church or making an everlasting promise to the Lord, start small by accepting God’s love into your life. Self-baptism isn’t recognized by the church or Christian religion, but it may help you feel empowered and connected with yourself and a greater power. There’s no official process, but you can start with these steps: Pray . Speak to God by confessing your sins, asking for forgiveness, and inviting Him into your life. Read the Bible . Study scripture to learn more about God’s power and love. Meditate. Dive deep into your soul—what do you crave most? Follow God’s commands. Show your loyalty to the Lord by abiding by His word."

      "title": "Yes, you can be baptized at home.",
      "content": "Yes, you can be baptized at home. You can be baptized wherever there’s water! Today, most baptisms are performed in a large bath or pool within a church. During Biblical times, baptisms were performed in bodies of water—Jesus himself was baptized in a river. A baptism can be performed in a pool, lake, or a hot tub in your backyard. [4] X Research source Talk to your pastor or Christian loved ones about planning a baptism at home. Some say this can be a more personal experience and celebration of your connection with God."

      "title": "“If a church baptizes me, I’m committing to that church or denomination.”",
      "content": "“If a church baptizes me, I’m committing to that church or denomination.” This is a common misconception and is entirely not true. Baptism is an outward display of your choice to repent your sins and devote yourself to God. [5] X Research source If you’re baptized in one church and later decide to join another, your baptism is still respected. Just because you’re baptized in one place doesn’t mean you’re bound to it."

      "title": "“Other churches won’t accept my infant baptism.”",
      "content": "“Other churches won’t accept my infant baptism.” Most churches will accept your infant baptism. Paedobaptism is the practice of baptizing infants and is a public display of a child’s oncoming Christian upbringing. [6] X Research source While not all Christians practice this, those within the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox branches do. Some Protestant denominations, like the Baptists, view baptism as an outward expression of an internal change and may only allow \"believers\" (those who were baptized in their church) into the congregation."

      "title": "“I need to get baptized again as an adult now that I can make my own decisions.”",
      "content": "“I need to get baptized again as an adult now that I can make my own decisions.” This may be a reason to want to baptize yourself again, but isn't totally necessary. People do get baptized again all the time! Having a second baptism in adulthood can help solidify and reaffirm your faith in the Lord. While it’s not necessary, it may help you feel more connected with God. Some churches offer reaffirmation ceremonies. These are not second baptisms, but a way to recommit to your belief and faith in God after being baptized once."

      "content": "1 Peter 3:21 states, “and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” [7] X Research source Acts 2:38 says, “Peter replied, ‘Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” [8] X Research source John 3:5 states, “Jesus answered, ‘Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.’” [9] X Research source Matthew 28:19-20 says, “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” [10] X Research source Romans 6:4 states, “We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.” [11] X Research source"
