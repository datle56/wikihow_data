Learn about the ins and outs of the process so you can properly relay them to your parents.

The piercer uses a hollow needle to create the hole for the piercing.” “I know the piercing will hurt a little bit, but I can deal with the pain.

Explain to your parents that you’ve researched a lot of piercing parlors in the area, and that you’ll only get your nose pierced by a reputable piercer who works in a clean, well-reviewed establishment. [4] X Research source “There’s a piercer about 20 minutes from here—he has hundreds of fantastic Yelp reviews and he has over 10 years of piercing experience. He’s even a member of the Association of Professional Piercers.” “I would never pierce my nose myself or get a piercing done by a friend (or anyone who wasn’t a professional). If I get this done, it’ll be done safely and hygienically.” “If it would make you feel more comfortable, we can search for piercers on APP’s website . Their database only includes certified, trustworthy piercing professionals.”"

Explain the different parts of the aftercare process, like washing your hands before cleaning the piercing with saline-soaked gauze, and washing your sheets and pillowcases frequently. [5] X Research source “I plan on cleaning my piercing twice a day by washing my hands, soaking a cotton swab in saline, and dabbing around the nose piercing.” “I won’t use any harmful products to clean my piercing like hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, or bacitracin.” [6] X Research source"

      "content": "A nose piercing (plus the jewelry) can easily cost more than $50, but it ultimately depends on the individual piercer or piercing business. Scope out the prices of piercers in your area and make sure you have enough saved up for the procedure ( including a tip , if possible). Let your parents know that you will pay for everything and that you don’t expect them to foot the bill. “I’ve been putting some of my savings aside for the past few months, and I have more than enough to cover both the piercing and the tip. I wouldn’t expect you to pay for anything.” “I’ve researched how much a piercing would cost and I’ve already budgeted the money for it.”"

      "content": "Your parents might have some unrealistic expectations when it comes to nose jewelry. To really ease your parents into the idea of a nose piercing, pick out some small studs that are barely noticeable to the naked eye. (Keep in mind, though, that your initial jewelry will likely come from your piercer.) Really impress your parents by talking about the best types of metals out there for initial piercings, like implant-certified titanium or niobium. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Introduce your parents to the world of retainers: extremely low-key jewelry that’s designed to hide or “retain” a piercing rather than stand out. If they’re worried about a piercing making you seem “unprofessional,” explain how easy they are to hide in more professional settings. Glass retainers in particular are great options.

      "content": "Nose piercings can close up once you remove the jewelry, especially if they’re recent. Reassure your parents that getting a piercing isn’t an irreversible decision—if you decide one day that you don’t like it, you can simply take it out, and your body will do the rest. [9] X Research source To really sell your point, explain to your parents that the “hole” of a nose piercing is known as a fistula. If you remove your nose jewelry before that fistula really has time to heal, the piercing will close easily."

      "content": "Dig deep and really think about why you want a nose piercing. Will it help you feel more confident? Do you really like the way they look? Understanding this reason can help you better connect with your parents as you make their case to them. “Nose studs have been trendy for decades, and they’ll never go out of style. I’ve always loved the way they look, and would love to have one of my own.” “I’ve always loved jewelry, and I think getting a nose piercing would be a great way to expand my horizons.” Note: Keep in mind that some reasons might not resonate with your parents. For example, getting a nose piercing to “fit in” likely won’t be compelling—they’ll probably say that you don’t need a piercing to fit in, or that true friends will stay by you regardless of your piercing status. (Which is all true, by the way, but not helpful when it comes to convincing your parents.)"

      "content": "It’s completely valid to be frustrated if your parents don’t see things your way. However, getting upset with them won’t earn you any points in the long run. If your parents say “no,” treat it as a temporary answer to an ongoing conversation that’ll be picked up later on. “While I’m a little disappointed, I respect your answer and appreciate you discussing this with me.” “I respect your answer, but this is something I’m really serious about. I’d love to discuss this more in a few months if you’d be willing.” “I’m disappointed, but I understand. Would you be willing to circle back to this conversation next year?”"

      "content": "If you’re in your early teens, your parents just might not be comfortable with you having a piercing so young. If you’re truly committed to getting a nose piercing, wait a year or 2 before talking to your parents again—they might take you more seriously when they see how dedicated you are. If you’re an older teen (like 16 or 17), it might be worth waiting until you’re 18 to get the piercing done. We know that it’s a tough wait—but imagine how rewarding it’ll be to get that piercing without needing your parents’ permission!"
