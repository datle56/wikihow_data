      "content": "Use a magnifying glass to decipher the karat number on each piece. The first thing you have to do is find out if your gold is real . Separating your gold by its karat weight will not only help you begin to assess its value, but it can point out items that are not even gold. If it is unreadable, you could choose to have the gold tested by a reputable dealer. There's also the possibility that some of the gold is actually just gold-plated, which a dealer would determine with certainty by performing a chemical test. Take note that much of the gold jewelry manufactured before 1980 is slightly below its marked karat value. For example, jewelry marked 18K would actually be between 17K and 17.5K. In 1980, the laws regarding the marking and purity of gold jewelry were changed."

      "content": "Perform an acid test on any items you are unsure of. If you're still uncertain as to whether or not an item is gold after inspecting it with a magnifying glass, prepare to test it. You have two options here: the acid test and the Skey test. The first, the acid test, will require a gold testing kit or the individual parts that make one up (the acid and stone). Supplies for this test can be purchased from online or physical jewelry suppliers for a small price, and are available separately or as a set. A kit will come with 10K, 14K, 18K and 22K bottles of testing acid, which will normally be nitric acid. It will also come with a test stone, also known as a streak stone or touch stone, that will be made from many different materials, including novaculite or other types of flint material. Kits can also be purchased with an accompanying scale. For suspected 14K jewelry, rub the item on the stone and place a drop of 14K acid onto the mark it leaves. If your item is indeed 14K gold, it will stand up to the acid and not change. If it is 10K, the 14K acid will turn it brown. If it completely disappears, it isn't even gold. If it is an unmarked item, go up to the 22K acid incrementally until it turns brown, and when it does, consider it to be the next lowest karat. For example, if the 18K acid has no effect, but the 22K acid turns it brown, then consider your item to be 18K. If the 14K acid has no effect, but the 18k acid turns it brown, consider it to be 14k, and so on for other karat fineness tests."

      "content": "Use the Skey test. For the Skey test, start by purchasing a gold tester or gold verification pen employing the Skey method. These testers sell for under $50 and can give a 1000 tests. This test is a safe alternative to acid and will test accurately on metals such as white gold. [1] X Research source For all suspected jewelry, Slowly write a Â¼ inch line and go over the same line 4 times without removing the pen tip from the test metal. Immediately write a line on any white paper. If it is under 10k, the line will be light brown and turn green within seconds If it is 10k, the line will be light brown. If it is 14k, the line will be dark brown. If it is 18k, the line will be orange. If it is 22k, the line will be yellow. If it is 24K, the line will be red. If there is no line at all, it is not gold."

      "content": "Keep gold coins separate from the rest of your gold. If you have gold coins, they may have a numismatic (coin) value which is above their metal value. This tends to be based on age, rarity, and overall condition. In this case, your best option is to take it to a coin dealer for assessment. This is definitely worth doing, as you may be able to get more money that way. [2] X Research source If you have experience auctioning items online, you may be able to sell the coin online, but you may need a certificate of authenticity to persuade buyers to pay top dollar. It also makes sense to have a secure payment system in place to make customers feel safe with their transaction. The benefit of an auction (provided you're aware of the coin's real value) is that it may go well beyond your asking price if several collectors are bidding for the coin.

      "content": "Get a scale to weigh your scrap gold. Determining the weight of your scrap gold will help you to calculate its base value. This doesn't necessarily represent the price you will get, but it's good to have this figure as a reference when starting negotiations. Purchase a jeweler's scale. Such a scale is available online for less than $50. This is the best way to accurately weigh your gold, as jeweler's scales are built to be more precise than a typical gram scale you might have in your home. Use a food scale if you cannot purchase a jeweler's scale. If you have a food scale in your home, you can use it to weigh your gold. Most inexpensive food scales weigh only by the ounce, so make sure you evaluate the functionality of the scale if you are purchasing one specifically to weigh your scrap gold. If you are unable or unwilling to purchase your own scale, take your scrap gold to a jeweler for weighing."

Depending on the scale, there may be an arrow that settles near an exact gram amount, and you take your measurements from that. However, more expensive scales will have a digital readout that makes calculations as easy as reading the screen."

[3] X Research source Usually, you won't have a full ounce of gold for any particular karat, and if you do, it will only be for a single karat fineness, so having all your calculations in the same weight measurement makes things much easier later in the process."

There is an exact formula for calculating the per-gram value of your scrap gold, and the only variable factor in the equation is the current market price of gold. You can find the current price by searching the Internet or looking it up in your local newspaper. Gold is valued per troy ounce, with a troy ounce equaling 31.1 grams. The price of gold fluctuates hourly according to supply and demand, so the price may be very different in the afternoon from the price you saw in the morning.

For example, if you have 10K gold and the current price of gold is US$1,600 per ounce or US$51.45 per gram ($1,600/31.1), then the price of your scrap gold is US$51.45 x .4167 = USD$21.44 per gram. [5] X Research source Use the following conversions to value your gold. 10k = 10/24 = .4167 14k = 14/24 = .5833 18k = 18/24 = .750 22k = 22/24 = .9167"

      "content": "Go through the assaying process to be sure of the gold's value. The gold still has to go through an assay process to determine the true percentage of gold. For example, 14kt gold assayed is .575%. When you melt gold you will lose weight due to alloys used in the making process. Assaying is a process wherein a sample of the gold is taken from the whole to be processed and assessed for purity. The sample is melted, separated, and weighed to reach a conclusion about its purity. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Multiply the price per gram by the weight in grams.",
      "content": "Multiply the price per gram by the weight in grams. If you have 10 grams of 10K gold and you calculated the price at US$21.44 per gram, then your scrap gold is worth 10 x US$21.44 = USD$214.40. Some examples: If you have 5 grams of 14K scrap and gold is US$1,600.00 today, then US$1,600 divided by 31.1 would equal US$51.45. That figure, multiplied by .5833 (14K) comes out to US$30.01 per gram. USD$30.01 multiplied by 5 grams equals US$150.05. If you have 15.3 grams of 10K gold scrap, US$1,600 divided by 31.1 equals US$51.45, and that amount multiplied by .4167 (10K) equals US$21.44 per gram. USD$21.44 multiplied by 15.3 grams equals US$328.02. Most people use grams for these calculations but some gold buyers use pennyweight (DWT) instead of grams. There are 20 pennyweights in a troy ounce. You can substitute 20 for 31.1 to calculate pennyweight in our formula. You can also multiply a pennyweight by 1.555 to get an equivalent gram weight or divide a gram weight by the same 1.555 to get pennyweight. [7] X Research source"
