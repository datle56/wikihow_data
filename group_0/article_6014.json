      "content": "Make sure that your cat actually has FeLV. Take your cat to a veterinary clinic so that your cat's blood can be drawn and tested. The test for FeLV is very sensitive and accurate; however, it is often necessary to retest the cat after four weeks to see if they are still positive, or have fought off the infection and are now immune. They will often also test for Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV). The FELV (and FIV in cats 6 months of age or older) tests are routinely performed by animal shelters prior to adoptions, so the results of this testing should be included with the cats veterinary records when adopted. If you found your cat or kitten, or obtained them from a private party, then viral testing should be part of your immediate health care plan. This is especially important if you plan to bring them to a home where cats already live."

      "content": "Look for symptoms of infection. Cats who have recently come in contact with the virus may show signs of the initial viral infection, with non-specific signs such as low energy, fever, or a decreased appetite. After the initial ‘viremia’ (virus multiplying in the bloodstream), some cats’ immune systems will actually fight off and clear the virus completely, others will progress into a persistently infected or ‘latent’ infection stage. At this stage, cats are often asymptomatic and can remain asymptomatic for many years. [3] X Research source Greene et. al, Infectious Diseases of the Dog and Cat"
