      "content": "Make your bed as soon as you wake up. When you wake up from your deep sleep, your bed will probably look atrocious from all that turning and tossing. Pick up any items that fell on the floor such as your pillow, blanket, or stuffed animals, and place them in the correct spot. Many children don't often do this so it will be a nice present for you and your parents. Check for any stains or lingering odor from your pillowcase, bed sheet, or blanket and toss them into the washing machine."

      "content": "Get ready for school. Head back upstairs, grab a toothbrush, squeeze out some toothpaste and brush away . Set a timer for 2 minutes and don't forget to use floss and mouthwash. Use a gentle face wash to clean your face, apply face cream even if you have oily skin to prevent dryness. Do something cute yet simple with your hair such as pigtails, ponytail, messy bun, flat iron it, curl it, half up half down, etc. If you are a girl, wear pretty headbands and hair clips. Pick out an outfit that is both appropriate for school and the weather. Make sure they follow the dress code. Here are examples of things you could wear. In winter, wear some nice warm pants or jeans and a cute shirt or sweater with a jacket. In summer, wear a nice short-sleeved shirt with shorts or a skirt, or a pretty dress. If your skirt or dress is short, wear tights or leggings underneath. In spring, wear a nice short-sleeved or long-sleeved shirt with leggings, pants, or a skirt. You could also wear a romper or dress. In autumn, wear a sweater or long-sleeved shirt with leggings or pants. Obviously, you shouldn't wear clothing with inappropriate messages since you'll most likely get in big trouble."
