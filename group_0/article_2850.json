      "content": "Use problem solving and critical thinking to settle disputes between family members. Practicing prudence means practicing counsel, judgement, and decisiveness. You can be prudent at home by offering counsel to family members who are arguing and using good judgement to try to settle any disputes. Use problem solving methods like active listening, rational analysis, and talking through issues to help your family members reach a compromise. [19] X Research source For example, maybe your siblings are having a disagreement about who should wash the dishes after dinner. Exercise prudence by suggesting that it would only be fair for the person who washed the dishes the night before to be given the night off and given the option of not doing the dishes that night. You can also use prudence to prevent more serious disputes, like a conflict involving money between family members. You may advise your family members to save all their receipts and keep a clear, up to date record on how money is being spent by each family member in the household. This can help to prevent arguments about money and spending down the road."

Exercising prudence in terms of bills will ensure your finances are in order and you do not fall behind on your monthly expenses. To help you be prudent with credit card payments, you may consider consolidating your debts so they are all on one card or with one credit card company, rather than spread out among several cards with different interest rates. Consolidate your debt under the card with the lowest interest rates and the lowest transfer fees so you have lower monthly payments and can pay off the debt faster. You should also try to settle any outstanding debts you may have, such as money owed to family and friends or to other financiers. Rather than try to write off your debts through a write off company, which is often not successful, you should set up a monthly payment system to help pay off your debts over a set period of time. Arrange realistic monthly payments based on your income and take into account any added interest on your payments."

Try to save about 10% of your annual income, especially if you make a decent salary and do not have high monthly expenses."

A big part of being prudent in the workplace is focusing on ways to reduce waste and unnecessary spending through good judgement and planning. You can do this in small ways by always recycling your used paper and printing all documents on both sides of the paper to reduce spending on office supplies such as paper and ink. You can also do this in larger ways by encouraging your co-workers to follow waste reduction practices and to use office supplies in an efficient way. Send out an email reminding everyone to always recycle their scrap paper and only print in color when necessary to conserve ink. You should also suggest cutting down on the use of paper plates and napkins at company events and make sure there are recycling bins throughout the office."

Or, you could suggest swapping out paper plates in the office break room for reusable plates and utensils. Focus on making daily tasks in the office more energy saving so it becomes a habit for everyone in the office."

For example, you may develop action items such as switching the office to green energy by the next fiscal year, or instituting a recycling policy in the office in the next two months. Be specific about the goals of the committee and try to include co-workers from every department or area in the company so the needs of each department are well represented."

You may decide to start your own action group if your school or university does not have an action group on a topic you are passionate about or interested in. Talk to your school counselor or the leader of student life at your university to find out how to start your own action group."

It can be difficult to balance your academic commitments and maintain an active social life, whether you are in middle school, high school, or university. Use good judgement and focus on completing your academic requirements first before you go out for the night or head off on a vacation. Make academic-related decisions that are based on principal, which often means prioritizing your most important deadlines first and completing your assignments on time. You can also create a daily schedule or to-do list of your academic commitments and your social plans to ensure you have set aside enough time for each task. Complete your homework and assignments before you socialize with friends so you can enjoy yourself without stressing out about a deadline. This will show you can act with prudence and good judgement."

Start a conversation around energy saving in the classroom by talking to other students, teachers, and administrators about energy saving methods. Start an energy saving committee with other students where you actively pursue ways to reduce waste on campus. Because energy saving on a campus wide or school wide level can be overwhelming, you may want to focus on small adjustments to daily tasks first and then tackle larger energy issues in the future. For example, you may suggest that all computer labs set the computers to energy saving mode and unplug all computers once the school is closed for the day. You may also encourage recycling bins next to every garbage can on campus and the use of compostable items on field trips or for large events."

Actively listen to friends who are fighting and try to help them reach a compromise or talk through their issues. Suggest an intervention with other friends if one friend is having difficulties at home or at school and needs extra support. You should also act prudently when you are trying to settle a dispute between you and a friend or a peer at school. Rather than try to place blame or ignore the opinions of others, listen to the person’s thoughts in a respectful way and try to have a respectful conversation about the issue."
