      "content": "Understand the Cloning and Reverse Cloning glitches. To do the Cloning Glitch, start by Flying to the Battle Frontier, and go to the Battle Tower PC. Deposit all but 1 Pokémon from your party in the PC (make sure all Pokémon you want to clone are in the PC). Save the game. Withdraw up to 5 Pokémon you want to clone and talk to the rightmost Lady (who manages the LINK Multi Battle Challenge). Enter the challenge, and when it says \"Would you like to save the game? Yes/No\", turn off the power. When you turn the game back on, the Pokémon you wanted to clone will be in both the PC and your party. A video guide for the cloning glitch can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRq7rJ7E7hU To do the Reverse Cloning Glitch, start by having the Pokémon(s) you want to delete in your party (up to 4) while in the Battle Tower. Make sure you also have 2 other Pokémon in your party that are Battle Tower legal. Save the game. Deposit the Pokémon you want to delete in your PC, and go to the same lady. Enter the challenge. When it says \"Would you like to save the game? Yes/No\", turn off the power. Now the Pokémon should be gone from both your party and PC. It might seem unnecessary to master the Reverse Cloning glitch when you can transfer Pokémon instead, but later we will have bad eggs that won't be able to be transferred. So we will have to use the Reverse Cloning Glitch to delete them. A video guide for the reverse cloning glitch can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BapXdh-lYMQ"
