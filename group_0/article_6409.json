Halal is similar to kosher in some ways, as they both require a specific way to kill the animal. [8] X Research source Also, both forbid the eating of pork and (in some cases) shellfish. Though there are differences, looking for the kosher symbol on dairy and non-meat foods in non-Muslim countries is acceptable because it usually means the food doesn't contain a meat product, such as gelatin."

During the standing period, you will read parts of the Qur'an. For this time of year, the Qur'an is divided into thirty parts. Therefore, you're essentially reading 1/30 of the Qur'an each night. You can do these prayers at home, but you can also visit the mosque for prayers."
