      "content": "Install a VPN from the App Store. The easiest way to change your IP address on a Mac is to use a VPN (virtual private network). The VPN will mask your computer’s public IP address by routing your internet traffic through a secure server. To get started, install a VPN on your Mac from the App Store or the VPN provider’s website. Some of the most popular VPNs for Mac include Surfshark, ExpressVPN, and NordVPN. Most of these services are available for a low monthly subscription fee. There are also free VPNs available, but they may not be as fast or secure."

You can check your public IP address before and after activating the VPN to make sure it’s working right."

You’ll see a list of options to choose from, including “Auto proxy discovery” (which will allow your Mac to automatically search for available proxy servers), “Automatic proxy configuration” (which you can use if you have access to a proxy auto-configuration file, or PAC), and various types of proxy protocols (including HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS). [1] X Research source In pre-Ventura versions of macOS, you will find these options in a drop-down menu under Select a protocol to configure . Select “SOCKS Proxy” if you are unsure about which protocol to choose. The “SOCKS Proxy” protocol is often used to route network packets between clients and servers through a proxy and is effective at boosting general security and hiding the client address of applications. Web Proxy (HTTP) and Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS) are also commonly used but are less protected than a SOCKS Proxy."

Some lists of proxy servers may show the IP address and port separately, while others will display the IP address followed by a : , then the port number. There’s a list of SOCKS proxies here: https://spys.one/en/socks-proxy-list/ . You can find many lists of public proxy servers with a simple web search. Use terms like “Free proxy server list.”"
