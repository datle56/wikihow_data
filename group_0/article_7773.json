      "content": "Avoid cleaners that contain acid, alkali, or sodium hypochlorite. These can etch, corrode, or discolour the surface. As a result, only mild and gentle cleaning agents should be used. Read the ingredients on your cleaning products to ensure they will not mark the surface."

      "title": "Rub with a damp cotton cloth or soft sponge.",
      "content": "Rub with a damp cotton cloth or soft sponge. Gently rub the cleaning agent onto the surface, using a damp cotton cloth or soft sponge. Using a circular motion and a little elbow grease, you should be able to remove most spills. For matte, sparkle, or dimensional finishes, you may need to use a nylon bristled brush to adequately clean the surface. Do not use an abrasive pad or scouring cloth. These can permanently scratch or dull the surface."

      "title": "Rinse with water.",
      "content": "Rinse with water. Once you have rubbed the cleaning solution over the surface, soak a clean cloth in water. Wring the cloth so that it is slightly damp and then rub the surface to rinse away any remaining soap. [6] X Research source Do not flood the surface. If you pour too much water onto the surface to rinse away the soap, it may seep into the seams of the Formica. This can cause the surface to warp."

      "content": "Use a baking soda and water mixture. Some tough to remove stains will respond well to a baking soda and water mixture. Mix 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of baking soda with one quart (liter) of water. Apply the mixture to the desired area. [8] X Research source Leave the paste on the stain for approximately five minutes. For really tough stains, leave the paste on the stain overnight."

      "content": "Avoid placing hot items directly on the surface. Dishes or pans that have been removed from the oven or stovetop should not be placed directly on a Formica surface. These can leave permanent scorch marks or warp the plastic finish. Similarly, you should not place a curling iron or straightener directly on the surface. [10] X Research source Always use a trivet or insulated hot pad to protect the surface from direct heat."
