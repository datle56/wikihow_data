      "content": "Start with a clean face. It is important to start with a clean slate, so wash your face thoroughly before applying the eyelid tape. This will help to ensure that the tape adheres well and stays put during the day. [1] X Research source Try using eye makeup remover to get all of the eye makeup off of your eyes before you apply the tape. Dry your face thoroughly after washing it, then wait about 5 minutes to apply eyelid tape to ensure there is no remaining moisture on your skin."

      "content": "Peel away the strip and trim as needed. Use a pair of tweezers or your fingernails to peel an eyelid tape strip away from the backing. You will need to peel away the piece of plastic covering the eyelid strip as well. The strips might be just the right size for your eyelids, or you might need to trim them. The strips should be slightly shorter than the width of your eyes. Otherwise, the strips may stick out on the sides of your eyelids. [2] X Research source If necessary, trim the strip to make it a little narrower. We'll cover how to hide the tape later. You can also make your own eyelid tape out of double sided medical tape if you cannot find eyelid tape strips. To do this cut the tape into a slim strip that is about the same width as your eyelid."

      "content": "Identify where you would like your new eyelid fold to be. You can use the eyelid prong to help you identify where to place the strip. You should place the strip right along the new crease that you want to create. Gently press the prong on your eyelid to find the new crease you want to create. [3] X Research source Do not push hard with the prong, and be careful using it around your eyes! Jump to more info on protecting your eyes when using eyelid tape."

      "title": "Close your eye and apply the tape to your crease.",
      "content": "Close your eye and apply the tape to your crease. When you have found the new crease you want to create, place the tape over the area where you want to create the new crease. Then, use the prong to gently push your eyelid in and create this new crease. As you push the eyelid inwards, open your eye and hold for a second. Then, remove the prong while keeping your eye open. [4] X Research source The eyelid tape should hold your new crease in place."

      "title": "Apply eyelid tape adhesive if the tape does not hold.",
      "content": "Apply eyelid tape adhesive if the tape does not hold. If the eyelid tape does not hold, then you can start over with a new piece or add some eyelid tape adhesive to the strip for a stronger hold. Just apply a small amount of eyelid tape adhesive to the strip and wait for it to dry partially and turn transparent before pushing in your eyelid with the prong again. Some eyelid tape strips come with eyelid tape adhesive, or you can also buy it separately."

      "title": "Remove the tape at the end of the day.",
      "content": "Remove the tape at the end of the day. Don’t wear the tape for more than one day. Remove the tape at the end of the day along with the rest of your makeup. Never pull at the tape or rip it off, instead moisten the tape until it slides off easily. Ripping off the tape could damage the lid and cause skin to droop. Use eye makeup remover and water to moisten the tape and remove the residue. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Be cautious with the eyelid prong. The eyelid prong is an essential tool for applying eyelid tape, but it is always important to use caution when putting any objects near your eyes. Make sure that you only use the eyelid prong on your eyelids and press very gently when you do so. If you experience any discomfort while using the prong, then remove it from your eyelid immediately."

      "title": "Stop using the tape if it irritates your eyelids.",
      "content": "Stop using the tape if it irritates your eyelids. Eyelid tape contains adhesive that is formulated for use on your eyes. However, it can still irritate your eyes. If you experience any irritation from the strips, remove them and wash away the adhesive immediately. [6] X Research source When looking for eyelid tape, find a brand that is hypoallergenic to reduce the chances that it will irritate your eyes."

      "title": "Choose a tape that will be less noticeable on your skin.",
      "content": "Choose a tape that will be less noticeable on your skin. Eyelid tape comes in a few different colors. You can get eyelid tape that is clear, skin toned, or even black to make it look like eyeshadow or eyeliner. Choose an eyelid tape that you think will work with your skin and makeup. [7] X Research source Clear eyelid tape may be your best choice if you don’t plan to wear much (if any) makeup while you are wearing the strips. Just keep in mind that any part of the strip that peaks out will be shiny under the light."

      "title": "Wear eyeliner or false lashes.",
      "content": "Wear eyeliner or false lashes. Emphasizing your eyes can also help to hide the tape while you are wearing it. Try going all out with some black liquid liner and false eyelashes to take the attention away from the eyelid tape. [8] X Research source Avoid wearing too much eyeshadow while you are wearing the eyelid tape. It can weaken the adhesive."

      "title": "Be honest if someone notices.",
      "content": "Be honest if someone notices. If someone notices that you are wearing eyelid tape, then it’s best to just be honest about why you are wearing it. Don’t be ashamed to tell them that you are wearing eyelid tape to make your eyes appear rounder or to create a new crease in your eyelid. People do all sorts of things for beauty and wearing eyelid tape is not a very drastic measure in comparison. [9] X Research source For example, wearing a small piece of tape on your eyelids is nothing compared to going from brown hair to blonde hair. Wearing eyelid tape is just another way to accentuate your eyes, like wearing eyeliner or mascara."
