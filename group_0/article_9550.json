      "content": "Practice deep breathing. Stress forces you to breathe faster and shallower than normal. When you practice deep breathing techniques, you will be able to lower your stress and cortisol levels. Abdominal breathing exercises for twenty to thirty minutes every day will significantly reduce anxiety and stress levels. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Deep breathing increases oxygen flow to the brain, which stimulates a state of calmness. Mastering your breathing techniques will connect your body and mind while stopping the stress response caused by the release of cortisol. Combine deep breathing and visualization to stop the devastating effects of cortisol. Imagine holes in your feet where hot air can enter your body. Take a deep breath and visualize hot air flowing in from the holes and then throughout your body. Relax your muscles as you exhale, pushing the hot air back down your body and out the holes. This exercise takes six seconds to complete and is known as the “quieting response.” Harmonize the body, mind, and emotions through specific natural rhythms of breathing. Rhythmic breathing techniques help eliminate stress, fatigue, and anger. Try lying on your back and then place one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach. As you relax your entire body with your eyes closed, breathe in slowly through your nose. The hand on your stomach should rise (not the one on your chest). Hold your deep breath for three seconds and then release it. Do this exercise until you feel completely relaxed."

      "content": "Relax for twelve minutes in the morning. Taking a shower, fixing breakfast and lunch, getting the kids ready for school, putting your work clothes on, and dealing with rush hour traffic are just some of the responsibilities that might be part of your morning. Relax twelve minutes after you wake up before you begin the range of activities that get you ready for the day. Studies have shown that cortisol, “the stress hormone,” can be lowered by taking approximately twelve minutes in the morning to relax. Cortisol is often released early in the morning and is responsible for maintaining homeostasis. Instead of jumping right into the workday by checking email messages or turning the computer, prepare a cup of tea and sit in the sunlight outside until you clear your mind."

      "content": "Perform mindful mediation. Mediation has long been known for its ability to help reduce stress and quiet the mind, but now mediation has been discovered to have a biochemical benefit: it can change brain chemistry to reduce cortisol levels, increase serotonin, and release endorphins. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Mediation produces alpha (focused alertness) and theta (relaxed) brain waves. All forms of mediation activate a relaxation response, which puts your body at ease and reduces the impact of cortisol on your body. New research makes clear connections between mindful mediation and a lowering of stress, anxiety, and fatigue."

      "content": "Take a yoga class. Yoga helps clear your mind and reduce your stress levels. Research shows that practicing yoga, even for the first time, will normalize cortisol levels, bringing balance to the body. Yoga reduces muscle tension and thereby neutralizing the stress response. The exercises performed during yoga opens your mind to experiencing the thoughts, feelings, and emotions of your true nature. [3] X Research source Relax your facial muscles and breathe deeply and slowly through your nose to reduce stress and anxiety. Be aware of your surroundings while keeping your eyes shut and remaining in the moment. The combination of exercise and mediation produce healing hormones that have proven to effectively reduce cortisone levels and improve the ability to heal. Or, you can get a massage instead. A nurturing massage is the ultimate muscle relaxation response activator that aids in other self-healing processes. Yoga classes can be purchased on dvd or on the internet if you don’t have time to attend a session at a local studio."

Nothing brings peace to the mind like walking through the forest with birds chirping in the background, leaves falling to the ground, and the rustle of squirrels and chipmunks running up trees. Nature brings stillness and immediate silence from the hubbub of modern society.

Don’ let modern technology disrupt the peace and quiet. Or, if you live in the city, snuggle with a pet. Playing with pets fills us with oxytocin, endorphins, and many other healing hormones.

Listening and playing music increases the body’s production of the antibody immunoglobulin A – the cells that attack viruses and help to boost the effectiveness of the immune system, as well as lowering cortisol.

Music can help reduce depression, anxiety, improves your autoimmune system, relieves physical pain while lowering your heart rate, decreasing your blood pressure, and slows down your breathing.

Studies show that during the “recovery period” after gardening significant decreases in cortisol were detected, reducing acute stress. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Reduction in stress, the release of aggression, and the reduction of weight were all results from the physical exertion of gardening. Known as “horticultural therapy,” gardening’s physical activity, awareness of natural surroundings, and cognitive stimulation and the satisfaction of a job well done has had an important impact on both physical and mental health because of its ability to reduce cortisol."

Aerobic exercise produces endorphins while weight training increases the human growth hormone, both block and control cortisone levels. Avoid over exercising by keeping your workout between thirty and forty-five minutes in order to maximize cortisol control. [7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Take care of your post-workout as well by preparing a carbohydrate-protein shake to help replenish your glucose and nitrate levels, which will help you recover your normal cortisol levels much faster. Lifting weights will build muscle mass and increase the release of serotonin and dopamine. These chemicals reduce anxiety and depression. Take DHEA supplements to accelerate the building of muscle mass to increase the feeling of strength and energy and the motivation to continue. Aerobic exercise also reduces stress, high blood pressure, and the regulation of blood sugar levels while maintaining a healthy weight."

Eliminating coffee (caffeine) from your diet is the fastest way to decrease your catabolic metabolism and increase your anabolic metabolism. Too much caffeine, more than 500 mg of caffeine a day, will cause headaches, restlessness, or anxiety. This, in turn, affects your sleeping patterns and will increase your cortisol levels."

      "content": "Consume vitamin C. Vitamin C is a antioxidant that strengthens cell membranes, supports immune-cell function, and performs collagen synthesis. Combined, vitamin C’s multifaceted approach to protecting cells is how it counteracts stress. Sources of vitamin C can be found in all citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, and grapefruit, as well as in tomatoes, broccoli, and peppers. A does of 1,000mg/day of vitamin C supplements greatly improves the capacity of the adrenals to normalize cortisol release. Other “stress-formula” multivitamins that contain vitamins B-1, B-5, and B-6 were able to bring cortisol ranges back to their normal levels. Minerals such as magnesium greatly reduce cortisol levels following extensive exercise while zinc shows a dramatic fall in plasma cortisol levels, also after exercising. In addition to reducing stress and controlling cortisol, these supplements also boost the immune system."

Hydrocortisone, prednisone or cortisone acetate may be taken orally to replace cortisol. Take corticosteroid injections if you are ill or in case of emergency. If you are vomiting and cannot keep your medication down or if you experience an emergency like an adrenal crisis, you can inject yourself with corticosteroids. Keep extra medication with you. Forgetting your medication can have serious consequences. Keep an extra supply at work; in your purse, briefcase, or backpack; and in a travel bag or suitcase. Consider wearing a medical alert bracelet and carrying a medical alert card in your wallet. A severe drop in cortisol may cause you to faint or become unconscious; a medical alert bracelet can be extremely helpful to emergency workers. They will know precisely what kind of help you need."
