      "title": "Attack their throat with strikes and chokes.",
      "content": "Attack their throat with strikes and chokes. The throat is a weak point in a person's body. When defending yourself, attack their throat by punching or hitting it. If you're able to get your arm completely around their neck, you can apply pressure to their carotid artery to induce unconsciousness. This artery can be found on both sides of the neck and only requires 11 pounds of pressure to close. Pinching off the carotid artery stops oxygenated blood from going to the brain and could cause brain damage if held for too long. You can use your hands, elbows, feet, or forearms to attack the strong persons's throat. If you are behind them, using a rear naked choke can cause unconsciousness quickly. Read Do-a-Sleeper-Choke-Hold to learn how to do this."

      "content": "Kick them in the groin. While this tends to be more effective when dealing with a male opponent, kicking anyone regardless of sex in the groin will temporarily incapacitate them, making it a great strategy when defending yourself. Make sure you are close enough to them to make clean contact, and don't hesitate. Doing a soccer kick in-between their legs is the best way to strike the groin. Mix in attacks to the groin with strikes to other parts of their body so it catches them off guard."

      "content": "Gouge or poke their eyes. Eye gouges and pokes can hinder the ability for a person to see, and more severe eye gouges can cause permanent blindness or death. If you are struggling against an attacker, press your thumbs hard against the surface of their eyeballs. [1] X Research source Only perform this attack if you are in a dire situation. You could potentially kill someone by performing an eye gouge."

      "content": "Attack their joints to remove their mobility. Places like the elbow, ankles, and knees are vulnerable parts of the body. [2] X Research source Each joint has a range of mobility, and will break or sprain if pulled or pushed in the opposite direction. Attack the soft part behind their kneecap, or do a push kick with the bottom of your foot onto their kneecap to incapacitate them."

      "title": "Use a weapon to neutralize your opponent.",
      "content": "Use a weapon to neutralize your opponent. Try to find things around you that you could swing at your attacker, like a broom, a brick, or a bottle. Any object in your vicinity that's hard enough to break skin can be used. Using a weapon can carry heavier jail times if you are convicted of assault. Be careful when reaching for a weapon. It may escalate the situation and your opponent may also grab a weapon in retaliation, or take your weapon away from you."

      "content": "Use the tactics of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Brazilian jiu-jitsu is a martial art that was developed by the Gracie family in Brazil. It incorporates aspects of Japanese Jiu Jitsu and Judo. It is a grappling martial art that concentrates on choke holds and joint locks. It was first developed as a method for smaller fighters to defeat larger opponents, and can help you in beating someone that's stronger than you. Brazilian jiu-jitsu also reduces stress. In addition to being a self-defense tactic, Brazilian jiu-jitsu increases your mobility, agility, and flexibility. [3] X Research source Helio Gracie developed Brazilian jiu-jitsu as a way to defeat his older, larger brothers on the mat."

      "content": "Use their momentum and size against them. The art of Judo uses your opponents momentum and size against them in the form of throws. Even though your opponent may be bigger, it doesn't mean they are immune to being thrown. Think of ways to use their size to your advantage. For example, instead of meeting them face on, try tripping their feet while they charge forward at you. Judo uses balance and leverage rather than brute strength to throw the opponent on the ground. [4] X Research source You can incapacitate a strong person with a single throw. In competition this is known as an ippon. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear out their cardio by staying elusive. The endurance and mobility of a strong person may be adversely affected by their muscle mass. [6] X Research source Because of this, you can stay mobile and elusive as they get tired. Once they are, you can take advantage of them. Feinting or faking punches may cause your opponent to react. Keep moving around them laterally and try to stay out of the way of their strikes. Make them swing and miss as much as possible. Do not get into a brawl with someone stronger than you. A single punch can knock you unconscious, so make sure to keep peppering shots with jabs and never try to stand punch for punch with them."

      "content": "Go to the gym and get in good physical shape. While superior technique may give you the ability to beat a larger opponent, having good physical fitness is also critical. Make sure to weight train to build up your muscle. Work on your cardio and endurance by doing drills, running, swimming, or biking. If you are in a prolonged fight, it's important that you have the endurance to overcome your opponent. Building muscle and building strength are two different things. Concentrate on building strength by doing a greater amount of reps with smaller weight. 10-15 reps per set is a good starting point for those trying to build strength.

      "content": "Do calisthenic exercise on your spare time. Calisthenic exercise is exercise that's performed without any gym equipment and uses your own body-weight as resistance. This is a great alternative for those who can't get to the gym, or want to get stronger while they are at home. Try to drill and chain your calisthenic exercise together in order to simultaneously work out your cardio and endurance. Calisthenic exercise increases your lean muscle and improves mobility, flexibility and strength.

Staying physically active or joining a sports team will ensure that you maintain good health, thereby equipping you with the tools to defeat a strong man. Doing this in conjunction with working out will allow you to be physically fit enough to beat a strong person. Doing a physical activity or participating on a sports team can boast a variety of other health benefits like an improved cardiovascular system and can prevent chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. Being on a team may motivate you further than if you were working out alone. Some physical activities include rock climbing, dance, or hiking. You can join a community baseball or flag football team to stay active."

      "content": "Train in a striking martial arts discipline. Striking is the art of punching and kicking your opponent. In order to compete with the strong person face to face, you'll need to develop striking skills. Find a local gym and talk to the trainer about taking classes. The most popular and effective striking arts include American boxing, Muay Thai Kickboxing, and Karate. When fighting a strong person, use your speed to your advantage. Try to dodge their punches without getting hit. Don't think you can become efficient at striking or at any martial art, without going to an official gym. Muay Thai for example, has been developed for several hundred years and requires an immense amount of skill."

      "content": "Learn how to grapple if the fight goes to the ground. Many fights end up on the ground, or in a wrestling or grappling situation. This can pose an obvious disadvantage if you are competing against someone that's strong. If you're able to learn how to grapple however, you will have the advantage against someone who is untrained in any grappling arts. Popular grappling arts include wrestling, Greco Roman wrestling, Judo, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Going to the ground may even be a better situation if you can get top control or your opponent is efficient at striking. ”Rolling” or grappling practice is the best way for you to get experience. Take every opportunity to grapple with someone bigger and better than you when you attend your class. Once you have trained and refined your technique, sparring will give you a real experience if you get into a fight."

      "content": "Watch instructional videos on how to defend yourself. While they could never substitute real training and sparring, instructional videos can give you a glimpse into different ways you can protect yourself from a strong person. If you can't afford a class, or there isn't one in your area, this could be an alternative. Do not rely on instructional videos before trying to beat a strong person. Make sure to check the ratings on the instructional video before you purchase it, so you know that others have found it effective."
