      "title": "Take apart any large tools to give them a more thorough cleaning.",
      "content": "Take apart any large tools to give them a more thorough cleaning. Examine your tool and see if it can be easily soaked and washed in its current state. If it’s a larger item, like a table saw, remove any bolts, screws, nails, or other items securing the metal components to the rest of the tool. Set these items aside, so you can reassemble your tool later on. [1] X Research source If you aren’t sure how to disassemble your tool, contact an experienced friend or hardware store associate for assistance."

      "content": "Fill a large bucket with water and a spoonful of dish soap. Pour warm water into a large bucket, basin, or other sturdy container. Next, stir in 1 US tbsp (15 mL) or so of dish soap into the water, until the mixture looks sudsy. [2] X Research source Dish soap is a useful ingredient for cleaning tools, since you’re trying to remove dirt and grease from the metal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the metal portions of your tools in the sudsy water.",
      "content": "Place the metal portions of your tools in the sudsy water. If your tools are made entirely of metal, arrange them in the soapy water so they can soak. If you’re cleaning a tool with wooden components, like a handsaw, rest the metal blade in the water instead of the handle. In this case, you don’t need to wait for the tools to soak; instead, you can start cleaning them right away! [3] X Research source You don’t want to damage any old or antique wood handles by soaking them in water."

      "title": "Work off stubborn dirt stains with an abrasive pad.",
      "content": "Work off stubborn dirt stains with an abrasive pad. While the tools are still soaking wet, use an abrasive pad to remove any stuck-on patches of grime. Apply as much pressure as you need, moving the pad in small, forceful movements until the dirt is completely gone. Once you’ve cleaned off 1 side of the tool, flip it over so that you clean off the opposite side. [4] X Research source Only focus on the metal portions of your tools with this mixture. If your tools are antiques, consider using a sponge instead of an abrasive pad."

    {
      "title": "Rinse and dry off the tools to get rid of any soap.",
      "content": "Rinse and dry off the tools to get rid of any soap. Dump out the soapy water from your bucket, then refill the container with clear, clean water. Dip and rinse your tools in the clean water to get rid of any leftover soap or suds. Once they’re fully cleaned off, use a clean washcloth or rag to wipe away any excess moisture. [5] X Research source It’s much more efficient to wipe your tools off than to let them air-dry."

      "title": "Massage linseed oil over your tools to prevent rust.",
      "content": "Massage linseed oil over your tools to prevent rust. Pour a grape-sized amount of linseed oil onto a clean rag, then rub the substance into the metal surfaces and wooden handles of your tools. Wait 5 minutes for the oil to soak into the metal, then wipe away any leftover product. [6] X Research source Adding a layer of oil helps protect your tools from future rusting. Camellia oil can also work for this."

      "content": "Reassemble and store your tools in a cool, dry place. If you had to take apart your tool during the cleaning process, use the displaced screws and bolts to put it back together. Once your tools are dry and fully assembled, find a toolbox or other dry place where you can keep your items for a long-term basis. Check that the area isn’t moist, and that your tools can receive plenty of dry, open air in the process."

      "content": "Pour 1 gallon (3.8 L) of white vinegar into a large bucket. Find a large plastic container that’s industrial-grade and won’t wear down after holding acidic substances. Next, fill this bucket with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of white vinegar, so you can fully submerge and soak your tools. Additionally, set a large piece of wood aside that can be used to cover the bucket. [7] X Research source If you’re working with larger tools, consider filling a basin or tub with vinegar instead. In this case, you may need more than 1 gallon (3.8 L). If you don’t want to use vinegar, you can also fill the bucket with warm water and dish soap. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak your rusty tools in the vinegar for 4 hours. Arrange your rusted tools in the vinegar, checking that they’re completely submerged as you go. Next, set a timer for 4 hours, so your tools have enough time to soak. To prevent any of the vinegar from evaporating, cover the bucket or basin with a large sheet of wood. [9] X Research source If your tools are severely rusted, you might want to let them soak for 6-8 hours initially."

      "content": "Wipe away the rust with an abrasive pad. Remove the tools from the bucket after several hours of soaking, then arrange them on a flat, clean surface. Take an abrasive, coarse-grit pad and scrub at any rusty areas of the tool. As you remove the rust, switch a softer, fine-grit pad to buff the metal surface of your tools. [10] X Research source Steel wool can also be a useful tool to remove rust. [11] X Research source You can purchase abrasive pads or sandpaper at your local hardware store."

      "content": "Let the tools soak overnight to soften any remaining rust. If your scrubbing doesn’t get rid of all the rust, try submerging your tools in white vinegar for a longer period of time. Leave the tools to soak overnight to soften the rust a bit more. Before you leave the area, place the wooden sheet over the bucket again so the vinegar stays covered. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrub the rust again with an abrasive pad. The next day, remove your tools from the vinegar mixture once more and place them on a flat, clean surface. Use the same coarse-grit pad to work away any layers of rust. [13] X Research source As you remove the rust, buff the surface of the tool with a softer pad, so the metal can look smooth and shiny. [14] X Research source Depending on the severity of the rust, it might take a lot of elbow grease to get your tools clean again. Don’t give up!"

      "content": "Apply a layer of kerosene to the tool if the rust remains. Soak a rag with kerosene, then rub it over the metal surface of the tool. Rub both sides of the tool, so the metal is fully lubricated. Once you’re finished using the kerosene rag, be sure to dispose of it safely . [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Rub away any rust with a wire-bristled wheel. Attach a wire-bristled brush or wheel to the drill bit, then power on your drill. Move the tool along the length of the metal surface to polish and buff the tool. Only use the brush on areas that you’ve conditioned with kerosene, or else you may not be able to polish the metal properly. [17] X Research source This process helps you to polish and buff the surface of your tools more effectively than an abrasive pad."

      "content": "Put on protective glasses and gloves before working with the acid. Find a well-ventilated area where you can soak and clean your old tools without inhaling any acidic fumes. To protect your eyes, slip on a pair of safety goggles or glasses. Additionally, wear a pair of rubber gloves to prevent your hands from coming into contact with any acid. [19] X Research source Try working in an outdoor area for this process. If you don’t have enough room outside, set up a box fan in your workspace to keep the air moving. If your tools are severely rusted, you might want to use oxalic acid instead of white vinegar."

If your tools are made entirely of metal, you can place the entire item in the bucket. If the items have wooden handles, only place the metal surface into the bucket. [21] X Research source While oxalic acid isn’t as potent as other acids, it’s still a pretty strong substance. To prevent your wooden handles from getting degraded, try to keep them out of the solution altogether."
