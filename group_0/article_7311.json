      "content": "Chill the champagne in a salted ice-water bucket. Fill a small wine bucket with 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of ice and 2 cups (546 g) of salt. Then, place the champagne in the bucket and pour in enough water to cover most of the bottle. In about 10 minutes, your champagne will be chilled and ready to serve! Stir the salted ice-water consistently to speed the cooling time down to 5 minutes. The salt causes the ice to melt rapidly, creating cold water that chills your champagne quickly."

      "content": "Serve the champagne with a couple of frozen grapes in each glass. Pour the champagne into a glass and add a couple of frozen grapes in lieu of ice cubes. The frozen grapes will bring down the champagne’s temperature without watering it down in the process. You can also chill your wine quickly with metal wine stones , which you stick in the freezer and place in your glass of champagne (like ice cubes)."

Then, slip the sleeve over and around the body of your champagne bottle. With any luck, your bubbly will be chilled in a matter of minutes. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Freeze the champagne for 15 minutes if you’re in a pinch. Does champagne freeze? Yes—that’s why most wine enthusiasts don’t recommend sticking it in the freezer, since it starts to freeze between −5 and −9 °C (23 and 16 °F). Still, sticking your champagne in the freezer for a few minutes at a time (not a few hours!) can be an effective way to chill it if you’re in a pinch. [2] X Research source Don’t stick vintage champagnes in the freezer—they’re typically served at a warmer temperature than non-vintage champagne (around 45 to 50 °F (7 to 10 °C)). [3] X Research source It’s also not a good idea to stick pricier champagne in the freezer, since it’s a more expensive loss if the bubbly gets frozen. The more alcoholic your champagne is, the longer it can last in the freezer. That’s why drinks with a super high alcohol volume (like vodka) stay completely unfrozen after a night in your freezer."

[4] X Research source Submerge the champagne bottle into the ice bath so just the neck of the bottle sticks out. [5] X Research source Believe it or not, the water in the ice bath helps the champagne bottle cool down more quickly than a regular bucket of ice would."

      "content": "Leave the champagne bottle in the bucket for about 15 minutes. Simply let the champagne bottle sit in the bucket. Then, set a timer on your phone or just keep an eye on the clock as you wait. The champagne is ready to serve once it’s between 45 and 65 °F (7 and 18 °C)."

Make sure to aim the tip of the bottle away from any expensive objects before popping the cork. To serve, tilt the bottle at a 45-degree angle, hold the champagne flute steady with your other hand, and fill it three-quarters of the way full with champagne.

      "content": "Place the champagne bottle in the fridge. Store the bottle upright in your refrigerator rather than placing it horizontally. [8] X Research source Some wine enthusiasts believe that champagne tends to age faster when set on its side since the champagne is directly touching the cork. [9] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Most refrigerators are set 40 °F (4 °C), which falls slightly below champagne’s ideal temperature range of 45 to 55 °F (7 to 13 °C). That’s okay, though—it’s not a big deal if your champagne is stored at a slightly cooler temperature."

Wine fridges are set between 45 and 65 °F (7 and 18 °C), which is the ideal temperature range for keeping champagne cool but not too cold. For a perfectly chilled glass of bubbly, set your wine fridge to exactly 55 °F (13 °C)."
