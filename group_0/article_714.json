      "content": "Buy at least 6 yards (5.5 m) of tulle. You will need a lot of tulle to create an overlay or underskirt for your dress whether the dress is long or short. Purchase 6 yards (5.5 m) of tulle fabric in the color of your choice. [1] X Research source Try getting some black tulle to layer over a black dress. Or, use a contrasting color with your dress, such as hot pink tulle with a black dress or green tulle with a purple dress. Some types of tulle fabric have glitter or sequins on them. You can also find tulle in different textures, such as a heavy flat tulle, a lightweight airy tulle, or tulle that is crinkled. Opt for a heavier tulle to give your dress some volume and structure. Opt for a lightweight tulle for an airy overlay."

      "content": "Buy 2.5 yards (2.3 m) of 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide ribbon. You will be sewing a piece of ribbon onto the pleated edge of the tulle. The ribbon will secure the skirt around your waist so you will need enough ribbon to fit all the way around your waist and tie the ribbon in a bow. Look for a piece of ribbon that matches your tulle color or that will at least blend in well. [2] X Research source For example, if your tulle is black, get black ribbon. If your tulle is baby blue, then get ribbon that is baby blue or white."

      "content": "Get enough elastic to fit around your waist. If you prefer to secure the skirt with elastic, then purchase enough elastic to fit around your waist. You can use any color elastic for an underskirt. If you want to make an overlay with an elastic band, then choose an elastic that matches the color of the tulle, or that at least blends in. For example, if the tulle is red and you want to wear it over a black dress, get red elastic if possible. But if you cannot find red elastic, get black elastic so it will blend in with your dress."

      "content": "Hold the tulle at your waist and mark the tulle with the length you want. Hold the tulle up to your body and bring the longest edge of the tulle so that it is in line with your waist. Then, make a mark where the tulle meets the part of your body that you want it to, such as your knees, mid-calves, or feet. This is where you will need to cut the tulle. [3] X Research source It may be difficult to mark the fabric while you are holding it, so you might want to have a friend mark the fabric for you. Before you mark the tulle, add 5 ⁄ 8 in (1.6 cm) for the waist seam. You might also want to add at least 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) for the hem in case you want to even the hem later.

Then, cut a straight line across the marked area of the tulle. [5] X Research source Use a sharp pair of scissors or a sharp rotary cutter on a cutting mat to cut the fabric. For a fuller skirt, cut more widths of tulle and sew them together. [6] X Expert Source Margo West Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 7 December 2020."

The pleated tulle should be fitted around your waist with only 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 3 inches (7.6 cm) of slack. This will allow you to sew it onto a piece of ribbon or elastic. If the tulle is too tight, then you will need to release a couple of pleats or go back through and re-pleat the whole piece of fabric with narrower pleats."

[10] X Expert Source Margo West Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 7 December 2020. Remove the pins as you sew. If you are having trouble sewing the seam, then try placing a piece of folded tissue paper under the edge of the tulle as you sew. This will help you to create the seam and you can rip the tissue paper off when you are finished. [11] X Research source You may want to place a piece of tape over the feed dogs at the bottom of your needle to avoid a snag. This will prevent the tulle from getting caught in the gears as you sew."
