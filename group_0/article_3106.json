      "content": "Experiment with your stride. Your stride is the motion your legs take as they extend and strike the ground, carrying you along. Your natural running stride should feel easy, rather than awkward. Everyone’s stride is a little different, although the general form is similar for most people. Once you find your stride, you’ll minimize your risk of injury and gain speed. [1] X Research source There are several variables you can experiment with. Focus on how high your knees are in relation to your hips. Focus on how your feet strike the ground and how you push off to create your strides. Some people prefer to strike the ground heel-to-toe, while others prefer to do it toe-to-heel. Find what is comfortable and work with what feels best. Generally, your ideal stride is the farthest distance in between steps that you can make without stretching or straining yourself consistently on a walk or run, but it really depends on your body structure and if you want to run for distance or speed. For a speed workout or race, your stride length should be fairly short, as you have more power with shorter strides. This takes more energy though, and so for a long distance run your stride length would increase. Your body tends to know its default stride length and so from there it's up to you to find out how much you should shorten. When doing faster, short distance runs one would probably focus more on arm movement. Especially in sprints, where the arm movement essentially determines the speed."

      "title": "Optimize your cadence.",
      "content": "Optimize your cadence. Another factor worth considering is cadence, or steps per minute. The average cadence for a medium to long distance runner is around 180 steps/minute. Many training runners load up music playing devices with music that plays at 180 bpm to help align their steps with beats (see How to Create an Exercise Music Playlist). There are some sites that let you sort music by BPM. While 180 steps/minute is an average to aim for, it's worth noting that not all experts and studies agree about how significant cadence is to speed or distance. It likely won't hurt to keep your steps per minute in mind when training, but don't be too concerned if your cadence doesn't match the average, as long as other measurements of progress are positive.

      "title": "Adjust your stride to the terrain.",
      "content": "Adjust your stride to the terrain. If you are running on rough trails, you have to adjust your stride to the terrain. Therefore, stride length will vary rather than being a static length. [3] X Research source If on a flat surface that has no obstacles, your stride should be based on what feels comfortable. In other words, a stride that feels like you are really stretching to maximize its length could become very tiring after a certain distance. You could also either experience sore muscles and tendons from over extending yourself. The effort required to maximize your stride length can also be stressful on your feet because you might be springing off each foot and could result in soreness or worse, injury. If running downhill, you might want to increase your stride length to take advantage of gravity. But again, it needs to be done with caution in order to reduce the stresses resulting from controlling your balance and braking to maintain control. Your stride length going uphill is going to be shorter than running on a flat or downhill surface, but how much shorter will be relative to the steepness of the hill, along with your conditioning, strength, and endurance. Take very short, slow, and deliberate strides to \"power\" up the hill. The pace might barely be above a walking pace but you'll still be using a running motion, not a walking motion. \"Drive\" your strides with your arms. As you continue training up that same hill, you will be able to run faster and your stride length will increase as you get stronger."

However, if you plan to run several times a week, and you want to start adding distance, it’s a good idea to invest in a pair of running shoes that fits you well and supports your feet. [5] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. Your shoes shouldn't be so roomy that they slip around, but you also don’t want them to be uncomfortably tight. Leave about ¼ to ½ inch between your toe and the front end of the shoe. Most running stores hire clerks who are runners themselves, and are trained to help you find the best fit for your foot. Try on a variety of shoes and test jog them around the store until you find a pair that feels comfortable. Different shoes are made for feet with different types of arches. For some people, their ankle bends slightly out (under pronation) or slightly in (over pronation) while running, and there are shoes designed to correct these problems."

Do the following stretches after your cool-down: [7] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Bend at the waist and touch your toes. Hold for 30 seconds, then straighten and do it again. Bend one knee and grab your foot with your hand. Hold it against your bottom for 30 seconds while you balance on the other foot. Switch sides. Push your toe against a chair or curb so that your foot bends back and your toes stretch toward your shins. Repeat with the other foot. Roll your ankle for 30 seconds. Repeat with the other ankle."

      "title": "Pump your arms.",
      "content": "Pump your arms. They need to move in the same plane as the running direction. The elbows need to be moving in the same plane as the knees. The forearms should be parallel to the ground. The hands cannot be clenched. Avoid clenching the hands by making the \"OK\" sign with the thumb and index finger on each hand. The shoulders, arms, elbows, and wrists must be relaxed, not tensed up. The more the arms are tensed the more the torso gets tensed and the running motion becomes less efficient and you get tired sooner. It is OK to occasionally drop the hands toward the ground and loosen up the arms like you are shaking rattles, but that is only occasionally just to facilitate looseness. If your hands look like they are making upper-cut jabs and/or moving side-to-side, energy is being wasted with motions that are askew to the direction your legs are going."

In other words, if someone really wants to be a runner, he or she must carve out at least 3 days a week (4 to 6 would be much better) if one expects to run comfortably for 20 minutes or more for cardiovascular fitness, personal satisfaction, or even competition. Someone with no running or sports background cannot expect to run 10Ks or half or full marathons on just a few week's training unless he or she doesn't care how it feels the next day."

If you tell yourself you’re going to run four days a week, 30 minutes a day, make a commitment to do it no matter what. Rain or shine, good mood or bad one, your mission is to get up and run. Slowly but surely, you’ll become a better runner. It helps to have a set time for running that works with your schedule. Consider doing it before work, so you’ll have it done before your day really gets underway. Or if you want a great way to relax in the evening, schedule in running before dinner. Plan to run under any circumstances. Say it’s spring break, and you've got a week off of work. You might be tempted to leave your running shoes in the closet, but you’ll feel a lot better at the end of the week if you stick to your schedule. Take your running shoes along, even if you’re going away on vacation. You’ll never finish a run and think to yourself, “I wish I hadn't done that.”"

One of the best things about running as a sport is that it’s incredibly versatile. You can run anywhere, with anyone, at any time, and feel a rush of endorphins without ever needing more equipment than your running shoes. Here are some ideas to add some fun to your run: Run in a different place. If you always run on a track, find a trail and run there instead. If you always go to the same park, choose a new neighborhood to run around. Even running the same old route backwards can help your run feel fresh. Listen to music while you run. Make a motivating mix full of songs with fast beats that you’ll be encouraged to keep up with. Do not listen so loudly you are unaware of your surroundings. You should be able to hear cars driving or bike bells. A car horn is too late. Lose yourself in your thoughts. Many runners use the time to let their minds wander to far-off fantasies. Let your mind go to its happy place, whether it’s planning a weekend dinner party or dreaming about your next vacation. Vacation in your mind!"

Sprint up a hill, then jog down. Repeat for a total of four times. As you gain endurance, increase your repeats so you eventually do 16, with breaks in between. Try tempo running. This is when you run at a pace that’s faster than normal, but not quite a sprint. Try pushing yourself to run a mile a minute or two faster than normal. As you gain endurance, increase the mileage. Try track workouts. These involve sprinting short distances with breaks in between. For example, sprint 400 meters (1,312.3 ft) four times, then take a three-minute rest, then repeat."
