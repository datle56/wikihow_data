What is it that all of them have in common? Think of women you know in real life, celebrities or historical figures."

Think about the state of your life now: the things you do, education you're pursuing, jobs you’re in, your relationships with others, your physical health. Consider your personal qualities, too. Make a list of the things you’re most proud of. Try to think about examples that prove that you are this way. Jump ahead for info on accepting yourself . For example, ‘I am a good daughter: I call my parents daily/once a week and speak to them patiently even when I’m pressed for time.’ 'I am diligent: I consistently perform to the best of my ability, I don’t procrastinate and I thoroughly check the standard of my work.' 'I have amazing hair: it’s soft, shiny and long.' Your list of strengths and proofs will be subjective -- they are unique to you."

      "content": "Write an operating definition of perfect. Of your strengths, which do you consider to be perfect? Think of your perfections and those of your role models, and write a few sentences or a list of what you consider will make you a perfect woman. What does that look like? What goals will you achieve that will mean you’re perfect? What behaviors, attitudes and values will you adopt? Avoid the words ‘always,’ ‘never,’ ‘should,’ and ‘must’ (e.g. ‘I must always speak in a polite tone of voice.’) Such words create unrealistic expectations and disappointment, guilt and frustration when they’re not met. Your definition of the perfect woman applies to you: the point of the exercise is not to be exactly like another woman. Rather it is to help you define your ideal version of you."

Check your local area or school for different clubs or societies where you can interact with others who can encourage you and teach you. Perhaps you’ll find you’re really good at cooking or woodwork. If you like, start with things that you have always wanted to know better but never really had an opportunity to follow. Perhaps you’ve always wanted to develop your photography skills or read classic English Literature. Devote part of your day to engaging in these activities. Remember that this is meant to be enjoyable. You will have something to look forward to that is stress-free. Not every new interest will necessarily require you to leave your house and spend money. Look for online documentaries or videos to watch."

      "content": "Display a positive outlook. Actively look for the positive aspects of every situation and person. Remember that ‘positive’ does not necessarily mean ‘good.’ A learning outcome from a negative situation is a ‘positive’ aspect but that does not make your situation a ‘good one’: you are allowed to consider things as being negative and bad. However, people gravitate towards those who display a positive attitude. [3] X Research source Your sunny disposition will encourage others to be cheerful. [4] X Research source Ask yourself, ‘What can I learn from this situation? What can I do differently next time to prevent such an outcome? What have I gained from this?’ Once you form a negative opinion of someone, you start to notice things about her that will confirm your opinion and ignore any evidence to the contrary. If you find yourself thinking mean things about another person, deliberately think of examples that dispel your negative opinion. Or think of reasons that may have made her behave in a way you disliked. Perhaps she was tired or hungry? Maybe she misunderstood the situation? Make a special effort to cheer other women on. It’s very easy to feel competitive around another woman as you seek to be the ‘perfect woman’. [5] X Research source Rise above such pettiness and be supportive of other women as opposed to trying to sabotage them. A simple example, is if a co-worker you dislike asks you if you know the deadline for a certain project, don’t sabotage her by giving her the incorrect date. Or if another woman asks you for the recipe of a dish you brought to the potluck, don’t leave out ingredients from the recipe or give different proportions to the ones you used. Be supportive of other women."

Make a quick assessment of the different consequences of potential actions. You will have to practice by putting yourself in situations where social skills are required. Read up on body language so that you are better able to assess others. Read up on emotions to better understand how they are conveyed. Identify your growth points by analysing your own behavior. Do you have trouble maintaining eye contact? Is your speech too fast or your voice too loud when you’re nervous? Do you stand too closely to others when you’re talking to them? Do you interrupt when others are talking? Do you have difficulty saying no? Ask friends/family you can trust to be honest without hurting your feelings about any of your social skills that you need to work on. Friends can often notice things about your behavior that you can’t. Make sure the person you ask is socially skilled. Pick one or two social skills at a time to focus on. When you’ve made significant progress in them, then advance to other skills. Consider asking a friend to role play with you or practice in front of a mirror."

If you’re feeling irritable, angry or any other negative emotion, try to identify the source of the emotion. Look to your thoughts. What are you thinking about that is making you feel this way? Know that just because you think something, that does not mean that thought it true. Avoid taking any negative feelings out on others. If you feel that you are about to snap, take deep, calming breaths. Inhale slowly through your nose, exhale slowly through your mouth. If you can, distance yourself from the situation: leave the room and find a quiet place. If you can’t leave, try to drink a glass of cool water or to sit down. This will help you calm down.

Go out of your way to show gratitude to someone who has done something good for you. Say thank you, send gifts, or try to return the favour. Set up a schedule to call family and friends who are far away. It may not be possible to do so every day or every week.

Keep any secrets that are entrusted to you; if anyone else brings up the subject, pretend that you don’t know anything about it.

Your heart rate should be up and it shouldn’t be so vigorous that you find it difficult to speak as you exercise. [13] X Research source You don’t need to spend a lot of money to be physically fit. Joining a gym is not the only way to stay healthy; though it’s certainly an option. Consider joining a sports team, or asking a friend or family member to join you for a daily jog. Look up different videos or blogs of fitness experts you can follow. Be sure to check the credentials of any ‘expert’ that you follow. Check for training, certifications and qualifications on their website. You don’t want to follow someone posing as an expert as you might end up injuring yourself.

Break your goals into logical steps by thinking of which goals you will have to achieve first in order to keep going. Apply this principle to all your goals: break them down into more manageable steps. Make sure your goals are specific, measurable, time-based and achievable. This will help you measure your progress and keep you from feeling disappointed if you don’t achieve goals that were unrealistic in the first place. If you are particularly inspired by your role models and want to achieve something similar to them, read their biography. Look at their milestones and how they achieved them. Some of this information may not be readily available and you will have to do your own research. For example, if you are looking to break into the cosmetics industry, you will have to research different methods of doing so. Consider contacting local makeup artists or contacting persons who design makeup for further guidance. Sometimes plans don’t turn out exactly as we want them to because of circumstances beyond our control or because something else inspires you along the way. That’s okay: find another way to achieve your goal. Make allowances in your plan for setbacks.

The amount of money you spend will depend on the scale of your goal. Take a look at your budget and see if there are ways of reducing your costs. Consider purchasing items second hand or renting them instead of purchasing them. For example, if you have a low budget and you’re pursuing an education, considering getting second-hand textbooks. If your goal is a large scale project that is out of your budget such as setting up a bespoke bakery, consider taking a loan or asking family for financial help.
