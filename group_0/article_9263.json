Many video connection ports may be labeled; but if they are not labeled, look at the shape of the cable and plug it into a port that looks the same. The most common source of output on a laptop are VGA ports. These look like ports consisting of three rows of five holes each. If your laptop does not have a VGA port, it should have an HDMI port. If your laptop has neither, you might need to purchase a VGA or HDMI adapter from an electronics retailer.
