As long as you have the Fruit equipped, you'll be teleported to a room with the NPC \"Mysterious Entity.\" Raids are designed so that the host (the person who buys the Raid Chip and starts the Raid) has to be level 1,100. This means other players participating in the Raid can be under level 1,100. However, this isn't recommended because the enemies and boss are balanced for everyone in the Raid being at least level 1,100."
