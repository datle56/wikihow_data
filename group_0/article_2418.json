The wet ingredients include softened unsalted butter, 5 eggs, 1 cup (200 g) of sugar, and vanilla extract. The dry ingredients include ½ tsp (3 g) of salt and 2 cups (400 g) of cake flour. Cake flour has a lower protein content that gives cakes a tender texture and fine crumb. [1] X Research source Believe it or not, sugar is a wet ingredient because it’s always creamed with butter (a wet ingredient). If you don’t have cake flour, use 2 cups (400 g) of all-purpose flour and 2 tbsp (28 g) of cornstarch."

After preheating your oven, use butter or shortening to grease the inside of your pan. Then, sprinkle a light layer of flour over the grease, rotating the pan until it’s evenly coated. Tap out the excess over a trash can. [2] X Research source Greasing and flouring the pan makes it easier to remove your cake later."

For the wet ingredients, gather 3 eggs, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of vanilla extract, 1 cup (100 g) of sugar, and 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of buttermilk. If you don’t have buttermilk, substitute with sour cream for a denser and richer flavor. The wet ingredients in cake recipes generally have moisture.

Make a chocolate frosting to coat your cake in for a rich dessert, or whip up a vanilla buttercream to complement the decadent chocolate cake. To help traditional American buttercream stick to a cake, whip it and make it smooth. Start with room temperature butter. Otherwise, the buttercream may be stiff. It may be hard to put it on the cake. It will fall from one place to another. Put the buttercream in a warm place. Take a big pot with some hot water and set the buttercream on top of it to melt the butter slightly. The consistency of the buttercream should be light and fluffy. If the buttercream is stiff, it will not stick and look chunky. It will not be shiny."
