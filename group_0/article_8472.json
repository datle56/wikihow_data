      "content": "Fill a bowl with 1 c (240 mL) of white vinegar. White vinegar is a natural cleaning agent that is mildly acidic, but not so much that it will hurt your necklace. Pour some into a bowl or a shallow dish that is large enough to hold your necklace. [1] X Research source You can find white vinegar at most home goods or grocery stores. Vinegar won’t harm costume jewelry, but it may hurt any precious metals or stones. Vinegar is great at removing rust, but won't work as well on tarnish."
