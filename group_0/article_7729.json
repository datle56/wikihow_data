If you prefer using a dishwasher anyway, there are ways to improve the results. For more fragile glasses (e.g. wine glasses), choose a delicate cycle. Leave as much room as possible between glasses to prevent clinking or scraping.

[8] X Research source If the cloudy deposits don’t go away after you clean it, then your glass may be etched. If you have soft water, use less dishwasher detergent and don’t let the glasses dry under high heat. [9] X Research source"
