You will need the following: A pencil and paper. Calculations are easier to solve when you write them out. Be sure to show all your steps to get full credit. A periodic table . You will need to be able to find atomic weight of elements using the periodic table. A calculator . Calculators are necessary to simplify calculations of complex numbers."

      "content": "Identify the elements in the compound that you need to convert into moles. The first step in calculating molecular mass is identifying each element that composes the compound. It is easy to distinguish elements because abbreviations contain only one or two letters. [2] X Research source If a compound is abbreviated with two letters, the first will be capitalized while the second will be lowercase. For example, Mg is the abbreviation for magnesium. The compound NaHCO 3 has four elements in it: sodium (Na), hydrogen (H), carbon (C), and oxygen (O)."

      "content": "Determine the number of atoms that each element contributes to the compound. You must know how many atoms of each element are present to calculate the molecular mass. [3] X Research source The number of atoms each element contributes will be written in a subscript next to the element. For example, H 2 O has two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. If a compound has parentheses followed by a subscript, each element within the parentheses gets multiplied by the number in the subscript. For example, (NH 4 ) 2 S has two atoms of N, eight atoms of H, and one atom of S."

Once you locate the element on the table, the atomic weight is usually found underneath the symbol for that element. [4] X Research source The atomic weight, or mass, or an element is given in atomic mass units (amu). For example, the molecular weight of oxygen is 15.99."

      "content": "Calculate molecular mass. The molecular mass of a substance is calculated as the number of atoms of each element multiplied by the atomic weight of that element. [5] X Research source Knowing the molecular mass is necessary to convert grams to moles. [6] X Research source Multiply the number of atoms each element contributes to the compound by the atomic weight of that element. Add the total weight of each element in the compound together. For example, (NH 4 ) 2 S has a molecular weight of (2 x 14.01) + (8 x 1.01) + (1 x 32.07) = 68.17 g/mol. Molecular mass is also referred to as molar mass. [7] X Research source"

[10] X Research source For example, imagine you have 2 g of (NH 4 ) 2 S and you want to convert it to moles. The molecular mass of (NH 4 ) 2 S is 68.17g/mol. Divide 2 by 68.17, and you have 0.0293 moles of (NH 4 ) 2 S."
