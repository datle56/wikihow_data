      "content": "Take apart your brakes after riding your bike so they'll be easier to clean. [2] X Expert Source Jonas Jackel Owner, Huckleberry Bicycles Expert Interview. 18 February 2020. Set aside some time right after your bike ride to give your disc brakes a little TLC. This way, all of the dirt, dust, and salt will be easier to wipe off. If you store your bike outside, you might have to clean your disc brakes more often. Give your bike a quick examination before and after each ride to see if everything looks good. You don’t need to clean your brakes after every ride. Instead, just listen for squeaking—this is a good indication that your disc brakes need to be cleaned. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Slide on a pair of nitrile disposable gloves to protect the brake parts. Your brake pads and disc rotor are pretty sensitive, and you don’t want to transfer any oil from your fingertips to these parts of your bike. Slip on these gloves before you start disassembling your bike, so you don’t contaminate anything by mistake. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Flip your bike so it’s easier to remove the wheels. It can be tricky to take off your wheels while your bike is still upright. Instead, find an open area where you can safely flip over your bike so the handlebars and bike seat are flush with the ground. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the large bolts holding your bike wheels in place.",
      "content": "Remove the large bolts holding your bike wheels in place. Look for a large bolt going through your bike axle, which holds each wheel in place. Rotate this bolt counterclockwise and slide it out of your bike. At this point, you can safely remove and separate the wheel from the rest of the bike. [6] X Research source Take a peek at your bike’s owner manual for more specific instructions. Some bikes might be built a little bit differently."

      "content": "Use a T25 Torx key to unscrew the bolts from your disc rotor. Set your bicycle wheels on a flat, even surface, with the center of the wheel facing up. Grab a T25 Torx key—this is a special kind screwdriver designed for the bolts that attach your disc rotor to the center of your bike. Remove the bolts 1 at a time, and then pull the disc rotor off the wheel. [7] X Research source Disc rotors are large, metal circles attached to the center of your bike wheels. Each wheel has 1 disc rotor attached to it. Most bike wheels have 6 bolts holding the disc rotor in place. Keep them in a safe place for when you’re reassembling the bike. Some disc rotors aren’t connected with bolts. You can remove these with a BB tool—simply align the round portion of the tool around the center of the disc rotor, and rotate it counterclockwise until the disc comes loose. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Unscrew the retaining bolt from your brake pads. Examine the section of your bike that connects to the center of the wheels. You’ll see a large, horizontal bolt going through both brake pads—this is known as a retaining bolt, and it helps hold these pads in place. Grab a pair of needle-nose pliers and pull off the retaining circlet—this is a small cap that goes over 1 end of the bolt. Then, stick an Allen key into the opposite side of the brake pads to unscrew and remove the bolt. [9] X Research source"

Now that you’ve removed the retaining bolt, grab onto the brake pads with 2 fingers. Pinch and pull these pads out of the bike—with the retaining bolt gone, they should come out easily.

Dip a clean, lint-free cloth or paper towel with specialized bike brake cleaning liquid, and rub it around the edges of this hub. A lot of crud and dirt can build up there after your bike rides. [11] X Research source The hub is a circular area, directly in the center of your bike wheel. You can find brake cleaner online, or in some specialty stores."

[13] X Research source Don’t worry, you’re not damaging the disc rotor—you’re actually making it easier for the brake pads to adhere and clamp onto these discs. Once you’re done, the metal surface should feel a little rough. [14] X Research source"
