      "content": "Determine the number of meters in a yard. There are 0.9144 meters in every yard. Simply multiply that number by the number of yards to get the number of meters. The formula to convert yards to meters is: m=yd X 0.9144. [1] X Research source This calculation was determined in 1958 by the United States and Commonwealth countries, such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. [2] X Research source If you are trying to convert, say, 100 yards to meters, you would simply multiple 0.9144 by 100 (answer: 91.44 meters). [3] X Research source The formula to calculate 2 yards would be 2 X .09144 meter = 1.8288 meter, and so on. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use division instead to do the reverse conversion.",
      "content": "Use division instead to do the reverse conversion. To convert meters to yards, use division. The formula is yd = m divided by 0.9144. [5] X Research source For example, The formula to convert 50 meters to yards would be 50m divided by 0.9144 = 54.68066492. A yard was originally thought to be the average length of a person’s stride. It’s a unit of length that equals three feet. You will need to understand what a meter is to determine other units of measurement, such as the newton. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Use an online calculator. Many websites allow you to put in yards to determine meters (or the reverse). You will sometimes see yard abbreviated as “yd” and meter as “m.” [7] X Research source Some people need to convert swim times between yards and meters for swim meets. There are also online calculators designed to help you do this. Some of them even allow you to enter an altitude adjustment. [8] X Research source They are easy to use and can also generally be used to determine the reverse too. You simply input the number of yards, and watch as the conversion is calculated.

      "content": "Use a yard-to-meter conversion chart. If you don’t want to do the multiplication yourself, or use an online calculator, you can easily find yard-to-meter conversion charts online. [10] X Research source These charts generally list the yard in one column, and the corresponding meters in the next column. For example, some yard-to-meter conversion charts present every conversion from 1 to 100 or present them in 5-yard increments."
