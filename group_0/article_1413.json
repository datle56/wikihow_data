Good lighting, such as natural light or bright artificial light, will enable you watch out for streaks and bubbles in your work. [1] X Research source Good ventilation is crucial. Crack a window to let fresh air in. If you're working in a small space, you may want to prop an exhaust fan in the window. Face the fan out to pull vapors from the room and blow them outside. [2] X Research source Never work in a damp area, as this will mess with your finish.

Use medium grit sandpaper to eliminate any major scratches, notches, or blemishes in the wood. [4] X Research source If you're working on a very large project, you may want to use an electric sander or sanding block to get the job done. You can use sanding sponges for corners and complex areas where a power sander cannot reach. [5] X Research source [6] X Expert Source Sarah Fogle DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 10 August 2021.

Vacuum the area around the project, as well. It's important that you rid the area of all dust generated by your sanding. Otherwise, that dust can end up trapped and visible beneath the clear coat.

Purchase this and your foam brush at a hardware or home improvement store. [13] X Research source Foam brushes are recommended because they are inexpensive, and you can toss them out when you’re done. Natural bristle brushes are also a great choice, although they are more expensive and not disposable."
