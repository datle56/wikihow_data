There are options available to you 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.

If you are in the US, please call or text 988 the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, or go to the nearest hospital Emergency Room. If you're in the UK, call Samaritans at 116 123 or PAPYRUS at 0800 068 41 41 (if you are a teen or a young adult). Other centers can be found on the International Association for Suicide Prevention website."

If you are not using a helpline, call the Emergency Services or a person you trust and tell them that you want to kill yourself. Ask them to help you get to a hospital, or go there directly yourself. Even better, get someone to drive you. It is hard to drive safely under these conditions."

      "content": "Talk to someone you trust about your thoughts immediately . Although Step 1 is the right first step in any situation where you are thinking of killing yourself, it may not feel right for everyone. In this case, you should tell someone you trust that you're having suicidal thoughts immediately. If you are alone, call a friend, a family member, a neighbor, a doctor, chat to someone online, or do whatever you can to not be alone during this time. Talk with someone on the phone and have someone come over to stay with you so that you are not alone."

      "title": "Wait for help.",
      "content": "Wait for help. If you have to wait for someone to come over or have to wait at the hospital, sit down and breathe slowly. Control your breathing by timing it, taking maybe twenty breaths a minute. Do anything else you can to distract yourself, knowing that help is on the way. Do not use drugs or alcohol during this time as it can impair your thinking. It can also lead to making your feelings worse, not better. [6] X Research source If you feel like you need to cause yourself some pain, hold an ice cube in your hand for 1 minute without letting go (this is a technique used in child-birthing classes to practice getting through the pain of pregnancy). The discomfort can be grounding without causing any harm. Listen to your favorite band's album. Watch a funny TV show. Even if these do not make you feel better, they may distract you from your thoughts while you wait for help to arrive."

If necessary, have someone reliable scheduled to take you every week to have an extra layer of accountability for going."

      "content": "Talk to a spiritual leader. If you are religious (or even perhaps if you are not) and have access to a spiritual leader, try talking to them. Those called to religious ministry are trained in helping people in crisis, including those in despair and suicidal. They can help you ease the pain by offering a new perspective and giving you some things to think about. Many hospitals in the United States have chaplains. Like chaplains in the armed forces, these individuals are typically people of faith, trained and experienced in working with people of many beliefs, and sometimes none at all. There is no charge for this service and it is worth looking into. A person of faith may not be for everyone especially if you are an atheist or have a philosophical or experiential issue with religion. You may only find a spiritual leader helpful if you are already involved in that particular spiritual or religious community. Although this article points out resources you may find helpful in this critical time, this may or may not be a good resource for you."

There may be support groups, both online and in your community, where you can find comfort by talking to other people who have suicidal thoughts or who have attempted suicide in the past and set up a social network of understanding people to help you through difficult times. If you are in the United States, check out the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention 's site for finding support groups online or in person. You can even find groups for your specific characteristics, such as a group for Teens. Check out the NHS site if you're in the UK, or the website for your country, to find options for yourself. If there are no support groups in your area for suicide or depression, talk to a therapist or local hospital about support groups they might run or how to get group support. You can also visit a website that offers online video counseling."

      "content": "Remove any suicide facilitators. If you have recently had suicidal thoughts, remove anything that could help you end your life, including alcohol, drugs, sharp objects, rope, or anything else you have been thinking of using. If you have a handgun, make sure it is out of your possession as soon as possible. Though this may sound extreme, if you remove the easy means to end your own life, then you are much less likely to follow through. If, for some reason, you can't get rid of potentially harmful objects, freeze them in a container of water. By the time the ice has melted, you may not feel suicidal anymore. However, this method is not completely foolproof, so it is better to give your items to someone else if possible."

Just giving yourself time to slow down and think things over can be a big help."

Sometimes the physical pain can actually be disguised as other things, such as emotional stress. Physical pain is a stress to the body, and sometimes this wears down your mental health. Addressing the root of the chronic pain can help you feel mentally healthier. Stress can cause flares in autoimmune diseases like fibromyalgia, and you might not even realize it is due to physical pain because the emotion from the stress is so unendurable. Migraines are another source of pain so extreme it can cause suicidal ideation. The answer to these medical situations is to visit a pain clinic and get pain medication if necessary maintenance pain medication. People with chronic pain unfortunately sometimes find the issue not managed well by medical doctors, and pain clinics are trained to focus on the pain in a way other medical professional may not. Check into an emergency room if you cannot get any help with it and the pain is driving you to the level of suicide. This is an emergency situation that needs medical intervention—it is not something you need to \"man up to\" or anything of the sort. This is not something you are supposed to endure alone!"

But sometimes realizing you can make it through a short period, day by day, will help you realize you can get through this. While you give yourself more time to figure things out, take other measures to move past the negative feelings you were having about ending your own life, such as reaching out to friends or health care professionals.
