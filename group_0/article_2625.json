This is especially important if you feel that you are not fun-loving because you never do anything that is fun or brings you joy. The activity that makes you happy can differ tremendously depending what type of person you are. Extroverts can find their happiness by seeking crowds and being in the center of attention, while introverts may find their energy in solitude. Whatever the activity, you need to figure it out yourself and then just do it. [4] X Research source If you love the outdoors and enjoy nature, go hiking, skiing, running, swimming, or bicycling. These are easy-to-do activities that require little planning and equipment and you can easily do by yourself. Or try something new and go horseback riding, rock climbing, parasailing, backpacking, etc. You may surprise yourself and find an inner happiness you never knew existed. If you are the type that requires company and/or encouragement to try new things, ask your friend or spouse to come along. Finding a new hobby to do together can be a great way to bring your fun-loving side up too."

Set a regular bedtime and stick to it every night, even during the weekends. If you need to adjust your bedtime, make small daily increments (15 min earlier every night) until you achieve the target bedtime. Also, wake up at the same time every morning. Avoid heavy meals and too much alcohol just before bedtime as these might make sleeping more difficult. If you suffer from insomnia or sleep disturbances, it can lead to fatigue and a lack of motivation. However, fatigue can also be a sign of a more serious health condition.

      "content": "Like stress, sadness or feeling blue can also affect your emotional and physical well-being. It can also dampen your fun-loving side. If you are sad, you may also suffer from low enthusiasm, lethargy, and/or low self-esteem. If you are feeling low in energy, drive, and hope, it is more challenging to be fun-loving. Sometimes beating sadness can be as easy as leaving the house and diverting your sadness to something positive and fun. When you are feeling blue you might keep yourself isolated and avoid spending time with others. If you find yourself spending all your time alone at home, force yourself out of the house. You can go shopping, walking, or catch a funny movie at the theater. Anything that gets you out of the house and spending time with your friends and family will do. The hardest step is to leave the house, but once you do it and are out, you can often find yourself forgetting the sadness and enjoying life. If you cannot beat your sadness, consider seeking medical attention to determine if you may suffer from depression. Your doctor can prescribe antidepressants to treat depression. Seasonal depression is a common condition; an estimated 6.7% of the U.S. population suffered from at least one depressive episode in 2013.

Learning to see the positive side in life can have a transforming effect and allow you to release your fun-loving side. [18] X Research source You may not always be able to control your external environment, but you can control your inner thoughts. Even in tough situations, thinking positively can help you overcome barriers and release your fun-loving side. Seek situations that bring out the best in you and then learn to transfer that feeling to situations that might not bring out the best in you. This way you can learn to think positively even in situations that might normally bring out negative thoughts. Focus on what is good in your life and write it down on a piece of paper. Then carry that paper with you. When you find yourself down or unhappy, read through that list and try to change your negative thoughts to positive thoughts (e.g., the glass is half full, not half empty). You can also break free from negative thoughts by telling yourself “I can” and not allowing disrespectful people or bad situations to bring you down."

Only when you understand who you are and can embrace that person, can you bring your fun-loving side up. To learn to honor yourself, list your biggest achievements on a paper (e.g., graduated from school, had children, bought a house, climbed a mountain, achieved a personal goal, etc).

[21] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Often times we keep ourselves contained in a zone where we are comfortable, but that does not mean that is the place we are happiest. Allow yourself to try new things, take chances, and have fun. However, there are limitations to what you can and what you should do and you should never try or do things that cause harm to you or others. To break out, first understand your comfort zone and how you tend to stay in it naturally. Once you understand your comfort zone, change your normal way of thinking and acting and slowly break out of it. For example, start by making a list of all the things that you do to avoid uncertainty (e.g., are there situations that you avoid, do you check on your kids constantly, do you suffer from lack of trust). [22] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Once you have your list, start by picking the small items that you can do to break out of the cycle (e.g., go to a place you have never visited before, seek situations you normally avoid, allow yourself to be more trusting). Keep a record of all the times you succeeded in your goal and what happened (e.g., what happened when you visited a new place or pursued an unfamiliar situation)."
