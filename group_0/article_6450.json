The snow-white bull was a gift from Poseidon and was meant to be sacrificed by King Minos to the god of the sea. But the king found the bull too beautiful to be slaughtered and so used a different one in its place. To get his revenge, Poseidon made Pasiphae fall in love with the bull, and she gave birth to the Minotaur. [3] X Research source The Minotaur’s birth name was Asterius, named after his grandfather, the King of Crete. The name “Minotaur” is a combination of “Mino,” as in Minos, and “taur” meaning “bull.”"

[4] X Research source Another origin story of the centaurs claims that they were actually the descendents of Apollo, god of the sun. Apollo and the river nymph Stilbe gave birth to Lapithes and Centaurus. Lapithes went on to found the Lapith race, while Centaurus mated with mares to create the centaurs. [5] X Research source"

They were mischievous, loved violence, and were generally not favorably viewed by locals. They tended to give in to their more animalistic side, but still had the capability to converse and think. They also lived off of normal human food and, being followers of the wine god Dionysus, weren’t opposed to a good glass of wine. [7] X Research source The centaur Chiron was the only exception to the brutish image centaurs were given, and he was dubbed “the most righteous of Centaurs” by Homer. He was one of the wisest beings in Greek mythology and the teacher of many famous heroes, including Achilles, Hercules, Perseus, and Theseus."
