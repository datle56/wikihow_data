      "content": "Be kind to yourself. Being socially awkward is not a state of being, it's a temporary phase. You will move through any particular incident and you will experience many more positive experiences in its place. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone has at least one mortifying experience they can recount. It's a sign of self-kindness that you can look back on such occasions with a smile and realize that it didn't break you but is now a rather entertaining dinner table tale."

[2] X Research source Some of the things that can be helpful in overcoming moments of social anxiety include: \"I’m going to be okay.

Relaxing before you go into a social situation can help you open up more, be honest with people, and let your guard down when you're in a social setting.

      "content": "Lighten up. Random unpleasant and downright embarrassing things happen. Lighten up and see the funnier side of awkward moments. Not only will doing so help you to place such occurrences into better perspective but humor will often break tension, allowing people to laugh with you, not at you. One of the best things you can do to avoid being socially awkward is to stop taking yourself so seriously. This will take the pressure off and will help you relax. Often we don't have control over awkward situations, such as the long silent gap in a conversation, the inelegant and noisy passing of wind when we least expect it, and the trip over the edge of the rug as we walk up to accept an award. Choose to laugh it off."

      "content": "Realize that you're not alone. You may think that every person in your orbit is socially smooth, but in reality, most people worry about being socially awkward in public. They worry about whether or not people like them, whether they're making a good impression, or whether people are bored by them. You may think that some people around you just naturally exude confidence and never have to worry about how they come off, but every person is insecure about some aspect of social interaction. We all want to be liked and have friends."

For many people who experience social awkwardness, the feelings stem from anxiety, fear, insecurity, or low self-confidence. Each of these sources can be tackled if you're willing to push your boundaries a little at a time and to find ways to build your confidence. In each case, try to identify the root cause of what's making you feel awkward so that you can address it directly. The sooner you know the real source, the sooner you can get to tackling it. There are many other reasons for feeling self-conscious, such as having had a bad past experience, feeling that you're not understood, feeling pressure to interact in situations (such as work, peers, or parental pressure, etc.), or feeling confused about the motivations and actions of those around you."

Though it may sound easier said than done, one major way to avoid social awkwardness is to stop caring about how others perceive you.

[7] X Research source If you're too busy worrying about what the person you're talking to really thinks of you, then you'll never be able to relax or to enjoy a social interaction. Once you let go of this worry, you'll find it easier to be yourself and to speak calmly and naturally. Remind yourself which opinions matter. Maybe one person didn’t like you, but will you see this person again? As for your friends, real friends will stick with you, even if you mess up here and there."

By being more aware of your own bodily sensations when you're feeling awkward and anxious, you can consciously recognize that your adrenaline is flooding you and causing you to want to run or hide. Be aware if you feel unusually warm, sweaty, jumpy, uneasy, or overly aware of your body. Watch your thoughts and see if they are overly critical of your social performance. Also watch your emotions, whether you feel helpless or ineffective. Get in tune with these feelings so you can learn to identify them."

If you don't feel ready to jump into a conversation with a witty anecdote, there are still other ways to connect with others: become an active listener. This relieves some of the pressure of social interactions, because you don't have to worry about sounding smart or interesting; you just need to listen carefully and ask questions. Remember, people love talking about themselves, especially if the other person appears to be really taking an interest. [11] X Research source When actively listening, show the other person that you are engaged by paraphrasing their message and repeating it back. You can say something like: \"So, it sounds like what you're saying is...\" Ask follow-up questions. You don't want to get inappropriate or too personal, but continue asking the person questions or their opinions. Show the person you are listening by nodding, making good eye contact, an making sounds or saying words that affirm you are listening (like \"Uh-huh\" or \"Sure\")."

By crossing your arms or legs, it appears as if you are disinterested in social interactions. If you avoid eye contact, this also makes you appear disinterested. Be careful not to cross your body, slouch, or keep your head down, and instead engage in eye contact and maintain an open body posture. [12] X Research source"

[13] X Research source Ask people how they are or how their day is going. Search for common ground. Find casual ways to find out if you and the person root for the same sports teams, watch the same shows, or have the same pets. Use your environment to help you. If you run into the person in a coffee shop, ask if she's tried the amazing baked goods. If you're outside and it's a gorgeous day, ask the person if he's going to take advantage of the beautiful weather to do something fun outdoors."

      "content": "Be friendly. Assuming that someone wants to connect with you allows you to be more open and friendly toward other people. While it's true that no matter how friendly you are, some people will respond as if their mouth and mind are perpetually soured, this isn't a reason to scuttle off or blame yourself. After all, you are not responsible for the behavior of other people. They could have a difficult background or they might be having a bad day. Either way, it's not a reflection of how you are as a person. By being friendly you will put others at ease, find ways to break the ice, and give others the freedom to be more open and vulnerable around you."

Yet, telling one at just the right time, with just the right tone can smooth over even the most tense moment. Get a feel for the situation. If things are a little heavy, the perfect joke can lighten the mood. But if people are having a really serious discussion like discussing the deaths of their grandparents, then you should back off with the humor until the tone of the conversation changes a bit."

      "content": "Give meaningful compliments. When it comes to giving compliments, the most important thing is to keep them sincere and drop them at the right moments. If you're not genuine, don't compliment. If you're a beginner in complimenting, watch others for timing of compliments and follow suit. You can compliment a person's jewellery, sweater, or new haircut, and move on to give deeper compliments as you get to know the person better. Complimenting an aspect of a person's personality, such as telling your friend that he has a great sense of humor or that he's good at talking to new people, can make a person feel more special than a compliment about physical appearance. If you're complimenting something physical, make sure it doesn't come off the wrong way. If you're complimenting somebody's appearance, stick to their face or hair and avoid complimenting their body or your comment may come off sounding more forward than you intended."

There are certain comments or actions that tend to come off as socially awkward and are worth avoiding if you want to feel comfortable around other people. Here are some things to watch out for: Avoid saying that you're so awkward. You can guess the outcome. Avoid asking people overly personal questions if you don't know them very well, like why they're not dating anyone or if they've gained weight.

      "content": "Get out there. Staying at home, behind your computer screen, hidden behind your cubicle barrier, or dodging lunch dates won't help you to avoid socially awkward moments.If you spend most of your time at home or in front of the computer for fear of interacting with people, then you'll never be able to work on your social skills. Realize that some people are snobby or standoffish. They are not the norm, nor do they represent a reason for hiding away. For such people, learn a simple way of detaching yourself with dignity, such as a quick nod and an \"It was nice to meet you\" before swiftly turning your back on them. Learn How to End a Conversation as well as how to have one. For many people, it is ending a conversation that is going nowhere or that is excruciatingly boring that leaves a sense of awkwardness, out of fear of appearing rude or uncaring."
