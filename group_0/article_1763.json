      "title": "An Aries man-Cancer woman bond is strong despite having little in common.",
      "content": "An Aries man-Cancer woman bond is strong despite having little in common. Astrologically, these two complement each other even though they might experience conflict from time to time. An Aries man is a strong-willed fire sign who’s passionate and adventurous, while a Cancer woman is an intuitive water sign who’s nurturing and emotional. When there’s a true love connection, they’ll balance each other out and make an exciting, intimate couple. [1] X Research source Aries men and Cancer women make easy friends when there’s no romantic pressure since they find their opposite qualities interesting. Aries and Cancer are both Cardinal signs, meaning these two are natural leaders. This can lead to a clash of wills sometimes. Aries is ruled by Mars (the planet of action and willpower) while Cancer is ruled by the Moon (the planet of feelings and the subconscious)."

      "content": "A Cancer woman loves an Aries man’s passion and energy. Even though she’s more than capable of taking care of herself, she’ll appreciate his desire to make her feel secure (a must for Cancers). She’ll find his bold, extroverted nature intriguing and different from her own, and will be pleasantly surprised to find out he’s a better listener than he seems at first. A Cancer woman finds an Aries man hard to resist. To attract her , he’ll sweep her off her feet with attention and affection like an old-fashioned gentleman. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "An Aries man admires a Cancer’s compassion and independence.",
      "content": "An Aries man admires a Cancer’s compassion and independence. He needs someone to protect to feel valued, and he’ll find her nurturing and loving character highly attractive. At the same time, he’ll appreciate that she can take care of herself since he needs personal space and alone time to feel free and energized. An Aries man responds well to flirtatious teasing. To attract him , all a Cancer woman has to do is make him a little mad and he’ll be wild for her. A Cancer woman can keep an Aries man interested by telling him how great he is or giving him any positive attention."

      "title": "An Aries man and Cancer woman have great sexual chemistry.",
      "content": "An Aries man and Cancer woman have great sexual chemistry. Their zodiac signs are square to each other (they form a 90-degree angle) on the zodiac wheel, which means there’s some tension between them. In the bedroom, though, this tension turns into a magnetic sexual attraction. Despite their occasional friction, they’ll hardly ever encounter issues in bed. [3] X Research source Aries men are passionate in bed and tend to seek instant gratification. For them, frequent and satisfying sex is a must in a relationship. A Cancer woman is more tender in the bedroom and sees sex as a way to communicate her love for her partner. Neither partner is particularly adventurous when it comes to sex. They’re both satisfied by the classics as long as their basic sexual needs are being met."

      "title": "The emotional bond an Aries and a Cancer share is surprisingly strong.",
      "content": "The emotional bond an Aries and a Cancer share is surprisingly strong. In this pairing, the Cancer woman does the brunt of the emotional work. She wants to see the true Aries man, who can appear emotionless or detached despite having passionate feelings deep down. Through her caring nature, she’ll eventually get him to open up and the two will share a deeply intimate, committed emotional relationship. An Aries man piques a Cancer woman’s emotional interest in a way she may not have felt for anyone else before. When an Aries man feels secure enough to be vulnerable, he can be surprisingly sweet and open (contrary to his hotheaded outer shell)."

      "title": "Aries men and Cancer women have no problem sharing their feelings.",
      "content": "Aries men and Cancer women have no problem sharing their feelings. Aries have a natural courageousness to tell someone how they feel and can’t hold things back or keep secrets for very long. Likewise, Cancers need to share their feelings with their partner in order to feel seen, secure, and loved. Arguments might arise when the Aries man speaks too bluntly, which can hurt the sensitive Cancer’s feelings. When a Cancer woman is hurt, she’ll retreat into her shell and go unusually quiet. The Aries man needs to give her space until she’s ready to communicate. Conversationally, these two may run out of interesting things to talk about sometimes because of their lack of shared interests."

      "title": "An Aries man and Cancer woman feel profound loyalty to each other.",
      "content": "An Aries man and Cancer woman feel profound loyalty to each other. Both signs are known for being faithful and dedicated to their partners, even during rough patches in their relationships. Their strong mutual loyalty is the biggest reason these two will decide that they’re perfect for each other. They know that there’s little to no reason to distrust one another, and that they can depend on each other for support. [4] X Research source Aries men and Cancer women trust each other easily as friends, but may take a while to build an intimate level of trust as romantic partners."

      "title": "Cancer women and Aries men both value family and a secure home.",
      "content": "Cancer women and Aries men both value family and a secure home. Cancers are notorious homebodies who view the home as a safe space to recharge and start a family. Likewise, Aries are fiercely protective over their loved ones. This makes an Aries man and a Cancer woman a dream team if they decide to get married and have children. An Aries man and Cancer woman tend to fall into traditional household gender roles, especially if they’re married or start a family. These two have complimentary abilities that make them a great parenting team should they decide to have kids. Reader Poll: We asked 326 wikiHow readers if they believed Cancers are generally family-oriented, and 91% of them said Yes. [Take Poll]"

      "title": "A Cancer woman and Aries man will disagree on money matters.",
      "content": "A Cancer woman and Aries man will disagree on money matters. An Aries man tends to be impulsive and thinks money is better spent than saved. He lives in the present and doesn’t plan for the long haul very well. A Cancer woman, however, values saving because it gives her a sense of safety and security for the future. [5] X Research source These two will have to have a talk and set boundaries about how they use their money if they ever get married or link their finances. Aries men are generally worse at planning for the future than Cancer women. In this relationship, the Cancer will end up instigating talks about the future. An Aries’ impulsiveness can threaten a Cancer’s need for security and predictability, which can lead to arguments about more than just money."

      "title": "An Aries man and Cancer woman may struggle to work together.",
      "content": "An Aries man and Cancer woman may struggle to work together. Just like a ram, an Aries man wants to tackle problems head on. He wastes no time confronting issues and wants them fixed yesterday. A Cancer woman, on the other hand, typically contemplates a problem for a long time before acting to solve it, which can irritate her impatient and hotheaded Aries man. An Aries man gets frustrated when he feels someone can’t keep up with him. He might interpret his partner’s slower approach as a lack of caring."

      "title": "An Aries man needs to let his Cancer woman dote on him.",
      "content": "An Aries man needs to let his Cancer woman dote on him. The hotheaded, independent Ram of the zodiac may have to curb his do-it-yourself attitude while dating a Cancer woman and go to her for help when he’s sick, injured, overwhelmed, or need emotional support. A Cancer needs to care for her partner to feel needed and it’s the biggest way she shows her love. An Aries man also needs to ask how his Cancer partner is feeling to show he understands her (it's best not to wait and hear about it later)."

    {
      "title": "A Cancer woman has to give her Aries man space.",
      "content": "A Cancer woman has to give her Aries man space. As a fire sign, an Aries man needs room to breathe and explore his personal freedom without feeling tied down. This can be hard for a water sign partner to accept since they like to envelop their partners to feel secure. A Cancer woman must curb her possessiveness and get used to loosening the reins to ensure they coexist peacefully. If a Cancer woman clings too much, an Aries man will feel threatened and retreat from the relationship."
