This file must have the same name as the folder that contains it. For example, if the folder name is \"LINK_3D\", the DEF file must be named \"LINK_3D.def\". If the new character folder has multiple DEF files in it, just make sure that the base one matches the folder name. For example, LINK_3D may have multiple DEF files for the different versions. As long as the \"LINK_3D.def\" file matches the folder name, you should be OK."

The name you type here needs to match the folder you added to your chars folder, which also needs to match the name of the character's DEF file. For example, if your new character's folder is named LINK_3D , type LINK_3D in the [Characters] section. If your character came with multiple versions, add the base DEF file to the end of the folder name. For example, if your LINK_3D character came with multiple versions, type LINK_3D/LINK_3D.def instead of LINK_3D . This will tell MUGEN to load the base DEF file, which will process the rest of the versions There may be lots of comments in your \"select.def\" file. These are indicated by ; at the start of the line. Make sure that you enter the characters on lines that don't start with ; ."

The game will randomly draw from all characters with the same order when determining a match-up. Add , order= # to the end of the character's entry in the \"select.def\" file.
