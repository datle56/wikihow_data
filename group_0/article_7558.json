      "title": "List the book title, chapter, and verse in your parenthetical citation.",
      "content": "List the book title, chapter, and verse in your parenthetical citation. At the end of the sentence where you've paraphrased or quoted the Bible, place a parenthetical citation inside the closing punctuation. Start by typing the title of the book of the Bible, then type the chapter and verse. Separate the chapter and verse with a colon. If your quote or paraphrase covers multiple verses, use a hyphen between the first and last verse of the range. [1] X Research source Example: (John 3:16 Abbreviate longer book names in your parenthetical citation. A handy table of abbreviations used in APA style can be found at https://www.apu.edu/live_data/files/288/citing_the_bible.pdf ."

      "title": "Add the name of the version you used.",
      "content": "Add the name of the version you used. After the chapter and verse, type the full name of the version of the Bible you used. Do not include any intervening punctuation between the verse and the name of the version. Place the sentence's closing punctuation outside the closing parenthesis. [2] X Research source Example: (John 3:16 New Revised Standard Version)."

    {
      "title": "Omit the version in subsequent citations unless you switch versions.",
      "content": "Omit the version in subsequent citations unless you switch versions. After your first parenthetical citation, you don't have to include the name of the version you used as long as you continue to use the same version. If you use different versions, however, include the name of the new version you used in the parenthetical citation. If you switch back, you would add the version again. [3] X Research source For example, if you were comparing the language used in different translations, you would need to include each of the different versions in the parenthetical citations."
    },
    {
      "title": "Incorporate the citation information into your text.",
      "content": "Incorporate the citation information into your text. A parenthetical citation is not required at all if you include all the information that would normally be in the parenthetical citation in the body text of your paper. If you include the chapter and verse but not the name of the version of the Bible you used, put the name of the version in parentheses immediately after the chapter and verse in your first citation to that version. [4] X Research source For example, you might write \"John 3:16 (New Revised Standard Version) states that everyone who believes in God and believes that Jesus is the Son of God will be granted eternal life in heaven.\""

      "title": "Ask your instructor or advisor if a reference list entry is required.",
      "content": "Ask your instructor or advisor if a reference list entry is required. APA doesn't require a reference list entry for commonly known classical or religious works such as the Bible. However, your instructor may want you to include it anyway. If they do, create a reference list entry that follows the format for a book with no identified author. [5] X Research source If you're citing supplementary material in the Bible, such as an introduction or study notes, you would typically include a reference list entry citing that portion as though it were an article or entry in a reference book, including the name of the author."

Use title-case, capitalizing all nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives. Place a colon after the title and include the name of the version as a \"subtitle\" after the title.

Abbreviate state names. If the version you used was published outside the US, use the name of the city and the name of the country as the location. Place a colon after the location, then add the name of the publisher. Place a period after the name of the publisher. [8] X Research source Example: Holy Bible: New Revised Standard Version . (1990).
