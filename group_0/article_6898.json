You'll need to have Service Pack 3 installed in order to use these language packs. According to Computer Repair Specialist Scott St Gelais, \"with Windows 10, you [...] just go into Windows settings. And then there's a section there called time and language. You can go there. And that's where you add language, you can add in all the languages you want.\" Click here and look for your language in the list. If the language you want is listed, and you are currently using the required base language, click the \"Get it now\" link to download the pack. If your desired language is not listed, or you aren't using the right base language, see the next step. Run the downloaded installer and follow the prompts to install the pack. Once the installation is complete, you'll see your changes take effect after restarting."
