Then, count the atoms according to the molecular formula and write them next to the element’s name or symbol. [2] X Research source For example, carbon dioxide or CO 2 , list that there is 1 carbon (C) and 2 oxygens (O) present in the molecule. For methane, CH 4 , list carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). Methane comprises 1 atom of carbon and 4 atoms of hydrogen. For glucose, C 6 H 12 O 6 , list carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O). Glucose comprises 6 atoms of carbon, 12 atoms of hydrogen, and 6 atoms of oxygen."

The Periodic Table lists the atomic mass of each element below the chemical symbol. For example, oxygen has a relative atomic mass of 15.9994 amu. [3] X Research source For carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), the relative atomic mass is 12.011 amu for carbon and 15.999 for oxygen. The atomic mass of an element is roughly equal to the summed mass of the protons and neutrons that it contains. Note that the relative atomic mass you find in the periodic table is scaled: it accounts for all of the isotopes of the element in the proportions that they naturally occur. [4] X Research source"

Remember to use the proper units. amu is the old abbreviation for atomic mass units, but the \"most correct\" modern unit is a lower-case u .
