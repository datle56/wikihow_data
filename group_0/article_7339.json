      "title": "Choose a broader heel for better stability.",
      "content": "Choose a broader heel for better stability. Stilettos may be what you think of when you're buying high heels, but they can also lead to discomfort. With stilettos, you're constantly balancing on a sharp point, and it can cause pain in your ankles and your knees. Instead, pick a wider heel for more stability. [1] X Research source For instance, look for wedges, spool heels, stacked heels, or chunky heels."

      "title": "Choose a heel no bigger than 3 inches (7.6 centimetres).",
      "content": "Choose a heel no bigger than 3 inches (7.6 centimetres). Too much height makes your shoe uncomfortable. Pick a heel that's 3 inches (7.6 centimetres) or lower. If you want more height, you can try a platform, which can give you more height without adding extra height to the heel. [2] X Research source For instance, if you have a platform of 1 inch (2.5 centimetres) with a 4-inch (10 centimetres) heel, the heel is essentially 3 inches (7.6 centimetres). Kitten heels are a great choice for work. Pumps also tend to have shorter heels."

      "title": "Pick a less pointy toe for more comfortable toes.",
      "content": "Pick a less pointy toe for more comfortable toes. While you make think a sharp toe on your high heels looks polished or sexy, those types of toes tend to scrunch your toes together. Instead, go for an almond-shaped toe, which is less pointy. [3] X Research source Round toes are also a good choice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick heels that are centered.",
      "content": "Pick heels that are centered. That is, some heels go straight down from the back of the shoe. A heel that dips slightly inward so that it is centered under your heel provides more support. That makes the shoe more comfortable. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make sure you're strapped in.",
      "content": "Make sure you're strapped in. If your shoe is constantly slipping off your feet, it's going to lead to discomfort. Instead, make sure to choose a shoe that straps securely on your feet for better comfort. [5] X Research source Don't tighten the straps too much. The straps should be tight enough that you're not sliding around in the shoe but not so tight that they hurt your feet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Opt for platform shoes when possible.",
      "content": "Opt for platform shoes when possible. Platform shoes give you extra height overall, but you can still choose a lower heel in comparison to the platform. That way, your foot isn't bent as awkwardly, and you can walk more comfortably. [6] X Research source Plus, platforms provide more support for your feet, as there's a bigger barrier between your foot and the sidewalk. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Buy leather shoes for a more comfortable heel.",
      "content": "Buy leather shoes for a more comfortable heel. The heel of any high heel is stiffened to keep its shape. When a shoe is made of leather, it will eventually take on the shape of your foot. Other materials may remain too stiff, and they will continue to cause blisters over time. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look for a lining that covers the entire inside of the shoe.",
      "content": "Look for a lining that covers the entire inside of the shoe. With cheaper shoes, the lining may just be lining the inside sole, not around the edges. However, for a more comfortable shoe, you want the lining to cover the whole inside. [9] X Research source Leather is a good choice for a lining because it breathes better than vinyl or other synthetic materials. It also moves better with your foot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add some padding.",
      "content": "Add some padding. If your heel doesn't have much in the way of support, adding padding can make a difference. Try a gel insert to give your feet some much-needed relief. [10] X Research source Look for one that gives you some arch support, as many heels lack this feature."

      "title": "Ask the salesperson to measure your feet.",
      "content": "Ask the salesperson to measure your feet. You've always assumed you're a certain size, and you may be right. However, having your feet measured can tell you if one foot is slightly larger or if you need a wider or narrower shoe. Plus, you'll know you're spot on when looking for shoes in your size.

      "title": "Go shopping at the end of the day.",
      "content": "Go shopping at the end of the day. When you walk on your feet all day, they tend to swell slightly, meaning you have larger feet at night then you do in the morning. Therefore, it's best to try on high heels when your feet are at their largest in the evening. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Use the power of your thumb to test the fit.",
      "content": "Use the power of your thumb to test the fit. Once you have the shoes on, you need to make sure you have just enough space. You should be able to measure about a thumb's width from your big toe to the end of the shoe. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Focus on how the shoes feel.",
      "content": "Focus on how the shoes feel. When you're trying on shoes, you may get flustered by all the salespeople and not give them a proper test. However, it's essential that you make sure they are comfortable. One test you can do is to spend a little time walking on a harder surface (such as tile) to get a sense of how that feels. You can also try closing your eyes as you walk a few steps just so you can focus solely on how your feet feel. [14] X Research source"
