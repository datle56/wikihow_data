      "content": "Apply a gauze pad over the wound. Cut out a rectangular piece of gauze so it’s about 1 inch (2.5 cm) larger than the wound on each side. Gently press the gauze down so it completely covers the wound. [1] X Research source Use a gauze pad on any wounds that are too large to cover with a smaller adhesive strip bandage. Gauze pads also are effective for treating minor burns. [2] X Research source Use an impregnated gauze pad that’s soaked in petroleum jelly or antibacterial ointments to help your wound heal faster."

      "content": "Secure the gauze with surgical tape for a simple dressing. Cut off pieces of surgical tape that are 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than the edges of your gauze pad. Place a piece of tape along the edge of the gauze so it’s half on the dressing and half on your skin. Firmly press the tape down to secure it. Then, apply the remaining tape strips to the other edges. [3] X Research source Be sure to tape all 4 sides of your gauze pad to keep bacteria and potential infections out. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap a cotton roller bandage around the gauze for wounds near joints.",
      "content": "Wrap a cotton roller bandage around the gauze for wounds near joints. Keep your joint relaxed while you put on your bandage. Place the end of the wrap just below your wound and start wrapping the bandage. Overlap half the bandage as you wrap it up over the wound. Once you’ve passed the top of the wound, clip the end of the roller bandage to the layer underneath it so it stays secure. [5] X Research source Using roller bandages also allows you to secure gauze without using any tape. If your bandage is so tight that it causes pain or cuts off your circulation, loosen it a little bit so it’s snug but comfortable."

    {
      "title": "Change the gauze at least once a day.",
      "content": "Change the gauze at least once a day. In order for the wound to drain and heal, take your bandage and gauze off at the end of the day. When you remove the bandage, clean the wound and let it sit in the open air for a few minutes before applying the new bandage. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source If blood soaks through the gauze pad, replace it right away so it doesn’t drip or leak."

    {
      "title": "Choose an adhesive bandage that’s large enough to cover your wound.",
      "content": "Choose an adhesive bandage that’s large enough to cover your wound. Adhesive strip bandages come in a variety of sizes to treat a minor cut or protect a large scratch. Check that the padded gauze section of the bandage is large enough to cover your entire wound to keep out any bacteria. [7] X Research source If an adhesive bandage isn’t large enough to cover your wound, then you may need to apply a gauze dressing instead."

    {
      "title": "Peel the backing paper off of the bandage.",
      "content": "Peel the backing paper off of the bandage. Flip your bandage over and hold onto the loose edge of the backing paper. Slowly pull the backing paper up and off of the adhesive without touching the gauze pad. Once you get the first piece of backing paper off, simply remove the second piece to expose the adhesive. [8] X Research source If you’re worried about the adhesive sticking to itself, bend the backing paper in half without fully pulling it off the bandage yet. That way, you expose the gauze to apply it to the wound, and you can easily peel the backing paper off once you position the bandage."

    {
      "title": "Position the bandage’s gauze over your wound.",
      "content": "Position the bandage’s gauze over your wound. Hold the padded gauze section of the bandage directly over the wound. Be careful not to apply the adhesive tape part of the bandage directly on your wound since it could cause irritation or re-open the cut. [9] X Research source Try to avoid touching the gauze with your fingers so that you don't transfer any dirt or germs to the bandage."

    {
      "title": "Press the adhesive firmly against your skin.",
      "content": "Press the adhesive firmly against your skin. Once you have covered the wound with the gauze, gently stretch the adhesive part and press it onto your skin. Make sure the bandage doesn’t have any slack or gaps in the adhesive tape so that the bandage stays secured in one spot. [10] X Research source If there are gaps or any raised areas of the adhesive, bacteria could get into your wound which may lead to an infection."

      "title": "Replace your bandage at least once a day.",
      "content": "Replace your bandage at least once a day. Change your bandage if the gauze soaks through or when the bandage gets wet. Gently pull the bandage off instead of tugging or ripping it so you don’t hurt your skin or reopen your wound.

      "content": "Press the gauze of a knuckle bandage against the top of your knuckle. Knuckle bandages have a gauze pad in between 4 “wings” that wrap around your finger. Peel the backing paper off the bandage just enough so the gauze is exposed. Gently set the gauze against your wound so it’s completely covered. [12] X Research source If you don’t have a knuckle bandage on hand, you can cut the adhesive ends of a strip bandage in half to make the wings."

    {
      "title": "Remove the backing paper from one side to stick on the wings.",
      "content": "Remove the backing paper from one side to stick on the wings. It’s easier to work with 2 of the wings at a time so they don’t stick to one another. Fully remove the backing paper from one side of the bandage. Slowly wrap the wings around your finger above and below your knuckle joint. Smooth the bandage out so there aren’t any raised areas or gaps. [13] X Research source The wings fit around your finger so you can easily bend your knuckle without the bandage coming loose or falling off."

      "content": "Apply the last adhesive wings to your skin. Take the backing paper off the other side of the bandage and throw it away. Then, pull the wings tight and wrap them around the other side of your finger. Make sure the bandage isn’t so tight that it cuts off your circulation. [14] X Research source If your bandage feels uncomfortable, try lifting up one of the wings and making it fit a little looser."

      "content": "Replace your bandage whenever it gets wet. If fluids from your wound soak through the gauze or if you get your hands wet, gently peel the bandage off your finger. Clean your wound and let it air out for a few minutes before you put your new bandage on. Once your wound fully heals, you can stop using bandages.

      "content": "Use a fingertip bandage on small cuts by your nails. Fingertip bandages have an hourglass shape that fits better around your fingers without any excess hanging off. Peel off the backing paper on one side, and position the bandage so one side of the hourglass is over your nail. Remove the other piece of backing paper and wrap the bottom of the hourglass around your finger. Then, bend the gauze over your fingertip and wrap the remaining adhesive around your finger. [16] X Research source You can cut a large rectangular adhesive strip bandage into an hourglass shape if you don’t have one made for fingertips."

      "content": "Use a butterfly bandage to hold together slices and cuts. A butterfly bandage has two wider sticky adhesive strips connected by a thin, non-sticky strip. Peel off the backing off one side of the bandage and place it on one side of the cut. Pull the bandage tight so it closes up your wound, and stick the other adhesive onto the other side of the cut. The non-sticky center strip will sit directly over your wound.

You may need to use multiple butterfly bandages to hold a large cut closed. If your cut is over a joint or cannot be closed, you may need to get stitches ."

Remove the backing of the doughnut-shaped moleskin round, and apply it so that the blister sits inside the center cut-out. Place the round moleskin lid or an adhesive strip bandage over the top of the moleskin to cover the top of the blister to protect it if it pops.

When you’re finished, pat your wound dry with a piece of gauze or paper towel. [25] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try to apply a bandage as soon as you clean your wound so there’s less chance of developing an infection.
