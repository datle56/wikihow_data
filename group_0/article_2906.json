      "title": "Aim to educate yourself.",
      "content": "Aim to educate yourself . Keep in mind education isn't the junk you are forced to do in school for diplomas and degrees; it's an understanding of the world around you. People who are naturally curious for some reason begin to stop asking questions the moment they hit school. The truly brilliant mind, however, always questions their world and tries to make sense out of it. That is the secret to \"genius\". Try teaching yourself . You can even learn from your life experiences, sometimes called \"unschooling\"."

      "content": "Educate yourself about the world around you . Cultivate an interest in subjects like current events, interesting facts, funny and inspiring quotations, good books and movies, scientific studies and interesting inventions. Educational television, like PBS, is a great way to learn. Learning to think critically about the world around you by being aware of cause and effect in events will make you much smarter. If you can read much faster than you can speak, it is much more efficient to read a book, or better yet a non-linear electronic document like a wiki than to watch a show for all but the most intellectually demanding or video-dependent learning. Commercial television is particularly bad because its ultimate purpose is to do just enough to keep you at the TV and its ads, not satisfy you so you can do something else."

Without goals, you would have nothing to hope for. Reward yourself after accomplishing your goal. Be organized . You don't need to be a total neat freak, but wasting time is not smart.
