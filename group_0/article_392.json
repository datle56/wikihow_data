It just means thinking more about the overall look and putting clothes together in an intentional way, rather than just grabbing something from the top of the pile of clean clothes. [1] X Research source Accessories can elevate basics like a T-shirt and jeans to something more stylish. You might also experiment with tucking in your shirt, rolling up your jeans, or wearing different types of belts.

But beyond that, taking care of yourself makes you feel better about yourself. When you know you smell good and look presentable, you have more confidence than if you roll out of bed in your PJs. [4] X Research source As a teenager, try to build the hygiene routines that will take you through and into adulthood. As your skin and body are changing, this is the perfect time to create routines that work for you to keep you looking and feeling your best.

In contrast, if your space (no matter how small!) is organized and well put together, you'll look and feel more like an adult. Even better, when you keep your home clean , you're always ready to have guests at the drop of a hat without stressing out about your place being a wreck. [8] X Research source Wall treatments, plants, and real artwork can make your place look less like a teenager's room or a dorm room. As with your wardrobe, you don't have to get rid of your favorite posters or concert memorabilia! Just frame them so they look more polished. They'll give your room a more put-together look."

Learning new skills helps you expand your mind and gain a greater perspective on the world, which can make you seem a lot more mature. When you recognize that you always have things to learn, you keep your mind active and alert so you're able to handle any situation with a calm, adult-like demeanor. [12] X Research source The more life experience you have, the more you have to compare to. A wealth of experiences makes it a lot easier for you to understand other people's perspectives. If you're constantly learning, that also means you remember what it feels like to try something new for the first time. This allows you to have more patience with others."

If you get into an argument with someone, go ahead and apologize for your part in it rather than waiting for them to say something.

When someone gives you negative feedback, you could choose to let it upset you—but the more adult-like thing to do is to show that you're open to it. Recognizing that you're not perfect and that there are always things you can improve is one of the biggest ways you can act like an adult. [18] X Research source If someone's feedback crosses a line and seems mean or hurtful rather than constructive, don't be afraid to set boundaries . Even if they have a legitimate complaint, they can tell you about it without being mean. Show that you're dedicated to improvement by immediately implementing the feedback as much as you can. You might also ask the person follow-up questions to find out if your performance has improved since they gave you the original feedback."

People will see that you're acting like an adult if you consider other people's perspectives. Showing empathy also means that you think about the consequences of something before you do it, so you're less likely to unintentionally harm someone. [21] X Research source Listen actively to people you care about if they need to vent. They'll see that you empathize with them because you give them a sounding board. If you can avoid judging people for the things they say and do, you'll have a big part of empathy already down. Just remember that you don't know what someone's dealing with, and there are many possible reasons for them to act the way they do."

What accomplishments have you achieved? Where do you live? What does your family and social life look like? Then, break those things down into measurable goals that you can achieve in a specific time frame. [22] X Research source Hold yourself responsible for meeting the smaller goals on the way to your big goals, and you'll be well on your way to achieving your dreams, which will make you seem very mature and in control of your life. Even if you aren't able to meet all your goals right away, the fact that you're planning them and putting effort toward them shows that you're acting like an adult.

While anybody can donate (as long as they have the money), only some people are going to be willing to roll up their sleeves and really pitch in to get things done. By doing this, you're showing that you take responsibility not just for yourself but also for the world you live in.

Your purpose is your guiding force; it's how you know which path to choose in life and which direction to head in. Your path in life isn't necessarily something you're going to know right away—it could take a lot of reflection. But just the fact that you're searching for it is usually enough at first, especially when you're young.

You might feel called to something that you later find isn't at all fulfilling. That's just part of the process. People don't necessarily need to know that you're living a purpose-driven life.
