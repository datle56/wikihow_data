Orders within 30 minutes of your location will likely include a $1, $2, and $3 recommendation. While tipping is always optional, keep in mind that Dashers only make a few dollars per hour, and must cover their own gas and vehicular expenses. They receive 100% of your tip, so it can make a huge difference for them."
