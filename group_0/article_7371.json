      "content": "Determine your skin's undertone with the vein or white shirt test. Some colors may look better on you depending on the undertone of your skin. [1] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO® Board Certified Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 31 December 2019. Your undertone is the dominant hue of your skin—warm, cool, or neutral. Warm undertones tend to look best in warm colors, cool in cool colors, and neutral in any color. Use one of the following tests to determine your skin’s undertone : Vein test : Look at the veins on your wrist or palm. If your veins appear green, you have warm undertones. Blue or purple means you have cool undertones. And if you have a mix or you can’t tell, you have neutral undertones. White shirt test : Pull out a white shirt (or any white fabric) and hold it up to your face in a mirror lit by natural light. If your face appears rosy, you have cool undertones. If it appears more yellow, you’re warm. Can’t decide? Neutral. [2] X Research source For context, warm colors are reds, oranges, and yellows. Cool colors would be your blues, greens, and purples."

[3] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO® Board Certified Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 31 December 2019. Generally, colors that create a contrast in brightness with your skin are more flattering. For example, bright colors tend to wash out light skin, while dark colors might not pop on dark skin. [4] X Research source If your skin is dark, saturated oranges and yellows almost always look great, even if your undertone is cool. Greens and blues tend to pop on people with fair skin. [5] X Research source Bold jewel tones like emerald, ruby, and amethyst flatter paler skin regardless of undertone."

      "content": "Use your hair color to help you discover more flattering colors. Your hair color, like your skin undertones, can also inform your wardrobe colors. People with light blonde hair typically have cool skin undertones, and so look great in cool-toned clothing. Yellow blondes, on the other hand, mesh better with warmer hues. [6] X Research source Black, dark brown, or true red hair often indicates cool undertones. Brassy reds or lighter browns often indicate warm undertones. If you dye your hair , pick dye colors that match your undertones to better complement your skin."

      "content": "Sort your closet into a “color season” that matches your undertone. Many stylists narrow the color profiles down into “seasons” to help their clients stick to a preselected palette. [7] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO® Board Certified Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 31 December 2019. Typically, “fall” and “spring” colors go well with warm undertones, while “winter” and “summer” colors go well with cool undertones. Now that you know your undertones, pick out clothing that coincides with a matching season of your choice. Some colors in each season are: Spring: Warm, pastel colors like soft yellows, pinks, or oranges. Summer: Sharper cool colors like sea blue, deep purples, and strong reds. Fall: Warm earth tones like burnt oranges, browns, and darker greens. Winter: Dark or bright colors with cool undertones, like royal blue, emerald green, or hot pink."

[8] X Research source In this example, the 6 neutrals are light and dark gray, light and dark brown, navy, and black. Grays and browns come in warm and cool variations, so pick ones that match your color profile. Make sure the object is almost entirely monochromatic to more easily analyze its color."

      "content": "Hold the object up to your face in a mirror and examine the undertones. Find an area with plenty of natural light to do this, and decide which color makes you look your best. [9] X Research source Even neutral colors have undertones that can match your skin. Examine the objects’ undertones. For example, is it a warm gray, or a cooler, bluer gray? Does the object’s undertones match your skin's undertones? This is largely subjective and open to your taste, so don’t stress too much about it! Your best neutral is often close to your natural hair color."

Pick a couple objects that match your undertones the most closely, and get other neutral clothes that closely match those colors. These colors will make up the workhorses of your wardrobe, and will constitute the majority of your pants, dresses, jackets and shoes. [10] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO® Board Certified Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 31 December 2019. Of course, you’ll incorporate plenty of other colors, but your neutrals make for a reliable, flexible base to build on. Avoid mixing neutrals in an outfit to keep your look cohesive."

[11] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO® Board Certified Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 31 December 2019. It’s best to stick to 2-3 colors to stay cohesive; a good outfit is usually made up of 1 neutral and 1 main color with an optional small amount of accent color. More colors tend to make an outfit look busy. Of course, don’t toss your favorite clothes just because they don’t match your color—if it looks good on you, it looks good on you!"

Pick either a color that matches your eyes closely or one that’s on the opposite side of the color wheel. For our brown-eyed fashionistas, go for blues, lavenders, or reds.

      "content": "Pick a few accessories in a complementary accent color. Wearing complementary colors—or colors that sit on polar ends of the color wheel—is a quick way to make any outfit stand out. [13] X Research source Have a look at a color wheel, and choose 2 colors that sit on opposite sides to build a complementary color scheme. Then, choose 1 color to make up the dominant color of your outfit, and accessorize with the other color. For example, an orange tie or pocket square can make you stand out in an otherwise conservative navy suit. Likewise, an aqua belt on a salmon dress can be an unusual but stylish choice. Use this technique sparingly, as too many competing colors can begin to clash."

Using 2 different colors of metal can clash or look busy, so stick to 1 if you’re unsure. Silver and platinum are cool-toned metals, while gold and bronze are warm-toned. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear colors that express your personality. People tend to associate certain colors with certain vibes or attitudes. [15] X Research source For example, earth tones and light, unsaturated warm colors can make you look friendly and approachable. Bright reds are attention grabbers. Dark, monochromatic colors can make you look stern or powerful. Wear muted or pale colors if you want to be noticed less. Bright, bold colors, especially purple, may make you seem more creative. Your favorite or go-to colors might not match your undertones, and that’s okay! Comfort and confidence is often more important than precise color-matching. In addition, you may find that your favorite color has hues that do match your undertone. For example, reds come in both cool and warm tones, and both make a bold outfit."
