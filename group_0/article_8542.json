      "title": "Place the typewriter on sheets of newspaper.",
      "content": "Place the typewriter on sheets of newspaper. Lay 3-4 sheets of newspaper flat on your work surface. Unlatch the carrying case and lift the typewriter onto the newspaper. This protects your work surface from any dust, dirt, or products that may drip during the cleaning process. It also makes cleaning up your work surface easier. [1] X Research source Alternatively, place the typewriter on an old sheet or towel. Not all typewriters have a carrying case. How often you need to dust your typewriter depends on how dirty it is and how often it's used. If you use your typewriter daily, aim for once every 2-3 weeks."

      "title": "Use a vacuum and a paintbrush to remove dust from the exterior.",
      "content": "Use a vacuum and a paintbrush to remove dust from the exterior. Getting rid of dust is one of the largest tasks of cleaning a typewriter. Hold the vacuum cleaner extension arm 6 in (15 cm) directly above the machine and run the paintbrush over the area. Work your way around the machine with the paintbrush and vacuum cleaner to free up and remove the dust from all of the surfaces, key faces, and crevices. [2] X Research source You can find a variety of small paintbrushes at craft stores. Pick one with very soft bristles. Alternatively, you can use a toothbrush instead of a paintbrush. However, only use a toothbrush on modern typewriters and not antiques. This is because the bristles may be too rough, which can cause paint to flake off older machines. Try to use a toothbrush labeled \"very soft\" if possible."

      "title": "Vacuum underneath the typewriter to remove dust from inside the machine.",
      "content": "Vacuum underneath the typewriter to remove dust from inside the machine. Lift the typewriter and rest it on its back. Use the same process of freeing the dust with the paintbrush and removing it with the vacuum cleaner. Move the carriage from side to side so that more of the inner workings are exposed. Remove the dust from these areas too. [3] X Research source Rest the typewriter back in its proper position once you have vacuumed underneath."

      "title": "Use a can of compressed air to dislodge any difficult to reach dust.",
      "content": "Use a can of compressed air to dislodge any difficult to reach dust. Compressed air is the best way to reach dust that couldn’t be removed with the vacuum cleaner and paintbrush. Purchase a can of compressed air from a department or home improvement store and follow the manufacturer’s directions carefully. Aim the nozzle directly above the area you want to reach, such as the keys, and hold down the trigger to dislodge the dust. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wipe down the typewriter exterior with a damp cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe down the typewriter exterior with a damp cloth. Warm water and a drop of dish detergent are great for removing years of built-up grime. Simply add a drop of dish detergent to a cleaning cloth and wet the cloth very lightly with warm water. Gently wipe all surfaces of the typewriter with the cloth. [5] X Research source Be very careful if you have an antique typewriter, as the labels can come off easily. It's best to clean the typewriter whenever you notice dirt building up to help keep it in good condition. If you use the typewriter daily, remove the dirt and grime at least once per month."

    {
      "title": "Dry the typewriter with a cloth.",
      "content": "Dry the typewriter with a cloth. Use a dry cleaning cloth to wipe all areas of the typewriter that you cleaned with warm water and detergent. Make sure that the typewriter is completely dry. [6] X Research source This prevents the typewriter from rusting."

    {
      "title": "Use white vinegar to clean any glass panels.",
      "content": "Use white vinegar to clean any glass panels. Not all typewriters have glass panels on the side, but if yours does, then white vinegar is a great cleaning solution! Pour white vinegar into a spray bottle and lightly spray the glass panels. Then rub the glass panels with a cleaning cloth to get a shiny, glossy look. [7] X Research source Be careful to only get vinegar on the glass panels and not on other parts. This is because typewriters tend to be very delicate and the vinegar may lift worn paint."

      "title": "Clean the typewriter key faces with white vinegar and cotton swabs.",
      "content": "Clean the typewriter key faces with white vinegar and cotton swabs. Lightly dampen a cotton swab with white vinegar and gently rub each key face to remove dirt and grime. Replace the cotton swab as it gets dirty. [8] X Research source Don’t scrub the key faces too harshly, as the paint may lift off."

    {
      "title": "Clean the carrying case if the typewriter has one.",
      "content": "Clean the carrying case if the typewriter has one. The typewriter will only be as clean as the carrying case! It’s easy for dirt and dust to build up in the case, so use a vacuum cleaner to remove as much as possible. Wipe down the inside and outside of the case with a damp cloth and then dry it fully with another cloth. [9] X Research source Don’t put your typewriter back inside the case until they are both fully dry, as otherwise, mold and rust can form."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store the typewriter in the carrying case whenever it’s not in use.",
      "content": "Store the typewriter in the carrying case whenever it’s not in use. The easiest way to keep a typewriter clean is to prevent dust from building up in the first place. Make a habit of putting your typewriter away whenever it’s not in use so that it’s protected from dust and spilled food and beverages. [10] X Research source If your typewriter doesn’t have a carrying case, place a clean drape cloth over it for protection."

      "title": "Unstick sticky keys with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Unstick sticky keys with rubbing alcohol. Dip a toothbrush or small paintbrush in rubbing alcohol. Brush the rubbing alcohol over the metal key mechanisms and over any metal joints. If any key is particularly sticky, press down on the key face to expose that particular key mechanism. Scrub all sides of the key mechanism with the brush and rubbing alcohol to get it running smoothly again. [11] X Research source When scrubbing the key mechanisms, try to scrub in between each one as much as possible. The key mechanisms are visible at the front of the machine, just below the platen. This is the rubber roller that supports the paper in the typewriter. Cotton tips (which are the same as cotton swabs) can also be useful if a toothbrush or paintbrush isn’t effective. You shouldn't need to deep-clean your typewriter very often, as it typically only needs to be deep-cleaned if you notice a problem starting. Aim to deep-clean your typewriter once every 3-4 months if you use it daily."

      "title": "Apply a firearm or machinery oil to the main internal mechanisms.",
      "content": "Apply a firearm or machinery oil to the main internal mechanisms. A small amount of oil can make a huge difference in helping your typewriter run smoothly! Lift up the typewriter and rest it on its back. Spray a tiny amount of oil over the key mechanisms that you cleaned and over any pivotal joints. Immediately wipe any excess oil away using a clean cloth so that it doesn’t clog up the joints. [12] X Research source Only oil the internal mechanisms once you have removed the dust with a vacuum cleaner first. The internal mechanisms of typewriters can look complicated. The easiest way to find the pivotal joints is to hold down the space bar, backspace key, and shift key individually, and watch from underneath to see which joints move."

      "title": "Clean the rubber platen with lacquer thinner if it has difficulty feeding.",
      "content": "Clean the rubber platen with lacquer thinner if it has difficulty feeding. Pour a small amount of lacquer thinner onto a cleaning cloth. Rub the lacquer thinner over the platen and turn it as you work so that you reach all sides. You may need to swap the cleaning cloth halfway through if the platen is especially dirty. [13] X Research source The lacquer thinner removes the ink and grease from the platen, which helps it to run smoothly."
