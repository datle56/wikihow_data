      "content": "Roan asked fans not to call her by her real name. In an Instagram post uploaded in August 2024, Roan told fans “[P]lease—don’t call me Kayleigh.” She explained that she wants her professional persona (the “Chappell Roan” character) and her private life to feel separate, which means not allowing fans to call her by her real name. In the post, Roan also asked fans not to stalk or harass her, her family, or her friends and to respect her boundaries without assuming they know her through her music. The post sparked discourse online, with many fans and fellow artists supporting Roan’s desire to maintain boundaries when dealing with parasocial fans. [6] X Research source"

In an interview with Cherwell, a student newspaper, in 2022, she explained, “I have never felt super connected to my real name Kayleigh.” [7] X Research source Her affinity for drag culture is another possible explanation for why she chose to use a stage name. She’s said in various interviews that when she sings, she becomes Chappell, someone who’s more fearless than Kayleigh. [8] X Research source Roan often introduces herself before a performance as “Your favorite artist’s favorite artist,” an homage to how drag queen Sasha Colby introduces herself as “Your favorite drag queen’s favorite drag queen.” [9] X Research source"
