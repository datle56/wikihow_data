Pay close attention to exterior walls, as they can potentially give rodents direct entry into your home. If you have a fireplace, check for possible holes in that area. The warmth makes it an attractive area for rodents to nest. When in doubt, run caulk over any crevices you see. Even if a rodent can't get through it now, it might expand if it isn't sealed."

Parker also recommends sealing most or all of the holes in your home and leaving a trap at one or two entrances, so the mouse has no choice but to go to that hole and spring the trap. Parker suggests avoiding baiting your traps with rodenticide (i.e., rat or mouse poison), especially if the mice are getting into your house. If they eat the rodenticide and then go back inside, they may die in the walls and leave a pungent stench that will be difficult to get rid of. Instead, use peanut butter. If you catch any mice and want to release them, take them far away from your home, preferably in a field. Remember to wear gloves and never let your skin come into contact with the mouse or anything it touches."

If you've had a problem with rodents in the past, don't leave out pet food overnight. Return any uneaten food to the airtight container, then replace it in the morning.

Never touch a dead mouse, a mouse nest, or any surface a mouse has walked on with your bare fingers.
