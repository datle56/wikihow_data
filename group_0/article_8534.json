      "content": "Drain out any excess perfume from your travel bottle. Spray any excess perfume that is left in your perfume bottle into the sink and rinse it down the drain. Depending on how full your bottle is, you may have to do this for a few minutes. Starting with an empty perfume bottle will make it much easier to clean. [1] X Research source Do not try to spray the excess perfume from your atomizer back into its original bottle. This will most likely create a mess."

      "content": "Fill a spray bottle with water and 1 drop of dish soap. Find an empty spray bottle that has a similar top to a normal perfume bottle. Rinse the bottle out to remove any leftover product that might be in it. Fill the bottle up about halfway with warm water and 1 drop of dish soap. [2] X Research source You can either buy an empty spray bottle or use an atomizer from a product that you’ve used up. If you use one from an old product, rinse it out super well before you put water and soap into it. Use a mild dish soap that doesn’t have much of a scent."

      "content": "Shake your spray bottle to combine the water and soap. Put the lid on your spray bottle and gently shake it from side to side for about 1 minute to mix the water and the soap together. If your mixture is really sudsy, add some water to dilute the soap. [3] X Research source If your mixture is too soapy and the bubbles overflow out of the bottle, it could leave soap residue in your perfume bottle that is hard to clean out."

Insert the exposed tube into the bottom of your perfume bottle and pump water and soap into your travel perfume bottle like you would normal perfume. Fill your perfume bottle up about halfway.
