      "content": "Give your ex some time and space before reaching out. After the initial breakup, both you and your ex will doubtlessly need time and space away from each other to process the breakup and recover emotionally. [1] X Research source Even if you decide the next day that you want to get back together, give your ex at least a month or two before you start making new overtures. If you like, use this time as an opportunity to meet and even date other people. If you date someone new, you may find that your desire for your ex fades with time. Extended time and space apart may allow you both to gain perspective on your relationship and appreciate one another more."

      "title": "Start by sending them a text.",
      "content": "Start by sending them a text. If you still want to get your ex back after a couple of months, keep things low-key and send a friendly, short text. This can be a good way to judge if your ex has any interest in talking with you. It’s still too early to flirt and certainly too early to say anything sexual. Be brief and sweet, and say something like: “I just walked by the bakery where we used to buy baguettes together, and it reminded me of you. I hope you’re doing well.” “I heard our favorite song on the radio together and thought of some good times we’ve had. Hope you’re great.”"

      "content": "Call your ex for a short phone chat. If your ex replies to your text and the two of you have had even a short texting conversation, you can take the next step by calling your ex. Keep the conversation light—don’t mention the breakup, and don’t bring up any long-term plans to get back together. Your ex could register these as red flags and decline your invitation to see one another. This will show that you’re willing to put in effort, that you have an interest in reconnecting with them as a person, and that you’re not just looking for a quick hookup."

      "title": "Ask your ex if they’d like to meet up.",
      "content": "Ask your ex if they’d like to meet up. It’s a good sign if your ex seems willing to talk with you on the phone. At some point during the conversation, ask them if they’d like to meet and do something brief and light. For example, you could bring up attending an art gallery, visiting a farmer’s market, etc. Say something like: “I heard that there’s a new photography exhibit at the art museum. I’d like to go and it should only take about an hour. Would you be interested in joining me?” If your ex agrees and the hangout goes well, ask them if they’d like to do another similarly fun, light activity."

      "title": "Tell your ex that you miss them.",
      "content": "Tell your ex that you miss them. Your ex will doubtlessly be curious about why you’re reconnecting with them. Be honest. This is a time when you can even be a little romantic, although your ex may not be interested until they see that you’re sincere in wanting to reconnect. Say something like: “While we’ve been apart for the past couple of months, I’ve realized how much I miss you.” “I’ve processed things emotionally after we broke up, and I figured out that I’m not happy when you’re not a part of my life.” Kaplan recommends finding out if your ex also misses you. “Some pretty practical signs that your ex misses you include peeking at your social media or keeping tabs on your life and how you spend your time. Is he or she getting in touch and popping in and out of your life? Those are probably the biggest indicators that your ex is missing you because we don't know how anyone’s feeling if we don't talk to them.”"

      "title": "Explain that you still have feelings for your ex.",
      "content": "Explain that you still have feelings for your ex. This is a delicate subject to bring up, and you shouldn’t do it on the first date. Wait until your ex has agreed to see you a second or third time, and then talk about your feelings. It’s best to be open and honest: state that you still have feelings for your ex and that you’d like to consider getting back together. Reconnecting and getting back together with an ex can be a time-consuming process. Don’t expect your ex to immediately agree to jump back into a relationship. Depending on how your ex feels, they may still harbor anger towards you or may have moved on altogether."

      "content": "Respect your ex’s feelings no matter what they are. Once you’ve explained your romantic feelings to your ex, your ex may make it clear to you that they are not interested in getting back together and do not have any lingering romantic feelings. [2] X Research source In this scenario, honor their wishes and abandon your plan to reconnect. It may be appropriate to make a final appeal. Say something like, “I’m not asking for us to get back together right away. I just want one more chance to show how much I care for you.” If your ex still declines, move on and give them the space they want."

      "title": "Apologize for things you did wrong in your relationship.",
      "content": "Apologize for things you did wrong in your relationship. If you were the one who ended the relationship, or if you said hurtful things to your ex, you need to apologize. Don’t try to skirt around the issues that led to your breakup. Own up to your mistakes and take responsibility for ways in which you may have wronged or offended your ex. On the other hand, you will also need to forgive your ex for any emotional harm they may have done you. If you reconnect with your ex but still harbor resentment or bitterness, the relationship is bound to fail again. [3] X Research source Dreyfus notes that “it’s important to have a clear understanding of your intention and goal of what you want to get out of the conversation and to use your awareness to help you make mindful choices,” especially “if the opportunity is there and they are receptive.”"

      "content": "Avoid re-hashing any painful past details. While you and your ex will need to discuss and somehow resolve the core issues that led to your prior breakup, there’s no point in dragging one another through the emotionally painful details. Focus on good things about your ex and express these in conversation. For example, say things like: “I was out with friends the other night, and I started thinking about how funny you are and how much I love the way our senses of humor work together.” It may help to take some time to process any stressful events or painful details of the past. Over time, your negative emotions will lose their strength, and you can gain a healthier perspective on the contributions of you and your ex to your relationship’s end."

It may make your ex unhappy or jealous, though, to hear stories about any indiscretions you committed following the breakup. For example, don’t tell your ex unnecessary details about other people you’ve dated. Looking to the past can result in the 2nd relationship with your ex going just as badly as the first time around."

A month or two is a good amount of time to consider whether the other person still fits into your plans (and vice versa). If you’ve both used the time away from each other to grow and focus on yourselves, the time may be right to try and reconnect.

If you’re both still in a place where you’re showing anger, frustration, or resentment toward one another, it’s not a good time to try and move forward. You need more space to move on from the hurt you both felt and to consider whether moving on from each other is best. It’s important that you both have clearly spoken about any former issues in the relationship and found a sense of resolution or closure about them. The worst thing you can do is push to get back together, only to re-experience the same problems you had before that were never dealt with. Listen closely when communicating with your ex . They may have specific questions about the breakup that they need addressed, which you should answer. Attentive listening shows concern and respect for the person you’re talking to.

Sometimes, the idea of a relationship you once had feels great, but the reality of it isn’t always the same thing. Before trying to ask your ex out, consider how compatible you both really are. Can either of you get over things about the other person that created issues before?

      "content": "Make a list of reasons that you’re contacting them again. Wanting to see them because you miss them or regret the relationship ending is very different from feeling lonely in general, or wanting a hookup. Try to list the pros and cons of the relationship and figure out which side best informs your decision. If your reasons mostly include unfinished business, it’s a better idea to work those issues out with them for closure than to meet up to reconnect. Dreyfus suggests that “it can be really easy to fall back into the familiar and regular habits between you and your ex. I would encourage you to honor the reasons you chose to end the relationship. By honoring our choices, we are building self-trust. When we don’t honor our choices and boundaries, we can break our own trust with ourselves.”"

If you think you’re better as friends who don’t spend too much time together, resist the urge to make contact with romantic intentions. If you know how dramatic and messy the two of you are together, don’t make an effort to go back to that place unless you know you’ve both truly changed. Infidelity or any kind of physical or emotional abuse in the relationship are red flags to let things go. Neither of you should put yourselves in harm’s way to be emotionally or physically harmed."
