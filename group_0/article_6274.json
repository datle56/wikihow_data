      "content": "Defeat Team Galactic so the Pokémon appear in their respective lakes. Each version of the game pits you against Team Galactic and their leader, Cyrus, who aims to remake the world by controlling Legendary Pokémon. Take down Cyrus on Mt. Coronet completely—after this point, Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit can be found and caught. [1] X Research source If you visit the lakes before this point, you won’t be able to find or catch this Legendary trio."

      "content": "Find, battle, and capture Uxie around Lake Acuity in the Acuity Cavern. Head to the northernmost end of Route 217, around the North Alabaster Icelands. Using Surf, swim across the lake to the central island and go through the entrance to reach the Acuity Cavern. A level 50 Uxie will be waiting in the center. Hit A to interact with the Pokémon and start battling it, where you can gradually weaken and catch it using Ultra Balls. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Find, battle, and capture Azelf around Lake Valor in the Valor Cavern. Journey down to the southernmost end of Route 214, until you reach the Northeastern Crimson Mirelands. Use a Pokémon’s Surf ability to swim to the central island in the lake. Then, use the entrance to reach the Valor Cavern, where a level 50 Azelf spawns. Just like with Uxie, hit A to engage the Pokémon in battle, where you can start to weaken and capture it with Ultra Balls. [3] X Research source If you still have your Master Ball on hand, feel free to use it on one of these rare Pokémon."

      "content": "Track Mesprit across Sinnoh to catch it successfully with an Ultra Ball. Unlike Uxie and Azelf, Mesprit disappears after you interact with it. Head to the Valley Windworks and Route 205 areas. Then, move between these areas, checking the Marking Map on your Pokémon Watch as you go—it’ll let you know when and where Mesprit moves. Once Mesprit moves to your location, spray a Repel and enter the grass; eventually, it’ll spawn in that area. [5] X Research source To ensure that you run into Mesprit first (rather than a random wild Pokémon), make sure that the leading Pokémon in your party is under level 50."

      "content": "Save your game before challenging any Legendary Pokémon. You only get one chance to battle and catch these Pokémon—if they faint, they won’t respawn in their respective places. To ensure that you catch your desired Pokémon, save your game before the battle begins so you have an easy reset point. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Stock up on Ultra Balls.",
      "content": "Stock up on Ultra Balls. Since you’re battling Legendary Pokémon, Ultra Balls are your best bet to successfully catch any of the Lake Trio. Dusk Balls may also be helpful since they’re extra effective when used in caves. Timer Balls are another possible option if the battle lasts for a really long time."

      "content": "Use attacks that come with status effects. You’ll have an easier time successfully catching Uxie, Mesprit, or Azelf if you freeze them or make them fall asleep. If you land a status effect on Mesprit and it manages to escape, it’ll still have that status effect the next time you encounter it in battle. [7] X Research source Moves that can inflict “sleep”: Sleep Powder, Spore, Yawn, Hypnosis, Sing [8] X Research source Moves that can inflict “frozen”: Blizzard, Ice Beam, Ice Fang, Ice Punch, Powder Snow [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Use False Swipe when battling any of the Lake Trio. The False Swipe move prevents the attacker from completely depleting the enemy’s HP—in other words, the enemy will stay at 1 HP after the attack no matter what. [10] X Research source Utilizing this attack can be helpful if you’re worried about knocking out Uxie, Mesprit, or Azelf. Many Pokémon learn this ability when they level up (like Farfetch’d, Zangoose, and Cubone), while others can be taught this ability via a TM (like Beedrill, Scyther, and Absol)."

A variety of Ghost-type Pokémon learn this skill when they level up (like the Gastly evolutionary line, Umbreon, Murkrow, Sableye, and Misdreavus), so they may be a helpful addition to your roster.

      "title": "Catch Mesprit first or save it for last.",
      "content": "Catch Mesprit first or save it for last. Mesprit is the most complicated of the Lake Trio to catch, so it might be easiest to catch it either before or after you catch both Uxie and Azelf. Since the process of finding and catching Uxie and Azelf is almost identical, it’s easier to catch these Pokémon in quick succession."
