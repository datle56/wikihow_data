      "title": "Choose a high-quality photo if you're working from reference.",
      "content": "Choose a high-quality photo if you're working from reference. If you aren't caricaturing a live subject, pick a large photograph of your subject. Ensure that the reference photo is crisp and has good lighting. You should be able to easily see the definition in your subject's face. [1] X Research source If you're caricaturing yourself, ask someone to take a photo of you instead of taking a selfie. Holding the camera close to your face for a selfie will cause distortion which makes it hard to see your actual likeness."

    {
      "title": "Draw the big shapes of your subject.",
      "content": "Draw the big shapes of your subject. Take your favorite drawing pencil and begin sketching the basic head shape of your subject on a large piece of paper. Then fill in the other shapes that form your subject's face, such as their eyes, nose, and mouth. Work quickly and keep the drawing basic. [2] X Research source Creating a rough outline for your thumbnail sketch will make it easier for you to emphasize some shapes and fill in details."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add some detail to the subject to make it recognizable.",
      "content": "Add some detail to the subject to make it recognizable. You may already know which elements you want to exaggerate as you sketch or you might not know yet. Observe the things that make your subject unique and sketch them onto the basic head shape you created. Fill in basic outlines such as the hair and jawline. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose which features you want to exaggerate.",
      "content": "Choose which features you want to exaggerate. Look at your subject and pick 1 or 2 features that immediately jump out at you. For example, a person's eyes might droop down noticeably or their lips might be incredibly plump. Once you know the features to exaggerate, make them a little more extreme so they really stand out. For example, if you're caricaturing Barack Obama, you might choose to exaggerate his ears, chin, or forehead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch the exaggerated features.",
      "content": "Sketch the exaggerated features. See how far you can push the exaggeration when you sketch the 1 or 2 features you're going to emphasize. Keep in mind that you'll probably have to downplay other features so the exaggerated features fit. Don't be afraid to erase or start over if things aren't working out. For example, for your Barack Obama sketch, start by drawing a large forehead. Then, instead of making the eyes higher and larger near the forehead, keep them small and lower on the face. This will make the forehead stand out even more. Go back and sketch glasses or accessories after you've finished drawing the features."

    {
      "title": "Make several thumbnail sketches.",
      "content": "Make several thumbnail sketches . Create more than 1 sketch even if you really like how the first thumbnail sketch turned out. Try exaggerating different features on the other sketches or draw your subject from different angles or sizes. This can help you see what really works for your specific subject. [4] X Research source Sketch your subject showing different moods to see which captures the likeness you're going for. For example, you might sketch comedian Jim Carrey looking serious or thoughtful, but a sketch of Carrey with a wacky expression will be more recognizable."

    {
      "title": "Choose your favorite thumbnail sketch.",
      "content": "Choose your favorite thumbnail sketch. Look over all of the quick thumbnail sketches you made of your subject and pick the one you like the best. It might be the one with the best exaggeration or likeness to your subject. [5] X Research source Keep the other sketches close by to use as references for the rough sketch. You should also have the reference photo at your work station so you can glance at it as you sketch."
    },
    {
      "title": "Outline the head shape and structure of the features.",
      "content": "Outline the head shape and structure of the features. Use a pencil to carefully draw the shape of the head, exaggerating it as much as you like. Then sketch where the big features, such as ears or nose, are placed. Refer back to your thumbnail sketch to see what exaggerations you liked. [6] X Research source Take more time doing the rough sketch. This is your chance to improve and expand on the thumbnail sketches you made."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the reference photo to fill in main features.",
      "content": "Use the reference photo to fill in main features. Once you've made the basic outline for your subject, look at the reference photo as you draw in details of the face. Go slowly to ensure that you're placing the details where you want them. You can sketch as lightly or as firmly as you like when you work. [7] X Research source Include all of the facial features in your rough sketch. At this point, the subject should be completely recognizable with exaggerated features."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add shading to fill in the dimensions of your subject.",
      "content": "Add shading to fill in the dimensions of your subject. Take your pencil or charcoal and fill in or cross-hatch parts of the face. Try to create shadows and depth so your subject's features stand out and look three dimensional. [8] X Research source It may be tempting to add small details, but try to focus just on quickly finishing the rough sketch before moving on to your final caricature drawing. Once you've finished your rough sketch, decide if you're happy with it and want to move on or if you'd like to try another rough sketch."

    {
      "title": "Trace",
      "content": "Trace an abstract version of the rough sketch onto tracing paper. Tape a piece of tracing paper over your rough sketch. Then take a pencil and lightly draw over the outlines of the subject. You should now have a basic drawing that looks like a coloring page without any detail. [9] X Research source Drawing the abstraction will help you catch any drawing errors. For example, you might find that the eyes were too far apart when you made your rough sketch or maybe you see that you want to exaggerate a person's chin even more."

      "title": "Choose the medium you want to use for the final drawing.",
      "content": "Choose the medium you want to use for the final drawing. While you've probably been working in pencil up to this point, decide what medium you'd like to work with to make the final caricature. For example, use a blunt marker, charcoal, or fine-point pen."

      "title": "Trace over the abstract sketch and add contouring lines.",
      "content": "Trace over the abstract sketch and add contouring lines. Now tape the piece of paper you'd like to use for your final drawing over the abstract version you just made. Take your chosen medium and draw the subject's outline. Continue to add lines that give your caricature depth. [10] X Research source There's no right or wrong way to finish your caricature. Some artists prefer to work on facial features, such as the eyes or mouth, before moving on to hair or ears. Draw in any order you like."
