      "content": "Turn off your furnace before checking or replacing the filter. Set the furnace’s thermostat to the “off” position. This will prevent the furnace from turning on while you are checking or replacing the filter. If the furnace turns on while there is not filter in it, then it can suck up potentially-damaging loose debris. Refer to the owner's manual for your furnace for any specific instructions regarding how to replace the filter."

Open or remove the door to provide access to the inside of your furnace. [1] X Research source If your door is the type that slides off, then you can typically remove it by simply lifting it up until it comes free, and then set it aside."

      "content": "Locate the filter in your furnace and remove any cover that is over it. The filter is usually located at the air return duct or the entrance to the blower chamber. There is sometimes another cover over the filter that you will have to pull off. [2] X Research source Look for the vents where the air enters into the furnace system to locate the filter near either the air return duct or the entrance to the blower chamber."

      "content": "Slide out the old filter and hold it up to the light. Use both hands to carefully pull the filter out for inspection. Hold it up to a light source to check how dirty it is and determine if it is time to replace it. [3] X Research source If there is any resistance when you try to slide the filter out, then there may be a locking mechanism keeping it in place. Check for such a system and slide the lock out of the way to release the filter."

      "content": "Replace the filter with a new one if you can’t see through it. It’s time to replace the filter when no light shines through the filter when you hold it up to a light source. It’s important to change the filter regularly to keep good airflow going through the furnace and keep it from overheating. [4] X Research source Disposable filters have a cardboard frame. If your filter has a plastic or metal frame, then it is a reusable filter than you can clean instead of replacing it with a whole new filter."

Note it down so that you can refer to the measurements when you shop for a new filter. [5] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If your filter does not have the dimensions printed on it, then measure it with a measuring tape, or check the owner’s manual for the manufacturer’s recommendations to ensure you get the right replacement filter."

Refer to the dimensions of the old filter and buy a filter of the same size. [6] X Research source The cheapest disposable furnace filters are fiberglass with cardboard frames. This kind of filter will trap large particles of dust and is designed to be replaced every 1-2 months. If you want to upgrade your filter, you can get a slightly more expensive disposable pleated filter, which will trap smaller particles of dust , pollen, and dirt. These filters last longer; from 4 months to 1 year."

Find this arrow to determine which way to slide the filter into your furnace. Home furnace filters are made to filter air in a single direction so that they do not collapse or fall apart as they trap dust and other debris."

Snap the filter cover back into place if you removed one to take out the filter. [7] X Research source If you put the filter in backwards, then your furnace won’t have sufficient airflow and it can overheat and shut down. This can also happen with a dirty filter, so make sure to keep checking your filter monthly and replacing it when it is dirty."
