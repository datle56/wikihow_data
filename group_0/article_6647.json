If the switch is gray, tap it to turn it blue now, and then restart Zoom. If you don’t see this option or can’t move the switch, ask your team admin to enable Virtual Backgrounds for you."

      "content": "Select I have a green screen if you have a physical green screen. Though a green (or any solid color) screen isn’t required, it’ll make your background look a lot more realistic. After you click to check the box, follow the on-screen instructions to click your green screen to set it as the background color. For example, if your green screen is white, anything that is white will be replaced with a virtual background. If you don’t have a green screen but do have a recent Intel i5 or i7 processor and see a Download option under “Enable smart virtual background,” click it to emulate a green screen. This makes it so you can select multiple colors in your background and replace them with a single image. A multi-colored background won't allow Zoom's camera settings to replace a single color with another image, so the result will look pixelated and broken."

If you're already in a meeting, you can change your background by clicking the up arrow (^) next to \"Start/Stop Video\" and selecting \"Choose a virtual background.\" You'll see the same \"Virtual Backgrounds\" box appear like the previous steps.
