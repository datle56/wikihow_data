Wait until the water starts bubbling and reaches 212 °F (100 °C) before turning off the heat.

      "content": "Pour the boiling water down your drain. Slowly and carefully pour the water directly down the drain, making sure not to spill or splash any liquid. If the water moves quickly and easily through the drain, then you’ve cleared the clog. [2] X Research source The boiling water will melt away any residue stuck inside your drain so it washes through your pipes. Pouring boiling water down your kitchen drain also helps get rid of drain flies that lay eggs in the buildup inside your pipes. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Target drains that have garbage disposals with hot, soapy, water. Put a stopper over your kitchen drain, and fill your sink with a few inches of hot water. Add a large squirt of dish soap to the water. Then, take the stopper out of your sink and turn on your garbage disposal. The soapy water will fill your garbage disposal and loosen smelly food residue that’s caught around the blades. [4] X Research source The added dish soap helps cut through any grease or fat that’s stuck in your drain as well. Alternatively, add a few lemon wedges, coarse salt, and ice cubes to your disposal, then run the disposal until the ice is gone. The salt scrubs the blades, the ice knocks away debris, and the lemon deodorizes the drain. If any odor remains, let some baking soda sit in your disposal for 5-10 minutes, then rinse with hot water."

      "title": "Put 1 cup (220 g) of baking soda down your sink drain.",
      "content": "Put 1 cup (220 g) of baking soda down your sink drain. Scoop the baking soda directly into your kitchen sink drain. Use the end of a spoon or butter knife to push all the baking soda inside of the drain so it’s not just sitting on the surface. [5] X Research source If you’re cleaning a really smelly drain , let the baking soda sit for about 15 minutes so it has a chance to absorb more odors. Baking soda acts as a natural deodorizer and abrasive scrubber to get rid of food and unpleasant odors from your drain. Baking soda is safe to use in your kitchen drain regardless of if you have a garbage disposal or not. [6] X Research source"

Let the vinegar sit for a few minutes, and take it off the heat once it comes to a rolling boil. [7] X Research source White vinegar is acidic and has antimicrobial properties, so it kills bacteria and helps freshen up your sink drain. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the baking soda and vinegar sit for 5–10 minutes. This will give the baking soda and the vinegar time to deodorize and clean the drain. As the baking soda and vinegar react, the fizzing will break down the residue stuck inside the drain pipes so it easily washes away. [10] X Research source"

After the baking soda and vinegar have been inside your drain for 5–10 minutes, slowly pour the boiling water down your drain. This will remove and rinse out any scum or debris that’s leftover inside of your kitchen sink drain. [11] X Research source To prevent your drain from getting too smelly or dirty, deodorize it with baking soda and hot vinegar once a week."

      "content": "Pull out any obstructions you see with needlenose pliers. Shine a flashlight down your drain and look for any visible obstructions in the pipes. If you see a clog near the top of your drain or in your garbage disposal, reach in with your needlenose pliers and slowly pull it out. [12] X Research source Unplug your garbage disposal so you don’t risk it turning on while you’re cleaning. If your disposal is hard-wired and doesn’t have a plug, then turn off the power at your main breaker box."

      "title": "Try using a sink plunger to force the clog out of your drain.",
      "content": "Try using a sink plunger to force the clog out of your drain. Set your plunger over the kitchen drain opening so it forms a watertight seal. Slowly press the plunger down, and quickly jerk the handle back up to loosen the clog. Keep moving the plunger up and down about 20–30 times before taking it out of your sink. Turn on your faucet and let water run through your drain. If the water flows without backing up, then the plunger removed the clog. [13] X Research source Plug the overflow opening on your sink with a rag or washcloth. If you have a double sink, then plug the second drain while you’re plunging. Plungers work great if your drain is fully clogged and there’s standing water in your sink."

      "content": "Remove and flush out the trap from the drainage pipe. The sink trap is the U-shaped piece connecting the drain to the waste pipe in your wall. Place a bucket underneath the trap to catch any spilled water. Remove the trap by unscrewing the pipe connections. Rinse the trap in a different sink or with your garden hose. If you still see residue inside, scrape it out with a wire hanger or a bottle brush . When you’re finished, just reattach the trap to your drain and run water through it. [14] X Research source If your sink is still blocked after cleaning out the trap, it may mean the clog is further down the waste pipe in your wall. Avoid using your kitchen sink after you remove the trap so you don’t spill any water. If you’re worried about making a mess, plug the sink drain or turn off the faucet’s water supply using the valves under your sink."

      "content": "Use a drain snake to dislodge deeper clogs. Remove the trap from the drain pipe underneath your sink and set it aside. To use your drain snake , feed the end into the waste pipe in your wall. Spin the handle clockwise on the drain snake to feed it deeper into the pipe until you hit an obstruction. Then, turn the handle counter-clockwise to break apart the clog and pull the snake back out of the pipe. When you’re finished, reattach the sink trap and try running water through your drain. [15] X Research source Check the manual for your drain snake to see if it can attach to a power drill. That way, you’re able to feed the snake into the pipe more quickly and can apply more force to remove the clog."

      "content": "Remove grease and food residue with an enzyme cleaner. Bio-friendly cleaners contain natural enzymes that eat away at organic matter, like grease, soap, and fatty debris without using any toxic chemicals. [16] X Research source Pour the cleaner directly into the drain and let it sit for several hours according to the directions on the label. After that, rinse the cleaner and any residual buildup out with warm running water. [17] X Research source Some of the best enzyme cleaners to get for your drain include Instant Power Drain Clog Remover , Green Gobbler Drain Clog Remover , and Bio-Clean Bacteria Septic Cleaner . Alternatively, drop an enzyme drain cleaner stick down the drain once a month. Over time, the cleaner stick will break down to prevent clogs and deodorize your drain. [18] X Research source Enzyme cleaners may not be effective for removing hard mineral deposits from your kitchen drain."

      "content": "Pour in chemical drain cleaners as a last resort for minor clogs. Commercial drain cleaners often contain very strong chemicals or acids that break residue. [19] X Research source Open the windows in your kitchen and put on rubber gloves before handling the cleaners. Because each drain cleaner works a little differently, follow the directions on the packaging carefully. Most times, all you’ll do is pour the cleaner down the drain, let it sit for a set amount of time, and rinse it out with warm water. [20] X Research source Some effective chemical drain cleaners include Drano , Liquid-Plumr , and lye . Avoid mixing different chemical drain cleaners since they could create toxic fumes. After you pour drain cleaner into your sink, avoid using a plunger because the chemicals could splash back. Many plumbers recommend using chemical clog removers sparingly since they contain harmful ingredients that could potentially damage your pipes and discolor surfaces around the drain.

If your kitchen drain is still clogged or you’re worried about causing damage, reach out to a local plumber and let them know the issue. They’ll be able to locate the clog more easily and clean out your entire drain safely and effectively. [22] X Research source If you notice bad smells regularly from your kitchen drain and you have old metal drain pipes under the sink, a plumber may recommend replacing them with PVC instead. Slick PVC pipes won't clog as easily, since food and grease will have a harder time sticking to them. Ask friends or neighbors for recommendations on a good plumber in the area, or look for local plumbers with good customer reviews online."
