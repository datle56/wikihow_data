      "content": "Use the long-tail cast on if you want an even and somewhat elastic edge. As the name implies, you will be using both the tail and working yarn to create your stitches. Because of its versatility, it is probably the most popular cast-on among knitters. [2] X Research source This is a good cast on for stockinette and stitches and ribbed patterns."

      "content": "Know when to use the provisional cast on. This method requires you to crochet a chain first, then knit into the chain. Once you have finished your piece, you can undo the crochet chain, slip the needle back through the loops, and continue knitting downward. Here are some reasons for using the provisional cast on: You don't know how to finish the edge of your piece, and want to decide later. You don't know how long to make the piece yet, and want to add length to it later. You are making several pieces and want to attach them seamlessly. You are working with lace and want to create a mirror image."

Then, bring the tail end over the working end of the yarn so it crosses. Use the thumb and finger of your non-dominant hand to make a single loop, and poke your knitting needle through this loop. Gently tug on the yarn and yarn tail to tighten the knot."

Keep making chains until you have the same number of stitches your pattern requires, then add at least six more chains. [3] X Research source Here is how to make a crochet chain stitch: [4] X Research source Make a small circle with the yarn. The tail end should be on top of the ball end. Both ends should be facing in opposite directions. Poke the a crochet needle through the circle and catch it onto the tail end. Pull it through the circle partway so that you have a loop. Take the hook out and poke it through the loop you just made. Gently tug on the tail end and ball end of the yarn, tightening the loop. The yarn should now be on your crochet needle. Fold the ball end of the yarn over the hook and away from you. Use the hook to pull the yarn through the slipknot. This will cause the slipknot to fall off the hook. This is one chain stitch. To make another, fold the yarn over the hook, towards yourself. Use the hook to pull it through the loop so that it is on the crochet needle."

Take what's left of the tail and make a temporary slip knot — this is the end you will unravel to release your stitches."
