      "title": "Dress",
      "content": "Dress appropriately. You want to make yourself presentable. Wash and brush your hair, brush your teeth, shower and wear deodorant. Try to wear smart and professional things. One of the most important things is to not wear pants that are falling down or a shirt that shows your stomach; you and your friends may think it's cool, but showing your teacher that you make an effort to come to school is much better. In addition, always dress according to the weather, because doing so shows that you want to be safe and warm and avoid becoming sick."

      "title": "Decide what teacher you wish to be the \"pet\" to.",
      "content": "Decide what teacher you wish to be the \"pet\" to. Is it going to be your homeroom teacher, a PE teacher, an art or music teacher, the teacher of your favorite subject(s), or all of them? You might want to start with the \"nicest\" teacher, or with the subject you know the most about. If you want to become teacher's pet to multiple teachers, make sure you have time to manage all the extra effort you should put into their class. Acknowledge that classroom as your home turf; you're going to learn a lot about that subject soon, and become an expert, so you might as well feel at home in the place where it's taught."

      "title": "Act confident on the first day and ask good questions.",
      "content": "Act confident on the first day and ask good questions. Unless they are talking about their personal life, \"What's your favorite sports team?\" will not go over very well. Teachers love kids who are quiet when they speak. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Come prepared to the teacher's class.",
      "content": "Come prepared to the teacher's class. You always want to have all the homework done with a lot of effort put into it. Projects should be ready to turn in soon after being assigned, and try your best to be creative in all of your work. Also, you might want to read over a lesson before the day it will be taught; doing so will enable you to be prepared for a class discussion and impress your teacher with your knowledge of the subject."

    {
      "title": "Get involved in classroom discussions!",
      "content": "Get involved in classroom discussions! Any answer you give shows the teacher that you were listening, and any well thought question shows the teacher how you are trying to apply what they teach to real life. In a class where everyone seems asleep, raising your hand shows that you care. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Don't talk when the teacher tells you not to talk!",
      "content": "Don't talk when the teacher tells you not to talk! This one is pretty simple. Don't laugh at the class clown either because that supports him/her interrupting the class, which will encourage them to do this more. Do not speak when the teacher is speaking and don't talk back, because the teacher will get upset, causing you to maybe lose their trust."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do your homework.",
      "content": "Do your homework. If possible, go the extra step and talk to your teacher about what you can do to improve your knowledge on the subject. Talk to him/her about what you learned and how much you enjoyed their lesson (they'll love this). However, avoid talking about these things too much, as teachers can sense false sensitivity. Ask for extra credit. This shows that you want a high grade. If they say no, don't whine. Just say \"Okay, see you tomorrow!\""

      "title": "Choose your words carefully, when faced with a writing assignment.",
      "content": "Choose your words carefully, when faced with a writing assignment. Don't use slang language, as it will show them that you don't care if your writing is good or bad. Make your writing meaningful, so that after a long night of correcting, the teacher will look forward to reading yours! Avoid writing too much, though. You don't want to make that long night of correcting longer by forcing your teacher to read your Great American Novel."

      "title": "Get good grades",
      "content": "Get good grades . Study for any test that comes up. When you receive the test back, ask the teacher how to do the ones you got wrong (you might want to do this in private). You don't have to point out that this is because you want to know better for next time; there's no other reason why you'd ask, and you're not looking for a goody-two-shoes label."

      "content": "Defend your teacher. If you see or hear any other classmates insulting the teacher, stick up for him or her. You never know where your teacher has eyes or ears. Also, being a teacher's pet is a two-way relationship, and this relationship will function much better if you like the teacher in question as well."

At the end of the lesson, \"Goodbye Miss/Sir, I am sorry for (whatever wrong thing you did) I'll try not to repeat it again.\" is a good thing to say to cool down your teacher if he/she is frustrated with you."
