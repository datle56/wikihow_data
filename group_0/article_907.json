      "content": "Greet an archbishop formally by saying, “Your Excellency.” When you approach an archbishop or a bishop, it’s best to give them a formal salutation. Both “Your Excellency” and “Your Grace” are acceptable and highly respectful greetings. “Your Grace” tends to be used more in European dioceses, but it’s also acceptable for American Archbishops. [1] X Research source For example, if you wanted to show your appreciation in person, say something like, “Good Morning, Your Grace. I’m very grateful for your kindness and leadership.” Use “His Excellency” or “His Grace” if talking about, but not directly to, an archbishop."

      "title": "Greet an archbishop informally by saying “Archbishop (surname).”",
      "content": "Greet an archbishop informally by saying “Archbishop (surname).” If you’ve spoken to a particular archbishop before, have volunteered under them, or are related to them, it may be appropriate to greet them informally. Refer to the archbishop as “Archbishop (surname).” This also applies when calling out to an archbishop, trying to get his attention, or asking him a question. [2] X Research source For example, you might say, “Hello, Archbishop Anderson. It’s great to see you,” or, “Hello, Archbishop Smith. How have you been?” Avoid saying just “Archbishop” or “Bishop,” as in, “Hello, Bishop.”"

If you want to greet a cardinal who is also an archbishop in person, it’s best to say, “Your Eminence” or “Your Lordship,” in order to show respect. [3] X Research source For example, you might say, “Thank you for the sermon, Your Eminence,” or, “May I get your opinion on this passage of scripture, Your Lordship?”"
