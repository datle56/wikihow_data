      "content": "Wash the eggplant. Rinse the eggplant thoroughly in cool water, making sure to scrub away any dirt from the surface of the skin. You may want to use a vegetable scrub brush, especially if your eggplant is from a farmer's market and still has bits of soil on it."

      "content": "Slice the eggplant. Place the eggplant on its side on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to cut off the tip of the eggplant from the smaller end, taking care to remove the green cap and stem. Next, slice the eggplant according to your taste. [2] X Research source Remove the skin if you'd like to, but that's not necessary. Choose from the following common ways of slicing eggplant to prepare it for baking: Slice it in half lengthwise. This is the simplest, most straightforward method, and is a great option if you're working with small eggplants. Each half of the eggplant will account for one serving. Place the eggplant on the cutting board and carefully slice it from tip to tip. Slice it into discs. This is another popular method for preparing baked eggplant. Discs of eggplant may be baked by itself or used as the foundation for more complicated dishes, like stuffed eggplant. Place the eggplant on its side on the cutting board and use a knife to slice it into discs of equal width. Slice it into cubes. Since eggplant breaks down when it bakes, slicing it into cubes results in a softer, creamier baked dish overall. To prepare it this way, slice the eggplant into discs, then slice each disc into quarters."

      "content": "Sprinkle the sliced eggplant with kosher salt. Place the cut eggplant on a baking sheet lined with paper towels and use a liberal amount of salt on the open side of the eggplant slices. Salting helps draw out the extra water, so the baked eggplant will turn out less watery and mushy. It also prevents the eggplant from soaking up too much oil. You can skip this step if you're in a hurry, but it's worth doing if you want the texture of your eggplant to turn out perfectly."

If you'd like cheesy eggplant, remove it from the oven and sprinkle it with Parmesan, cheddar, or goat cheese. Place it back in the oven for another 5 minutes, until the cheese is melted. For another variation, try tomato garlic eggplant. Place tomato halves and garlic cloves around the eggplant slices and bake them together for 30 minutes."
