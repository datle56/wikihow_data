      "content": "Determine the number of computers you want to connect. The number of computers you're connecting will determine the type of network hardware you'll need. If you are connecting four or fewer computers, you'll just need a single router, or one switch if you don't need internet. If you're connecting more than four computers, you'll want a router and a switch, or just a switch if you don't need internet."

      "content": "Determine your network layout. If you're installing a permanent LAN solution, you'll want to keep cable length in mind. CAT5 Ethernet cables should not run longer than 250 feet. If you need to cover larger distances, you'll need switches at regular intervals, or you'll need to use CAT6 cables. You'll need one Ethernet cable for each computer you want to connect to the LAN, as well as an Ethernet cable to connect the router to the switch (if applicable)."

These pieces of hardware are the \"hub\" of your LAN, and all of your computers will be connected to them. According to Harris, the easiest way to create a LAN where every computer has access to the internet is to use a router, and then add a network switch if the router doesn't have enough ports. [1] X Expert Source Mitch Harris Consumer Technology Expert Expert Interview. 16 July 2021. A router will automatically assign an IP address to every computer that is connected to it. Switches are similar to routers but do not automatically assign IP addresses. Switches typically have many more Ethernet ports than a router has."

You can skip this if you're setting up a LAN without internet access. You don't need a router at all to create a LAN, but it makes things easier. If you just use a network switch, you'll need to manually assign IP addresses to each computer after connecting them."

You can use any open port on the switch to make the connection. When connected, the router will provide IP addresses for every computer that is connected to either device."
