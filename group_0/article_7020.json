      "title": "Choose a good profile picture.",
      "content": "Choose a good profile picture. Your profile photo is a great way to show off your physical assets and personality. Try to choose something that can best represent what kind of person you are. The same principle applies to your matches – viewing profile photos of others can say a lot. This could indicate the degree of effort they put into their profiles and perhaps how serious they are in finding a match. For more information on setting up your Tinder profile, see this guide ."

    {
      "title": "Make some matches.",
      "content": "Make some matches. You can only chat with other Tinder users that have been matched with you. In order to make matches , you will need to \"Like\" some profiles. When you start Tinder, you will be displayed the first in a list of possible matches for you in your area. Swipe to the right to \"Like\" the person, or swipe to the left to reject them. In order to be matched, both you and the other person need to \"Like\" each other's profiles."

      "title": "Open a chat.",
      "content": "Open a chat. Once you have a match, you can begin chatting with them. Open the Tinder menu and select Messages. Tap the person you want to start chatting with and you can begin composing your first message. Many people will recommend waiting at least a day before starting a chat. This will help prevent you from coming across as desperate."

      "title": "Set the mood of the conversation.",
      "content": "Set the mood of the conversation. The way you start chatting with a person is going to set the mood for the rest of the conversation. You want to pique their interest to get to know you more. Try not to come on too strong. By being too aggressive, you might just scare them off. On the other hand, try not to come on too weak, else you might just bore them. Talking about similar interests is a good start, which may springboard into more in-depth conversations. Don't open with a boring line like \"Hey\" or \"Hi\". Instead, comment on something in the other person's profile, or something from one of their pictures."

    {
      "title": "Avoid asking awkward questions.",
      "content": "Avoid asking awkward questions. Here are some basic questions to avoid with new matches or people you’ve just met: Don’t ask, “Do I look fat?” If you don’t want to hear an honest answer, don’t ask. Weight is a very sensitive issue. Hearing an answer you don’t want to hear, may just leave you offended and may start conflict that could have easily been avoided. Don’t ask questions about your match's past relationships. Asking about past hookups early on in the relationship could be misconstrued as prying. Let the person get to know you first before asking extremely personal questions. Don’t ask question about your future as a couple. Jumping the gun with a question like this may be a heavy assumption that you two will actually work together as good partners. Asking about marriage and children with someone you just met will most likely scare them away. Don’t ask questions that just feed your ego. Asking questions that put your match on the spot may be off-putting. Examples: “If I were drowning in a shark-infested ocean, would you jump in to save me?” “If you were offered $1 billion to leave me, would you take it?”"

    {
      "title": "Be natural and be yourself.",
      "content": "Be natural and be yourself. Ask questions that you think you would want to be asked. Treat the conversation as if the person was actually standing in front of you. Avoid being creepy, and try to get to know the person behind the profile. Take a look at the interests and hobbies they may have listed. This will help you determine if you share any interests. You have to be interesting. Tinder is a form of speed-dating, and boring messages will get ignored. Use the chat to express your creativity and humor, and you can set yourself apart from all the other users in your area. Reader Poll: We asked 249 wikiHow readers to tell us which personality trait they find most attractive, and 50% of them said kindness . [Take Poll] When it comes to attraction on Tinder, being genuinely nice can go a long way."

      "content": "Ask the person to meet sooner rather than later. Again, Tinder is a speed dating service. In order to make an impression, you'll need some face-to-face time. Tinder is great for initiating the contact, but you'll need to follow up on it. Say something like \"Wouldn't you rather ask these questions in person?\" or \"Come share a drink with me this weekend.\" This will help get you moving towards meeting in person."
