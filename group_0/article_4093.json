      "content": "Perform a Protestant blessing to ask for God’s protection. In the Protestant faith, the blessing may be performed by a pastor or the owner of the house themselves. If you prefer to bless the house yourself, use anointing oil (which can be cold pressed, extra virgin olive oil, blessed by a minister) to mark a cross on each of the windows and doors inside the house. As you mark the sign of the cross, utter a simple prayer asking God to bless the room. For example, \"In the name of Jesus Christ, I ask for Your peace and joy to inhabit this room,\" or \"May Your Holy Spirit flow through and fill this home up with Your Spirit.\" Recite an appropriate Bible verse, like Joshua 24:15: “But as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.” House blessings are usually performed when moving into a new residence or annually at Epiphany, a holiday commemorating the first manifestation of Jesus and his divinity.

      "content": "Follow the instructions for a lay minister in the Book of Blessings . Gather the family in front of a blessed crucifix and perform the Introductory Rites . Then, read from the sacred Scripture. After the reading, say the intercessions, which are prayers you make on behalf of your household. Offer a prayer of blessing, sprinkling holy water and blessed salt around your home before performing the concluding rite. [2] X Research source One reading that is often used is 1 Peter 2: 9-10: “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.” Your diocese may have recommended readings and prayers for home blessing ceremonies, so check with your parish priest for additional instructions. For example, this prayer might be said at the entrance of your home: “O God, protect our going out and our coming in; Let us share the hospitality of this home with all who visit us, that those who enter here may know your love and peace. Grant this through Christ our Lord.” It’s common to ask ordained priests to perform a house blessing during Epiphany."

For example, in the kitchen, say something like, “May I cook nutritious, wholesome meals for my family.” Place the candle in a central location in the house and allow it to burn down naturally. Or allow it to burn for at least an hour, then snuff it or pinch it with your fingers to put it out. Dispose of the remaining wax or the leftover candle by burying it in your garden or a potted plant. [4] X Research source Open your home’s eastern-facing windows to allow the life-giving energy of the sun to stream in, bringing energy, life, and light. Pink symbolizes love and kindness and will invite these energies into your home. A white candle symbolizes purity, divinity, and peace, so it’s also a good choice for a house blessing."
