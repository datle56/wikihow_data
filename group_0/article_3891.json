The best way to get Truffle Worms is by buying Coral Geodes from the shop in the Desolate Pocket for 600C$ per geode.

      "content": "While Weird Algae might seem like a poor choice since it lowers your lure speed by 35, this bait actually increases your universal luck by 200. That means it increases the luck for any fish you catch with it by 200, instead of just fish that prefer it. It's great for catching high-rarity fish if you're trying to fill out that bestiary. The best way to get Weird Algae is from Quality Bait Crates (which have an 11.11% chance to give Weird Algae).

That's because this bait has both preferred luck and universal luck, which means it's a great choice no matter what fish you're trying to catch. It's also the preferred bait of the elusive Squid, so make sure you bring along some Shrimp if you're going for that catch. The best way to get Shrimp is from Bait Crates (which have a 7.69% chance of giving Shrimp).

The best way to get Deep Coral is from Coral Geodes, which can be purchased for 600C$ from the shop in the Desolate Pocket. You can also fish up Coral Geodes using the Magnet Rod.

If you have the Brick Rod with the hasty enchantment and use the Rapid Catcher bait, your lure speed will be incredibly high. You should only use this with rods that have high resilience, though, since the bait lowers your rod's resilience by 15.
