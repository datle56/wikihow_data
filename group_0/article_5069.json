      "content": "Yes—but it requires rigorous exercise and a total change in lifestyle. Walking on the treadmill for an hour on an incline is a great way to start shedding calories, and ultimately, those pesky pounds. In fact, contestants on The Biggest Loser have attributed this form of cardio to the majority of their weight loss. [1] X Research source Then, you can start implementing more rigorous workout routines, like HIIT and cycling. Protein and drinking water should also be top priorities. Consuming protein can help you feel fuller longer, which immediately reduces the risk of snacking and overeating, minimizing your overall caloric intake. Additionally, digesting protein burns more calories than its macronutrient counterparts. Hydrating is important, too—during, before, and after your workouts. Drinking water can not only catalyze your metabolism, but it also helps fight hunger. Finally, allowing your body the rest it needs to instrumental in weight loss. You burn about 50 calories per hour you’re asleep and REM sleep is prime calorie burning time. So, aim to go to bed at the same time each night and to wake up at the same time each morning. Your sore muscles will thank you."

      "content": "Consider other external factors, like gender, age, and basal metabolic rate. Calories are burned via physical activity, and that includes everything from basic physiological functions like breathing to competing in a triathlon. One of the major determining factors of weight loss is identifying your basal metabolic rate, which is how many calories you burn naturally without any extra effort. This is what most people think of when referring to having a fast or slow metabolism. For men, basal metabolic rate can be calculated by multiplying their weight times 13; for women, times 11. For example, a 160-lb woman burns about 1760 calories daily, even if they’re the ultimate couch potato! You can also use an online calculator that factors in age, height, and current level of activity. [2] X Research source After doing the math, you only have to make up the difference to meet your 5000 calorie a day goal. High energy workouts, coupled with significant changes in lifestyle, can certainly render the extreme results you seek, as long as you’re prepared to sweat it out! The proof will be in the pudding— or lack thereof."

      "content": "HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training). In a HIIT session, you can expect to burn up to several hundred calories, depending on a variety of factors. One major incentive of HIIT is that it typically requires only 20-30 minutes of your time, although it definitely makes up for it in intensity! HIIT is designed to take turns testing your cardiovascular endurance while alternating with brief periods of rest. Do a light warm-up prior to beginning your circuit. Prepare to do each exercise for about 45 seconds, with 15 second intervals of rest, and repeating for 3-4 rounds. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Some calorie burning HIIT workouts include: Burpees: This full body workout will truly make you feel the burn! Engaging multiple muscle groups at once, you’ll start in a standing position. Then, bend down into a squat, and place your arms on the ground in front of you to get into a pushup position. Perform a pushup, pop right back up, and jump. Rinse and repeat until drenched in sweat! Mountain Climbers: Targeting arms, core, and quads, the name of this exercise sets high expectations, and rightfully so! Begin in a pushup position. Then, lift one knee up to your chest, followed by the other. Before you know it, you’ll have climbed a mountain—horizontally, on your living room floor. Push-Ups: This exercise is a tried-and-true method to burning calories and shedding pounds. Beginning in a plank position, simply lower yourself as close to the ground as possible and then prop yourself back up. A great way to tone up your arms, chest, and shoulders, a few rounds of pushups will have you catching your breath—during the few seconds of rest you get!"

Tasty as these treats might be, they lack any real nutritional value and result in you consuming empty calories—a no-no when striving to meet such challenging weight-loss restrictions. Instead, stick to lean meats, leafy greens, and legumes—all probably readily available in your fridge and pantry.

      "content": "Don’t drink your calories. When aiming to burn thousands upon thousands of extra calories a day, being very selective about what you’re putting in your body has to be a top concern. This would be a great opportunity to cut out sugary drinks and alcohol as they serve no real purpose other than pleasure, which is just not the current objective. A single cocktail, like a mojito or Moscow mule, can add 200-300 calories to your daily count, subtracting from the likelihood that you’ll meet your 5000-calorie goal. If the numbers aren’t reason enough, your body takes longer to process and digest alcohol, which slows down your metabolism. The next best time to have an adult beverage might be to celebrate just how far you’ve come in your weight-loss journey! [8] X Research source"

If you’re still not sold on the calorie-burning powers of the jalapeño, some studies show that people are less hungry after consuming spicy foods versus their bland, under seasoned counterparts. Like capsaicin, cinnamon has thermogenic properties that demand more energy to be processed during digestion, and therefore, more calories burned.

Although often used for weight-loss purposes, biohacking can improve your health as a whole. Some examples of biohacking include cold therapy and intermittent fasting. Cold therapy works by exposing yourself to cold temperatures, whether that means turning your AC down to 65 degrees while you sleep or actively choosing to drink particularly cold water. [12] X Research source No matter the method, our bodies will exert more energy to warm us up, which leads to more calories burned. Intermittent fasting aims to limit your eating window, allowing your body to use up its stored calories for energy during your fasting window. Don’t think of any of this as cheating—think of it as scientifically approved loopholes!"
