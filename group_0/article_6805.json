      "title": "Swap the actor and the object of the sentence.",
      "content": "Swap the actor and the object of the sentence. An active voice sentence starts with the actor as the subject—this placement emphasizes the actor and makes them the central focus of the sentence. In a passive voice sentence, on the other hand, the focus is on the object being acted upon, so it moves to the first position as the subject of the sentence. Stubbs notes that \"you can completely change things around just by what it is that you start with as your subject.\" [1] X Expert Source Diane Stubbs English Teacher Expert Interview. Tuesday, April 12, 2022. For example, \"Boys bullied other children on the school bus\" is an active sentence. The boys are doing the action of bullying other children (who are the object of their bullying). If you wanted to change the focus of the sentence to the children being bullied, you might use passive voice: \"Children on the school bus are being bullied by boys.\""

      "title": "Convert the main verb to its past participle.",
      "content": "Convert the main verb to its past participle. With regular verbs, you form the past participle by adding -ed to the end of the verb (-d if the verb already ends in \"e\"). While regular verbs tend to be the most common, there are irregular verbs with different past participle forms that you just have to memorize as you come into contact with them. [2] X Research source The main verb is changed to its past participle for passive voice regardless of the tense of the original sentence."

    {
      "title": "Add a conjugated form of the verb \"to be\" in front of the main verb.",
      "content": "Add a conjugated form of the verb \"to be\" in front of the main verb. Conjugate the verb \"to be\" to fit with the actor and match the tense of the original active sentence. This essentially means that \"to be\" is now doing the action in the sentence (with the original main verb describing what is being done to the object) [3] X Research source For example, you might say, \"The door was blasted open.\" The word \"blasted\" is the past participle of the regular verb \"blast\" while \"was\" is the singular, past tense form of the verb \"to be.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the preposition \"by\" before the active sentence's subject.",
      "content": "Add the preposition \"by\" before the active sentence's subject. This prepositional phrase tells you who performed the act described by the verb. And as with any prepositional phrase, this whole part can be completely taken out without changing the meaning of the sentence. [4] X Research source For example, if you'd received a mysterious unsigned letter, you might say, \"The letter was sent to me on November 1st.\" No need to add \"by someone I don't know\" or \"by someone who didn't sign their name.\""

    {
      "title": "Maintain the same tense as the active sentence.",
      "content": "Maintain the same tense as the active sentence. Not all sentences will be in a simple tense. You might have auxiliary verbs in the original sentence that you need to port over to your passive sentence as is. [5] X Research source If you're writing in a continuous tense, you already have a conjugated form of the verb \"to be.\" In that case, you add the word \"being\" after the conjugated form. For example, you might say, \"Wounded cats were being helped by some neighborhood children.\""

    {
      "title": "Swap the position of the object and the actor.",
      "content": "Swap the position of the object and the actor. To find the actor in a passive voice sentence, look for that prepositional phrase that begins with \"by.\" That tells you who's doing the action and needs to come up to the front and become the subject. The object just moves back to where the actor was. [6] X Research source Since passive voice sentences don't always include the \"by\" phrase with the actor, sometimes you'll have to ask yourself who's performing the action so you know what to make the subject of the sentence. For example, \"The suspects were shot on sight\" is a passive sentence without a \"by\" phrase. If it was the police who shot the suspects, your active sentence would read, \"The police shot the suspects on sight.\" If the actor is kind of generic, you can use a subject such as \"people\" or \"folks,\" unless you can narrow it down further, such as \"researchers\" or \"professionals.\""

      "title": "Convert the main verb to its correct conjugated form.",
      "content": "Convert the main verb to its correct conjugated form. In the active sentence, the main verb once again takes center stage along with the actor. Don't forget to keep it in the same tense as it was in the passive sentence. [7] X Research source For example, \"The report will be completed by my team before the deadline\" would become, \"My team will complete the report before the deadline.\" Note that the word \"will\" stays, because it's part of the future tense form of the verb \"complete.\""

      "title": "Remove the auxiliary verb and preposition.",
      "content": "Remove the auxiliary verb and preposition. Now you've got everything back in the more natural, default order for sentences in English, you can get rid of all of those extra words you needed for passive voice. After this, you should be back to the very clean and direct subject-verb-object word order. [8] X Research source For example, \"The award was given to the winner by the mayor\" becomes \"The mayor gave the award to the winner.\""

    {
      "title": "You don't know who the actor is.",
      "content": "You don't know who the actor is. Passive voice might be the only option available when something has happened but you don't know who or what caused it to happen. While you could use a subject such as \"someone\" in an active voice sentence, it might not be as clear or get the point across as well. [9] X Research source For example, if you're talking about a hit-and-run accident, you might say, \"My car was T-boned while it was parked in the lot.\" You don't know who hit your car—the important thing that you're trying to convey is that your car was hit and is damaged."

    {
      "title": "It doesn't matter who the actor is.",
      "content": "It doesn't matter who the actor is. If the actor could be anybody, passive voice might be more direct than using a word such as \"someone\" as the subject. The same logic applies when the actors are specific, known people, but their identity isn't important to what you're talking about. [10] X Research source For example, if you're talking about nuclear weapons, you might say, \"American nuclear devices were first tested in July 1945\" to place the emphasis on the testing and leave the specific researchers anonymous (even though they're likely known)."

      "title": "The sentence conveys an adage or universal truth.",
      "content": "The sentence conveys an adage or universal truth. Common sayings are often in passive voice because they're meant to apply to anyone and everyone. It's also typically the case that it doesn't matter who the actor is in these sorts of sayings—they're meant to apply in all instances. [11] X Research source For example, in the saying \"rules are made to be broken,\" it doesn't matter who makes the rules because the saying is meant to apply to all rules regardless of who makes them."

    {
      "title": "You want to be vague about who the actor is.",
      "content": "You want to be vague about who the actor is. Essentially, people switch from active voice to passive voice when they want to avoid the actor facing any responsibility. As Bonacci points out, \"most people will find a passive voice when they're reading legal material, because the idea is that you don't want to take responsibility for your actions.\" [12] X Expert Source Tristen Bonacci English Teacher Expert Interview. 21 December 2021. For example, if you said, \"I threw the ball through the window,\" that would be an active sentence because you're \"taking the action, and taking responsibility for that action,\" Bonacci continues. \"But if you said... 'the ball was thrown through the window.' Well, someone had to do it. So how did it happen?\" [13] X Expert Source Tristen Bonacci English Teacher Expert Interview. 21 December 2021. Passive voice is also common in biased news reporting that wants to emphasize the object over the actor."

      "title": "You want to emphasize or highlight the object of the sentence.",
      "content": "You want to emphasize or highlight the object of the sentence. In some situations, the object and what happened to it is legitimately more important than who the actor is, so you want that to be the focus of the sentence. Writing in active voice in this situation can detract from that. [14] X Research source For example, if you're writing about the destruction of a historic building that had fallen into disrepair, you might write, \"After all efforts to save the old chapel failed, it was demolished.\" It doesn't matter who specifically demolished the building."

      "title": "You are writing a scientific academic paper.",
      "content": "You are writing a scientific academic paper. Traditionally, academic journals favor scientific articles written in passive voice because the researcher isn't supposed to matter. The logic behind this policy is that since a proper scientific experiment can be replicated by anyone, the focus should be on what's done, not who's doing it. [15] X Research source This is changing, though. As of 2024, most academic journals accept and publish articles written in active voice as well as articles written in passive voice."
