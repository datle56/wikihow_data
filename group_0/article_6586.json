    {
      "title": "Meet with the new school’s principal and teachers.",
      "content": "Meet with the new school’s principal and teachers. If possible, hold a meeting between the school’s teachers and principal and yourself. Ask about expectations for yourself and your child, including details about homework and school involvement. [1] X Research source Take an active role in your child’s transfer process. A mid-year transfer can be stressful for everyone, including your child’s teachers, so make sure you are aware of all of the requirements involved."

    {
      "title": "Identify any curriculum differences.",
      "content": "Identify any curriculum differences. Curriculums often vary by state, or even by school district. Learn whether you or your child will be right on target with coursework, or ahead or behind. If your child’s new school has a curriculum more advanced or further behind your child’s current curriculum, work with your child’s new teachers to make sure your child is up to speed. [2] X Research source You can request coursework from your child’s new teachers, and go over this coursework with your child so they know what to expect from a new school and classroom. A tutor may be necessary for the first few months if your child’s current curriculum is behind the new curriculum. If this is the case, talk with your child about tutoring beforehand and explain why it is necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to other parents in the new school.",
      "content": "Talk to other parents in the new school. Get a feel for the school’s reputation and strengths and weaknesses by talking to parents familiar with the school’s ins and outs. Educators are likely going to focus primarily on the school’s academic habits and accomplishments, and might not be as aware of the school’s social dynamics. You can request to contact the PTA through the school office, or, if distance permits, you can go directly to the school, explain your situation, and approach some of the parents you see dropping off or picking up their children. Have questions prepared prior to talking to parents. In the particulars of introducing yourself to someone new, you might accidentally forget a few important points to touch on. You might ask how their children like the school, if they have experienced any troubles with any faculty or staff, if homework and testing are rigorous--ask questions to get a better idea of what your child should expect."

    {
      "title": "Start the transfer process early.",
      "content": "Start the transfer process early. Some schools require a lot of paperwork to be processed before a transfer is complete. Begin the transfer process as early as two months before your intended move, if possible. [3] X Research source Begin by explaining your intent with your child’s teacher or teachers. Ask them how you can help make the transition a smooth one. Visit your current school and new school’s offices (or call, if the distance is too great). Determine exactly what needs to be done prior to transferring, and how you can help it go quickly and easily."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a detailed timeline for your move.",
      "content": "Create a detailed timeline for your move. Whether you are all moving across the state, or your child is moving to another school in the same city, plan your move and every aspect of moving that might impact schooling. This might include completing homework ahead of time, finishing up a unit at your existing school to get a concrete grade to transfer, or saying goodbye to the friends and faculty at your current school. [4] X Research source Take some time to thank any teachers or faculty members who have had a significant impact on your child’s life."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gather all necessary paperwork and keep it on hand.",
      "content": "Gather all necessary paperwork and keep it on hand. Most schools will require a minimum of proof of address, transcripts, and vaccine records. Some may require report cards, letters from teachers, and evidence of a move. Find out what the new school requires early on, and gather the necessary paperwork, keeping it in an easily-accessible area. [5] X Research source A binder or file folder will be sufficient to keep all papers intact. If you have multiple children, or multiple schools, divide the paperwork accordingly, and carefully label each storage container."

    {
      "title": "Retrieve medical records.",
      "content": "Retrieve medical records. Most school districts require a record of immunizations, and many will not accept a child who is not up to date on their vaccines. These are not difficult to obtain, fortunately, and typically only require a quick call or visit to your child’s pediatrician or your family practice physician. If your child has been diagnosed with a disability of any kind, you may be required to provide additional medical information, such as medicine and dosage information, diagnosis information, etc. If your child suffers any particularly volatile illness such as epilepsy, make sure you let your child’s new school know. In such cases, it is best to give your child and the school a small card with emergency contact information."
    },
    {
      "title": "Print previous school transcripts.",
      "content": "Print previous school transcripts. To demonstrate where your child is grade-wise and curriculum-wise, you must present your child’s new school with transcripts. These can be delivered directly to the new school, or you can deliver these yourself. If possible, wait to move schools until your child has completed a semester or quarter; transcripts are much easier to provide if a grading period has ended and grades have been distributed. Although it is not impossible to create transcripts in the middle of a semester or quarter, it will require additional notes and may be an added obstacle in your child’s new school. Find out if your child’s new school requires transcripts to be sealed. Some schools require transcripts to be delivered in sealed envelopes directly from the institution they originated from. Although this is not common in elementary, middle, and high school, it can be a frustrating obstacle to encounter."

    {
      "title": "Locate “proof of address” forms.",
      "content": "Locate “proof of address” forms. Public schools usually have specific zones drawn, detailing which children attend which school. For this reason, schools will require you to not only provide your home address, but also a proof of address. [6] X Research source Utility bills are usually accepted forms of proof of address. These might be difficult to come by your first month of living in a new place, but you may be able to request a “proof of service” letter from your utility companies. If you have purchased a new home, your home deed’s title page should be enough to verify your address. To keep this important document safe, it is best to make a copy to deliver to your child’s school. Bank statements are often acceptable address proof forms, though some establishments might not be willing to accept these. Contact the school office to ensure this is an acceptable form of address proof."

    {
      "title": "Make copies of your child’s ID.",
      "content": "Make copies of your child’s ID. If your child is 16 or older, make copies of their driver license to provide to the school’s office. A younger child will not have a driver license, but most states allow children to have verified ID cards under 16. Obtaining an ID is a simple way to establish your child’s identity with the new school office. [7] X Research source Middle schools and high schools use school IDs in most areas. These will be acceptable forms of identification, if they are available."

    {
      "title": "Request copies of school transfer forms.",
      "content": "Request copies of school transfer forms. It is not uncommon for school offices to have mix-ups regarding paperwork. To be safe, request copies of all of your child’s transfer paperwork and information, and have them with you when you visit the new school for the first time. If a mishap has occurred, you will not have to postpone your child’s first day. These forms are also good to have on hand to get an idea of where your child is in their curriculum. If teachers or other faculty members have questions, you can refer them to your child’s transcripts directly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Schedule your child’s new ID.",
      "content": "Schedule your child’s new ID. If your child’s school uses student IDs, schedule your child’s ID portrait as soon as possible--preferably on or before their first day of school. IDs may be used to verify a student’s identity, to allow access to the school, or to purchase school lunches, so getting this task completed early on is a definite must."

    {
      "title": "Create an open line of communication.",
      "content": "Create an open line of communication. Your child may feel frustrated or angry at the sudden change in schools and social circles. Create an open line of communication between your child (or children) and yourself, making it clear that emotions are not off limits. Discuss how the first day at a new school may look when transferring in the middle of the year. [8] X Research source Talk about how children might react to new students, how to talk to the teachers if you need help, etc. Offer to escort your child to their new classroom or homeroom. Although many children will decline, some may need the added boost of confidence having a parent present provides."

      "title": "Gather information about extracurriculars.",
      "content": "Gather information about extracurriculars. Extracurricular activities will vary from school to school, both in terms of offerings and in terms of timing. Getting your child involved in extracurriculars they enjoy is an excellent way to help them find friends with similar interests. Acquaint yourself with elective courses, as well as after-school activities, and go over them with your child or children, helping them choose which to enroll in. Start slow. Your child may have a wide range of interests, but scheduling too many activities may overwhelm your child, particularly in the wake of a move. Start with 1-2 activities, and build from there.

      "title": "Check in with your child’s teachers and coaches.",
      "content": "Check in with your child’s teachers and coaches. Children may feel too embarrassed to mention falling behind in class, or struggling to perform in gym or sports. Keep in contact with your child’s teachers and coaches, checking in once per month to make sure everything is going well in the classroom. [10] X Research source Keep these interactions friendly. You might feel defensive if your child begins to struggle, but you need teachers and coaches to be your allies."

    {
      "title": "Keep routines intact at home.",
      "content": "Keep routines intact at home. Although your child’s school has changed, home routines don’t need to. Continue to provide breakfast and dinner at the same time, if possible, and continue any weekly traditions (think family nights, game nights, and so on) to create a sense of normalcy. [11] X Research source If you don’t currently have routines, ask your child or children what types of traditions they might like to start. This will help them have some control over their day-to-day activities and may ease some of the difficulty of moving schools. If your child moved schools due to a parent’s job change and old routines are no longer possible, try to mimic them as closely as possible. If you can no longer be there for breakfast, for instance, make breakfast before you leave for work and have it ready for your kids. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Give your child time to adjust.",
      "content": "Give your child time to adjust. Changing new schools is difficult; children must not only learn a new routine, but have to develop new friendships and acclimate to new teaching methods. It may take a couple of months for your child to be as well-adjusted as they were in their previous school. If this is the case, try not to worry too much, as your child is likely going to be just fine. [13] X Research source If you notice your child has still not been able to assimilate within a reasonable time frame (4-8 weeks), calmly discuss with your child any ways you can help make the transition easier."
