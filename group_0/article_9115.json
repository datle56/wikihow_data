Talk with your own child first to get more details about the situation, and then talk with your friend after that. Be cautious when your child says that the other person was a bully and they themselves didn't do anything. The more information you have and understand, the better informed you'll be when talking with your friend. If you were present when the friend's child bullied your kid, make sure to correct the bully immediately so they understand what they're doing is not acceptable. If you weren't present when your child was bullied by your friend's child, try to get more specific details about what the bullying child was doing, and what your child was doing at the time. Avoid overreacting if your child says something like, \"I don't like hanging out at their house. He's mean. He keeps bullying me.\" You need to get the specifics of what this means. Keep in mind that it might be possible for your child to handle this on their own depending on their age and on the situation."
