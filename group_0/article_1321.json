I like how you make me laugh.\" When you compliment your partner's appearance, don't talk about body parts, like the size of their \"assets.\" Instead, say, \"You look beautiful in that dress.\" or \"You look handsome in that suit.\" Compliment the style choices they make. Avoid using crude words at all times. No slang for body parts. It's not funny, and it's not complimentary."
