If you used hydrogen peroxide, you may hear a fizzing or popping sound. Don't worry, this is totally normal! If you can, you might want to ask another person to do this step for you. It'll be easier for him or her to make sure the solution is actually getting into your ear."

Gently squirt lukewarm water (at body temperature—98.6°F (37°C) into your ear canal. For very stubborn wax or for people with very small ear canals, an enema bottle filled with clean, warm water may work better than a bulb syringe. Pull on the earlobe out and up to open up the ear canal. Do this over the sink, tub, or other container: it's a messy operation, and you may flush chunks of earwax out."
