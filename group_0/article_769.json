But if you want the person opening the document to be able to click particular text to open a website, document, or other location in the same file, you have two options: [1] X Research source The first option is to type the full URL of the site or document you want to link to (e.g., https://www.wikihow.com). If you do this, the link will automatically turn into a hyperlink in the majority of PDF readers , which means that the person opening the document will be able to click the link to go to that website or document. This option doesn't require you to have Adobe Acrobat Pro—the link will just work. The second option is to type custom text (instead of the URL) that you can later convert to a hyperlink in Adobe Acrobat Pro . You'll want to choose this option if you'd rather the user click text that says something other than the URL, such as \"Click here.\""
