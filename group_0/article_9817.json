      "title": "Choose fresh or frozen tuna steaks.",
      "content": "Choose fresh or frozen tuna steaks. Ahi tuna is sold in form of large steaks or fillets that can be cooked in a similar fashion to beef steaks. Look for deep red tuna steaks with firm flesh. Avoid steaks that have a rainbow sheen or look dry, also avoid buying fish that looks mottled or pale in color. Buy a six-ounce steak per serving you need. If you're using frozen tuna steak, thaw it completely and put in the refrigerator before using. Fresh tuna is in season from late spring to early fall. If you're choosing fresh tuna, it's best to get it while it's in season. Frozen tuna is available all year round. Ahi or yellowfin tuna from the United States or Canada is the best choice, since it has relatively low levels of mercury and is not in danger of being overfished. Bluefin tuna should be avoided, as the mercury levels are higher and it is being over-fished across the world.

      "title": "Make a spice mixture for the tuna.",
      "content": "Make a spice mixture for the tuna. Seared tuna is frequently coated with spices that complement the tuna's meaty flavour. You can use a steak rub or any other type of spice mix that includes ingredients like garlic powder, pepper and dried herbs. Try making your own spice mix by combining the following ingredients in a bowl (makes enough to coat one six-ounce steak): 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon dried basil 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano If you don't want to mix different spices, you can just use salt and black pepper. Other kinds of pepper might also work, but the black pepper is the most common, and it gives tuna a great flavor."

      "title": "Heat your skillet or grill.",
      "content": "Heat your skillet or grill. Tuna steaks and fillets are easy to sear on either a grill or stove top. The key is to fully heat the cooking implement you're using before adding the tuna. This will ensure that the tuna cooks evenly and attains a good crunchy sear. If you're using the stove top, heat a cast iron skillet or other heavy skillet over medium high heat. Add a tablespoon of peanut oil or canola oil and heat it until the oil just begins to smoke. [2] X Research source If you're using a grill, light the charcoal at least half an hour before you plan to cook the tuna. that way it will have plenty of time to get nice and hot before you add the tuna."

      "title": "Coat the tuna with your spice mixture.",
      "content": "Coat the tuna with your spice mixture. Each six-ounce steak or fillet will need approximately one to two tablespoons of seasoning. Pat the seasoning into the tuna on all sides so that it's completely coated. After you've coated the steak, allow it to sit out and come to room temperature before you place it on the grill or skillet."

    {
      "title": "Sear the tuna on both sides.",
      "content": "Sear the tuna on both sides. Tuna steaks are normally served rare, since the texture of rare tuna is more appealing than the texture of a fully-cooked piece of tuna, which tends to be on the dry side. To achieve a sear on the outside and keep it rare inside, place the tuna on the skillet or grill and let it sear for two minutes on the first side. Flip the tuna and let it cook for another two minutes, then remove it from the heat. Watch the tuna as it cooks to make sure you don't overcook it. You'll be able to see the heat cooking the tuna from the bottom up. If two minutes seems like too much time on one side, flip the tuna sooner. If you'd prefer to make sure the tuna gets fully cooked, leave it on the heat for extra time."

      "content": "Grease a baking dish. Choose a glass or ceramic dish that's just a little bigger than the size of the tuna steaks or fillets you're baking. Use olive oil to grease the bottom and sides of the dish so the fish doesn't stick."

    {
      "title": "Butter and season the tuna.",
      "content": "Butter and season the tuna. Rub each steak or fillet with a teaspoon of either melted butter or olive oil, then season with salt, pepper, and the dried herbs of your choice. The tuna itself will be the star of the show, so keep the seasoning light and complementary. A squeeze of lemon juice complements the flavor of the tuna well if you want to add a little extra flavor. You could also season the tuna with classic pairings like soy sauce, wasabi and ginger slices."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bake the tuna.",
      "content": "Bake the tuna. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake until the skin is no longer pink and flakes when poked with a fork, about 10 to 12 minutes. The actual cooking time will depend upon on how thick your steaks are. After 10 minutes, check the steaks to see if they need more time. Err on the side of undercooking the tuna, since overcooked tuna tends to be dry and take on a fishier taste. If you want the baked tuna to be seared on top, turn on the broiler and broil the top for the last two to three minutes of cooking."

      "content": "Select sushi-grade tuna. Tuna tartare is a dish made with raw ahi tuna. It's a light, refreshing dish that doesn't actually require cooking, but it's one of the most popular ways to prepare the fish. It's important to get sushi-grade tuna if you're using this preparation method, since you won't be cooking the fish to kill parasites and bacteria. To make four servings of tuna tartare, you need one pound of tuna. Either steaks or fillets will do. This dish is best with fresh tuna, rather than tuna that has been previously frozen."

      "content": "Toss the tuna cubes with the sauce. Mix them together thoroughly so the tuna is completely coated. Serve the tuna tartare right away on crackers or potato chips. If you don't serve the tuna right away, the lemon juice in the sauce will begin to react with the tuna and change its texture. If you wish to prepare the tuna tartare in advance, keep the sauce and tuna separate until just before serving."
