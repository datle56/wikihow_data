      "content": "Understand basic anatomy. You have 12 sets of ribs that function to protect your internal organs and allow numerous muscles to attach to for movement and breathing. The ribs attach to the 12 thoracic vertebrae of the spine in the back and most converge and connect to the breastbone (sternum) in the front. A few \"floating\" ribs at the bottom protect the kidneys and don't connect to the breastbone. Your uppermost ribs are located at the base of your neck (underneath your collarbones), whereas the bottom one resides a few inches above your hip bones. [2] X Research source Ribs are usually easily detected under the skin, particularly in thinner people. The most commonly fractured ribs are the middle ones (ribs four through nine). [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source They typically break at the point of impact or where the curve is the greatest, which is their weakest and most vulnerable area. Rib fractures are much less common in kids because their ribs are more springy (more cartilage and less bone compared to an adult) and require considerable force to break. A significant risk factor for rib fractures is osteoporosis, a condition common in people over 50 and characterized by brittle bones from loss of minerals."

      "title": "Look for a swollen deformity.",
      "content": "Look for a swollen deformity. With the shirt removed, look and feel around the area of the torso where the pain is coming from. With a small hairline rib fracture, you won't see a deformity but should be able to pinpoint the tenderness and maybe notice some swelling — particularly if there was blunt trauma to the area. With more serious rib fractures (multiple breaks in multiple ribs or ribs that have separated from the rest of the wall), a flail chest may occur. Flail chest is a term that describes when the broken chest wall moves in a way that is opposite to the rest of the chest during breathing. Therefore, the chest wall in the area of concern will be sucked in when the person takes a breath and the chest expands and will be pushed out when the person exhales and the chest contracts. [4] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source More serious rib fractures tend to be very painful, create more swelling (inflammation) and bruise quickly due to broken blood vessels. A flail chest is sometimes easier to see when the injured person is lying on his back with his shirt off. The condition will be easily spotted while watching a patient breathe, and especially when listening to his lungs. Healthy ribs are usually fairly springy when you put pressure on them. However, broken ribs feel unstable and can be depressed with pressure, which generates severe pain."

      "title": "See if pain increases with deep breaths.",
      "content": "See if pain increases with deep breaths. Another common sign of broken ribs, even small stress fractures, is increased tenderness or pain with deep breathing. [5] X Expert Source Kevin Stone, MD Board Certified Orthopaedic Surgeon Expert Interview. 19 November 2020. The ribs move with every breath, so inhaling deeply causes pain. With serious rib fractures, even shallow breathing may be very difficult and extremely painful. Consequently, people with significant rib fractures tend to take more rapid and shallow breaths, which can lead to hyperventilation and eventual cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to lack of oxygen).

      "title": "Check for reduced motion.",
      "content": "Check for reduced motion. Another sign indicative of a rib fracture is reduced range of motion in the torso, especially rotational side-to-side movements. [7] X Research source People with broken ribs are either unable or very hesitant to twist, bend or laterally flex their upper body. The broken rib and related muscle spasm may prevent the movements, or the pain may be severe enough to act as a deterrent to any movement. Again, less serious stress (hairline) fractures hamper movement to a lesser extent compared to more injurious fractures. Ribs that break at the cartilage junction where they attach to the breastbone can be particularly painful, especially with rotational movements of the upper body. Even with small stress fractures, the combination of reduced mobility, impaired ability to breathe, and relative tenderness significantly limits a person's ability to exercise and be active — sports are virtually out of the question until the injury heals."

      "content": "See your family physician. If you or a significant other has experienced some form of trauma that has caused lingering pain somewhere in your torso, then seeing a doctor for a thorough physical examination and assessment is the best strategy. Even if the pain is relatively mild, seeing a healthcare professional is a good idea."

      "content": "Know when to get emergency care. It is essential to get immediate medical attention if you have complications that indicate something life-threatening, such as a pneumothorax. Signs and symptoms of a punctured lung include severe breathing difficulty, sharp or stabbing chest pain (in addition to the pain related to the fracture) cyanosis, and extreme anxiety that goes along with the sensation of breathlessness. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A pneumothorax occurs when air becomes trapped between the chest wall and the lung tissue. This can be caused by a broken rib tearing into the lung tissue. Other organs that can be punctured or lacerated by fractured ribs include the kidneys, spleen, liver, and heart (rarely). [9] X Research source If you have any of the above symptoms, go to the nearest emergency room or contact emergency services."

      "title": "Get a chest x-ray.",
      "content": "Get a chest x-ray. Along with a physical assessment, x-rays can visualize bone and are effective for diagnosing the presence and severity of most rib fractures. However, stress or hairline fractures (sometimes referred to as \"cracked\" ribs) are difficult to visualize on x-rays due to their small size. [10] X Research source As such, another series of chest x-rays may have to be taken after the swelling subsides (about a week or so). Chest x-rays are also useful in diagnosing a collapsed lung because fluid and air can be visualized on x-ray film. X-rays can also detect bruised bones, which can be mistaken for broken bones. If the doctor has a good idea where the fracture is, a more focal x-ray of the injured rib can be taken to get a more magnified view."

      "title": "Get a CT scan.",
      "content": "Get a CT scan. Hairline fractures of the rib are not serious injuries and typically just require short-term use of painkillers or anti-inflammatories while they heal on their own. CT scans can often uncover rib fractures that regular radiographs (x-rays) miss and injuries to organs and blood vessels are also easier to see. [11] X Research source CT technology takes a variety of x-rays from numerous angles and combines them via computer technology to depict cross-sectional slices of your body. CT scans are significantly more expensive than regular plain-film x-rays, so it's worth checking with your health insurance to see if they are covered."

      "title": "Get a bone scan.",
      "content": "Get a bone scan. A bone scan involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material (radiotracer) into a vein, which then travels through the blood and into your bones and organs. [12] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source As the radiotracer wears off, it gives off a little bit of radiation, which can be picked up by a special camera that slowly scans your body. Since fractures show brighter on a bone scan, it's a good tool to see even small stress or hairline fractures — even new breaks that are still inflamed. [13] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Bone scans are effective for visualizing small stress fractures, but because these are not clinically significant, the potential side effects related to the procedure may not be justified. The main side effects are related to allergic reactions to the radioactive material (radiotracer) that's injected during a bone scan procedure."
