      "content": "Feed a bite of rope through one of the slots in the belay device. Once the climber is tied in, the belayer must set up their belay device. A common type of belay device is an ATC, which features two slots for feeding through a bite of rope, and a wire keeper. Make a small bite (not a twist or full loop) in the opposite end of the rope from the one that is attached to the climber’s harness. Make sure the top of the rope bite emerges on the same side as the wire keeper."

      "content": "Attach the rope and belay device to your harness. Hook a locking carabiner through both the rope and the wire keeper, and attach it to the belay loop on your harness. Lock the carabiner securely. If you have a horizontally oriented belay loop, make sure the rope is oriented so that the tail end is in your dominant hand. If you are using a Grigri instead of an ATC, the setup concept is similar. Open the device and feed a bite of rope in such that the climber side comes out the top of the device and the brake side is facing down. The tail end of the rope is the “brake strand,” which is the part of the rope that you will need to control in order to arrest falls and manipulate the amount of tension in the climbing rope.

      "content": "Sign up for a PBUS belay class. It is important to get professional instruction before you begin to belay. Most gyms that have indoor climbing walls offer belaying instructions, and may require you to get a certification or pass a test before you can use their equipment on your own. Most belay classes will teach you the PBUS (Pull, Brake, Under, Slide) method. [2] X Research source PBUS is a basic belaying technique that allows you to safely and steadily control the slack in the rope as your partner ascends. The PBUS technique involves using short, controlled, repetitive movements."

      "title": "Practice the pull.",
      "content": "Practice the pull. The first part of the PBUS method is the “Pull.” As the climber moves up, slowly pull down on the guide strand of your rope to take in the slack. The guide strand is the part of the rope that attaches to the climber and runs upward in a top rope setup. At the same time, pull up on the brake strand (the tail end of the rope) in order to feed the excess rope through the belay device. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Put your rope in brake position.",
      "content": "Put your rope in brake position. The B in PBUS stands for “Brake.” Once you’ve removed enough slack from the climber’s rope, pull down on the brake strand to hold the rope in place. Braking is one of the most important parts of belaying, since you will need to be able to brake quickly in case of falls. Make sure you always have at least one hand on the brake strand at all times.

      "content": "Put your guide hand under your brake hand. This is the “Under” part of the PBUS technique. Holding the brake strand in brake position, remove your hand from the guide strand and place it underneath your brake hand on the brake strand. This motion begins the process of repositioning your hands so that you have full control of the brake strand after a pull and brake. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Slide your brake hand back up the brake line. The S in PBUS is for “Slide.” During the pull and brake parts of the PBUS maneuver, your brake hand will move away from the belay device, and will need to be moved back into place. Once you’ve put your guide hand under the brake hand, slide your brake hand up the brake line until it is about 3 inches (8 cm) from the belay device. Put your other hand back on the guide strand.

While belaying, you must keep your dominant hand on the brake strand (the “tail” end of the rope emerging from the belay device) at all times. Your other hand should be either on the guide strand (the part of the rope that leads up to the climber) or on the brake strand, depending where you are in the belaying process. Keeping both hands in place will allow you to maintain control of the rope and quickly pull it taut in case of a fall. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Brake if the climber falls or needs to stop. Being able to do a strong brake is vital to safe belaying. If the climber starts to fall, reaches the top of the climb, or needs a moment to rest, pull the brake strand straight down while holding it directly in front of your body. [9] X Research source For an extra stable brake, use both hands. You can also add some extra tension by using your body weight in addition to your brake hand. Keeping your brake hand in place, use your other hand to wrap the brake strand around your hip and just under your butt."

      "content": "Communicate with the climber using calls. Being able to communicate with your climbing partner is vitally important during belaying. Before you begin a climb, work out a system and make sure that you both understand what the different calls mean. There are a variety of standard communication systems, but the most important thing is to pick a system that works for both you and your partner. Examples of common calls include: [12] X Trustworthy Source Princeton University Leading academic institution devoted to expanding and sharing knowledge Go to source “Ready to climb,” or “On belay?” when the climber is checking in with the belayer before starting to climb. The belayer may respond with “On belay,” or “Belay on.” “Climb ready,” or “Climbing,” when the climber begins to climb. The belayer may respond with “Climb,” or “Climb on.” Other climbing calls include “Slack” (when the climber needs more slack), “Up rope” or “Take” (when the climber needs less slack), “That’s me” (once enough excess slack has been taken in), “Falling!” (if the climber is falling or beginning to fall), and “Safe” or “Belay off” for once the climber has reached their destination at the top of the climb safely."

      "content": "Begin belaying in top-rope situations for greater safety. Top-rope climbing, or top-roping, is a method in which the rope is attached to a pre-set anchor at the top of the climb. Top-roping offers greater stability and a lower risk of serious falls than lead climbing. The anchor at the top of the climb will help keep the rope taut with less effort required from the belayer. Top-roping is the best technique to use when you are learning how to belay. [13] X Research source"

Make sure the harness has a waist belt, tie-in point, belay loop, and buckles. Some harnesses use the same point for tie-in and the belay loop. You can purchase climbing gear at most stores that sell outdoor recreational equipment. You may be able to rent harnesses and other equipment for indoor climbing at your gym. Many universities that offer outdoor recreational programs will allow students, faculty, staff, or alumni to rent climbing equipment."

Your legs go through the leg loops, with the pair of elastic straps (called risers) that attach the loops to the belt facing the back. Pull the waist belt up over your hips, with the tie-in point and belay loop facing the front. Use the buckles on the waist band and leg loops to adjust the harness so that it fits comfortably. Check that your harness is \"double backed\" when you tighten it, meaning the strap you use to tighten the harness runs back through the buckle again. In most modern harnesses, they are set up as double backed by default, and you'd have to pull the strap out errantly to accidentally undo it."

Since the carabiner is the only thing keeping the rope and belay device attached to your harness, it will need to be strong and sturdy. Climbing carabiners are available at stores that sell outdoor recreation equipment. Make sure the carabiner is never cross loaded (meaning it would be oriented so that the minor axis with the gate is against your belay loop or belay device). Carabiners are strongest along their major (long) axis and can break when cross-loaded if exposed to significant force."
