      "content": "Tuck your pads or tampons in a small bag before school. When you need to change, carry the bag or case to the bathroom with you and take it into the stall. That way, you’ll have total privacy when you take out your tampon or pad! [1] X Research source If you can’t have the bag or case with you in class, keep it in your locker or put it in your backpack. You can grab it on your way to the bathroom. You might also be able to tuck a small tampon or pad into a large wallet, a change purse, or your phone case. Some schools have strict rules about what kind of bags or containers you can carry with you during school hours. Check the school manual or talk to the nurse if you’re not sure what’s allowed."

      "title": "Pants or a hoodie with deep pockets are good options.",
      "content": "Pants or a hoodie with deep pockets are good options. Choose something with large or loose pockets if you’re worried about people seeing the outline of your period products. Put a pad or tampon in your pocket before you start the school day, or slip one in from your backpack or locker between classes. If you wear a school uniform that doesn’t have good pockets, find out if you can wear a jacket with pockets over it. Even if it’s too warm to wear it all day, you can just put it on when you need to go to the bathroom. A jacket with zippered pockets or inner pockets is ideal for stashing things away."

      "content": "These are good alternatives if pockets aren’t an option. Before hitting the bathroom, palm a pad or tampon from your backpack or locker and tuck it away somewhere in your outfit. Slip it under the waistband of your pants or skirt and hide it under your shirt, slide it between your boot and your ankle, or put it under a bra strap. [2] X Research source If you have long sleeves, you can tuck a pad or tampon under the cuff or roll it up inside your sleeve."

      "content": "Roll up a thin pad or hide a compact tampon in your fist. If you have nowhere else to hide your products, your hand might work. Pretend you’re fishing in your bag or locker for something else, like a tube of lip balm, and discreetly grab your tampon or pad. If you use pads, this will work best with thinner ones that you can fold, roll, or bunch up into a ball."

      "content": "Do this to avoid drawing attention in the middle of class. If you don’t have enough time between classes, try hitting the restroom at lunchtime. You can also do it when you have to change before or after gym class. [3] X Research source When you’re moving between classes, you can carry your backpack or purse with you. Bring your bag with you into the bathroom so you can take out your period supplies in total privacy! If you’re worried that you won’t have enough time to change between classes, talk to the school nurse or a teacher you trust. Chances are they’ll be happy to help you or give you some advice."

Disposable baggies that you can put pads or tampons in before throwing them away. Wet wipes to help you freshen up whenever you change. Painkillers, like ibuprofen (Motrin/Advil) or naproxen (Aleve), in case you get cramps. Check with the school nurse first if you’re not sure whether you’re allowed to bring medications to school."

Most cups can stay in for 12 hours, so you’ll be set for the whole school day!

If your cup does leak, you’ll need to remove it and rinse it before putting it back. Cups can be a little tricky to use at first, and you’ll need to find one that fits. It might take some practice to get good at putting it in and removing it. If the cup isn’t right for you, there are other alternatives that might work. For instance, you can get period panties or even period boxers to keep you fresh on light flow days. [6] X Research source"
