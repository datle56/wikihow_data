      "content": "Use your moon sign to better understand your emotions. Your moon sign provides insight into your inner world, including your conscious and subconscious emotions. Your moon sign is passive and reflects your emotions; your sun sign is active and influences how you react to your emotions. [4] X Research source Your moon sign can shed light on your emotional personality and how you interact with others. For example, Leo moons are warm, friendly, and care a lot about how others perceive them. On the other hand, Scorpio moons are intensely private, stand-offish, and don't need validation from others. You can learn more about how you approach conflict when emotions are running high. For example, an Aries moon can be confrontational in the heat of the moment. A Libra moon avoids conflict at all costs and tends to repress negative emotions. Moon signs can help you better understand how you view and treat yourself. For example, Virgo moons struggle with perfectionism and extreme self-criticism."
