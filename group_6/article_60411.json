      "title": "Talk with your doctor.",
      "content": "Talk with your doctor. If you suspect an issue with your pituitary gland, your doctor's office should be your first stop. You can go to see your primary care physician first or go directly to an endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in the endocrine (hormone-producing) system. The doctor will likely start by measuring your gland output with a blood test. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source After the initial consultation, the doctor may suggest more in-depth diagnostic tests, such as a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI)."

      "content": "Treat any underlying diseases. It's possible that your pituitary gland is malfunctioning as part of a larger illness. Your doctor will likely consider this possibility during their examination. Cushing's Disease, for example, is triggered by a tumor growth on the gland. The tumor then causes the gland's output to be off, and it is almost impossible to correct without doctor-led treatment. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Do hormone replacement therapy.",
      "content": "Do hormone replacement therapy. Because the pituitary gland regulates the creation of hormones across all of your endocrine glands, your doctor will first need to determine which hormone levels are off. Then, they will prescribe a medication to treat that particular hormonal imbalance. The medication may be in pill, liquid, shot, patch, or gel form. For example, thyroxine is the one-a-day tablet most likely prescribed for a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) imbalance.

      "title": "Agree to a tumor removal.",
      "content": "Agree to a tumor removal. If your doctor believes there is a tumor located on or near your pituitary gland, then they will start with scans and blood tests to verify their diagnosis. They will work with an endocrinologist, and maybe an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) to determine a surgery plan. Then, a surgeon will make a small incision in your nose to remove the tumor. If the surgery is successful, your gland should fully recover. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support Go to source Most pituitary tumors are not life-threatening if treated promptly. But, they can disrupt your system by applying pressure to the gland or emitting hormones themselves."

      "title": "Consent to radiotherapy.",
      "content": "Consent to radiotherapy. To clean up any tumor remains post-surgery or if surgery is not an option for a pituitary tumor, your doctor may suggest a course of treatment with directed radiation, also called radiotherapy. The idea is that the radiation beams will break down the tumor over time. After your treatment is completed you will likely need hormone replacement therapy. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Consent to regular monitoring appointments.",
      "content": "Consent to regular monitoring appointments. With or without surgery and regardless of whether you have a tumor, your doctor will likely want to monitor your blood test results every few months post-diagnosis. They may also order additional tests, such as x-rays or eye exams. Being committed to keeping these appointments can significantly improve your odds of successful treatment. Regular monitoring is even more important if you have a pituitary condition and are planning a pregnancy."

      "title": "Avoid unproven medical suggestions or treatments.",
      "content": "Avoid unproven medical suggestions or treatments. If you are looking for ways to alter the functioning of your pituitary gland, you'll likely run into a bunch of pseudo-science information. Before you put time and effort into making any changes, verify that the information you are reading or following is coming from recognized medical studies, not just personal opinions. For example, some people may claim that they have discovered how to “decalcify” a pituitary gland even though it has not been medically proven."

      "title": "Take no action at all.",
      "content": "Take no action at all. Remember that it is not always a good idea to try to alter your current hormonal balance. So, stimulating your pituitary gland can actually be a misconception if taken literally. You want your pituitary gland to secrete precisely the right amount of various hormones, no more and no less. Make sure to talk with your doctor before following any hormonal adjustment plan, no matter how minor. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Reduce sugar consumption.",
      "content": "Reduce sugar consumption. To balance out your gland, cut sugary foods out of your diet. Go with fresh, natural produce instead of processed food items. Read labels carefully and look for hidden sugars with unusual names, such as corn fructose. The pituitary gland regulates the production of human growth hormone (HGH). Too much sugar and refined carbs raise insulin levels enough to impair the production of HGH and cause inflammation in the nervous system. [8] X Research source Watch out for foods with high hidden sugar levels, such as yogurts, cereals, granola bars, and flavored drinks. Look for ways to make healthy flavor substitutions. For example, instead of drinking soda, go with water with a slice of lemon."

      "content": "Boost your protein intake, if needed. Your protein intake should account for 10-35% of your total calories for the day. Calculate your intake and determine whether or not you need to eat more lean beef, nuts, eggs, and fish. Your body will likely break that steak dinner up into amino acids, which your pituitary gland can then use as fuel for hormone production. As with any suggested dietary changes, make sure to run them by your doctor before starting.

      "content": "Don't eat large meals before bed. Your pituitary gland kicks into high gear while you are asleep and releases high amounts of useful hormones. Avoiding heavy meals, especially those with lots of carbs, two hours before bedtime can keep your insulin levels steady. Following these suggestions will let your gland concentrate on doing its work. Small snacks before bed may help balance some people's hormones. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "content": "Get more vitamin D, E, and A. You can buy a quality multivitamin that contains all of these vitamins and more. But, the better route is to incorporate more vitamin-rich foods into your diet, such as salmon or bell peppers. All of these vitamins help to stimulate hormone production by eliminating free radicals and harmful chemicals from your glands. To get vitamin D, eat foods like tuna and wheat cereals. To get vitamin E, eat foods like spinach and almonds. To get vitamin A, each foods like carrots and leafy greens."

      "content": "Get more manganese. Foods like legumes and leafy greens provide instant manganese that your body can use. Some of these minerals go to your bones, but your pituitary gland stores some as well. Eating foods rich in manganese can keep your pituitary gland at capacity and provide it with important antioxidant benefits. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Try out herbs. Milk thistle or sagebrush can be mixed into teas or other drinks. Ginseng and alfalfa have also been mentioned in connection with pituitary gland improvements. Although there is no scientific evidence to support this. You may be able to take these supplements in pill form. Check with your doctor before starting an herb regimen, especially if you are taking any prescription medications."

      "title": "Get the recommended amount of sleep per night.",
      "content": "Get the recommended amount of sleep per night. Because your pituitary gland peaks in its production of hormones at night, it's important to give it plenty of time to work. Avoid consuming caffeine late in the day or looking at any blue screens, like phones, right before bed. Adults 18-60 are recommended to sleep for 7 or more hours per night. Children, teens, and older adults require more sleep. [13] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Getting enough sleep can also lower your cortisol levels, which helps your gland to function better."

      "content": "Exercise at least three times a week. Getting your heart rate up helps your body to function more efficiently and balance out the production of hormones. It's not necessary to engage in high-intensity exercise, just raising your heart rate for 30 minutes, three times a week can have positive benefits. So, take the stairs instead of the elevator when you can. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"
