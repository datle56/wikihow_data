      "content": "Upright Upright Temperance means you’re likely to find success in your work and career path, but that success may take time to manifest! Temperance is the card of patience and moderation, signifying that you’ll need both to achieve your career goals. Remain steady and motivated; your dedication and calm focus will help you be noticed by your coworkers and superiors, no matter what you choose to do.

      "content": "Reversed When Reversed Temperance comes up in a work or career tarot spread, it means something in your work life may be out of balance. For example, you might be working longer hours than you’re supposed to and sleeping less (which lets you get more done but impacts the quality of your work). Temperance may also signify that you’re rushing through your work or making reckless career choices without really thinking them through—and, as a result, your work life may be negatively affected. [6] X Research source Tip: Consider which areas of your work may be imbalanced at the moment, whether it’s working longer hours, overextending on projects, or, on the other hand, not working enough and letting coworkers pick up your slack. Once you can recognize where your work life may be suffering, it’s easier to devise a plan to correct those imbalances!"

      "content": "Upright Upright Temperance is a reminder that your approach to managing finances requires moderation and balance—and it serves as reassurance that you’re on the right track. You’re allowed to indulge yourself sometimes, so long as you continue to be proactive about saving up your money. Temperance advocates building resources (and financial stability) over time with careful, patient saving. [7] X Research source Tip: Start keeping track of your income and spending if you don’t already. Keep a monthly budget to know exactly what you can afford to spend and what you need to save; this will help you save money in the long run!"

      "content": "Reversed Where Upright Temperance suggests you manage your finances in a balanced way, Reversed Temperance is a sign that there may be an imbalance—whether you spend money a little too freely and have trouble saving it or you’re so frugal that you never spend any extra money as a treat, even to reward yourself for all the hard work you do. Both are imbalances, and Temperance encourages you to correct them. [8] X Research source Tip: Reflect on your financial goals. What do you need to do to achieve them? Make a plan to achieve those long-term goals , taking your present and future well-being into consideration as well. For example, if you overspend without considering your future well-being, you may find yourself in a tight spot financially later on. Conversely, if you never splurge (even when you have enough money to do so comfortably), you may miss out on some fun in the present!"

Do you have any unhealthy or unhelpful habits that you’ve been meaning to change? Seeing Upright Temperance in a tarot spread indicates that now is the time to make those changes. Temperance may also be a sign that any health issues you’re experiencing may stem from a lack of balance in life. [9] X Research source Tip: Reflect on your life, particularly on areas where you may be overextending yourself (and, consequently, neglecting other areas). According to Temperance, bringing balance to your life may give you the healing you need."

      "content": "Reversed Reversed Temperance is very similar to its Upright counterpart. However, where Upright Temperance indicates that now is the time to change any unhealthy habits you may have, Reversed Temperance is a more insistent warning that some areas of your life are out of balance (and affecting your health). Therefore, seeing Temperance means it’s time to connect to your feelings, figure out what issues in your life are causing unhealthy habits, and work on resolving them to restore balance. [10] X Research source Tip: Temperance Reversed can also be a sign of unhealthy excesses, so try to be especially mindful of what you eat, drink, and put in your body. Focus on maintaining a balanced, healthy diet !"

      "content": "Upright Spiritually, Upright Temperance is a sign that your spirit guides are with you, and now is the time to listen to your inner guidance. Your inner guidance is your intuition; it’s a gut feeling, an unconscious nudge from within, or something you just feel in your heart without knowing exactly why. Therefore, Temperance advocates following your intuition. It also means that you’re finding the right balance in life between your mind, body, and spirit. [11] X Research source Tip: Temperance is also a gentle reminder to be patient as you find your spiritual path in life. Rather than getting impatient, remind yourself that everything happens at its own pace. Spirit guides are believed to be beings that are connected to you in order to help you navigate life; they can be angels, ancestors, spirit animals, and more."

      "content": "Reversed Reversed Temperance is a sign that you may currently be spiritually imbalanced. This is thought to happen when you lose your connection to your inner guidance or your spirit guides—or when you have an imbalance between your mind, body, and soul. Reversed Temperance encourages you to find that balance within yourself again, either on your own or with the help of a spiritual guide. [12] X Research source Tip: Meditation may help bring you back into balance. Make time for it in your weekly schedule, and focus on mindful meditation techniques to find inner peace."

      "content": "In a Yes/No tarot reading, Temperance means “Yes, but use caution.” Temperance represents balance and moderation, but it can also be an encouraging sign when you wish to take action on something. If you see Temperance while doing a Yes/No tarot spread, it’s likely telling you that you should do whatever it is that you’re considering so long as you proceed with caution and ensure you’re ready first—because rushing and taking blind risks can easily backfire."

      "title": "Temperance depicts an angel with one foot in water and one on land.",
      "content": "Temperance depicts an angel with one foot in water and one on land. This is deliberate: the angel’s foot in the water represents the subconscious, while the foot on land represents the material world. The angel’s robe features a square with a triangle inside, which represents humanity (the triangle) being bound to the earth and natural law (the square). The angel is pouring water between two cups, symbolizing the flow of life. [13] X Research source The winged angel’s cups and the water flowing between them also represent the conscious and subconscious minds and their connection. The angel’s feet also symbolize the need to stay grounded (with one foot on land) and the need to be in flow (with one foot in the water). The angel’s gender appears somewhat ambiguous, capturing the idea of balance between sexes. The card’s background depicts a winding path up into mountains, representing your journey through life. The golden crown hovering above the mountains reflects the importance of staying true to your life’s purpose."
