Although the idea of being friends may seem appealing, staying in contact will likely prolong your feelings and can compromise your emotional well-being. [1] X Research source Let her know that you will be blocking or removing them from your phone and any social media. You could say you’re doing this because you want to create distance between her and don't want to keep reading her posts. [2] X Expert Source Luis Congdon Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 3 September 2021. If you live close to each other, try to avoid being in the same place as much as possible. For example, if you know she likes to grocery shop on Saturday, plan to do your shopping on Sunday. [3] X Expert Source Luis Congdon Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 3 September 2021. If you have mutual friends, ask your friends to plan time to hang out with you separately until your feelings for her have subsided."

      "content": "This is a great way to create some distance from her. Wherever possible, try to get rid of or put away the mementos that make you think of the girl of your dreams. While you likely won’t want to get rid of an expensive television you bought together, for example, it will be helpful to put away knick-knacks from a trip you took together, or the scarf she left at your house. This will help you create a space that’s free of reminders of her so you can start to move on. This is particularly important with gifts that she’s given you, as these will surely continue to bring her to the forefront of your mind. If you have any framed photos of you together, put these away as well. These will only serve as a reminder of the good times, which can make you forget about the real reasons it didn’t work out over time."

      "content": "Digital reminders are just as painful as physical ones. While you may have some hand-written letters and printed photos, in this day and age, it’s likely that most are stored on your smartphone or computer. Having these reminders with you at all times will just give you more opportunities to reminisce about happier times, which can prevent you from getting over her. If you don’t want to remove all her photos and texts entirely, try creating a folder on your computer and putting it on an external hard drive. That way, these memories won’t be readily available, but you won’t have to get rid of them entirely."

If the girl of your dreams breaks your heart but still tries to be friends, try not to read too much into this and hope that it means she’s changed her mind. Instead, tell her that while you appreciate her efforts, you’re still hurt and need her to stop contacting you until the pain subsides. She may not realize how painful her continued contact is for you, or that it’s giving you false hope. [6] X Expert Source Luis Congdon Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 3 September 2021.

For example, if you’ve always wanted to learn how to knit a winter hat, try throwing yourself into learning this new skill. Once you’ve learned to knit and finished your hat, you’ll have a sense of accomplishment and may find that you didn’t think about her while you were working."

Whether you start to workout regularly, meditate, take yoga classes, or eat healthier, feeling better physically and mentally will give you a more positive outlook on life, and will help you realize that you can be happy and healthy without her. Keep in mind that relying on alcohol, food, or any other substances not only won’t make you feel better, it will also be detrimental to your health.

If you let your bitterness go on for too long, however, you’ll let her continue to have control over your emotions even when she’s out of your life. While forgiving her may be difficult early on, it’ll allow you to have more control over your own emotions as you start to move on. [18] X Research source Keep in mind that forgiving her isn’t necessarily about letting her off the hook for the hurt she’s caused you.

As a result, it’ll likely take some time for you to break these habits and start naturally doing things for yourself instead of her. It can be helpful, then, to deliberately recommit to focusing on yourself and what you need to do to get over her every morning. Taking just a few minutes to meditate and focus on your own goals each morning can go a long way in keeping you focused on your own future rather than on the past. [19] X Research source"
