      "content": "Clingy behavior tends to push people away. You might find yourself constantly texting or calling your partner, even when they’re slow to respond. If that’s the case, chat with your partner about how often you both want to see each other and whether or not he needs more alone time. [1] X Research source “You’ve seemed a little different lately. Are you getting enough alone time? I need less alone time than you do, so let me know if you want to switch things up.” “I love hanging out with you, but I understand if it’s too much. Should we hang out every other day instead of every day?”"

      "content": "Your guy may be worried because he’s used to short-term flings. If this is his first real relationship or the longest he’s dated someone, he might be pulling away because he’s scared of his feelings. Try sitting down and talking to him about what he’s going through, and see if you can reassure him in any way. [2] X Research source “Ever since we became official, I feel like you’ve pulled away a little bit. Are you feeling a little weird because this is new for you?” “Let me know if you want to take things slower. Relationships can be overwhelming, and I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable.”"

      "title": "Fighting over little things can make people pull back in relationships.",
      "content": "Fighting over little things can make people pull back in relationships. If you find that you and your partner are constantly arguing about small stuff, you may need to reconnect with each other. Sit down and talk about any underlying problems in your relationship to get to the root of why you’re fighting so much. [3] X Research source Arguments over small things, like doing the dishes or taking out the trash, usually have a deeper meaning to them. Try to communicate with your partner to stop fighting so much and express how you’re really feeling. Bring this up by saying something like, “I’ve noticed we’ve been fighting more often than usual. Is there anything about our relationship that you want to discuss? I’m happy to talk things over with you.”"

      "title": "Not getting compliments can make men put up their walls.",
      "content": "Not getting compliments can make men put up their walls. In long-term relationships, it’s easy to offer more constructive criticism than positive reinforcement. However, constantly hearing how you need to improve can be draining over time. Be sure that you’re giving your partner plenty of praise, and call out the good things they do, too. [4] X Research source “Thanks so much for making dinner tonight! This food is delicious.” “You got me flowers? How sweet! You’re so thoughtful.”"

      "title": "Outside stressors can distract people from their relationships.",
      "content": "Outside stressors can distract people from their relationships. If your partner seems a little bored or preoccupied, take a look at what he’s doing on a daily basis. If he’s working on a tough project at work or in school, he might just be stressed. [5] X Research source Help him unwind by planning relaxing activities for the two of you. Go get a massage or run him a bubble bath so he can unwind at home. Talk with him about it by saying something like, “I know you’ve been working super hard lately, and I want you to know I appreciate everything you do. Is there anything I can do to help alleviate that stress?” Reader Poll: We asked 2229 wikiHow readers about the most common signs that a man is stressed, and only 6% of them said if he self-medicates with food or alcohol . [Take Poll] So, getting angry or snappy might be a better indication that he’s stressed."

      "content": "Long-term relationships can fall into ruts from time to time. When you’ve been together for a while, it’s easy to get into a routine of going to work, coming home, hanging out, and going to bed. Try mixing it up every once in a while by doing something spontaneous or heading out for a fun date night whenever you can. Try to break out of the “roles” in your relationship, too. If he’s normally the one to plan dates, surprise him by taking him out. If he’s usually the one who cooks, take over and make a fancy dinner one night."

      "content": "It’s important to make time for each other in a relationship. If you and your partner have been together for a while, you might get stuck talking about work, kids, or other responsibilities. Be sure you’re making time to sit down with each other and reconnect one on one. [6] X Research source An easy way to do this is to set a designated date night every week. Or, try new things together. Sign up for a class to do a fun activity while learning something new."

      "content": "When the mystery is gone, some people end up getting bored. Maybe your partner thinks he’s asked you every question under the sun or knows all your childhood stories. Try reconnecting by asking each other deep questions to get some surprising answers. Try questions like: “What advice do you wish you heard when you were younger?” “How much time do you think couples need to spend with each other?” “What’s something I do that you really love?” Asking deep questions is especially important in a long distance relationship, because it helps you two feel closer even when you’re apart."

      "content": "Couples tend to fall into a routine in the bedroom. If your partner seems a little bored whenever you initiate sex, try asking him if he has any fantasies he wants to try. You don’t have to do anything you aren't comfortable with, but keep an open mind, and be open to trying new things. [7] X Research source An easy way to spice up your sex life is just by trying new positions. You could also buy yourself a sexy new outfit, or bring home a new toy from an adult shop. Talk to him about your sex life by saying something like, “Hey babe, is there anything you’d like to try in the bedroom? I want to make sure you feel satisfied with our sex life.”"

If he is suffering from depression, try suggesting that he see a mental health professional.

      "content": "In rare cases, boredom is a sign that your guy is looking elsewhere. While it’s not the number one cause of boredom in a relationship, if you notice that your partner is withdrawing or spending a lot of time with someone else, he could be developing feelings. Having a crush on someone doesn’t necessarily mean you need to end your relationship, but it’s good to sit down and talk about it together. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source “Honey, I’ve noticed you’ve been spending a lot of time with Melissa lately. I just want to check in and make sure you two are strictly platonic.” “I don’t mind you having friends, but your relationship with Rebecca is making me a little uncomfortable. Are you sure you don’t have feelings for her?”"
