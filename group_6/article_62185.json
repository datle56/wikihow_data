      "content": "The kissing face emoji can also be a platonic kiss. The ðŸ˜˜ emoji doesn't have to be romanticâ€”blowing kisses can be done in a platonic sense, too. Many close friends and family members send this emoji to one another to say \"I love you\" over text. \"Thanks for coming over today, dad! It was great to see you. ðŸ˜˜\" \"If I didn't bombard you with annoying texts, I wouldn't be your sister! ðŸ˜˜\""

      "content": "The kissing face emoji can be a goodbye kiss. Traditionally, \"blowing a kiss\" is used as a form of farewell. In emoji form, you can use it to wish somebody else goodbye or good night via message. You can also pair ðŸ˜˜ with another emoji, such as ðŸ‘‹ (waving hand) or ðŸ™‹ (waving person), to craft your emoji goodbye. \"Gotta run! I'll text you again later, okay? Bye! ðŸ˜˜ðŸ‘‹\" \"Goodnight, babe! See you tomorrow. ðŸ˜˜\""

      "title": "The kiss mark emoji symbolizes a kiss.",
      "content": "The kiss mark emoji symbolizes a kiss. As the short-form version of the word \"kiss,\" the ðŸ’‹ emoji can be used in place of \"kiss\" or \"kisses\" rather than typing out the whole word. It can be used in either a romantic or platonic context. \"Sending you lots of ðŸ’‹ today!\" \"I'm gonna give you so many ðŸ¤— and ðŸ’‹ when I see you!\""

      "content": "The kiss mark emoji is flirtatious and seductive. More often than not, the ðŸ’‹ emoji is meant to be enticing and romantic; it has more steamy implications than other kissing emojis. When someone sends you the kiss mark emoji, they might be trying to get a little sultry with you!

      "content": "The kiss mark is also a sassy emoji. You can use the ðŸ’‹ emoji if you're feeling a little cheeky. Remember the phrases \"kiss something goodbye\" or \"kiss my butt\"? Well, you can put a little extra emphasis on a sassy remark with a ðŸ’‹ emoji to make sure your point gets across. \"I am so ready to kiss these exams GOODBYE. ðŸ’‹\" \"Anyone who takes me for granted can kiss me goodbye! ðŸ’‹\""

      "content": "The kiss mark emoji refers to makeup and beauty. Sometimes, the ðŸ’‹ emoji can be a bit more literal! A kiss mark implies lipstick being left behind after a kiss, so when talking about cosmeticsâ€”particularly lipstickâ€”the ðŸ’‹ emoji can be a useful tool. You can use it to talk about applying lipstick, favorite makeup products, or about style and beauty in general.

      "content": "A kissing face emoji is more likely to be friendly than a kiss mark emoji. Both can have romantic vibes, but ðŸ˜˜ is a sweet emoji you can easily send a parent or friend. ðŸ’‹ is more often used in steamy, sensual messagesâ€”although you can still give it a platonic or sassy context. Overall, both emojis can be used interchangeably or together to say \"kiss\" without fully writing the word. [4] X Research source \"Hey, mom! Just wanted to check in and say, 'I love you!' ðŸ˜˜\" \"Hi, girl! Let's hang out at the party this weekend! ðŸ’‹\" \"I'm really looking forward to tonightâ€¦ ðŸ¥µðŸ’‹\" \"Sending you many kisses today, my love! ðŸ˜˜ðŸ’‹\""
