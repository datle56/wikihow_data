[2] X Research source On the other hand, whom is used as a direct or indirect object of a verb or preposition. While a preposition ( at , by , for , in , with , etc.) often comes before whom , this is not always the case, so the key question is to ask, “Who is doing what to whom?” What follows is a quick way to determine which pronoun to use in a particular question."
