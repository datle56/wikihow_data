      "content": "Toss your dog a high-value treat any time they have an item to guard. A high-value treat is anything that your dog loves more than whatever they’re guarding, like a treat, a piece of chicken, or a hot dog. Approach your dog a short distance from when they start to react. Toss the treat to them, and when they eat it, toss another. Then, turn and leave. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If you have multiple dogs, put them in separate rooms so you can train the dog who’s resource guarding one-on-one. Optionally, say something like “What have you got there?” in a conversational tone as you toss the treat. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source After a few sessions, begin to add one more step towards them before tossing the treat, and then step back. If your dog gets tense, take the training back a step. This can let your dog know that they should expect good things when you approach them. When their body language becomes more relaxed, that means the training is working."

      "title": "Teach your dog to “drop it” by offering a high-value treat.",
      "content": "Teach your dog to “drop it” by offering a high-value treat. To teach your dog to “drop it,” offer your dog a low-value toy, let them play with it, and then put a high-value treat under their nose. As soon as your dog drops the toy, praise your dog or use a clicker , then give them the treat. Pick up the toy and hold it behind your back, then repeat the process.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source When you know your dog will drop the item after you show the treat, add a verbal cue like “drop it.” This training can teach your dog that giving up something they’re possessive over can be a good thing. If you need to take an item away from your dog, use the verbal cue and offer your dog a trade with something higher value than the item, like chicken or a special treat."

      "title": "Give your dog high-value treats in exchange for low-value items.",
      "content": "Give your dog high-value treats in exchange for low-value items. Give your dog a low-value dog toy and allow them to play for a while. Offer them a few high-value treats, and as they’re eating, remove the low-value item. Repeat a few times until your dog is excited when you approach. Then, try to trade the item for the treat simultaneously. [4] X Research source Practice this technique with a variety of items your dog doesn’t show interest in guarding, then slowly move up to more valuable items. You may start with a toy they don’t play with, then move to a toy they sometimes play with, then a favorite toy, and then a toy they absolutely love. If your dog shows interest when you take away the low-value item, try making a trail of treats leading away from the item so you can pick it up. Tethering your dog to a door or piece of furniture with a leash before training can create a way for you to move away from them if they start growling, freezing up, or snapping. Practicing trading with your dog can help them feel better about having their stuff taken away, which may help reduce or eliminate your dog’s guarding behavior."

However, punishing a dog for resource guarding can make them more aggressive because their worst fears have been verified. If your dog growls or tenses up, take a step back and try the above training methods instead. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If your dog growls at you and you yell at them, for example, they might be more likely to skip the growl and go straight for a bite. If your dog growls, it’s their way of trying to tell you to “back off” without escalating to a bite."

If you adopt a second dog and buy them a brand new fluffy bed, your first dog may want that one instead of their old one. To avoid trouble, you may want to buy them a new one, too.

[9] X Research source If a new dog visits your space, try to create a neutral environment free of items that may cause tension, like toys, crates, or food. If your dog loves to take your shoes from the closet but growls when you try to take them away, put them where your dog can’t reach them. If your dog does get an item you need to get away from them, distract them with treats far enough away from the item that you can retrieve it safely. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Resource guarding is a normal and natural dog behavior. The reason behind resource guarding varies, but it’s typically based on a worry that what they love will be taken away. [13] X Research source Although the behavior often occurs with adult dogs, puppies might resource guard as they learn to navigate the world. [14] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Other contributing factors might include: Genetics: A dog’s breed or mix might have predispositions for guarding behavior. Stress: When a dog is stressed because of guests in the home, new family members, or stress-inducing events like fireworks, their guarding behavior might increase. The item’s inherent value: Food often has the highest value, but every dog is different in what they see as inherently valuable. Other needs not being met: This could be a long-term issue, like lack of enrichment or exercise, or a short-term issue, like tiredness, hunger, or thirst. Underlying medical issues: Pain can increase the frequency or intensity of aggressive behavior. If guarding is a new behavior, visit a veterinarian for a health check up. [15] X Research source Training: In an attempt to assert dominance, some owners might take a puppy’s food or toy away. This only teaches the dog that a human approaching means the item will disappear, and may cause them to respond defensively. History of resource scarcity: Former street dogs or dogs from environments with fewer resources might still feel the drive to protect what they have. However, one study found that food aggression is not linked to a history of food scarcity. [16] X Research source"
