      "content": "Your AirTag has lost Bluetooth connection. If your AirTag is moved out of Bluetooth range from your device, it will start to beep after 8 to 12 hours of losing connection. The beeping is meant to notify people that there is a lost item nearby—but your AirTag can start beeping even if it's not lost simply due to a dropped Bluetooth connection. If you find a beeping AirTag that you suspect might be tracking you or someone else, hold the white side of the AirTAg to your iPhone or other NFC-capable phone. Tap the notification that appears to open information about the AirTag. Screenshot this information, then tap Instructions to disable to stop the AirTag from tracking. [1] X Research source"
