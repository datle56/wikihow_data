      "content": "STG means “Swear to God” when used over text or on social media. People sometimes use “stg” or “STG” as a way to add some frustrated emphasis or a sense of exaggeration to their social media posts. STG isn’t exclusive to a specific social media platform, though—it means “Swear to God” on TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and most other sites/apps. [1] X Research source “He is trying my last nerve stg 🙄” “Stg it’s taken 3 years for this package to get here 😔🎁” Some people spell STG in all capital letters (STG), while other people spell it in with lowercase letters (stg). It means the same thing in both formats, though."
