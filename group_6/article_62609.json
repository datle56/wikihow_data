Rarely, you will encounter a book name that is part of an anthology, and these titles will be written differently. An anthology is a collection of smaller works, which usually includes short texts. However, an anthology can contain novels, as well. If your book was part of an anthology, you do not need to put it in italics. Simply place quotation marks around the title.

In this case, you could write the name of the first novel as \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" when citing it in an essay."

For example, you would write Blue River: The Trial of a Mayor-Elect . If there is a dash or colon in the title, you should capitalize the word after the punctuation, regardless of how long the word is. As above, you would write Blue River: The Trial of a Mayor-Elect ."
