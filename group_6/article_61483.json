If you can't find Unrar in your distro's package manager, you can download the source code and install it easily: First, download the latest version of RAR using this command: x64: wget https://www.rarlab.com/rar/rarlinux-x64-621.tar.gz x86: wget https://www.rarlab.com/rar/rarlinux-x32-621.tar.gz You can double-check the latest version at https://www.rarlab.com . Untar and unzip the downloaded file: x64: tar -zxvf rarlinux-x64-621.tar.gz x86: tar -zxvf rarlinux-x32-621.tar.gz Enter the new directory called rar by typing cd rar and pressing Enter .

[1] X Research source This command will extract all files and folders from the RAR file to the current directory. If you want to extract the files to a different directory, use unrar x filename.rar /path/to/directory . If the RAR file requires a password, you'll be prompted to enter it. Many RAR files are protected by passwords for security purposes."

      "content": "Use unrar e filename.rar to extract files without preserving directories. If you want all files from the archive to be extracted to the same location instead of keeping the directory structure in which they were compressed, use this option. In most cases, it's better to use the x option instead. You can specify the directory you want to extract the file to with unrar e as well. E.g., unrar e myfile.rar /usr/local/bin If you have a RAR file that came with multiple parts (e.g., .rar, .rar.00, .rar.01), you'll only need to use the above command on the first file (the one ending in .rar). This will extract the files from the RAR's other parts."
