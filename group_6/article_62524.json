Some Logitech and Azio keyboards have a physical switch above the F1-F3 keys, enabling gaming mode and preventing the Windows key from working. Some keyboards have a Win Lock button on the right side, next to the Ctrl key. Corsair, Gigabyte, Logitech, and MSI computers and laptops have software that can disable the Windows key.
