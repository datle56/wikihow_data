      "content": "They’re being silly. Is there anything funnier than a smiley face poop? If a friend puts a 💩 at the end of a text, they may be feeling playful. They’re trying to get you to laugh, so try replying with a 😂. [1] X Research source “Did Sam tell you his latest joke? 🤣💩” “What did the poop say to the fart? You blow me away 💩🤣🤣”"

      "content": "They’re talking about poop. A 💩 can be used to say, “I feel like poo” or, “It stinks in here!” If they’re talking about how or what they’re doing and they send a 💩, chances are they literally mean poop. [2] X Research source “Don’t go into the basement bathroom 💩💩” “Not feeling the best today 💩🤮”"

      "title": "They’re dissatisfied.",
      "content": "They’re dissatisfied. Sending a 💩 could be their way of saying, “Nope!” This fun and silly emoji can put a positive spin on a disagreement or disappointment. For example, maybe you’re working on a project together, and they send you a single 💩 after you send a pic of your progress. This could be them politely saying, “It’s not looking too great. Maybe try again!” “It’s not exactly what I pictured 😐💩” “I can’t say it looks amazing 💩 but it’s not terrible! 😁”"

      "content": "They’re being passive-aggressive. A 💩 at the end of an insulting message could be a form of mockery. They may be calling you a “turd” or a “loser” without actually saying the word. Is there a negative tone to their message? If there is, a 💩 may be a back-handed compliment. [3] X Research source “You’re such a 💩” “Nice hairdo 😂💩”"

      "content": "They’re wishing you good luck. In Japan, a 💩 is possibly the best emoji you could receive! Unko is the word for poop in Japanese, and un means “good luck.” This usage is not as commonly known, but if a friend sends this emoji at the end of an encouraging message, they're wishing you the best. [4] X Research source “You’re going to do great 👍💩” “Sending good vibes your way this morning 💖💩”"

      "content": "Be silly with friends. Make a friend chuckle by sending them a funny text and a 💩. You can pair this emoji with other humorous emojis like 😂, 🤪, and 😋 to make your message even more playful. “What would you do if I licked my shoe? 🤪💩” “The 💩 looks more like chocolate ice cream to me 😋”"

      "content": "Show your disapproval. If you don’t necessarily agree with what someone’s doing but don’t want to say so outwardly, try sending a 💩. This is a good way to be honest without ruffling any feathers right away. “That’s not the best idea bro 💩” “Can’t say that’s a smart move 💩🙃”"

      "title": "Give a playful insult.",
      "content": "Give a playful insult. Spark some harmless banter with a friend or crush by using 💩 to replace words like “turd,” “idiot,” or “loser.” Now, be careful with this usage. You don’t want to offend someone, so only try this with a friend who’s okay with playful mockery. “You’re such an idiot sometimes 💩😂” “You’re the biggest 💩 I know. But I love you for it ❤️”"
