      "content": "Choose a variable to eliminate. To eliminate a variable, the numerical coefficient (the number in front of the variable) of a variable must be opposite to one another (for instance 5 and -5 are opposites). The goal is to get rid of one variable, so that you can solve for the other variable by eliminating one through subtraction. This means making the coefficients of the same variable in both equations cancel each other out. [2] X Research source Steward, J., Lothar, R., Watson, S., Algebra and Trigonometry. Second Edition. Singapore: Thomson Learning Asia, For instance: In 8x - 3y = -3 (equation A) and 5x - 2y = -1 (equation B), you can multiply equation A with 2 and equation B with 3 so that you get 6y in equation A and 6y in equation B. This would look like: equation A: 2(8x - 3y =-3) = 16x -6y = -6. Equation B: 3(5x - 2y = -1) = 15x -6y =-3"

      "content": "Add or subtract the two equations to remove one of the variables and solve the other variable. Now that you have a variable that can be eliminated, you can do so by adding or subtracting. Whether you add or subtract will depend on how you will be able to remove the variable. In our equation we would subtract, because 6y is in each of the equations: [2] X Research source (16x - 6y = -6) - (15x - 6y = -3) = 1x = -3. Therefore x = -3. For other cases, if the numerical coefficient of x is not 1 after we add or subtract, we must divide both sides by the numerical coefficient to simplify the equation."

[3] X Research source When you know that it works in one of the equations, you can try plugging it into the other equation to make sure: Equation B: 5(-3) - 2y = -1 so -15 -2y = -1. Add 15 to both sides so -2y = 14. Divide both sides by -2 so that y = -7. Therefore x = -3 and y = -7."

If one of the equations doesn’t work with the variables you have found, you will have to try again. 8(-3) - 3(-7) = -3 so -24 +21 = -3 TRUE. 5(-3) -2(-7) = -1 so -15 + 14 = -1 TRUE.

It doesn’t matter which equation you decide to work with or even which variable you choose to solve for, as you should find the same solution no matter what. However, you do want to make the process as simple as possible. You should choose the equation that you think will be easiest to work with. [4] X Research source For instance, if there is an equation where one of the coefficients is 1, such as x - 3y = 7, you would choose that as it will be easy to solve for ‘x’. For example, let’s say our equations are: x - 2y = 10 (equation A) and -3x -4y = 10 (equation B). You would choose to work with x - 2y = 10 because the coefficient of x in this equation is 1. Solving for x in equation A would meaning adding 2y to both sides. Therefore, x = 10 + 2y."

When you use elimination to solve a multivariable linear equation, you get rid of one of the variables you are working with (such as ‘x’) so that you can solve the other variable (‘y’). Once you find ‘y’, you can plug it into the equation and solve for ‘x’ (don’t worry, this will be covered in detail in Method 2). [12] X Research source Substitution, on the other hand, is where you begin working with only one equation so that you can again solve for one variable. Once you solve one equation, you can plug in your findings to the other equation, effectively making one large equation out of your two smaller ones. Again, don’t worry—this will be covered in detail in Method 3."
