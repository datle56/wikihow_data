      "content": "A loose power plug can cause a black screen. Make sure the power cable from your TV to the wall is snugly plugged into the back of your TV and the wall outlet. The LED light on the front of your TCL TV should be off or blinking if the TV is on. Alternatively, the light will be solid white if your TCL TV is off but plugged in. If your TCL TV isn't turning on while plugged in to a power strip or surge protector, try plugging it directly into the wall."

      "content": "Your TV may be on the wrong input. If you have a separate Roku device, Amazon Fire Stick, Apple TV, set-top cable box, or other streaming device, check which HDMI port it is connected to on the back of your TV (they'll be numbered). Then, use the Source or Input button on your remote to switch to that port. If you've selected the correct source and the screen is still black, try a different HDMI cable. It's also possible that there is a problem with your streaming device or set top box and not your TV."
