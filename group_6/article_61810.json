      "content": "Find out the mother's lunar age at the time of conception. The Chinese use a lunar calendar, which is different from the Western Gregorian calendar. For this reason, you're going to have to calculate the mother's age according to the lunar calendar, not the Gregorian calendar . [1] X Research source First of all, add one year to however old you are right now. You're 32 years old right now? According to the Chinese calendar, you're at least 33 (possibly 34). This is because the Chinese count the first nine months spent in the womb towards the baby's age, unlike in the West. So when a baby is born, it's already 1 year old according to the lunar calendar. If you were born after February 22, take your Gregorian age, add 1 (from the roughly year you spent in your mother's womb), and you're done. If you're 17 and you were born on July 11, you're 18 according to the lunar calendar. If you were born before February 22, find out if your birthday comes before or after the Chinese New Year during the year you were born. If you were born before the Chinese New Year, add an additional year to your Gregorian age. For example, you were born on January 7, 1990; the Chinese New Year during 1990 happened on January 27, meaning you were born before the New Year, according to the lunar calendar. This makes you two years older, in lunar years, than you are according to the Gregorian calendar.

      "content": "Use the birth chart to try to select which gender you ideally want. While many families use the Chinese birth chart after a child has been conceived, some couples look to the birth calendar before conception to select a boy or girl specifically. Whatever gender your child is, you're sure to love them; but what if you could figure it all out beforehand?"

      "content": "Remember that accurate readings always involve the Chinese lunar calendar and dates based on the time of conception. Birth charts that don't use the lunar calendar as a guide aren't accurate. Beware of readings that use the Gregorian Calendar. Be sure to select dates based on the date of conception, especially when considering age. Select how old you were at the time of conception, not how old you currently are."

      "content": "Know that there is no scientific basis to the Chinese birth chart. Science has been unable to verify the accuracy of the Chinese birth chart, so be careful using the chart solely to determine or predict the gender of your child. There are several ways to scientifically predict the gender of your unborn baby — ultrasound , amniocentesis — but the Chinese birth chart is not one of them."
