      "content": "“Skill issue” is a joking insult used to taunt fellow gamers. Some players use the term in a semi-serious way to point out a definitive skill gap, but the term is most commonly used in a playful or ironic sense when a player’s skill is irrelevant to the situation at hand. Some people say “sounds like a skill issue” or “simply a difference in skill” rather than “skill issue” on its own. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Taunt a fellow player when they’re having a bad game. Maybe you’re 1v1ing a friend in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate or are teaming up with someone in a League of Legends game. Whenever they complain about negative circumstances in the game, hit them with a playful “skill issue.” Person A: “How does Ahri keep dodging me???” Person B: “Skill issue” Person A: “I accidentally missed my combo… I’m gonna freak out” Person B: “Sounds like a skill issue to me”"

Poke fun at their misfortune with a sarcastic use of “skill issue.” Person A: “Sorry I disconnected, my dad somehow managed to unplug our internet router??” Person B: “Skill issue” Person A: “My power just went out…” Person B: “L + ratio + skill issue” In this context, L+ ratio is another type of cheeky taunt used to playfully degrade someone.

      "content": "Respond to “skill issue” with something equally snarky. At the end of the day, “skill issue” is a remark used jokingly—it isn’t meant to be a serious insult. Still, a sarcastic comeback can be a fun way to turn the tables on a fellow gamer who’s trying to get under your skin. Try saying something like: “You would know!” “You’re right. I should’ve known that… [insert unpredictable scenario here]” “Come on, is that all you got?”"

      "content": "“Skill issue” emerged from the gaming community around 2020. There’s no internet celebrity or iconic screenshot credited with the birth of “skill issue,” but it definitely became a buzzword on Twitter and Reddit as a taunting reply to gamers who were venting about their video game experiences online. Chances are, someone uttered the now-famous phrase on Twitch or in the chat section of a Twitch stream. GIFs captioned with the phrase helped it to spread to other social media platforms (like Discord). “Skill issue” is often used on TikTok. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "“Skill issue” can refer to an issue with someone’s professional skills. In the world of HR and the professional workplace, “skill issue” isn’t a snarky comment at all—it’s a lack of know-how that prevents a worker from giving 100% to a given job. [4] X Research source Professional skill issues come in all shapes and sizes. Technical skill issues can refer to someone who lacks up-to-date knowledge in their field (e.g., someone who got a computer science degree in the 90s or early 2000s), while soft skill issues can refer to someone who isn’t great at communicating or getting along with their co-workers/employees."
