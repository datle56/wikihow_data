For example, if you're cooking and step away from your iPhone, which is locked, Siri might not respond if you don't have \"Allow Siri When Locked\" enabled in Settings > Siri & Search . Siri won't work if you have your phone face down or covered. To change this so you can use Siri in these situations, go to Settings > Accessibility > Siri and turn on \"Always Listen for 'Hey Siri'.\" If you don't hear Siri's responses, make sure they aren't muted. Go to Settings > Siri & Search > Siri Responses and make sure Prefer Spoken Responses is selected. [2] X Research source"

If you're using an unreliable Wi-Fi connection, switch to using cellular data; if you're using a weak cellular data network, switch to Wi-Fi. Some VPNs disable Siri. If you don't see \"Siri & Search\" in your iPhone's menu, your VPN is most likely the cause. Turn it off and restart your phone to regain access to Siri."

You can check the physical microphone and clear out any dust or debris that might be preventing Siri from hearing you (it's at the bottom of your iPhone, next to the charging port). Don't use compressed air to clean it since the pressure can drive liquids or other small debris inside your phone and damage it. Instead, use something like a microfiber cloth or painter's tape, which doesn't leave residue. Make sure Siri has access to use your phone's microphone in Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone ."
