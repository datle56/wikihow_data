This function tells us the relationship between the input variable (x) and the output variable (y). [1] X Research source If we input a value for x, we get a specific value for y. The table above shows x values and their y values. An x value of 1 gives us 2*1 + 1. Therefore, if x=1, y=3. An x value of 2 gives us 2*2 + 1. Therefore, if x=2, y=5. And so on."

      "content": "Each column represents a group of numbers called a “set.” Sets of numbers are presented using { }. The set of x values is called the domain, while the set of y values produced by the function is called the range. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source [4] X Research source In our example, the domain is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The range is {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}. A set of possible y values is known as the “codomain.” [5] X Research source This is different from the range, because the range is the actual set of y values. For our example, you can say that the codomain is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17} because these are possible values for y. Meanwhile, the range is {3, 5, 7, 9, 11} because these are the actual values in our table."

How can we tell that that table came from a function? To figure this out, we’ll need to compare the x values (domain) with the y values (range). Let’s look at some examples."

Likewise, the x value of 13 always has a y value of 5 and never something else. This is fine because multiple x values can have the same y value, but a given x value can only have one specific y value. Therefore, this table is a function."

The first x value of 11 has a y value of 20. The second x value of 11 has a y value of 16. In this case, the table is not a function because an x value of 11 has more than one y value.
