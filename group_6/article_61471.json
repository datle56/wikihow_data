      "content": "Your SIM PIN protects your SIM card from unauthorized use of your mobile service. If you've protected your SIM card with a PIN, your phone will ask for the SIM PIN each time you restart it or remove and reinsert the SIM. [1] X Research source If you haven't changed the PIN, most SIM pins are 0123 or 1234 by default. [2] X Research source But don't try to guess the SIM PIN if you don't know what it is—if you mis-enter it 3 times, you'll only be able to unlock the SIM if you use a PUK code from the provider. SIM PINs are different from the PIN you use to unlock your phone's screen, and most phones do not have SIM PINs by default. If you see a message on your phone that says \"Locked SIM\" or similar, you'll need to enter the SIM PIN to do anything on the phone."

      "content": "The only thing that will unlock your SIM is the PUK key. Don't try to guess the PUK, as entering it incorrectly too many times will permanently lock the SIM—if this happens, you'll have to replace the SIM entirely. Fortunately, your mobile provider will provide you the PUK so you can reset your SIM. You'll just have to prove your identity over the phone or at an in-person location. If you're not sure who your provider is, remove the SIM card—you'll see the provider's name there. Some providers let you see your PUK when you log in to your online account. Look for an area of your account dashboard called something like \"SIM\" or \"SIM Card,\" which should have a sub-area called \"PUK\" or similar. [3] X Research source"

The worst thing that can happen is that you lose access to your SIM card completely—as long as you have a removable SIM, your mobile provider should be able to issue you a new one. If you stored any contacts or texts on your old SIM, they'll be gone, but storing things on SIM cards is rarer these days."
