Gather at least 4 people to play, but know you can fit as many people around the table as you want to get everyone involved. Just make sure everyone is the legal drinking age and has a way to get home safely."

      "content": "Fill and arrange 20–30 plastic cups around the center of the table. Fill each cup about ⅓ of the way full with the beer of your choice, but fill one cup all the way to the brim to be the “King’s Cup.” Place the King’s Cup in the middle of the table and tightly arrange all the remaining cups around it in a circle. Looking for a fun night but want to stay sober? Just fill the cups with your favorite soda or juice instead."

      "content": "Give 2 starting players each a ping pong ball and empty cup. Choose 2 players who are directly across the table from one another to give the balls and cups to. The players set the cups on the table in front of them. Alternatively, have the 2 starting players take a cup from the middle of the table to drink and use at the start of the game."

      "title": "Bounce your ping pong ball into your empty cup if you're starting.",
      "content": "Bounce your ping pong ball into your empty cup if you're starting. Have the whole group count down from 3 out loud to start the game. The two starting players that have a ball and an empty cup then try bouncing the ball on the table so it lands inside of the cup. If the ball doesn’t go in the cup, quickly grab the ball and try bouncing it again. [1] X Research source If your ball bounces into a different cup in the middle of the table, drink what’s in that cup. Then, stack that cup inside your original empty cup and try bouncing the ball in again."

      "title": "Pass your cup to the left when your ball lands inside.",
      "content": "Pass your cup to the left when your ball lands inside. As soon as you bounce the ball inside of the cup, quickly pass the cup and ball to the next person on your left. Then, that player immediately starts trying to bounce the ball inside the cup. [2] X Research source If you get your ball in the cup on your first try, you are allowed to pass it to anyone at the table instead. One of the best strategies is giving the cup to the person to the right of the other player trying to bounce their ball. Keep a glass or bottle of water nearby to take sips between turns. That way, you stay hydrated while you’re drinking."

      "title": "Stack your cup if the player on the left hasn’t gotten their ball in yet.",
      "content": "Stack your cup if the player on the left hasn’t gotten their ball in yet. If you bounce the ball in your cup and the person to your left has an empty cup in front of them, stack your cup inside of their empty one. Once their cup gets stacked, they have to pass the stack and ball to their left and take a new cup from the center. They must drink from the cup before trying to bounce the ball in. As more cups are added to the stack, it will get taller and more difficult to bounce the ping pong ball into."

      "title": "Continue playing until somebody takes the King’s Cup.",
      "content": "Continue playing until somebody takes the King’s Cup. As the cups make their way around the table, players will continue adding to the stack and taking drinks from the center. When there’s only the King’s Cup left in the middle of the table, the last person who gets their cup stacked must take it and drink it to end the game. Stack Cup can be pretty fast-paced, so take breaks between games to rehydrate and rest. Keep your eyes on the cups when it's not your turn. If someone makes it in on their first try, they could pass it to you."

      "title": "Split into teams if you want to be more competitive.",
      "content": "Split into teams if you want to be more competitive. Rather than playing individually, split the players into 2 equal teams. Have everyone stand around the table so the player order alternates between players from each team. At the end of the game, the losing team splits the King’s Cup instead of one person having to drink the whole thing."

      "title": "Take penalty sips when you miss getting the ball in the cup.",
      "content": "Take penalty sips when you miss getting the ball in the cup. Have every player keep another drink of their choice next to them as they play. Any time a player misses the cup when they bounce a ball, they have to take a sip from their drink before trying again. This variation can get you tipsy a lot faster, so play with only 10–15 cups in the center instead. Make sure you keep some water nearby, too."

If a player gets their ping pong ball in their cup and the person to their left is still trying to shoot the ball, the player slaps their empty cup away instead. After that, the player who slapped the cup gives their empty to anyone at the table, and the other person takes a new cup from the middle. [3] X Research source"
