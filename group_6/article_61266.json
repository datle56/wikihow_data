      "content": "Find a pair of hair clippers, a razor, and a handheld mirror. Though you may be tempted to use beard trimmers, it’s important that you use clippers specifically meant to cut the hair atop your head for a tidy hairline. Use a razor to clean up the edges and get the closest shave. A handheld mirror may be the most important tool, as you need to use that in combination with your bathroom mirror to see the back of your neck and other tricky spots on your hairline. [1] X Research source Ask friend or loved one to assist you as you trim your hair. Having a second person around is very, very beneficial and helpful."

      "content": "Your hairline follows a specific pattern and direction. To find this, look for the line in which most of your hair grows. For example, find the hairline on your neck by standing with your handheld mirror in front of you with your bathroom mirror behind you. Look for the place in which your hair grows most densely and determine where that stops. It may not follow an exactly even line, but this pattern is your general guideline nonetheless. [2] X Research source Note any stray hairs below the hairline. These are what you will trim! Remember—you don't want to change the style or shape of the hair itself."

      "content": "A number 2 clipper guard is the best choice for beginners. It won't cut too harsh a line compared to something like a number 1 clipper guard. This is super important if you are new to cutting your own hair, as harsh lines can make mistakes more obvious and difficult to hide. A number 2 clipper guard's softer lines help you avoid making glaring mistakes and even disguises any slip-ups. [3] X Research source The setting is ultimately up to you and what hairstyle you're going for, but keep this advice in mind if you are new to trimming your hairline."

      "content": "Hold your handheld mirror in front of you with your bathroom mirror behind you. This will give you a view of the back of your neck! Next, hold the clippers upside down with your other hand. Gently push the blade up toward your hairline on the back of your neck, starting at the bottom of your neck where any stray hairs may be. Stop at your natural hairline so that you do not over trim. [4] X Research source To trim the other side of your neck, you may need to switch which hand is holding the clippers and which hand is holding the mirror. That way you're not reaching too far with your opposite hand! Repeat the process until you have trimmed all the excess hairs on the back of your neck and your back hairline is smooth and even. Keep your hand really steady while you're trimming so you don't slip and cut off too much hair."

Apply a layer of shaving cream to the back of your neck. Make sure the layer is thin enough so that you can still see your hairline! Hold your handheld mirror in front of you with the bathroom mirror behind you to get a good view. Next, hold the razor with the hand that is on the same side as the part of the neck you are shaving. Using steady, small strokes, shave any excess hair in the direction that it grows. This can help you avoid cuts and razor bumps. [5] X Research source Avoid shaving past your natural hairline!"

Take the clipper guard off of your clippers. Then, hold the straight blade of your clippers alongside your hairline. In other words, match up the straight blade of your clippers to the straight line of your hairline. Pushing toward that hairline, trim any stray hairs that fall out of the natural hairline to make it a straight line. This should tidy up any excess hair on your face! [6] X Research source Avoid cutting past the natural hairline or shaping the hairline so that it is curved. For the most flattering haircut, you want a straight line at the sides of your hairline!

Use the corner of the blade to trim your hairline, following the natural curve of your ear. Remove any excess hair growing over and behind your ears. This will give you an even hairline that looks neat and fresh! [8] X Research source Using only the corner of the blade helps you reach difficult spots on your hairline.

Once you've determined your natural hairline, trim the excess hair on your forehead in the direction of hair growth. Consider making a guideline at the center or middle of your hairline to follow along as you trim both sides of your forehead hairline. Use small, even cuts to make the hairline as straight as possible. [11] X Research source Be very careful to avoid over-trimming when it comes to your forehead hairline!
