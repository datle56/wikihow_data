      "content": "Most people stop using white noise when their baby is a toddler. For your baby, this could range anywhere from 2 to 4 years old. [1] X Research source There are no set rules or regulations on when your baby should stop listening to white noise, and plenty of older kids and adults like listening to white noise, too. However, if you’re worried about your baby becoming dependent on it, slowly wean them off of it when they’re sleeping through the night more often. While some parents worry that white noise can become a “sleep crutch,” there’s actually no evidence to suggest that long-term white noise use is a bad thing. The only reason why you’d want to wean your baby off of it is if you’re tired of using the white noise machine and want your baby to fall asleep on their own."

      "content": "Gradually lessen the time you use the white noise machine. It’s better to wean your baby off of white noise rather than going cold turkey. Instead of letting the white noise machine play all night, only let it go for a few hours instead. Your baby might wake up the first few times, but after a few tries, they’ll naturally fall back asleep on their own. [2] X Research source You can also try gradually lowering the volume on the white noise machine so it gets quieter and quieter."

      "content": "Set the volume below 50 decibels. At 50 decibels, your white noise machine is safe for baby to listen to, even when it goes all night. You probably won’t be able to measure 50 decibels precisely, but for most white noise machines, this is about a medium volume level. [3] X Research source White noise machines are generally safe, but many of them go up to 85 decibels, which is as loud as a hair dryer. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Listening to a white noise machine that’s too loud can lead to long-term hearing damage. The rule of thumb here is just to never set the white noise machine to the maximum volume, since that will definitely be too loud."

      "content": "Keep the white noise machine as far away from your baby as possible. The closer the machine is to your baby, the more likely it is that it’s going to be too loud. Experts recommend a general rule of keeping the white noise machine at least 7 ft (2.1 m) away from your baby, or further if you can. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Only use white noise when your baby is sleeping. Leaving white noise going 24/7 can actually be detrimental for your baby’s development. It’s important for your baby to hear natural background noise, like people talking, kids playing, and cars honking. Drowning out these sounds can be confusing for your baby, so use white noise to calm your baby sparingly. [6] X Research source Leaving the white noise machine on all night is fine, as long as it’s quite enough and far away from your baby’s crib."

      "content": "White noise is better for babies, while pink noise is good for adults. While there have been multiple studies on white noise for babies, the only studies that have been done on pink noise have been about adults. Pink noise is a little bit lower-pitched than white noise, and it’s been shown to improve adult memory while sleeping. [9] X Research source You may have also heard of brown noise (sometimes called red noise). Brown noise is similar to the sound of rainfall or a waterfall, and it’s been shown to help people who have ringing in their ears. However, no studies have been done on its effect on sleep."
