      "content": "Core memories are emotional moments said to shape your personality. Core memories aren’t a clinical or real concept in neuroscience. The term comes from Disney Pixar’s 2015 movie Inside Out . The movie defines core memories as special memories that significantly impact a person’s personality. [1] X Research source You might see #corememory on social media when someone uploads videos or pictures highlighting a nostalgic or important moment in their lives. Unlike in the movie, people can have more than 5 core memories and they aren't always clearly tied to different emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or fear."

      "content": "Core memories probably don't affect your personality. Unlike Pixar’s Inside Out , in the real world, your memories don’t define who you are. The American Psychological Association defines “personality” as “the enduring characteristics and behavior that comprise a person’s unique adjustment to life, including major traits, interests, drives, [and] values.” [2] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source The life experiences and memories you have can influence you, but they don’t ultimately determine who you’ll be. For instance, in the movie, Riley ( Inside Out ’s main character) loses a core memory called Goofball Island. When this happens, she becomes less of a goofball, appearing more serious and sad. This isn’t the case in real life. While you may “lose” or forget memories, it doesn’t mean you’ll change. An experience or memory may change your perspective or outlook on life (such as a first kiss or a scary accident), but it doesn’t impact your overall personality."

      "content": "No, you can’t predict what will be a core memory. There’s no way to ultimately know if something you experience will be a core memory. While something may seem important at the moment, it might be something you forget later. Memories are created through a biological process and can be triggered by different things, which is why you can’t know for certain which will continue to stand out as you get older.

      "content": "Forming lasting memories may help create core memories. While you may not be able to predict a core memory, you can influence which memories stick with you the longest. Memory is about connections, and the stronger those connections are, the easier it is to remember. [4] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Here are some ways you can create longer lasting memories: Think about moments you want to remember often. The more you think about the memory, the easier it’ll be to remember. Connect memories to other things. Listening to a specific song, eating a type of food, or smelling a particular perfume can help trigger memories.

Give yourself something to look back on to keep a memory alive and fresh. Sleep well. When you sleep, your mind processes and stores memories, helping you remember them later. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Core memories aren’t always happy. While TikTok and other social media platforms can make core memories seem joyful, that’s not always the case. Anything meaningful (whether good or bad) can be a core memory—sad, fearful, and angry memories can impact you. More often than not, traumatic memories are the ones that influence your experiences and perspective the most. [7] X Research source"
