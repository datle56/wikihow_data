If you visited a beach in Central America, South America, the Caribbean, the West Indies, or Africa, you may have been bitten by the Tunga penetrans , also known as a chigoe flea. These insects are true sand fleas, unlike the tiny crustaceans ( Talitrus saltator ) that cause minor bites on beaches throughout the world. Female Tunga penetrans can burrow into the skin to hatch eggs, which can lead to infection called tungiasis. The bite will look like a swollen area with a small black spot in the center. Fortunately, a doctor can remove the burrowed flea quickly.
