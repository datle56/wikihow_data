      "content": "Impressions are the number of times your content is displayed on LinkedIn. Anytime your posts or content is shown to a LinkedIn user, it is counted as an impression. Even if that user has already seen the content you posted. To be specific, your content has to be at least 50% visible on the screen of the logged-in user's device for at least 300 milliseconds to be counted as an impression. This can be in a web browser or using the LinkedIn mobile app . [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Unique impressions are the number of times your content is shown to unique users. Whenever your content appears in the feed of a logged-in user for the first time, it is counted as a unique impression. If that user sees the same piece of content again, it is counted as an impression but not a unique impression. Unique impressions are also referred to as \"reach.\" While reach is often confused with impressions, they are different. Reach is the number of users who saw your content, while impressions are the number of times your content was viewed. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Impressions help you gauge the performance of your posts on LinkedIn.",
      "content": "Impressions help you gauge the performance of your posts on LinkedIn. The more impressions your content receives, the more people have an opportunity to view and interact with your content. This will likely result in more engagement with your content. It's important to remember that while impressions are an important metric in gauging the performance of your LinkedIn posts, they are only one of many metrics. Impressions should be considered along with likes, comments, shares, views, and unique impressions or reach."

      "content": "Paid Impressions. Paid impressions are impressions that are gained as a result of a paid advertising campaign. In other words, someone has paid to promote and boost the content.

      "content": "Organic Impressions. Organic impressions are gained naturally without paid advertising. These impressions are usually seen as more authentic and generally reflect the interests of your target audience. However, they typically don't have the same reach as paid impressions, and their success often depends on the algorithm. Not only that, but it can also take quite a bit of time to build a platform that has significant reach through organic impressions."

According to social media and marketing expert Carin Bennett, you have to stay within your lane. Identify your brand and stick with it. If it's not part of your brand, don't post it. Posting about too many different interests is the easiest way to dilute your brand and confuse the algorithm."
