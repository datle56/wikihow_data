      "content": "Ensure your car has upright locks. These locks look like small cylinders and are found near the bottom of the car window, where it meets the door. Note that these mechanical locks are usually found on cars manufactured in 1992 or before. If your car was made afterwards, it might still have these locks, but the car door may have electronics, wires or even airbags that make using a slim jim more difficult. [1] X Research source If you’re unsure what locks are on your car, you should consult the user’s manual, or try researching your car model online. Newer cars have complex electric power locks and lock shields or shrouding that block slim jims and other break-in tools, making them ineffective. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Call a locksmith if you’re still unsure. If it’s not obvious whether your car has the right locks for a slim jim, you should strongly consider calling a locksmith. Using a slim jim on the wrong type of locks could seriously damage your car. A locksmith might seem expensive, but the repairs on your car could be moreso. Professional locksmith Robert Vallelunga recommends calling a pro. “You can go it alone, but you risk damaging the car lock, car door, or door seal, which will ultimately cost you more than hiring a professional to begin with. Every car model has a preferred way of opening, and they can be very different.” He adds, “For older cars, with proof of ownership, a locksmith shop can just make you a key that will unlock the door by using the car’s VIN . Even if the key isn’t programmed to the car, it will unlock the door so you can get your working keys out.”"

Ideally, use a rubber wedge, as a wooden wedge could leave splinters and shards in your car door."
