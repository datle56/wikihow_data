      "content": "Have several small meals throughout the day. Rather than have 2-3 big meals, try having 5-6 meals with smaller portion sizes. This can help to prevent overwhelming your esophagus with a lot of food at once and make it easier for you to digest your food properly. [2] X Research source For example, you may have a small portion of food in the morning and then several small meals during the day, rather than a set breakfast, lunch, and dinner with larger portions."

      "content": "Raise your bed 15 to 20 centimetres (5.9 to 7.9 in) to help you sleep. Esophageal spasms can become worse at night and make it difficult for you to sleep. To stop them, raise the head of your bed by using blocks under your bed frame or by placing a foam wedge under your mattress. [6] X Research source Do not try adding extra pillows under your head when you sleep, as this is not an effective option unless you buy a special pillow. You can purchase a special pillow that keeps you elevated. However, raising the bed, or investing in a bed that you can raise up, is a better option. Wait two to three hours after you eat to lie down in bed, to give your body time to digest your food and prevent spasms or heartburn."
