      "title": "They’re happy.",
      "content": "They’re happy. Pet ducks are a lot like dogs when it comes to body language. They often wiggle their tail when they’re excited or in a good mood. They might give you a wag when they see you coming toward them, and they’ll probably shake their tail a lot when they see food. [1] X Research source Your duck might also quack at you as they waggle their tail. When you’re feeding ducks, you can be sure they’re shaking their tail feather out of pure happiness."

      "title": "They’re shaking off water.",
      "content": "They’re shaking off water. Even though duck feathers are waterproof, it’s pretty common for water beads to stay on their feathers when they leave the water. When this happens, the duck will shake their tail to fling off the beads of water. [2] X Research source If you see a duck wagging their tail right after a swim, they're probably trying to dry off. Similarly, your duck might shake off the water after it rains."

      "title": "They’re calming themselves down.",
      "content": "They’re calming themselves down. In the wild, ducks encounter some big stressors, like predators. After going through an anxious situation, the duck may shake their tail to help them release the excess energy. It’s just a way for them to calm down after a stressful moment. [3] X Research source If you see a wild duck shaking their tail, it's much more likely that the duck is stressed rather than happy. That is, unless you’re carrying some food."

      "title": "It helps them balance while walking.",
      "content": "It helps them balance while walking. Ducks typically have short legs and a chubby body, so they don’t have great balance. Because of this, they waddle when they walk. Sometimes, ducks wiggle their tail when they walk to help them stay balanced so they don’t fall over. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "They’re trying to attract a mate.",
      "content": "They’re trying to attract a mate. Male ducks typically wiggle their tails as part of their courtship rituals. They’ll also stretch out their neck, wag their head, and stick out their breast. Additionally, the ducks will flap their wings to impress the lady ducks. When they see a female they like, the male will whistle and spray water at her. [5] X Research source In some cases, you may see multiple male ducks circling the female ducks. Occasionally, female ducks will also waggle their tail when they’re trying to attract a mate. However, it’s much more common in male ducks. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "The duck might be cold.",
      "content": "The duck might be cold. Sometimes it’s hard to tell if your duck is shivering or just shaking their tail. If it’s shivering, your duck may be cold. [7] X Research source If it’s chilly outside, that could be your explanation. In some cases, shivering is actually caused by an illness, so take your duck to the vet if they continue to shiver or if it’s not cold out."

    {
      "title": "They might be sick.",
      "content": "They might be sick. Although their feathers are waterproof, ducks can get an illness called wet feather. This happens when the duck’s preen gland no longer makes enough oil to coat their feathers. [8] X Research source When a duck has wet feather, they may shake their tail more often to try to get dry. If you suspect your duck has wet feather, take your duck to the vet for a diagnosis and treatment. [9] X Research source Your duck could be shivering because of a viral or fungal infection. Common duck illnesses include pneumonia, duck viral hepatitis, and Newcastle disease."

      "title": "Yes, all ducks wag their tails.",
      "content": "Yes, all ducks wag their tails. While ducks have different reasons to wag their tails, they all do it. Wild ducks are more likely to shake their tail because they’re stressed or shedding water. Domesticated ducks may also show happiness and excitement when they see you. Tail wagging is just part of a duck’s life. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Happy ducks quack and bob their heads.",
      "content": "Happy ducks quack and bob their heads. It'll look like your duck is nodding their head, “Yes.” Additionally, their quack will sound upbeat, typically in a “quack-quack, quack-quack” cadence. A happy duck might also shake their tail while they’re doing this. [11] X Research source You can take this as a sign that your duck is absolutely delighted."

      "content": "Angry ducks often charge at what is scaring them. When a duck gets mad, they’ll extend their neck and run toward you at full speed. [12] X Research source If you want to avoid conflict, simply run away from the duck. However, keep in mind that the duck may continue to get aggressive with you every time you come around."

      "title": "Stressed ducks are lethargic, weak, and disinterested.",
      "content": "Stressed ducks are lethargic, weak, and disinterested. Your bird may at first stop laying as many eggs as usual. If the stressor continues, they’ll lay around and may even become lame over time. Additionally, your stressed duck may not want to eat and could throw up any food they do consume. [13] X Research source Common stressors for ducks include a new duck, changing seasons, illness, or parasites."
