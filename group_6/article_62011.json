To tie a Brahmin style dhoti, you make two folds in the back and one in the front. [1] X Research source To start, hold the fabric horizontally behind you. Make sure the colored bands are at the top (at your waist) and facing outward."

Arrange the cloth so that you have equal amounts of fabric on the right and left sides. With the material from the left side, pull the cloth taut and wrap it around your waist. Hold the cloth at your right hip, letting the excess drape down your side to the ground. Wrap the material from the right side around your waist and hold it at your left hip. Pull the material so it’s snug around your waist. At the waist, fold the material down by about an inch (2.5 cm). Then fold it again by another inch to hold it in place."

To make the first fold: Pick up the top layer of material that’s hanging from your left hip. Hold the material straight out in front of you. Make a two- to four-inch (five- to 10-cm) vertical fold in the end of the material to fold the fabric back on itself toward your body. Make a second accordion-style fold in the material in the same way. Continue making folds like this until you’ve made about six accordion folds in the fabric. Tuck the top three or four inches (7.5 to 10 cm) of the folded material into the waistband of the cloth. [2] X Research source"

Smooth it out so it isn't twisted or bunched up. Hold the corner of the fabric and orient it so the decorative band on the horizontal edge is vertical in front of you. Make about 10 accordion folds in the fabric, until you have folded the entire vertical panel of fabric. Flatten and smooth out the material so the folds are neat and straight."

[13] X Research source In the south of India, the dhoti is often paired with the Angavastram or the chokka, which are both unstitched pieces of cloth. The angavastram and chokka get draped over the shoulders. [14] X Research source It’s not necessary to wear undergarments with it. The dhoti is popular in hot climates, so it’s important to keep cool by wearing fewer layers. [15] X Research source"
