      "content": "\"Taylor’s Version\" means the album was rerecorded by Taylor. Taylor Swift is in the process of rerecording her first 6 albums so she can own her master recordings. When you see \"Taylor’s Version\" next to an album title, it means the album has successfully been rerecorded and Swift owns the rights to it. [1] X Research source Swift has released \"Taylor’s Versions\" of her albums Fearless , Speak Now , Red , and 1989 and will release Taylor’s Versions of Reputation and her self-titled album Taylor Swift in the future. Swift already owns the rights to her albums Lover , Folklore , Evermore , Midnights , and The Tortured Poets Department , so those albums will not be rerecorded and are not marked as \"Taylor’s Version.\" \"Taylor’s Version\" albums also include tracks “From the Vault” which means they’re songs that Swift recorded for the original version of the album that didn’t make the final cut."

She stated that the sale was her “worst case scenario” and accused Borchetta of selling to Braun despite her known opposition. [5] X Research source Swift stated that she had asked for the right to own her work for years but was always refused. Instead, she was given the opportunity to re-sign with Big Machine and earn the rights to a previous album with each new album she recorded.
