The z test uses a normal distribution while the t test uses the Student's t distribution. Degrees of freedom are needed in t testing, not in z testing. The z statistic is calculated with the standard error. The t statistic uses the estimated standard error. The z test is used for testing proportions when np > 10 and n(1 - p) > 10. The t test is not used for proportion testing."
