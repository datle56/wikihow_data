    {
      "title": "Look for red, scaly patches.",
      "content": "Look for red, scaly patches. A yeast infection often looks like a rash that has a scaly surface. It will be dark red or pink, with pimple-like bumps spread throughout. Your rash could be small or widespread across a large affected area, so don't dismiss your redness just because it's small. [1] X Research source Sometimes the patches will look circular, but they can also be more formless. Check in warm, moist locations on your body. The center of each patch might become lighter in color or shade than the rest of the patch."

      "title": "Notice if you're scratching your red patches.",
      "content": "Notice if you're scratching your red patches. A yeast infection on your skin will cause itching and possibly burning, so consider how often you catch yourself scratching the area or adjusting your clothes to help you find relief. If your rash is not itching, then it may not be a yeast infection. [2] X Research source Itching alone does not mean that your rash is a yeast infection. If the infection is on your foot, you may notice that the itching becomes worse after you take off your shoes or socks."

    {
      "title": "Look for red pustules.",
      "content": "Look for red pustules. The red pustules may resemble small pimples and are most likely to occur around the edge of your red patch. Itching makes the pustules worse, and scratching can cause them to ooze. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider the location of the rash.",
      "content": "Consider the location of the rash. Yeast infections are more likely to occur on skin that is warm and moist, such as the areas under your arms, around your groin, the folds beneath your buttocks, under your breasts, on your feet, or between fingers and toes. Yeast especially thrives in the folds of skin, such as under breasts or around skin folds. [4] X Research source Warm, moist places are more likely to be effected by a yeast infection. Take a closer look at redness near skin folds."

    {
      "title": "Check your risk factors.",
      "content": "Check your risk factors. People who are obese, have diabetes, are taking antibiotics, or have a weakened immune system are more likely to get a yeast infection. Yeast infections are also more common if a person has been experiencing poor hygiene or wears tight clothing. [5] X Research source Hot, humid weather is also a risk factor for yeast infections, so consider the environment and season. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "See your doctor.",
      "content": "See your doctor. Your doctor can examine your skin cells under a microscope to give you the most accurate diagnosis, ensuring that you're on the right treatment plan. [7] X Research source Yeast infections can require a prescription anti-fungal to properly heal, which you will need to obtain from a doctor. [8] X Research source Your doctor can prescribe you both a topical cream and an oral antifungal. [9] X Research source There are many skin disorders that look similar to yeast infections, such as seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, or Lyme disease. Your doctor will be able to tell you for certain if you have a yeast infection or one of these other conditions."

    {
      "title": "Try a natural treatment method.",
      "content": "Try a natural treatment method. Coconut oil and tea tree oil are both commonly available natural antifungals that you can use on your yeast infection. Both coconut oil and tea tree oil kill fungi, including yeast. To use coconut oil, smooth it onto your skin 3 times a day. You should see reduced redness after about a week of treatment. To use tea tree oil, apply 2-3 drops of oil onto your infection 3 times a day. Expect the treatment to take a few weeks before you see results."

    {
      "title": "Use over-the-counter antifungals.",
      "content": "Use over-the-counter antifungals. You can purchase several topical antifungals over-the-counter that will treat your yeast infection. While you will commonly find them in the department that specializes in foot care, you can treat your yeast infection with some of the same products used to treat athlete's foot. Try antifungals like clotrimazole, such as Lotrimin AF, or miconazole, which includes Desenex or Neosporin AF. These antifungal brands are widely available at department stores and online retailers. [10] X Research source Smoothe the product over the entire affected area. Reapply twice daily. You may not see an improvement until 2-4 weeks of treatment have passed. Consult your product packaging for more information."

      "title": "Keep your skin dry.",
      "content": "Keep your skin dry. When possible, allow air to circulate around the affected area by wearing loose clothing or leaving the area uncovered. Because of the locations where yeast thrives, it's not always possible to air it out; however, it's still possible to take steps to keep the area dry. [11] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Avoid hot, humid areas. Towel off throughout the day. If you can, allow air to circulate around your skin. Don't bandage the area, and choose clothing that either leaves the area uncovered or hangs loosely around it."

      "title": "Use moisture-absorbing powders.",
      "content": "Use moisture-absorbing powders. Cornstarch and talcum powders soak up moisture, including sweat. They can also act as a soothing agent on your skin, which will improve your comfort level while your rash heals. You can find several options available on the market, or you can choose to use basic cornstarch. [12] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Avoid breathing in the powder. Some people are concerned that using talcum powder around the genital area in women can lead to ovarian cancer, so you may want to minimize your use of the powder if your yeast infection is near your groin.

      "title": "Wear loose, moisture-wicking clothing.",
      "content": "Wear loose, moisture-wicking clothing. Choose breathable clothing options such as natural fibers or moisture-wicking microfiber. Avoid tight-fitting clothes, which encourage yeast to grow. [14] X Research source Try to wear cotton underwear and socks. Cotton may be able to help prevent yeast infections because it is breathable. [15] X Research source Avoid layering your clothing on warm days. On cold days, wear more layers so that you can take off heavy clothing when you're indoors."

      "title": "Use good hygiene.",
      "content": "Use good hygiene. Good hygiene is essential for healing and preventing yeast infections; poor hygiene can actually make your yeast infection worse. In addition to taking regular showers or baths, you can use disposable cleaning cloths to refresh yourself after you get sweaty. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Control your blood sugar if you are diabetic. Fungal infections, such as yeast infections of the skin, are common in people with diabetes. If you have diabetes, make sure that you keep your blood sugar under control and keep your skin clean and dry. Follow your doctor's instructions for controlling your blood sugar and take any prescribed medications as directed."
