      "title": "Choose a natural form of vitamin E oil.",
      "content": "Choose a natural form of vitamin E oil. Your body can more easily absorb and utilize natural forms of vitamin E. The synthetic version of vitamin E is called alpha-tocopherol acetate. This form may react with some beauty products, so it is best to choose a natural form of vitamin E oil, which you can find in a health food store, the vitamin aisle of a well-stocked grocery store, or online. Some food grade oils contain vitamin E as well, such as wheat germ oil, sunflower oil, and almond oil. [3] X Research source Look on the packaging for d-alpha tocopherol, d-alpha tocopheryl acetate, or d-alpha tocopheryl succinate."

      "content": "Test the oil on your skin before using. Some people are sensitive to vitamin E oil, so it is a good idea to test a little on your skin before using it on your hair. You can also develop a sensitivity to vitamin E oil over time, so pay attention to how the skin on your scalp looks and feels after a few days of using vitamin E oil. [4] X Research source To test the oil, apply 1-2 drops to the inside of your wrist and then massage it in. Wait 24 hours and then check your wrist to see how it looks. If there is any redness, dryness, itching or swelling, do not use the oil. If the area looks and feels normal, then you can use the oil."

      "title": "Consider taking a vitamin E supplement to promote hair growth.",
      "content": "Consider taking a vitamin E supplement to promote hair growth. A very small study showed Vitamin E may be effective at promoting hair growth when taken as an oral supplement. Try taking two 50 mg capsules of vitamin E oil daily after eating a meal. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, you could take one capsule after breakfast and the other one after dinner. As with any supplement, make sure that you check with your doctor first. Incorporate additional natural sources of vitamin E into your diet, too. Try nuts, seeds, green leafy vegetables, and plant oils, especially wheat germ and sunflower seed oil. You will get more vitamins from eating foods that are naturally high in vitamin E than taking a supplement."

      "title": "Consider adding vitamin C.",
      "content": "Consider adding vitamin C. Vitamins E and C go well together because, in tandem, they are more effective at protecting hair and skin from damaging ultraviolet radiation. If you're taking topical vitamin E, you should take topical vitamin C. Similarly, if you take oral vitamin E, you should take oral vitamin C. These two will be more effective than either on their own."
