      "content": "Let your skin recover after using a razor or another depilatory cream. If you’ve had recent prolonged sun exposure or sun burns, wait for your skin to return to normal before applying Magic Shaving Powder . Consult a dermatologist if you have skin inflammation, abrasions, or sores on the area you want to de-hair. [1] X Research source Use a depilatory cream like Magic Shaving Powder if you suffer from frequent razor burn or bumps after using a razor. The ingredients in Magic Shaving Powder can irritate sensitive or damaged skin, so only apply it to healthy, happy skin. You don’t need a razor or any other product to use Magic Shaving Powder—no shaving required!"

If you don’t have a spoon, any hard, thin object will work—try a key, a Swiss army knife, or even the tip of a pen. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix 0.5 tsp (4.9 g) of powder with an equal amount of water. If you’re using it on your face, choose a small area of your beard to test it out on (try somewhere inconspicuous like underneath the jaw). If you’re using it on another body part, test it somewhere hidden, like the top of your thigh near your buttocks. [3] X Research source Leave the mixture on for 5 minutes, then rinse it away thoroughly. Wait 24 hours—if there are no signs of irritation or redness, you’re safe to use the Magic Shaving Powder on larger patches of skin. The active ingredients are calcium thioglycolate, calcium carbonate, and calcium hydroxide (the same as most other depilatory creams)."

      "content": "Mix 2 tsp (9.8 g) of powder and 2 tsp (9.9 mL) of water to treat beards. If you’re slathering it over a large area like your legs, start by doubling that amount and then mix more powder and water as needed to cover the desired area. Add the water in small amounts while mixing with a spoon until you get a toothpaste-like consistency. [4] X Research source Aim to make a paste that’s not too thick to spread around your skin easily, but not so runny that it’s dripping onto the floor. Mix the ingredients in a bowl, mug, or any other container you have on hand."

      "content": "Spread an even layer over your beard, leg hair, armpits, or other areas. Make a thin layer with your hands (you don’t need a thick glob) that covers every patch of skin you want to treat. If you run out, quickly stir more powder and water together to make extra mixture. [5] X Research source Unlike a regular shave, don’t wash or exfoliate your skin beforehand (you’ll increase your chance of dry or red skin). [6] X Research source Use the cream formula for your scalp for a bald or shaved look. Scalp skin is thin and might be irritated by the regular formula. Magic Shaving Powder is designed to be used on the face. However, beauty influencers have had success on their legs and underarms, too. Do not apply Magic Shaving Powder to your genitals since the skin there is thin and sensitive. Side effects could include redness, dryness, or a burning feeling."

      "content": "Leave the mixture on no longer than 7 minutes to avoid skin irritation. If it gets extra dry, remoisten the mixture with a small amount of clean water. Let a few droplets drip from your hand or squeeze a damp washcloth over the area, then rub the water into the paste. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a clean, damp washcloth to rub the powder off your skin.",
      "content": "Use a clean, damp washcloth to rub the powder off your skin. Apply light pressure to clean up all chemicals and loose hairs, and rinse the cloth clean after each swipe. Use a skincare spatula to remove the paste if you prefer to scrape (it’s what the instructions say), or substitute a spoon or credit card. [8] X Research source Keep an eye out for severe irritation while you wipe up. Very slight redness or dryness is nothing to be concerned about unless it’s painful."

      "title": "Splash the area clean with water only—no soap.",
      "content": "Splash the area clean with water only—no soap. Be thorough and make sure to get every last bit of powder off so it doesn’t linger and irritate your skin. Jump in the shower to clear off large areas like your legs or arms more efficiently. Wait at least a few hours to use soap on your face or body since it can make any dryness or redness from the powder worse. [9] X Research source Try not to rub or scrub your skin very hard in case it’s a bit more sensitive after the depilation. Don’t apply any aftershave products containing alcohol after your rinse. Use alcohol-free aftershave or moisturizer instead."

      "title": "Space out your applications to keep your skin healthy.",
      "content": "Space out your applications to keep your skin healthy. Allow your skin to restore its natural hair cycle and oils before dehairing again. Depilatories keep you fairly hairless for up to 4 days, so try to wait at least 2 days between sessions. A 4.5 oz (127.5 g) can lasts for 10 to 15 uses. If you apply every 3-4 days, one container can last 30 to 60 days. If you apply too frequently, you’re more likely to experience dryness, itching, irritation, or sensitivity."
