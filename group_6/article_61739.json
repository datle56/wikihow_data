      "title": "Buy a kitchen torch.",
      "content": "Buy a kitchen torch. Look for a kitchen torch that has a fuel gauge, so that you can keep on eye on how much fuel is left in your torch. It is also wise to pick one that has hands-free operation, which will allow you to operate the torch without constantly holding down the ‘on’ button. You can purchase a kitchen torch at specialty kitchen stores or online. Kitchen torches cost between $30 and $60. You can get kitchen torches that use gas, butane or other fuels. If you purchase a torch online, make sure you know where to purchase the fuel in your neighborhood so that you can easily get refills. Typically, the fuel canisters will screw onto the back of a kitchen torch."

Clear a surface for torching by removing any flammables such as kitchen towels and plastic items. Place a sturdy metal tray or cast iron grill on your kitchen counter or stovetop to prepare for torching. Finally, you should wear a kitchen apron and make sure your clothing does not get in the way of the flame. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that a kitchen torch can melt common metals such as aluminum and copper. [3] X Research source For instance, acrylic clothing and fleece jackets tend to be quite flammable."

      "content": "Light the torch and wait for a blue flame. You need to light the torch prior to exposing it to food. Once it is lit, you will need to wait a few seconds for the yellow or orange flame to go away. Once you see a small, hissing, blue flame, you are ready to torch. [5] X Research source If you torch your food prior to seeing the small, blue flame, you may get torch taste. Torch taste is caused by fuel contaminating your food. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure you have a clean nozzle. If you or others use the blow torch a lot, the nozzle will get dirty. If there are food items covering the nozzle, it could lead to poor aim. You could also end up with poor flavor, since you may end up getting bits of old food on the dish you are cooking. If the nozzle is dirty, you can clean it with a rag or dish cloth."

      "title": "Aim the torch away from your body.",
      "content": "Aim the torch away from your body. The torch should be pointing away from your body, including your other hand. It is not uncommon to get second and third degree burns from a kitchen torch. In addition, you should make sure that you are wearing appropriate clothing and that it is not in the way of the flame, in order to avoid lighting yourself on fire."

Lightly torch the surface to give it a bit of a crisp outside. Then, put it in the oven following your normal recipe.

After cooking steaks, burgers or veggies on the stovetop, use your blowtorch to make grill lines.

If you are making a pie, for instance, use your torch to caramelize the sugar on top. When the pie is out of the oven, gently burn the sugar on top until it looks brown and crunchy. Similarly, you can caramelize sugar on top of fruits like grapefruit or peaches. [11] X Research source"
