If you’re not getting positive reinforcement or encouragement from the people around you, life coach Sandra Possing recommends “finding validation within yourself.” You can build self-confidence by getting to know yourself and practicing self-care , or by looking at an inspirational quote everyday to remind yourself that you’re strong, worthy, and bound for success! [6] X Research source To express pride in yourself in a humble way, repeat positive affirmations aloud and recognize your achievements. You might say, “I’m really proud of how the project turned out. I spent months researching our customers, and I believe all my efforts paid off.” Remember, boasting about yourself isn’t inherently bad, but think about your motivations before expressing your achievements. If you’re bragging about something to impress others, for example, that will likely come off as arrogant. If you’re expressing an accomplishment after enduring struggles, on the other hand, that’s more likely to be perceived as inspirational."

Rather, you could say, “I'm so happy because you studied so hard” or “Congratulations—you deserve it after all your hard work!”"
