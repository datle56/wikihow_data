      "title": "Ladies achieve their physical peak in their 20s.",
      "content": "Ladies achieve their physical peak in their 20s. The human body is at its most fit in the early to mid-twenties. Once a woman reaches 30, her metabolism begins to slow down. That continues all the way through the end of her life. [1] X Research source This is the same for men, who peak physically around 25-30."

      "title": "Women are at their sharpest mentally in their 20s.",
      "content": "Women are at their sharpest mentally in their 20s. The human brain fully develops around the 20s, stays sharp through the 30s, and then things begin to slowly wear down. This mainly has to do with the brain’s white matter, which is responsible for processing information. [2] X Research source This doesn’t mean that women are smarter in their 20s, just that their ability to process information mentally, think creatively, or generate novel ideas is at its peak during this time."

      "title": "Women reach their sexual peak in their early 30s.",
      "content": "Women reach their sexual peak in their early 30s. Women tend to reach the apex of their sexuality in their late 20s or early 30s. Studies have proven that if you measure the frequency of orgasms, women are orgasming the most often in their early 30s. Unlike men, who reach their peak in their 20s and then decline over time, women can reach their peak and stay there for up to 20 years! [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source A big factor here is that women can achieve orgasm through a variety of sensations and factors, so figuring out what “works” can take a little time.

      "title": "Ladies fully mature emotionally by their early 30s.",
      "content": "Ladies fully mature emotionally by their early 30s. Women, on average, mature about 3 years earlier than men do when it comes to emotional intelligence. This is when a woman is most likely to pick up on subtle emotional signs or perceive things others miss. [5] X Research source This is also when a woman is at the apex of her maturity in general. This isn’t to say that women who are older than their early 30s aren’t emotionally mature. It just appears that women become more inward-looking and internally thoughtful as they get older."

      "title": "In their 40s, women reach the peak of their earning power.",
      "content": "In their 40s, women reach the peak of their earning power. Women have the most negotiating and earning power in their early- to mid-40s. They’ve usually got more than a decade of experience under their belt by this time, and younger employees or managers won’t (wrongly) assume they’re “too old.” [6] X Research source In countries outside of the US, Canada, France, Germany, and Sweden, older women are more likely to be perceived as wiser than their younger counterparts. As a result, they may have more earning power. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Women achieve their intellectual peak in their late 50s.",
      "content": "Women achieve their intellectual peak in their late 50s. Women stay intellectually sharp for much longer than men do, and by the time a woman has reached her 50s, she’s at the top of her game. She’s finished any degrees, gotten some job experience, and acquired a lifetime of information to help her tackle problems and solve challenges. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Women reach the apex of their careers in their 50s or 60s.",
      "content": "Women reach the apex of their careers in their 50s or 60s. For many women, the kids are finally out of the house, their partners are starting to take it easy, and they finally get the space in their lives to pour energy into their careers. This is when women are most likely to land positions of power or end up in managerial roles, so don’t sweat it if you aren’t getting promoted early on. [9] X Research source This is actually fairly unique compared to men, who tend to get promoted earlier but leave the workforce faster. Women tend to join the workforce later, and get promoted later as well. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "title": "The 50s and 60s are when women can really relax.",
      "content": "The 50s and 60s are when women can really relax. By the time a woman is in her late 50s and early 60s, she has time to kick back and enjoy the fruits of her labors. She’s likely slowing down in her career and focusing on any passion projects that might contribute to her legacy. Any children she might have tend to be fully self-sufficient by now, and she can enjoy a fulfilling retirement. [11] X Research source"
