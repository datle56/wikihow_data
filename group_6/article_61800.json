      "content": "Choose one of Apple's MP3 players. If you don't own one yet, the iPod touch, Nano, and Shuffle devices all play music. From there, they branch off in different directions. Find the one that fits your budget and lifestyle. Jump ahead to Step 2 if you already own an iPod MP3 player. iPod Shuffle: The smallest and cheapest of the iPod line, the Shuffle is slightly bigger than a postage stamp and can hold 2 gigabytes (GB) of music. You operate the Shuffle by pressing physical buttons on its face. As an added bonus, it clips to your clothes, perfect if you like to listen to music while working out. iPod Nano: The Nano is Apple's middle-of-the-road device. It sports a 2.5-inch touchscreen, runs around $150, and holds up to 16 GB of music. The Nano also supports FM radio as well as workout features such as Nike+, which tracks your progress as you run. iPod touch: Nearly identical to the iPhone in shape, size, and color choices, the iPod touch comes in 16, 32, and 64 GB sizes. You can download apps and games, browse the Internet, check email, and do virtually anything else besides make a phone call."
