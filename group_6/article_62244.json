      "content": "A WASP mom is a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant mother. On a very literal level, a WASP mom is just a mother who happens to have a WASP background. That means she’s white, Protestant, and has an Anglo-Saxon background. The WASP mom stereotype pokes fun at how wealthy white moms are often a little demanding and annoying. [1] X Research source The WASP mom character was popularized on TikTok by comedian Caitlin Reilly. In these videos, she’d make skits about a well-to-do mom who drank too much wine and wasn’t that fond of her kids. [2] X Research source You can find a full playlist of the WASP mom skits here . Anglo-Saxon here is just shorthand for someone with a British (or generally “white European”) heritage. The historical Anglo-Saxons haven’t been around for centuries. [3] X Research source"

On a literal level, there’s nothing intrinsically wrong about being white, having a European background, being Protestant, or having kids. There are a lot of stereotypes about WASPs though—especially WASPs from the New England region of the United States. In those contexts, WASP mom can be used pejoratively.

This is the character the WASP mom plays up."

      "content": "Not necessarily, but the two do share some overlap. The “Karen” is a popular archetype of a (usually white) woman who is super needy, demanding, and uptight. Caitlin Reilley’s WASP mom character certainly has some Karen-esque tendencies, but Karen is a much broader term. The WASP mom is a riff on a pretty specific type of person—wealthy stay-at-home moms who like their wine a bit too much and find a way to annoy everyone around them. [5] X Research source Not all WASP moms are Karens and not all Karens are WASP moms, but there’s a pretty big overlap in that Venn diagram."
