It’s important to note that starting with a color other than white can be confusing if you are just starting. This is because you will have to imagine different colors in place of the ones in this article."

The color that the edges have must line up with both the white center and the center on the sides of the cube. The cross only needs a maximum of eight moves to become solved. (five or six in general). If you put a white edge piece in the correct place but it is flipped around, then try popping it out of the top layer and reinserting it correctly. If you are really struggling, then put the white edge pieces next to the yellow center instead and then rotate each edge piece above its correct center, bringing it down so it is now next to the white center instead. Place the cross at the bottom. Turn the cube over 180° so that the cross is now on the bottom."

      "content": "Solve the four corners of the first layer, one by one. You should also be able to place the corners without needing algorithms. To get you started, here is an example of one corner being solved: There are some algorithms if you cannot do it intuitively yet. Try turning the cube so the white is facing up again, and check to see which direction the corner points. If it faces right, you can do R’ D’ R. If it faces you, you can do D’ R’ D R. If it faces down, you can do F L D2 L’ F’. Another common method for solving a corner is to have it above the slot it needs to go in and repeat R U R’ U’ until it is solved. At the end of this step, the first layer should be complete, with a solid color (in this case, white) at the bottom."

The second algorithm is symmetrical to the first. If the edge piece is located in the last layer: (1.a) (1.b) symmetrical to (1.a) If the edge piece is in the middle layer but in the wrong place or with the wrong orientation, simply use the same algorithm to place any other edge piece in its position. Your edge piece will then be in the last layer, and you just have to use the algorithm again to position it properly in the middle layer."

      "content": "Permute the corners. At this step, our goal is to place the corners of the last layer in their correct position, regardless of their orientation. Locate two adjacent corners that share a color other than the color of the top layer (other than yellow in our case). Turn the top layer until these two corners are on the correct color side, facing you. For instance, if the two adjacent corners both contain red, turn the top layer until those two corners are on the red side of the cube. Note that on the other side, the two corners of the top layer will both contain the color of that side as well (orange in our example). Determine whether the two corners of the front side are in their correct position, and swap them if needed. In our example, the right side is green, and the left side is blue. Therefore the front corner on the right must contain green, and the front corner on the left must contain blue. If it is not the case, you will need to swap those two corners with the following algorithm: Swap 1 and 2 : (2.a) Do the same with the two corners at the back. Turn the cube around to place the other side (orange) in front of you. Swap the two front corners if needed. As an alternative, if you notice that both the front pair and the back pair of corners need to be swapped, you can do it with only one algorithm (note the huge similarity with the previous algorithm): Swap 1 with 2 and 3 with 4 : (2.b)"

You need to know only one algorithm to orient the corners: (3.a) The algorithm will rotate three corners on themselves at once (from the side to the top). The blue arrows show which three corners you are turning, and in which direction (clockwise). If the yellow stickers are the way shown on the pictures and you perform the algorithm once, you should end up with the four yellow stickers on top : It is also convenient to use the symmetrical algorithm (here the red arrows are counter-clockwise turns): (3.b) Symmetrical to (3.a) Note: performing one of these algorithms twice is equivalent to performing the other. In some cases, you will need to perform the algorithm more than once : Two correctly oriented corners : = = + = = + = = + No correctly oriented corner : = = + = = + More generally, apply (3.a) in those cases: Two correctly oriented corners : No correctly oriented corner :"

If all four edges are incorrectly positioned, perform one of the two algorithms once from any side. You will then have only one edge correctly positioned."

The pieces that compose the Rubik's Cube are called Cubies , and the color stickers on the cubes are called facelets . There are three types of Cubies: The centers (or center pieces), at the center of each face of the Cube. There are six of them, each have one facelet, they always stay in the same place relative to each other. The corners (or corner pieces), at the corners of the Cube. There are eight of them, and each have three facelets. The edges (or edge pieces), between each pair of adjacent corners. There are 12 of them and each have 2 facelets. Not all cubes have the same color schemes. The colors used for these illustrations is called BOY (because the Blue, Orange and Yellow faces are in clockwise order). Examine the positions of the centers relative to each other, as this is always your color scheme. White opposes yellow; Blue opposes green; Orange opposes red; Orange is to the right of blue if white is facing up."
