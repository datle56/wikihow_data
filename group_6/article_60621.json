Take deep breaths and picture yourself responding calmly. [2] X Research source For instance, let’s say you get called into your boss’s office and find out that your coworker blamed you for something they did. Don’t get upset and tell your boss about all of your coworker’s flaws. Instead, take a deep breath and count to 10. Then, calmly tell your boss that you aren’t working on that project but are happy to help. Say, “I didn’t realize that this project was behind because I’m not assigned to it. However, I’m happy to take it on.”"

[11] X Research source For instance, let’s say your workplace has a rule that you’re not allowed to use the company printers for personal items.

While it’s okay to have fun at work events, make sure you don’t cross the line into unprofessional behavior. Imagine that your boss is watching at all times, and avoid doing anything you wouldn’t want to discuss in a review of your job performance. For example, your office might have alcohol at company parties. It’s okay to enjoy a drink, but don’t have so many drinks that you lose your inhibitions. Similarly, you might have an overnight work trip with a coworker. While it’s okay to be friendly with them, don’t gossip about your other coworkers or reveal too much about your personal life."

If you don’t feel comfortable announcing your thoughts to the entire office, keep them to yourself. For example, a coworker might say, “I can’t believe Joe got that promotion. He’s late every day.” Don’t say, “I know! I can’t believe it either.” Instead, say something like, “Did you hear that we might be getting a new copier?” or “Do you know if there’s a fresh pot of coffee in the break room?”"

[13] X Research source You want your coworkers to feel like you’re helping them reach their goals, which will make them feel like you need them.
