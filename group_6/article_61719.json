      "content": "Sit in a chair with a back. Use the coccyx cushion in a chair with a back that will give you extra support. The cushion naturally helps improve your posture by slightly elevating your hips, and sitting in a chair with a back will help you sit up straight and eliminate pressure on your spine and pelvis. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source When using a cushion on a chair that is a comfortable height for you, your thighs may be slightly higher than usual. To offset this difference, try using a footstool to make sure your lower body is still in a comfortable position. If the chair is adjustable, then you can also adjust the height of the seat to make yourself more comfortable."

      "title": "Place the coccyx cushion directly on the seat.",
      "content": "Place the coccyx cushion directly on the seat. Do not use a coccyx cushion with other cushions. Adding extra pillows or cushions will cause you to sit unevenly and in turn, distribute your weight and pressure unevenly, which is unhealthy for your back. The placement of the cushion on the seat can either be flat or slightly sloping. This is most people's preference. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you need extra height, purchase a thicker coccyx cushion instead of adding extra pillows or padding. If you are putting the cushion on a very soft seat, like couch or plush chair, put a rigid board under the cushion for support."

      "content": "Upgrade your cushion if necessary. If the coccyx cushion isn't providing sufficient relief to your tailbone pain, then try a different one. For example, you use a coccyx cushion that is made of soft foam and find that it’s not alleviating the pain, upgrade to a cushion made of firmer, denser foam for more support. Cushioning is an individual need, so your cushion needs will be unique."

      "content": "Know what a coccyx cushion is and does. A coccyx cushion (sometimes called a wedge cushion) is a U-or V-shaped pillow that protects the coccyx from uncomfortable pressure. Some cushions are also formed as a wedge. The U- or V-shape, in comparison with the circular doughnut cushions, often provide more comfort for people with tailbone pain. These cushions can also be used to provide comfort for those with hemorrhoids (piles) pain, prostate disorders, pilonidal cysts or degenerative bone disease. [6] X Research source Doctors frequently recommend that patients use a coccyx cushion after back surgery to reduce pressure on the spinal column and tailbone. Coccyx cushions are also often used to help relieve pain from other chronic pain conditions and inflammatory pain or to relieve pressure on the back and pelvic area during pregnancy. Coccyx cushions differ from ring or doughnut cushions, which have a hole in the middle, and help reduce pressure on the anal and prostate region in cases of hemorrhoids and swollen prostate.

There are multiple things to consider when buying a coccyx cushion. Some are softer and thicker than others, some are inflatable, and others have washable covers. There are also cushions using different materials as padding and some may be more comfortable for you than others. Some of the materials used are memory foams, gels, semi-liquid gels, or other materials. Talk to your physician or orthopedic specialist to see if they have specific recommendations."

Most coccyx cushions are just regular cushions with a small opening on one side. You can get a large piece of memory foam or a memory foam pillow and cut out a small wedge on one side. Other creative options include duct taping together segments of a pool noodle, using a neck pillow, or filling a long sock with rice and bending it into a \"U\" shape."

Coccyx cushions are made in varying levels of thickness and firmness and it’s important that you select a coccyx cushion that’s comfortable for you.

Gel inserts can help provide a softer form of cushioning and will conform better to the particular contours of your body.
