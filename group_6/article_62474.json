In that case, you may be predisposed to androgenetic alopecia or alopecia areata (hair loss/lack of growth caused by genetics).

Hair loss can be passed down on either side of your family. Keep in mind that even the healthiest scalps shed around 150 hairs a day—it’s natural and expected!"

      "content": "Age While people of all ages can experience a lack of hair growth at any time throughout their life, hair growth tends to slow for men in their 30s and after menopause for women due to changes in hormone levels. The older you get, the shorter your hair cycle becomes, making it thinner and more prone to breakage. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Hair tends to get weaker with old age due to the accumulation of styling, processing, etc. and is also related to your diet and overall physical health."

      "title": "An underactive or overactive thyroid",
      "content": "An underactive or overactive thyroid Hypo and hyperthyroidism cause the thyroid to produce too much or too little of certain hormones like T3 and T4, which can contribute to thinning, brittle hair. If you struggle with fatigue and/or nervousness, your lack of hair growth may be caused by a thyroid disorder. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Weight gain (underactive thyroid) and weight loss (overactive thyroid) are other thyroid disorder symptoms. If you suspect you have an under or overactive thyroid, consult your doctor to check for a thyroid disorder and determine the best possible treatment. Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis are thyroid-related autoimmune disorders that may lead to hair loss. Other non-thyroid-related hormone disrupters, such as PCOS, childbirth, breastfeeding, and other postpartum complications, can also cause stunted hair growth."

      "content": "Poor diet Your body loves nutrient-rich foods packed with vitamins and minerals, so if you haven't been eating the best as of late, your hair growth might be slowing down as a result. Think of a nutrient-rich diet as the cup of coffee your hair needs to jump-start back into action! Maintaining an active lifestyle may also boost hair growth, as a quick metabolism contributes to the production of hair follicles."

      "title": "Psychological and physical stress",
      "content": "Psychological and physical stress Stress has been scientifically proven to cause hair loss, as it triggers a response that prematurely puts hair follicles into the telogen phase or the shedding phase of the hair-growth cycle. Telogen effluvium (temporary hair loss) tends to occur around 2-3 months after a stressful event, such as a big move or the loss of a loved one and may last for about 6 months. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Symptoms of telogen effluvium include rapid hair loss (over 150 strands present on your pillow, brush, etc.), thinning hair, and dry hairs that fall out easily. Participating in activities such as meditation or journaling are proven ways to reduce stress and improve both physical and mental health."

      "title": "Chemical treatments",
      "content": "Chemical treatments Chemical products and treatments like dye, bleach, and relaxers strip the hair follicle of its natural oils. This leads to split ends and further breakage, making it extremely challenging to grow your hair past a certain length. Keep your hair moisturized with conditioning masques around once a week to combat dryness from chemical treatments. To combat breakage and split ends, aim to get a trim once every 8 weeks. Remember that hair takes about a month to start growing again after a haircut."

      "title": "Styling Issues",
      "content": "Styling Issues If you’re constantly using heat and excessive products on your hair, such as multiple serums and oils, your hair has likely become brittle and prone to breakage, thus stunting your hair growth. Use a heat protectant before styling your hair with hot tools and be sure to thoroughly cleanse your scalp with shampoo on wash day to remove any product buildup. Tight hairstyles such as ponytails can also lead to breakage and split ends."

      "content": "Improper haircare routine Whether you’re a little too heavy-handed brushing your hair or use too little or too much product when washing your hair, you may be causing breakage and stunting your hair’s growth. To combat this, avoid washing your hair in hot water and develop a haircare routine suitable for your specific hair type and texture, like using a shampoo and conditioner made for fine hair, etc. Frequent washing also strips your hair of natural oils and can cause breakage, so aim to wash it no more than 2-3 times a week."

      "content": "Hair grows in a 3-part cycle. Regardless of type or texture, hair goes through a 3-part cycle, consisting of the Anagen, Catagen, and Telogen phases which can be described as follows: [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Anagen (growth): The most active phase of the hair growth cycle, the anagen phase forms new follicles and elongates your hair shafts. Hair follicles can be in the anagen phase for up to 4 years (anywhere from 80-90% of your hairs may be in the anagen phase right now!) Catagen (resting): During this transitional stage of hair growth, the lower portion of the follicle degenerates and stops growing (around 5% of your hair is in the catagen stage at any given time.) Telogen (shedding): In this final resting stage, the hair follicle becomes inactive and is held in place by a keratin bulb (white root at the top of a strand) until it falls out, and the hair growth cycle begins again."

[7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Not only do scalp massages feel great, but they also encourage blood flow to the scalp which can help with hair growth and thickness! To give yourself a scalp massage , gently run your fingers through your hair in circular motions, gradually working your way from the top of your scalp to the bottom for around 6 minutes, 1-2 times daily. Scalp massages are particularly helpful for those with hair loss in one patch or on a specific side of their head, as massaging that particular area will promote hair-boosting blood flow to the site."
