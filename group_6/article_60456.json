      "content": "Make a commitment to stop playing video games. You’re not going to get anywhere if deep down you don’t really want to stop.

      "content": "Give yourself a strict time limit when you do play. Note approximately how long you spend in front of the screen each day and make it a point to log off an hour early. If the thought of losing a whole hour doesn’t sit well with you, start with half an hour or even 20 minutes and gradually decrease your play time as you get more comfortable until you no longer feel the need to play at all. [4] X Expert Source Wes Pinkston Certified Holistic Life Coach Expert Interview. 18 January 2022. This kind of progressive reduction will make it easier for you to adjust.

[6] X Research source It could take weeks or even months to taper off your daily play time, and that's okay. The important thing is that you stick with it and fight the impulse to play for longer than your predetermined time frame."

      "content": "Have your friends or family help enforce your self-imposed time limit. Tell a parent or a responsible sibling or roommate about your desire to play less (and eventually stop altogether). Ask them to check in with you every now and then at agreed-upon times to make sure that you’re staying on track. You may respond better to pressure that’s coming from an outside source. [7] X Research source Tell your loved one to be as firm as they need to be, even if it means forcibly turning off your console or hiding your gaming equipment from you. If you often play with other gamers online or in-person, inform them of your intention to quit, as well. Hopefully, they'll be supportive of your decision, but if not, you'll at least be giving them a heads up that they may not be seeing as much of you."

      "content": "Restrict yourself to only playing later in the day. Make gaming a reward that you give yourself for being productive and completing your important daily duties. If you always hop on first thing in the morning, you run the risk of getting sucked into a prolonged session when you should be getting ready for work, school, or other responsibilities. [8] X Research source It will be much easier to control your urge to play before you begin than after you’ve already started. Be sure to apply your regular time limit to your evening sessions to keep yourself from staying up too late. Pulling an all-nighter will only make it harder to do what you need to do the next day."

      "content": "Summon the resolve to walk away once and for all. This is probably the simplest and most effective way to break a destructive gaming addiction. Just put down the controller and don’t look back. It will require tremendous willpower, no doubt. Over time, however, it will get easier, to the point where video games no longer have the same hold over you that they once did. [12] X Research source Anytime you're tempted to sit down and play, take it as a challenge to get stronger.

      "content": "Put your gaming equipment away where you can't easily get to it. Box up your console and games and stow them in the attic or basement, on a high shelf in your closet, or in another spot that’s not readily accessible. It’s much easier to give something up for good if it’s not staring you in the face all the time. [14] X Research source Actually make it hard for yourself.

Then, make an effort to police yourself when using your computer in the future. [15] X Research source"

You can also sell newer systems and titles back to stores that accept used games and put the money you get towards other hobbies or pastimes.
