      "content": "Take collagenase injections to break down the plaques. Collagenase, or Xiaflex, is the only FDA-approved medication for Peyronie’s disease. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Ask your doctor about getting collagenase injections into your penis to help break down the plaques, or scar tissue. Your doctor may recommend collagenase treatments if you have a moderate to severe curve in your penis (30–90°) along with a scar tissue buildup that you can easily feel under the skin. If you have a curve larger than 90° in your penis, consider getting surgical correction. If you’re worried about pain from the injection, ask your doctor to numb the area before giving you the shot. Collagenase injections work best when they’re used together with “modeling.” During a modeling treatment, your doctor will carefully bend your penis in the opposite direction of the curve caused by the plaque. You may need to receive several injections and modeling sessions before you get the desired results. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Get verapamil injections to reduce pain and scarring. Verapamil is a blood pressure medication that may also help prevent your body from producing too much collagen, one of the proteins that causes scar tissue to build up in your penis. Injections of verapamil can also help reduce pain associated with Peyronie's disease. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Ask your doctor about verapamil if you have relatively mild curvature in your penis or if you’re concerned about the risks of using collagenase. Verapamil has the advantage of being less costly than some other treatment options. [6] X Research source Verapamil also has relatively few side effects, so it is considered a safe treatment for Peyronie’s disease. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Possible side effects include pain, swelling, bruising, nausea, and dizziness. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Ask your doctor if they can numb the area before giving you the injection."

      "content": "Try interferon injections to treat pain. Interferon is a type of protein that your body releases to help boost your immune system’s disease-fighting power. While interferon is still being researched as an effective treatment for Peyronie’s disease, early studies show that it may significantly improve the pain associated with Peyronie’s disease with a low risk of side effects. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Talk to your doctor about trying interferon as an alternative to collagenase. More research is needed to determine whether interferon injections can be effectively used to treat penile curvature and plaque formation. The most common side effects of interferon injections include pain, swelling, bruising, and flu-like symptoms (such as fever, chills, tiredness, and muscle aches). [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source As with other types of injected medications, your doctor will probably be able to numb the area before giving you the injection."

      "title": "Ask your doctor about oral medications to shrink the plaques.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor about oral medications to shrink the plaques. If you’d rather avoid getting injections to treat your Peyronie's disease, there are oral medications that may help. Some of these medications can reduce the size of the plaques or scar tissue in your penis, while others may minimize pain and inflammation. However, it’s still unclear how effective any of these treatments are. Ask your doctor about options such as: [11] X Research source Pentoxifylline, an anti-inflammatory medication that may help reduce the amount of scar tissue in your penis and is usually the first line of oral therapy. [12] X Trustworthy Source Nature Respected Multidisciplinary Scientific Journal Go to source Vitamin E, which may help shrink the plaques and straighten your penis, though it is not shown to be more effective than other treatments. Potassium amino-benzoate, a form of vitamin B which may help reduce the size of plaques associated with Peyronie’s disease. However, it does not help reduce the curve. Tamoxifen, a type of anti-estrogen drug that may help break down the scar tissue in the plaques. Colchicine paired with vitamin E and ibuprofen has also been shown to improve plaque size. Carnitine, an antioxidant that can reduce inflammation and promote better healing of damaged tissues."

      "content": "Discuss using over-the-counter medications to manage pain. Fortunately, the pain from Peyronie’s disease isn’t usually severe and it often goes away on its own once the plaques finish forming. However, if the pain bothers you, anti-inflammatory pain medications can help. Talk to your doctor about using a medication such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve), or acetaminophen (Tylenol) to treat your pain. [13] X Research source Let your doctor know if you are taking any other medications or supplements before taking pain medications. They can help you avoid potentially harmful drug interactions."

However, your doctor may recommend it if your condition is severe and other treatments aren’t working. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks and benefits of getting surgery. You may be a good candidate if: [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You have a severe bend in your penis or your condition prevents you from having sex.

      "content": "Have the long side of your penis sutured if the curve is less severe. If the curve in your penis is only moderately severe, your surgeon may recommend shortening the side of your penis opposite the curve. This involves either making an incision or folding the tissue over on the long side of the penis to straighten it out, then suturing it in place with surgical thread. [17] X Research source This type of procedure is relatively safe, but it may cause your penis to appear shorter. You may be a good candidate for this kind of surgery if you have little or no erectile dysfunction, your penis is mildly to moderately curved, and your penis is long."

      "content": "Get grafting done for more severe curvature. If your penis is severely curved or the plaque has caused your shaft to become very narrow, your surgeon may recommend a graft. In this type of surgery, the surgeon cuts directly into the plaque on the curved side of the penis to relieve tension and help the penis straighten out. They may also remove some of the plaque. They will then take a piece of tissue from another part of your body (such as behind your ear) to fill the space that is left behind.

Ask your doctor about how to perform these stretches correctly and how often to do them. [21] X Research source Your doctor may recommend using a mechanical device to help stretch your penis rather than doing it by hand. [22] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This is called traction therapy.
