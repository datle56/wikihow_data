[1] X Research source Magma makes you immune to physical damage (unless you're below level 750) and creates a similar effect to Venom, leaving a damage-per-second tick on the Boss. [2] X Research source The drop chance for his sword is pretty low, so you'll probably end up defeating this boss a few times before you get it. It's a longsword, even though Diamond looks like he's wielding a cutlass."
