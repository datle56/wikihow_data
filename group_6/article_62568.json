Then, peel back 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) of the backing paper, so part of the sticky side is exposed. Take a moment to center and place your cupboard door front-side-down on the vinyl wrapping. This way, the top of the vinyl wrap will stick to the top 2 in (5.1 cm) of the cupboard door. [8] X Research source Try to leave around 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of vinyl hanging off each side of the cabinet door, so you can wrap it along the inside of the door."
