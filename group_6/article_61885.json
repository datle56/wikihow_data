      "content": "Drive to the Googleplex in Mountainview, California. Google's headquarters is located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in the city of Mountain View, California. If you’re driving from San Francisco, take the US-101 South to the Rengstorff Avenue exit. From there, continue to Amphitheatre Parkway. [1] X Research source The Google campus is open for tourists to walk around 7 days a week. However, most office buildings are closed on weekends. To keep with the theme of your trip, use Google maps to plot out your journey efficiently. Google has 35 office and retail locations spread throughout the United States. Other U.S. cities that house Google offices include Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, New York, and Portland."

      "title": "Access Google's headquarters by train and bus instead of driving.",
      "content": "Access Google's headquarters by train and bus instead of driving. Take either the number 32 or number 40 Mountain View city buses to the Googleplex. Both buses also have stops close to the San Antonio Caltrain station, allowing you to get to Google's headquarters from San Francisco, San Jose, or South Bay. [2] X Research source Caltrain is a commuter rail service that operates within the San Francisco Bay Area region. If you take the Mountain View city buses, the nearest stop to the Googleplex is Charleston & Google. From there, it’s about a 0.2 mile (0.3 km) walk to Google HQ. If you’re taking the Caltrain, get off at the Mountain View Caltrain Station and transfer to Mountain View city bus #40. Take this bus to the Charleston & Google stop, then walk the 0.2 miles (0.3 km) to the Googleplex. A day pass for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority costs $7.50 while a one-way ticket costs $2.50 (for adults). [3] X Research source A day pass for the Caltrain costs $7.50 while a one-way ticket costs $3.75. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Park in one of the lots on the north end of the campus (if you’re driving). There are 5 large parking lots for the Googleplex located at the top of the campus. Get to these lots by driving north down North Shoreline Boulevard, which intersects with the east end of Amphitheatre Parkway. The best part? Parking here is completely free! [5] X Research source The parking lots are labeled A, B, C, D, and E."

      "content": "Follow Billy Graham Parkway and cross Amphitheatre Parkway. After parking, it’s a 5 to 10-minute walk to access the Google campus. Walk down Billy Graham Parkway, located just west of the parking lots, until you reach Amphitheatre Parkway. Safely cross this street to access the main hub of the Googleplex. [6] X Research source If you’re taking the bus and get off at Charleston & Google, you’ll be dropped off on the south end of the Google campus. Simply cross the street behind the bus stop to get to the Googleplex."

      "content": "Explore the outside campus on foot. While most Google buildings are closed to non-employees, feel free to explore the outside of the Googleplex—also called the Google campus—to your heart’s content. Be ready to walk a lot, as the entire campus stretches over a whopping 26 acres of land. [7] X Research source There is no longer a Google Visitor Center for tourists to visit. Wear comfortable shoes to help you trek across the campus without hurting your feet."

      "content": "Visit the Google head office at the center of the campus. Google buildings are restricted to employees and their guests, but you can still visit the central point of Google's headquarters. This cluster of buildings is just west of Charleston Park, a large green area in the city. You’ll recognize them instantly by their shiny glass exteriors and the large, colorful Google logo. [8] X Research source Make this the first stop on your Googleplex tour since it’s easy to access from the campus parking lots. In addition to the Google head office, Google Buildings 41, 42, and 43 are also in this cluster. There is also a volleyball court and a small green area near these buildings."

      "content": "Look for the life-sized T-Rex skeleton replica. A life-size T-Rex sculpture was placed on the campus by Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page as a reminder not to let the company go the way of the dinosaurs. Visit this iron sculpture as part of your Google headquarters tour. You’ll find the T-Rex—nicknamed “Stan” by Google employees—in front of the main Google buildings. [9] X Research source If you’re lucky, you might see Stan wearing fun accessories, like pink flamingos. The giant T-Rex is also a nod to Silicon Graphics, a Hollywood effects company that worked on the huge dinosaurs that appear in the Jurassic Park movies. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep an eye out for the self-driving Google car. An impressive sight on the Google campus is one of the company's self-driving cars. There is usually at least one cruising around the campus, sometimes transporting passengers to different buildings. As you walk by the campus roads filled with bikes and other vehicles, keep your eyes peeled for one of these self-driving Google cars. [11] X Research source You might also be able to see the Google Street View car. This is the car that drives around and takes pictures for the street view option on Google Maps.

      "content": "Ask a friend or contact who works for Google to give you a tour. Most of Google's buildings are only accessible to Googlers—a.k.a. Google employees. However, exceptions are sometimes made for guests of employees. If you happen to be friends with a Googler, call or email them to ask if they can give you a tour of some of the buildings. [14] X Research source If you do manage to score a tour, remain respectful and discreet as you tour the buildings. This is a workplace after all, and you wouldn’t want to disturb the hard-working people who are busy revolutionizing the tech industry."

Ask your Googler tour guide if you can share a meal with them in the cafeteria, which is open to employees and their guests. [15] X Research source The different food options are color-coded depending on their general level of healthiness. Green represents maximum healthiness. Yellow indicates food that features both healthy and unhealthy ingredients. Red signifies that the food is more decadent and not ideal for a healthy diet."

These enclosed reclining chairs shut out external stimuli so that employees can work quietly or even catch a quick nap. They also include a built-in Bose music system and a timer to wake up employees so they don’t miss their afternoon meetings. [16] X Research source These \"nap pods\" were created by a company called MetroNaps. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask if you can see the Google Garden. Many of the plant-based foods served in the Googleplex cafeteria are grown on-site in the Google Garden. This large organic garden uses Earthbox, a technology invented by Google that waters plants from the bottom instead of the top. Ask if you can visit this impressive space on your tour. [18] X Research source The Google Garden also has vast green spaces and meditation spots for Googlers to use freely."
