      "content": "Houses are sections of the sky determined by your birth time and location. There are 12 houses in most calculations, each corresponding to a different aspect of your life. The sun, moon, and planets are located within the houses (their exact placement is determined by where they were at your moment of birth). Their interactions with the houses has a great impact on the events of your life. [1] X Research source On a birth chart (also called a natal chart), the 12 houses are arranged in a counterclockwise ring according to your perspective view of the sky at the precise time and location you were born. The circular house chart is not the same as a zodiac wheel, which is based on the sun’s observable path around the earth. Houses are determined by the Earth’s own 24-hour rotation."

This house governs your identity—what it feels like to be you, how you express yourself, even your appearance and wellness. This house is embodied by the energy of Aries and its ruling planet, Mars. Your Ascendant sign is very important. It’s your personality and persona, your social standing, and the way you look at things. It also determines your Descendant (the sign on the Western horizon when you were born, 180 degrees away from the Ascendant), which determines who you’re attracted to and get along with."

      "content": "The various methods differ based on the philosophy and preferences of the astrologers who invented them. Many yield similar results to each other, but some can create noticeably different charts. Almost all methods begin by identifying the degree where the 1st house begins on the eastern horizon and then calculating the remaining houses moving counterclockwise. The math involved can range from simple to very complex. Calculation methods can be broadly split into 2 groups: Equal House systems where all houses are uniform in size, and Unequal House systems where house sizes can vary."

    {
      "title": "Equal Houses:",
      "content": "Equal Houses: These systems tend to be simple, elegant, and easy to read on a birth chart. All 12 houses are evenly divided into 30 degree sections of the wheel, and calculations are easy to do by hand. These methods work well for people born near the poles (above or below 66 degrees from the equator) since some signs never touch the horizon in these regions. [3] X Research source Popular Equal House systems include: Whole Sign: In this system, each house lines up with an entire zodiac sign. The 1st house spans your entire Ascendant sign, your 2nd house spans the entire following sign, and so on (mathematically, the cusp of each house is at 0 degrees of its corresponding zodiac sign). Equal House: Houses in this system may not align exactly with the zodiac signs, but they are still all the same size. Each house will be offset from a zodiac sign by the same amount. This amount is determined by the degree of the Ascendant at birth (for example, say your Ascendant sign is Gemini and it had risen 5 degrees when you were born. The cusp of your 1st house would be 5 degrees Gemini, the cusp of your 2nd house would be 5 degrees Cancer, and so on). One downside of Equal House methods is that the Midheaven degree (usually the cusp of the 10th house, where the sun is highest in the sky) can move around to other houses."

      "title": "Unequal Houses:",
      "content": "Unequal Houses: Many of these systems use the time it takes planets to move through the sky to divvy up the houses. They use the Ascendant/Descendant line and the Midheaven/IC (bottom of the sky) line as cusps for the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th houses (think the X and Y axes on a graph). The other cusps can occur at irregular angles since their locations are based on the amount of time each sign spends on the horizon from the perspective of Earth. Popular Unequal House systems include: Placidus: The cusp of the 1st house is the degree of the zodiac sign rising at birth. Over the course of 12 hours from birth, the degree of the horizon is measured every 2 hours to mark the cusp of the next 6 houses. Those lines are then extended across the birth chart to complete the remaining 6 houses. Koch: This method works like Placidus, except it uses Midheaven as the starting point instead of the Ascendant. Its results are very close to what you’d get with Placidus, but planets can change houses if they are close to the cusps. Porphyry: The cusps of the intermediate houses are based on the number of degrees between the Ascendant and Midheaven. That number is divided by 3, and lines are drawn across the chart to mark your 12th, 11th, 5th, and 6th houses. So if there are 84 degrees between Midheaven and the Ascendant, each house is 28 degrees wide."

      "content": "It’s completely up to you! Use whichever method you’re most comfortable or familiar with, or whichever method gives you an interpretation of your chart that resonates with you. Think of the different calculation methods as filters on an Instagram photo—they all reveal the same truth, just from a different perspective. [4] X Research source Compare multiple readings to see which you identify with. Online birth chart calculators make it fast and easy to compare charts created with different house calculations. The location of your birth might influence which method works best. A Placidus or Koch chart creates wildly unequal house sizes for people born near the poles, so a Whole Sign or Equal House chart might work better. If you’re calculating houses by hand, systems with simpler math (Whole Sign, Porphyry) might be easier to determine than those with complicated math (Koch, Placidus). However, online house calculators make using any system a breeze."

      "title": "The sun, moon, and planets are located in different houses at birth.",
      "content": "The sun, moon, and planets are located in different houses at birth. Each planet embodies different aspects of your being (like a warrior, a lover, or a scholar) and the way they interact with the houses can have a big impact on your life. Some houses may have multiple planets in them while some have none. Here are some example interpretations of planets in houses: Say you have Mars in your 1st house (the house of self). Mars is a soldier that represents action, fitness, and aggression. This could be interpreted as you having the willpower and assertiveness to accomplish your personal goals. Imagine Saturn in your 3rd house (the house of communication). Saturn is responsible and cares about rules and obligations. This might mean you have a tendency to communicate very logically with the goal of accomplishing important tasks. Your birth chart shows where your interests lie and where you're drawn. By examining certain houses and certain signs and certain planets in the chart, you can map out a course for your life, even including a list of possible careers!"

      "title": "Each house is also ruled by a zodiac sign.",
      "content": "Each house is also ruled by a zodiac sign. The sign depends on which zodiac constellation was rising at the time of your birth (your Ascendant sign). The ruling sign influences how the planet behaves and speaks more to your personal traits. For example: Imagine Mars in your 1st house ruled by Gemini. You have the willpower to accomplish your goals, and your method of getting what you want will probably involve Gemini’s witty, chatty, dualistic nature. Picture Saturn in your 3rd house ruled by Taurus. You communicate logically to accomplish a goal, but may be slow, static, or stubborn like Taurus in your negotiations."
