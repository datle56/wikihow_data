For that price, you're getting Apple's latest \"standard\" phone, with an extremely fast processor, excellent multi-lens camera, and 5G capability. [3] X Research source"

Despite its tiny size, the $700 Mini packs the same overall specs as the standard iPhone 12, including the fast processor, camera, 5G capability, and screen shield. (Though the battery life is about 10% shorter.) If you're a fan of compact phones and this is in your budget, it's hard to go wrong. [4] X Research source"

That said, its powerful processor should keep it relevant for years, which is not bad for the lowest price tag in Apple's store: $400. [5] X Research source This is the only current model that has a Home button and that uses the fingerprint ID login system. All other models offer a face recognition option instead.

As the oldest model still in production, the iPhone XR sits in an odd spot. At $500, this might be the phone for you if budget is your main priority, but you can't stand the tiny screen of the SE. (Otherwise, the tiny $400 SE wins on price and processor.)

The most noticeable upgrade from the standard iPhone 12 is the camera: these models add a third, telephoto lens, much better low-light performance, and a ProRAW mode with more image editing control. [10] X Research source The Pro starts at $1000, while the Pro Max is an oversize model with a slightly better camera for $1100. [11] X Research source Although these phones are near the top of the camera phone world, there are state-of-the-art Android competitors as well. Look into the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, OnePlus 9 Pro, and Sony Xperia 1 III. [12] X Research source"

The iPhone 13 is the newest iPhone available, having released in September of 2021.

      "content": "The iPhone 13 Pro Max is Apple's most powerful device yet. With a screen that measure 6.7 inches diagonally, it is also ginormous. This makes the 13 Pro Max ideal for gaming and watching TV, but it may also be inconvenient for some users. The device weighs 8.47 ounces, so it'll feel a bit heavy in some users' hands. Fortunately, a bigger phone also comes with a bigger battery. Even with Apple's brightest display and most powerful camera, the Pro Max version of the iPhone 13 also offers the best battery life of any iPhone model. Apple promises up to 25 hours of video streaming! [14] X Research source As one might expect, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is quite expensive. The phone debuted on the market at $1,099 for a 128GB model. A 1TB model can be purchased for $1,599. Like with the iPhone 12, Apple offers an iPhone 13 Pro. It is basically the same as the Pro Max, but at a slightly smaller size and with less battery life."
