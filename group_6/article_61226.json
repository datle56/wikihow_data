Physical therapists are trained medical professionals who can teach you exercises to help boost the muscles in your neck and shoulders. If you have a primary care doctor, get a recommendation from them on what physical therapists are in your area. Otherwise, make sure you are going to a physical therapist that knows about upper cervical issues. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Depending on how severe your compression is, you may have to visit the physical therapist once to twice a week. You can practice easy exercises at home as well. Try lying on your stomach with your arms at your side. Rest your forehead against the floor. Keep your chin tucked as you lift your forehead off of the floor."
