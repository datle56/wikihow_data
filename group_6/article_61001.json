      "content": "We spoke with licensed marriage and family therapist Allen Wagner to bring you the best advice on expressing gratitude in relationships. When it comes to communication and saying thanks, Wagner had a few tips to help improve and cultivate a loving relationship. Here’s what he had to say: Demonstrate love by being “open to the other person’s thoughts. It’s always a compromise, but I think if you want to show somebody that you love them, sometimes it’s understanding why certain things have a certain meaning to them.” Make saying “thank you” a habit. As Wagner explains, “It takes about 66 times of doing something before it becomes what you do.” Know that it’s okay to have uncomfortable moments. Wagner advises couples to push their boundaries and express their needs , even if they think it might lead to an argument. The key to a lasting relationship? The relationship “has to be respected . And by that...I mean you understand the value of what your life would be if you didn’t have that person and what they give to you.” Don’t be afraid to verbalize that."
