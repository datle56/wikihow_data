      "content": "Try different types and brands of earbuds to find one that fits your ears. Ear canals come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and so there’s no one-size-fits-all type of earbud. Try out different brands and styles of earbuds belonging to friends or family members to see what fits best in your ears. Or, ask sales staff at an electronics store if you can try out a few pairs of earbuds to see which feel most comfortable. [1] X Research source In general, men have larger ear canals than women, and so will need larger earbuds."

      "content": "Place the earbuds snugly into your ear canal. In order for earbuds to effectively transmit sound, they need to be lodged in your ear canal and relatively close to your eardrum. Giving the earbuds 2–3 twists back and forth may help to lodge them in place. [2] X Research source Fitting the head of the wireless earbuds in your ear canal will also block ambient sound from entering your ears."

      "content": "Pull on your earlobes to seal the earbuds in place. Once you have an earbud loosely in each ear, reach up and lightly tug on each earlobe with your opposite hand. This will slightly open and enlarge the ear canal. While you’re tugging, gently press the earbud farther into place with the index finger of your other hand. For example, to secure the earbud in your right ear, lightly tug on that earlobe with your left hand. At the same time, use the index finger of your right hand to push the earbud into your ear canal."

      "title": "Clean earwax out of your ears",
      "content": "Clean earwax out of your ears if your earbuds don’t fit properly. A buildup of wax can change the size and shape of the ear canal. This can cause the earbuds to fit poorly or slip out of your ears when you’re using them. If you notice that the buds don’t stay put in your ears as well as they used to, pull out a couple of Q-tips and clean your ears. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Also clean your ears if you notice a buildup of yellow earwax on the earbuds when you pull them out from your ears. Be careful not to push inside. Gently push and rub so it clears the ear walls without pushing the wax further inside."

      "title": "Don’t move your jaw while using earbuds if you can help it.",
      "content": "Don’t move your jaw while using earbuds if you can help it. Depending on the shape of your jaw and its proximity to your ear canal, opening and closing your jaw may loosen the earbuds. While you obviously can’t help moving your jaw when you’re on a phone call, try not to move your jaw too much while you’re using the earbuds for other purposes. For example, if you’re chewing a piece of gum or eating a snack while you’re listening to music on earbuds, the jaw motion may loosen the buds and make them slip out of your ears."

      "content": "Pair your earbuds with your phone or other device. Tap the Bluetooth button on your phone or other device (e.g., tablet or computer) and turn it on. Then, tap the “seek” button on the side of 1 earbud. When your earbud pops up on the Bluetooth menu of your phone, tap on it to connect the device. [4] X Research source Be aware that, if you’re trying to pair your earbuds with a device that they haven’t been paired with before, it may take a few moments. Check your phone’s user manual for specific directions regarding how to pair with a wireless device."

      "content": "Control the earbuds with the included remote control. Many pairs of wireless earbuds come with a small remote control, typically about 2 by 3 inches (5.1 cm × 7.6 cm). Use the interface of this remote to skip songs, adjust the volume of whatever you’re listening to, or mute a phone call. [5] X Research source Make sure to always bring the remote with you when you’re out (e.g., jogging with the earbuds), or you’ll have a tough time controlling your music. If you happen to forget your remote control, you can always control the music you’re listening to with your phone (or other device)."

      "content": "Tap the buttons on the side of the earbuds if they have no remote. Various other brands of earbud have no remote control, but feature small buttons on the side. Use these buttons to pause, play, or skip songs that you’re listening to, or to answer, mute, or hang up a telephone call. Take a look at the buttons before putting the buds into your ear so you don’t accidentally tap the wrong button. [6] X Research source If you find that the buttons are too small for your fingers to press with accuracy, you can always just use your phone’s interface to adjust music or hang up a phone call."

      "content": "Clean the earbuds if you notice a wax buildup. If wax from your ears has coated part of the in-ear surfaces of the earbuds, clean them off with a cotton swab and a dab of rubbing alcohol. Wipe down the surfaces of the earbuds until you’ve removed all of the wax. [7] X Research source Don’t use soap to clean wireless earbuds, and never rinse them under the faucet."

      "content": "Charge your wireless earbuds when you’re not using them. Although the exact charging mechanism varies from one set of earbuds to another, most will have a small port that they charge in. Keep the port plugged into a wall outlet in your bedroom or living room. Whenever you’re not using the earbuds, attach them to the charging port. [8] X Research source If you forget to charge your earbuds, you won’t be able to use them when you want to. If you’re using them for, for example, an important business conference call, dead earbuds could be a serious problem."
