      "content": "Redline cars Redline cars have red stripes on the sides of each wheel and were the standard look for the first 10 years Hot Wheels were produced. They also have “Spectraflame” paint, which has a sparkly appearance like glitter. Since these cars are classics from 1968–1977, they tend to be worth more than more recent models. [1] X Research source More common redline cars, like the King 'Kuda or Chevy Nomad, sell for around $15–20 USD while rarer models, like the Bye Focal or Six Shooter, are valued around $200 USD. Some vintage re-releases of Hot Wheels also have red stripes on the tires. Original redline cars were only manufactured in the United States and Hong Kong. If the “Country of Origin” label on the bottom of the car says any other location, then it’s not authentic."

      "content": "Treasure Hunt cars Treasure Hunt cars were rare variants that started being released in 1995. Since these cars were randomly mixed in with common ones on the shelves, they were tougher to find. Some Treasure Hunt cars are labeled “Treasure Hunt” directly on the packaging, either on the top or behind the car. If you don’t see it listed on the packaging, look on the car for a symbol that looks like a circle with a flame inside. That symbol means you have a rare collectible Treasure Hunt car. [3] X Research source The symbol may be hidden on a logo or spoiler on the car, so carefully inspect the entire model. Treasure Hunt Hot Wheels usually sell for around $15–30 USD."

[4] X Research source Super Treasure Hunt cars can sell for anywhere between $30–$200 USD. If the car is still in the packaging, check behind the car for a gold circle with a flame inside to signify that it’s part of the Super Treasure Hunt series."
