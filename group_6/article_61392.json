      "content": "Add 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 ml) of dish soap to your toilet and let it soak for 25 minutes. Pour liquid dish soap directly into the toilet bowl so it can sink to the bottom. Over the next 25 minutes, the soap will make the pipes more slippery so it’s easier for the clog to move through the toilet. During this time, you may notice the water level go down as the clog loosens up. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour 1 US gal (3.8 L) of hot water into the toilet bowl. Use the hottest that comes out of your bath faucet. Slowly add the water to the toilet bowl directly over the drain to help force the clog down. The hot water paired with the soap could break apart the clog so your toilet can flush again. [2] X Research source Only pour hot water into the bowl if there’s no risk of it overflowing. You can also add 1 cup (200 g) of Epsom salt to help break apart the clog."

As it mixes with the baking soda, it will start to fizz and bubble due to a chemical reaction. [5] X Research source Make sure not to add the vinegar so fast that the fizz goes over the edge of your toilet or else you’ll have a bigger mess to clean up."

Use another bathroom or wait until 1 hour has passed before trying to flush it. [6] X Research source If the water still doesn’t go down, try adding the same amount of baking soda and vinegar, but let it sit overnight."

The rag will help prevent any damage to your toilet as you feed it into your pipes.
