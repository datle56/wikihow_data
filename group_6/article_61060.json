      "content": "Spread the twilly fabric out to make it flat and remove wrinkles. Take your twilly and pull it out so that the fabric is even and straight. Turn over any folded portions to make 1 flat length of fabric. Brush any wrinkles out with the palm of your hand. [1] X Research source A traditional twilly is 32 inches (81 cm) long and 2–6 inches (5.1–15.2 cm) wide. This should be more than enough fabric to wrap the handle on a medium-sized bag. This can be kind of hard to do if your bag has big looping handles, though."

      "title": "Slide the twilly between the handle and the bag.",
      "content": "Slide the twilly between the handle and the bag. Pull the handle on your bag up and slide the last 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) of the twilly in between the bag and the end of the handle. If the handle is attached to the top of the bag’s fabric, just hold it against the handle on the side facing the bag. [2] X Research source If your bag has 2 handles, you can wrap a twilly around one of the handles, or use 2 twillies to cover each handle. It’s really up to you! [3] X Research source"

Pull the fabric back towards you so that you have roughly 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of excess fabric at the end. Hold the 2 sides of the twilly parallel. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Layer the twilly over the handle by wrapping the fabric. Take the long length of fabric and wrap it around the handle where you just tied your knot. Grip the twilly tight as you’re curling it around the handle. Once you’re wrapped the bottom of the handle, pull the fabric up a little while creating a second loop around the handle. [6] X Research source It doesn’t matter if you go clockwise or counterclockwise around the handle, so choose whichever direction feels natural to you."

      "content": "Continue wrapping the fabric until you reach the other end of the handle. Fold your third loop around the handle by dragging it up and around the same way you made your second loop. Overlap at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the fabric with each wrap so that the thickness of the handle stays uniform and the entire handle is covered. [7] X Research source If you have more than 4 inches (10 cm) left over when you get to the other end of the handle, wrap the fabric around the base of the handle 1-2 times until you have 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) left. You’re basically wrapping your way around the handle in a sequence of loops, kind of like a spiral staircase."

Once you get to the end of the handle, rest the side of your nondominant palm on the area above the end of the handle to hold the wrapped fabric still. Then, hold the end of the twilly with your nondominant hand and let it come a little loose. Use your dominant hand to pull the fabric out a little and pinch the fabric to the handle to maintain the slack. [8] X Research source You’re basically holding the fabric tight while you loosen up the last wrap to make room for a knot."

Slide it through the top of the loop and slide it through the other side. Yank it taut until the loop tightens against the end of the handle. Keep pulling until the loop is tight and you have 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of excess fabric sticking out from the bottom of your knot. [9] X Research source You can repeat this process on the other handle for a more symmetrical look, or stop here to go for a more unique look where one of the handles are covered."

Run your fingers over the fold while pressing down to keep the fold in place. [10] X Research source This is also known as a camellia, which is a type of shrub with knot-like flowers that resemble the knot you’re going to make. This is great way to give a monochromatic bag a little color and personality. It will look like there’s a small flower resting on one the ends of your handle."
