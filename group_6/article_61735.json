      "content": "Home pregnancy tests detect hCG in your urine. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the human body at the very beginning of pregnancy. Home pregnancy tests only show whether the hormone is present or not—they don't indicate the amount.

      "content": "Yes, but over-the-counter hCG won't turn a pregnancy test positive. If you do a search, you'll find over-the-counter hCG drops sold online, typically for weight loss. Unfortunately, these products don't actually have any real hCG in them and won't turn a pregnancy test positive. Over-the-counter hCG drops use homeopathic hCG, which is an herbal concoction designed to mimic the same effects of real hCG on the body. Even if you find drops that do contain real human hCG, the hormone is extremely diluted and would be unlikely to turn a pregnancy test positive."

      "content": "You can only get real hCG by prescription from a doctor. Real hCG is a prescription drug used to treat female infertility and some other hormonal issues. It's typically administered in injectable form. While just a couple of drops of this form of hCG would likely turn a pregnancy test positive, you'd have a hard time getting your hands on it.

      "content": "Yes, there are other substances that might work. Try apple juice or soda (such as Coke or Pepsi). The sugars in these popular drinks will sometimes trip a pregnancy test. Just pour a small amount into a cup and dip the pee strip of the pregnancy test into the liquid for a minute. Then, take the test out and wait the amount of time specified in the test instructions before checking your result.

      "title": "Yes, you can use an expired test or use a test more than once.",
      "content": "Yes, you can use an expired test or use a test more than once. Pregnancy tests have an expiration date on the package. After that date, their reliability decreases, so you're more likely to get a false positive. Re-using a test also makes it more likely that you'll get a false positive. [6] X Research source If you feel shy about using your own urine, you can just use water. It's just as likely to get you a false positive when you're working with an expired or used test. You can also try just leaving the pregnancy test out for a while—sometimes another line will show up that makes it look positive. This is actually an evaporation line, but if you're just using it as a joke, it might be good enough."

      "content": "Only use it for a prank or a costume. Before you go to the effort to fake a pregnancy test, it's worth doing a little soul-searching about your reasons for doing it. Playing a joke on someone or using it as an accessory with a Halloween costume might be perfectly innocent things to do, but people could still be upset or offended. [7] X Research source If you're just doing it to see how your partner reacts, it's usually better to simply have an open conversation with them rather than trying to trick them. Even if they're initially happy and excited about the possibility of you being pregnant, they're still likely to be hurt or upset when they find out the test was a fake. Acting like the fake pregnancy test is real and using it to extort money or anything else is a crime. [8] X Research source It's also a bad idea to use a fake pregnancy test to try to get back at someone, even if you're not trying to get money from them."

      "content": "The best option is to come clean and admit it was a joke. Acknowledge that you created a fake pregnancy test and that you intended it to be a joke. If the person is upset, apologize for hurting them. Take full ownership of what you did and ask if there's anything you can do to make it up to them.
