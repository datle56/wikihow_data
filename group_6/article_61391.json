      "content": "Wait for several minutes after showering so that the water can drain. It will be easier to remove a clog if the pipes are free of water. If the water doesn't drain, you may need to try plunging or snaking. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a screwdriver or your hands to remove the drain stopper. If you have a strainer that is attached with screws, use a screwdriver to remove it. Some drain covers simply lift out or can be unscrewed with your hands. Put the cover in the open position and remove any screws that need to be undone. Then lift the cover out. [2] X Research source If you have a drop stopper, lift the stopper and find the screw at tub level. Unscrew it and the top section of the device."

      "content": "Remove surface level clogs by hand. Most clogs are caused by hair. If the hair is sitting near the surface, just pull it out with your fingers. [3] X Research source Wear rubber gloves if you don't want to touch the hair with your bare hands."

      "title": "Unwind and straighten a wire hanger and create a hook at the end.",
      "content": "Unwind and straighten a wire hanger and create a hook at the end. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to unwind the loops and straighten out the wire as much as possible. Create a small hook about 1 ‚ÅÑ 4 inch (0.64 cm) long at the end of the wire to make it easier to catch hair. A wire snake will be able to reach clogs that are deeper than those you can reach with your hands. [4] X Research source If you don't have a wire hanger, you can also purchase a plastic drain snake with a hook at the end designed to pull out hair. Find these at the hardware store. Wear rubber gloves to protect from scratching yourself with the wire and to grab any clogs you pull up without touching them with bare skin."

      "content": "Reach the wire snake into the drain, hook clumps of hair, and pull them up. Hold a flashlight with one hand to be able to see where the clogs are. Reach the wire snake into the drain with the hook side down, targeting any large clumps of hair. Wiggle the wire around so that it goes deeper into the drain. Feel for it to hook onto the clog and pull it out. [5] X Research source If the hair clog is tight enough to block water, it will stick together as you pull it up. You may have to repeat the process several times to pull out all of the pieces of the clog. [6] X Research source"

[7] X Research source If the water still doesn't drain, there is another clog deeper down in the drain and you will need to plunge, use a hand snake, or make a baking soda and vinegar solution."

If you have a flange plunger with an extra ring of rubber around the bottom, fold the extra ring into the cup. [8] X Research source The plunger will bring up whatever is clogging the drain. Don't use a plunger if you've poured toxic chemicals like bleach down the drain, as it will bring these up, too. They can splash and cause burns."
