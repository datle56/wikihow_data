      "content": "Spotify curates shuffles rather than using a true randomizer. This feature is meant to seamlessly blend songs into a playlist you want to hear based on your past listens, but it can be frustrating when you want to listen to songs in a different order. As of right now, there's no way to force Spotify to change its shuffle other than the new Smart Shuffle feature that suggests new songs while you listen. If you want Spotify to add a pure shuffle function, you can vote on a Live Idea that suggests this feature. Do the following: Go to the Live Idea community post . [1] X Research source Click or tap VOTE on the right side. Log into your Spotify account if prompted. Your vote will be added. If enough users support the idea, the Spotify team will work to implement it."
