      "content": "Download Turbo C++ IDE for your operating system. Turbo C++ may not work in Windows Vista and Windows 7. You may have to run it through another program called DosBox . Install the software DOSBox version 0.74 Create a folder,for example \"Turbo\" (C:\\Turbo\\): Download and extract TC into the Turbo folder (c:\\Turbo\\): Run the DOSBox 0.74 from the icon located on the desktop: Type the following commands at the command prompt [Z]: mount d c:\\Turbo\\ [The folder TC is present inside the folder Turbo] Now you should get a message which says: Drive D is mounted as a local directory c:\\Turbo\\ Type d: to shift to d: Next follow the commands below: cd tc cd bin tc or tc.exe [This starts you the Turbo C++ 3.0] In the Turbo C++ go to Options>Directories> Change the source of TC to the source directory [D] ( i.e. virtual D: refers to original c:\\Turbo\\ . So make the path change to something like D:\\TC\\include and D:\\TC\\lib respectively ) You can save yourself some time by having DOSBox automatically mount your folders and start TurboC++: For DOSBox versions older then 0.74 browse into program installation folder and open the dosbox.conf file in any text editor. For version 0.73 go to Start Menu and click on “Configuration” and then “Edit Configuration“. Then scroll down to the very end, and add the lines which you want to automatically execute when DOSBox starts."
