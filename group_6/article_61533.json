Converting complex photo-real images with lots of color and detail to vector may slow down your computer and/or cause Illustrator to crash. Select a high-resolution image for best results. To paste a raster image: Click File in the menu bar at the top. Click Place . Select a raster image file (.jpeg, .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, etc.). Click Place ."

      "content": "You can select a preset which will set all the image trace settings for you. This is optional, but a simple way to start. Use the drop-down menu next to \"Presets\" to select a preset. Your options include the following: [1] X Research source High Fidelity: This preset preserves as many colors as possible. This is used for creating photo-realistic images, but may be taxing on your computer's processor. Low Fidelity: This preset reduces the amount of color in the final trace. This is good for creating a simplified photo-realistic image. 3 Colors: This limits the number of colors in the final trace to 3. This is a good preset for logos or drawings that only have a few colors. 6 Colors: This limits the number of colors in the final trace to 6. This is good for more complex logo designs as well as some cartoon drawings. 16 colors: This limits the number of colors in the final trace to 16. This is good for cartoon images that have a wide variety of colors. Shades of Grey: This creates a greyscale image trace, which includes black and white, and shades of grey to shade the image. Black and White: This creates an image that only uses black and white. There are no shades of grey with this option. Outline: This creates an image that is traced with black outlines."

Outlines with Source Image: This displays the outlines that are traced around the shapes with the original raster image below the outlines.

When this mode is selected, a slider bar appears below the \"Palette\" drop-down menu that allows you to select how many colors you want to allow in your image trace. Grayscale: This produces a grayscale image that consists of black and white with shades of grey. When this mode is selected, a slider bar appears below the \"Palette\" drop-down menu that allows you to select how many shades of grey you want to allow in your image trace. Threshold: This produces an image that only uses black and white. [3] X Research source There are no shades of grey.

Limited: This option selects a limited number of colors from the source image to create a traced image to use in the color palette. Full Tone: This option uses the full range of colors from the source image to create a traced image.

If you find the traced image doesn't look quite right, you can click Advanced to additional sliders and tools you can use for a better trace. Paths: Use the slider bar to adjust the path settings. The higher the path settings, the shorter the distance between the traced shapes and the original raster image. Corners: This adjusts how likely a sharp bend will turn into a corner point. Noise: Use the slider bar next to \"Noise\" to specify how much a pixel area is ignored by tracing. A higher value results in less noise. Select a higher setting for higher resolution images and a lower setting for lower resolution images. Choose one of the two Method options to choose how paths are created: 'Abutting: This method has an icon of a circle cut out of a square. Use this method to trace shapes next to each other. The path of one shape matches the path of its neighboring shape. No shapes overlap. Overlapping: This method allows shapes to be created on top of shapes. If you want to turn regions filled with color into traced fill shapes, check the box next to \"Fills.\" To add a stroke line around shapes that are traced, check the box next to \"Stroke,\" and then use the arrows to define the thickness of the stroke line. Click the checkbox next to \"Snap Curves to Lines\" to specify if lines that are slightly curved are rendered as a straight line. Click the checkbox next to \"Ignore Whites\" if you want white areas of the original image to be ignored in the trace."
