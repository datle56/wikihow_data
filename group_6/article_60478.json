Generally, those taking the drug should continue it to help manage the respective depression or disorder unless directed otherwise by a care provider; however, there are a few good reasons to discontinue or change the therapy, including: If you experience severe or continuous side effects If your depression or disorder is not under control with Wellbutrin. For example, your depression may not be adequately controlled if you have persistent sad, anxious or empty feelings, irritability, loss of interest in pleasurable activities or hobbies, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances such as insomnia or excessive sleeping, appetite changes, thoughts of suicide, or physical aches and pains.

      "content": "Discontinue Wellbutrin slowly. Antidepressants need to be slowly discontinued with a gradual decrease in doses to avoid discontinuation symptoms. This is called tapering. Wellbutrin is usually tapered for approximately two weeks before stopping the medication completely. If you stop right away or go “cold turkey,” your body does not have enough time to adjust and you may experience worse discontinuation symptoms. Note that these symptoms may be different than SSRI discontinuation symptoms or those of other antidepressants. Symptoms can occur within hours to three days after discontinuation and may include: [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Abdominal issues such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or cramps Sleep issues such as insomnia or nightmares Balance issues such as dizziness or lightheadedness Sensory or movement issues such as numbness, tingling, tremors, or lack of coordination Feelings of irritability, agitation, or anxiety This constellation of symptoms is sometimes called \"discontinuation syndrome.\""

The length of time it takes to completely stop taking Wellbutrin may depend on how long you were on the medication and the dose you were prescribed. Your doctor will determine the best way to taper Wellbutrin. [6] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source The usual target dose of Wellbutrin according to the manufacturer is 300 mg per day in the form of 150 mg twice daily (with a maximum dose at 400mg per day as 200 mg twice daily). [7] X Research source However, your specific prescription may vary. Always follow prescribed dosages. The standard reduction schedule for patients at the target dosage of 300 mg daily is to reduce to 200 mg at the first reduction, followed by subtracting 50 mg on subsequent reductions; however, the amount of time and dosage between reductions will ultimately depend on your first initial reaction to the first reduction, which your doctor will monitor closely to determine the best reduction schedule for you. The process can take anywhere from weeks to months depending on the individual patient. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source For regular, immediate release tablets, your doctor may recommend cutting the tablet to change the dose; however, it is important to note that Wellbutrin is usually prescribed as a longer-acting tablet. With extended- or sustained-release formulations, you cannot cut the tablets. Tapering these formulations may include prescribing lower dose tablets or taking the same dose at longer intervals such as every other day. Keep track of your tapering schedule by writing down the dates and the dosage changes."

In order to differentiate between relapse and discontinuation symptoms, look at when the symptoms start, how long they last, and the type of symptoms. While discontinuation symptoms with bupropion are not common, there is a greater risk of side effects with discontinuing if the patient is not starting a new antidepressant with a similar pharmacodynamic profile. Relapse, or the recurrence of your depression, may also occur with discontinuation of your therapy. Keep you doctor informed about how you are feeling and if you have concerns about a relapse. Relapse symptoms gradually develop after two to three weeks and get worse over two to four weeks. Contact your doctor if any symptoms last more than one month.
