[2] X Research source On a shelf label, you may see the UVP ( unverbindliche Preisempfehlung , or recommended retail price) displayed alongside this additional charge. For example, zzgl. €0,15 Pfand (zzgl. is short for zuzüglich ) means \"plus €0.15 deposit.\" The two types of bottles in this system will be labelled on the container: Single-use containers, which are used once and then recycled - labelled as Einweg(pfand/flasche) or Einweg-Pfandflasche, colloquially referred to as Dosenpfand Reusable bottles made from glass or PET plastic - labelled as Mehrweg-Pfandflasche , Mehrweg(pfand/flasche) or Pfand-Glas Both may be labelled with \"Pfandflasche.\" Look out for a symbol near the barcode. The DPG (Deutsche Pfandsystem GmbH) logo (a bottle and can with an arrow) can be found on single-use bottles, and the \"Ak Mehrweg\" logo (a blue circle with a thicker green segment) on reusable bottles. You can also look for \"PET CYCLE\" enclosed in a circle, or a \"Der Blaue Engel\" logo (a person encircled by leaves). [3] X Research source [4] X Research source [5] X Research source"

Single-use Einweg plastic bottles (described as thin or \"less stable\" plastic) carry a higher, government-set deposit of €0.25 to discourage consumers from buying them, and in recognition of the higher environmental impact. They are crushed and recycled upon return. With reusable Mehrweg containers, the deposits are set by the producer but are roughly as follows: [6] X Research source Glass beer bottles: €0.08 Resealable beer bottles: €0.15 (in some regions, €0.25, €0.50 or €0.60) Glass water bottles (0.75 or 1 litre): €0.15 Reusable plastic bottles (glass or harder plastic): €0.15 Glass yoghurt containers (Pfandglas): €0.17 Some 1-litre wine bottles: €0.02 or €0.03 [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep empty bottles together when buying crates of drinks. In Germany, crates of beer, water, and soft drinks are commonly found in supermarkets. They often have a Pfand applied to them that varies by manufacturer. Generally, smaller crates (e.g. six bottles) come with a deposit of €0.75-€1.50, with €1.50 being standard for beer crates. Larger, wooden, or heavy-duty containers may come with a deposit of €3 or more. [8] X Research source Keep all the empty bottles and the crate to return and claim your deposit. Don't worry if a bottle is missing: the machine you return the bottles to will count them and calculate the Pfand automatically."

These include: [9] X Research source [10] X Research source Some thin plastic bottles (check the label for Pfandfrei ) - these go in the yellow recycling bin Milk cartons: these go in the yellow recycling bin Most wine and spirit containers: these go in the glass recycling bin Bottles over 3 litres (e.g. the container pictured) : dispose of according to local recycling guidelines and what they're made of Paper-based containers wrapped in plastic packaging: these go in the yellow recycling bin Condiments: dispose of according to local recycling guidelines and what they're made of Containers with the \"Grüne Punkt\" logo: these go in the yellow recycling bin Bottles purchased in other countries: dispose of according to local recycling guidelines and what they're made of"

Additionally, reusable Mehrweg bottles with a screw thread should always be returned with the cap on, to protect the thread and make the bottle last longer. [11] X Research source You may see something like bitte Pfandflasche ausgespült und mit Verschluss zurückgeben on the bottle, which translates to \"please return the deposit bottle rinsed and with the cap.\" For reusable glass bottles that do not have a thread, you can remove the lid before returning them. Bottles with a swing top should also be returned opened. Since bottles with swing tops or \"crown caps\" are often reinforced on the spout, they are more robust, and returning with the lid open makes it quicker to clean the bottle. [12] X Research source"

There will often be a Pfandstation, Pfandautomat, or Leergut(automat) (bottle return machine) that accepts both individual bottles and crates of bottles. [13] X Research source [14] X Research source Be aware of what different shops will accept: Supermarkets only have to accept the types of bottle that they sell. For example, Aldi and Lidl only sell and accept single-use Einweg bottles, not reusable Mehrweg containers. Large stores over 200m² (and most Rewe, Edeka and Kaufland stores) will accept most sorts of bottles. Beverage stores (such as Trinkgut or Getränke Hoffmann) will accept large volumes of bottles, including crates of beer, water and soft drinks, and glass beer or water bottles [15] X Research source As a general rule, return the bottles to a store that also sells that brand of drink. They have to accept returns of the kinds of bottle that they sell."

      "title": "Locate the bottle return machine.",
      "content": "Locate the bottle return machine. In supermarkets, they are usually at the entrance or the back of the store. Then, insert each bottle, barcode first. Always check which types of bottle the machine accepts. Stores may have separate machines for the two types of bottle, or only accept the type of bottles they sell. Anything that isn't accepted will be spat back at you. Additionally, most machines will also have a slot at the bottom to insert crates into. Single-use Einweg bottles are crushed immediately to be recycled, while reusable Mehrweg bottles are routed for storage to be cleaned and refilled. If you are returning bottles for the first time, do not go on a Saturday. This is the busiest day and you will encounter long, impatient queues. Consequently, the machines fill up very quickly and are more likely to break."

They will deduct the money from your shop, or pay you back the money if you aren't buying anything. Keep in mind that this will take longer, as the employee has to process each bottle manually. If you aren't buying anything, briefly mention that you have no shopping to scan to avoid confusion. Queues in German supermarkets can be impatient. If the machine is broken and you're left with a huge volume of bottles, it may be best to take them to another store rather than trying to have them all scanned manually."

If you've bought a drink from a farmer's market or specialty drinks store, the bottle may have a Pfand included in the cost. This can also apply to condiments such as honey and jam. Since these containers are not of a standard shape and may not have a label, they will not be accepted at chain stores and supermarkets."

      "title": "Return individual bottles to convenience stores when supermarkets are closed.",
      "content": "Return individual bottles to convenience stores when supermarkets are closed. Small stores such as Kiosks and Spätkaufs (Spätis) are often open late and on Sundays. They will accept bottles from a brand they sell where Mehrweg bottles are concerned, but Einweg bottles are rarely rejected. However, do not make a habit of returning large volumes to kiosks — they are not equipped to handle them. Return larger volumes to a supermarket or beverage store instead. If you have one empty bottle that needs returning, you can usually claim your Pfand at a petrol station - just hand it to a cashier. Some larger petrol stations may have a machine, but it's best to take large volumes of bottles to a supermarket or beverage store. Germans often buy a beer to drink by the river from a convenience store. It's cheaper than buying one in a bar, and kiosks are open long after supermarkets have closed. This is an example of where you can return these bottles to the store you bought them from."

[17] X Research source At some supermarkets, there is a letterbox on or next to the machine to insert the receipt into, along with a sign about the charity the money is donated to. Additionally, look out for separate collections boxes specifically for charity donations, donation stations at events and festivals, and city campaigns that partner with local charities to donate the proceeds. Major locations like airports will also allow you to donate the proceeds. [18] X Research source Look out for the word Spende, which means donate."

      "content": "Leave a bottle next to a rubbish bin for a deposit collector ( Pfandsammler ) to collect. People looking for an extra source of income, such as the homeless, collect bottles from the streets, concerts, and events to return and claim the Pfand . This is a common practice to help collectors find the bottles more easily. [19] X Research source Do not use this as an excuse to dump bottles in large volumes. If you opt to do this, leave only one bottle, and keep in mind that it can be misinterpreted as littering. Be aware of local laws and consider using a returns location or rubbish bin instead. Look out for the words \"Pfand gehört daneben\" (which loosely translates to \"deposit belongs next to it\") written on the pavement next to rubbish bins. It is a public campaign reminding you to place bottles next to bins rather than inside them. This way, people who rely on the money from returning Pfand bottles can locate them more easily. [20] X Research source Alternatively, you may see a Pfandring — a designated holder for bottles — fixed onto a bin. Leave your Pfand bottles in there for bottle collectors to find. Lampposts may also have boxes or rings for this purpose and will be signposted as such, e.g. as \"Pfandkiste\" (deposit box) . [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Collect a token at markets and festivals. When you pay a Pfand at a stall, such as when buying a mug of Glühwein (mulled wine) at a Christmas market, you will be given a token to keep hold of. Return this with the empty container to claim your deposit back. This is a precautionary measure to stop people from collecting up empty glasses and claiming back money that isn't rightfully theirs. Additionally, it prevents people from bringing containers from home and trying to claim a Pfand they haven't paid. If you lose the token, you will not be able to get your money back."
