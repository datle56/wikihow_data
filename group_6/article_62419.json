This chemical reaction can give us a high and even decrease physical pain. Because it feels so good, it’s actually possible to be addicted to love.

If you fall in love quickly and easily with lots of people, but struggle to stay in love beyond the honeymoon stage , it could mean you’re afraid to experience deeper love and be truly known.

Our culture emphasizes dating and marriage above singledom, so if you haven't found \"the one,\" you might wonder if there's something wrong with you (there's not!) or if it means you'll be alone forever. The fear of being single may make you more susceptible to emophilia. Keep in mind that if you're lonely while you're single, a relationship won't necessarily fix that: loneliness is not the result of being alone, but of feeling isolated, whether or not you're with other people.

      "content": "You’ve got an insecure attachment style. Your attachment style refers to the way you connect with people in close relationships. Attachment styles are formed in infancy and early childhood based on how your needs were met—or not met—by your primary caregiver. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you fall in love easily, you might have an insecure attachment style. There are 3 types of insecure styles: Anxious : You tend to be clingy in relationships and fear abandonment. You may feel a constant need for love and reassurance and do almost anything to get it. You may be more likely to have an anxious attachment style if your parental figures weren’t consistent with their caregiving: some days they may have offered care and support, and other days they didn’t. Avoidant : You reject others’ attempts to connect on a deeper level because you fear being vulnerable, but you still crave love. Because of this, you may seek out surface-level relationships that never move past the honeymoon stage. Avoidant styles often stem from a lack of attention from a parental figure. If you grew up believing you couldn’t rely on your caregivers for attention, you may struggle to rely on romantic partners as an adult. Disorganized : You possess traits of anxious and avoidant attachers: you bounce back and forth between a fear of abandonment and a fear of intimacy. You might even worry deep down that you don’t deserve love. People with a disorganized style often experienced extreme neglect, trauma, or abuse during childhood."

Don’t begin to rely on them heavily for emotional support.” To avoid committing to one person too early, she suggests “dating other people until you know someone well and they show you they are consistent and trustworthy.” Even if you feel like you’d rather be with your new partner, your crush, or someone you met on an app, spending time with other people who care for you will help you rely less on romance and feel more well-rounded."

      "title": "Pause to assess red flags.",
      "content": "Pause to assess red flags. Even when you feel a strong attachment to someone, practice pausing and looking for signs you should slow down. Dr. Georgoulis points out that it’s only after the “falling in love” stage that we really learn who someone is: “Don’t make any major...commitments to that person for several months…. Usually around 12-18 months the feel good love chemicals in our brain start to taper off and we have a clearer picture about who the person is.” Potential red flags might include: Suspicion: Listen to your gut: do you feel any inkling, deep down, that things aren’t right with this person? If so, they may not be! Controlling tendencies: Do they exhibit any controlling or manipulative behavior? Aggressive behavior: Do they yell or get unreasonably mad about things? Even if they’re not aggressive towards you at first—say, they snap at service workers—it doesn’t bode well. Moving too quickly: If your new partner talks way too soon about marriage, having kids, or moving in, or says “I love you” within a few dates, it’s a sign to slow down. Poor communication: Does this person communicate openly and honestly with you? Do you never know where you stand with them or what to expect?"

      "title": "Fall in love with yourself.",
      "content": "Fall in love with yourself. Dating yourself can be a healthy way to prevent falling too soon for others and create a secure attachment style. Whether you’re single or dating, take time to be alone and enjoy your hobbies and passions. Learning to enjoy your alone time can help you take more pride in who you are, which can make it easier not to fall in love with other people so quickly. Practice good self-care: get plenty of exercise, eat well, and do things that make you feel good—without needing to rely on a romantic connection. If you’re struggling with obsessive thinking about your partner or potential partners, Dr. Georgoulis advises practicing mindfulness meditation for 15-20 minutes a day: “Recognize when the obsessive thinking is happening and redirect your focus instead on the activity you are engaging in in the present moment.”"
