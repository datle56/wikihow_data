You do not have to imitate them exactly—just recreate their joy, whether they’re jumping up and down or just swaying to the music. Who knows; after seeing your moves, they might invite you to join them! [1] X Research source For instance, if a group of dancers are rocking out to a high-energy song, you might bounce up and down or rock your head to the music."

If you’d like to take a more subtle route, try making eye contact and gesturing for them to join you. You can always break the ice with a compliment first, or ask a question like “Have you been dancing for a while?” or “What’s your favorite dance move?”"
