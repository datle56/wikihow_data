      "title": "Meditation is the essential building block of self-discovery.",
      "content": "Meditation is the essential building block of self-discovery. Whether you’re Buddhist, Hindu, or a follower of some other faith, meditating is a recommended way to get closer to your God. The cycle of rebirth only ends with enlightenment , and the only way to become enlightened is by cultivating your inner peace. [1] X Research source There’s nothing wrong with starting out with 10- to 15-minute meditation sessions or using guided meditation tapes. It’ll get easier to meditate for longer periods of time with practice."

      "title": "The cycle of rebirth only ends when you want for nothing.",
      "content": "The cycle of rebirth only ends when you want for nothing. The desire for youth, beauty, wealth, status, and power will only ensure that the cycle of rebirth continues. You’ve already done this in so many lifetimes and forms—where did it lead you? Back to the fleeting, temporal, and shallow now. [2] X Research source There’s a massive comfort that comes from accepting things as they are, and that comfort is the best sign that you’re closer to enlightenment. Buddhists recognize an “eightfold path” to end suffering. You must have the right understanding, thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Replace the chase for things with a desire for God.",
      "content": "Replace the chase for things with a desire for God. Earthly desires can never replace the singular longing to be one with God. For a Hindu, this is believed to be the will of God. Buddhists develop a single longing for Nirvana, the end of suffering. [4] X Research source This doesn’t mean that it’s wrong to buy things or spend money—just that you shouldn’t make it your central fixation or goal."

      "title": "Remember God throughout the day by speaking His or Her Names.",
      "content": "Remember God throughout the day by speaking His or Her Names. It doesn't matter what you choose to call Him or Her—Christ, Allah, Jehovah, Krishna, Devi, etc. Buddhists remember the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. God is everywhere and comes in all different forms, so pray to them in whatever way makes most sense to you. [5] X Research source If you aren’t fond of traditional prayer, come up with a few mantras about your God and use them throughout the day."

    {
      "title": "Look for (and recognize) God in the little things.",
      "content": "Look for (and recognize) God in the little things. Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, and Hindus call this Dharma (spiritual teachings). Basically, God is order. Wherever you find order, you find God. Stop frequently throughout the day and bring to mind how God or the Dharma explains the world around you and whatever situation you currently find yourself in. [6] X Research source Consider the perfect patterns in a leaf or the beauty of a bumblebee that knows how to spread seeds. These are simple examples of order in daily life. The Hindus believe in three paths to find divinity (known as “margas”). There’s the path of duties, the path of knowledge, and the path of prayer. In other words, you can find God in your daily habits, your studies, or your meditation/prayer. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid excess wherever you can.",
      "content": "Avoid excess wherever you can. For a lot of religious people, alcohol and drugs are the most obvious forms of excess. However, anything that you tend to overdo or makes you stray from your inner peace can be an indulgence. Treat your body as a living temple! [8] X Research source Moderation is one of the easiest ways to cultivate your inner sense of balance."

      "title": "Allow the people around you to travel their own paths.",
      "content": "Allow the people around you to travel their own paths. Whether it is holding onto family, friends, or anyone else, just let them live their own lives. Don’t confuse this with ignoring your kids or parents—your responsibilities to the people who need and love you are important. Just remember that each cycle in one's life has a purpose, and your purpose isn’t to interfere with the journeys of others. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Live as simple a life as possible to focus on God.",
      "content": "Live as simple a life as possible to focus on God. Reduce your belongings and debts to the bare minimum and learn to trust that you will receive what you need. This is why monks often give away their belongings—they want nothing to distract them from the word of God and their inner journey. [10] X Research source This doesn’t mean that you’re best off giving everything away if that’s not what your inner spirit tells you do. It just means that you should be more conscious of what you have and why you have it."

      "title": "If you are destined to be reborn, that’s actually a good thing.",
      "content": "If you are destined to be reborn, that’s actually a good thing. There’s nothing worth avoiding when it comes to reincarnation. There’s nothing cruel or painful that needs to be prevented or shied away from. Whether you’re Hindu, Buddhist, or some other faith, the cycle of life and death exists for a reason. You will learn something new from each perspective and experience, and trying to end that journey prematurely wouldn’t be productive. [11] X Research source"
