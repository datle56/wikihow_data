      "title": "“Do you have a bandage?",
      "content": "“Do you have a bandage? I scraped my knees falling for you.” A goofy pickup line is a great way to drop the hint to your crush. On top of that, if they don’t like you back, you can always play if off like you were joking. This is probably a better option if you’re already friends with your crush, since a pickup line can come off the wrong way if you don’t know the other person super well. Other options include: [1] X Research source “I always thought ‘true love’ started with ‘t,’ but I guess it starts with ‘u.’” “I believe people should follow their dreams. Am I following you on Instagram?” “If you were a fruit, you’d be a fine-apple.”"

      "content": "Arrange your playlist so the titles vertically spell out your message. The idea here isn’t to grab the best music possible (though that’s great, too). Pick songs with titles that fit the message you’re trying to convey and share the playlist with your crush. [2] X Research source Here are some ideas for your next playlist: “Do I Wanna Know?” by Arctic Monkeys followed by “If You Love Me (Really Love Me)” by Brenda Lee ”Hey You” by Pink Floyd, “You’re the One That I Want” by John Travolta and Olivia Newton John, “Are You Gonna Be My Girl” by Jet"

      "title": "If you’re a little shy and creative, a silly illustration is a funny way to go.",
      "content": "If you’re a little shy and creative, a silly illustration is a funny way to go. The upside here is that you won’t have to actually say anything, which is perfect if you’re a bit shy. You could draw two people with triangle heads and write, “We would be acute together,” or draw yourself looking at your crush with ridiculous googly eyes and a heart over your head. [3] X Research source If you feel like putting in some effort, a flip book is a really fun, creative way to confess your feelings. To make one, draw a series of images on a stack of separate pages. When you flip through the pages, it looks like your drawings are moving! You might draw a short 4-panel comic of the two of you doing something cute together and just make the drawings really silly. If you want to be more direct, draw yourself looking at them and write, “I’m so drawn to you. Want to go out sometime?”"

      "title": "Snap a photo of you doing something ridiculous.",
      "content": "Snap a photo of you doing something ridiculous. Add the caption “This could be us if we dated!” For inspiration, you could dress up in a dorky outfit, do an embarrassing dance pretending to hold your date in public, or hug your family pet. Take a photo sitting next to an empty chair and say, “I saved a seat for you. I guess that means I like you.” Draw them into a photo next to you and say, “I miss you! Want to hang out?” [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Write “the story of us” or “our first date” in emojis.",
      "content": "Write “the story of us” or “our first date” in emojis. Go for an earnest yet quirky approach by depicting a nice amusement park outing, or go for a wacky bank robbery date story. Include a caption so your crush understands what’s going on. Caption your emojis, “Hey, I like you. Wanna go on a 👫🎡🧺🎠🎢🎆 date with me?” “Okay, this is how I picture our first date going: 🏃🏃‍♀️💸🏦🚓🚓🚓 Want to see if I’m right?” The words are much less important than energy. You can make boring words interesting by changing the energy. [5] X Research source Focus less on the content and more on the energy and enthusiasm you bring to the content. [6] X Research source Make statements and share good energy with emojis. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Nothing says romance like a slideshow. Pick your favorite school presentation or business presentation format and make charts to convince your crush why you’d be good together. This is definitely an out-there approach, so use this one with caution. [8] X Research source Create a bar graph to demonstrate how you stack up against your crush’s other potential love interests. For this approach, use funny characters or celebrities rather than real people. For instance, you could make a graph ranking Shawn Mendes and Jim Halpert as 5/10s and put yourself as a 10/10. Make a pie chart that says “100% datable.” Draw a line graph labeled “How Happy I Could Make You if We Dated.”"

      "title": "“Roses are red, violets are blue, wow you’re hot!”",
      "content": "“Roses are red, violets are blue, wow you’re hot!” If you aren’t much of a writer, find a template, like “roses are red,” and customize it for your crush. This is a more romantic option, but there are plenty of ways to make it funny. Writing a limerick or song is another funny option! [9] X Research source If you’re looking for inspiration, start with funny metaphors. “You’re sweeter than chocolate cake. You’re hotter than the cookies I bake,” is a goofy and cute way to start it out. You don’t actually have to write the poem if you don’t want to. There are all kinds of cheesy, cute poems out there, and you can preface it with, “I found this and it reminded me of you!”"

      "title": "Nothing says “I like you” quite like a cheesy meme.",
      "content": "Nothing says “I like you” quite like a cheesy meme. If the two of you are always sharing the latest trending memes, this might be a fun way to confess your feelings. Create a custom meme online and specialize it for the person you like. Send it to them and say something like, “I just came across this one online. What do you think?” or, “I made this for you!” depending on how direct you want to be. [10] X Research source You don’t have to make a custom meme if you don’t want to. If you stumble on a meme that works for you, feel free to use that. For example, use the distracted boyfriend meme and put “Me” on the boyfriend, “Finishing my homework” on the girlfriend, and “Daydreaming about you” on the girl walking by. Go the ironic route with something like the Evil Kermit the Frog meme by putting “Being honest and open with my feelings” on Kermit and “Using memes to confess a crush on you” on the Evil Kermit."

      "title": "If you talk on social media or text a lot, this is a fun way to do it.",
      "content": "If you talk on social media or text a lot, this is a fun way to do it. This is a safe choice if you aren’t sure your crush likes you or not. You can always play it off like you just thought the gif was funny if this doesn’t work. Try search terms like “I like you,” or “Falling in love,” and scroll through your options to find a funny one that suits you. [11] X Research source If the two of you have never done this kind of back-and-forth gif sharing, confessing a crush probably isn’t the best time to start. You may just confuse them."

      "title": "“Jamie’s butt is so cute, but I don’t know about his fashion sense.”",
      "content": "“Jamie’s butt is so cute, but I don’t know about his fashion sense.” Whenever they text you back, shoot them the all-caps, “WHOOPS!” and play it off like you were meaning to text someone else. You can also be more ambiguous if you want to test the waters by sending them something like, “She’s a cutie for sure, but I don’t know if she likes me like that.” If they text back, “Are you talking about me :)” you know you’re in. Other options include: [12] X Research source “He’s hotter than a jalapeno, and I’d love to take a bite of that sandwich.” “If Sam and I ever got together, we’d be the cutest couple in school.” Accidentally texting “revealing” information is kind of a funny scenario. If the two of you end up dating, you’ll have a great “How’d you two get together?” story! The danger here is that it’s normally pretty easy to see through this. If you think your crush won’t take it the right way, you may want to go another route."

      "content": "Ask a pizza shop they’re willing to deliver a love note with their pie. Alternatively, ask them to make a heart out of pepperoni or something like that. Even better, pick the pizza up yourself to deliver it in person and confess your feelings. Say something like, “Sorry, I know this is cheesy,” to really lean into the absurdity of the gesture! [13] X Research source You can bake something or buy a cake, spell out something like “Date me, sugar!” or, “I’m sweet on you” and confess your feelings that way."

    {
      "title": "“I absolutely adore you!",
      "content": "“I absolutely adore you! You give me butterflies! Date me, beautiful!” If you’re into theatrics, going over the top can be a funny way to confess a crush. Do it when you’re alone with them, though! Even if the feelings are reciprocal, you might embarrass them if you do it in front of other people. Also, make sure this approach lines up with your crush’s taste of humor; some people may just be put off or confused by theatrics. [14] X Research source Say something like, “You are the all-time greatest, cutest, hottest, funniest, laziest, loudest, and ridiculous person of all time and I love it!” Just try to personalize it a bit. Put on some kind of old-timey monologue to confess your feelings and start with something like, “Hear ye! Hear ye! Mine eyes are glued to thee!”"
