      "title": "Choose a high neck with delicate details.",
      "content": "Choose a high neck with delicate details. Because a high neckline often has a severe look, it's best to opt for a shirt or dress with details that help soften it. A high neckline top or dress with lace or crochet detailing can be very flattering. [1] X Research source Embroidered details can also help balance the more structured look of a high neckline."

      "title": "Pick a delicate fabric.",
      "content": "Pick a delicate fabric. Tops and dresses made of delicate fabrics tend to have a softer look that balances the higher neckline. Look for high neck blouses and dresses in materials such as silk, chiffon, rayon, or cotton voile. [2] X Research source A sheer dress or blouse with high neck is another delicate option that can soften the severe look of the high neckline."

      "title": "Opt for a midi high neck top.",
      "content": "Opt for a midi high neck top. With a high neckline, it helps to make sure that the cut of the rest of the top balances it out. Wearing a midi or cropped high neckline top that hits at your waist or a little above your waist can provide a flattering, balanced look. [3] X Research source If you aren't a fan of cropped tops, choose a snug high neck top that you can tuck into your pants, skirt, or shorts for a similar effect."

    {
      "title": "Try a high neck with cutouts.",
      "content": "Try a high neck with cutouts. If you're worried about a top or dress with a high neckline looking frumpy or old-fashioned, choose a style that features cutouts. In particular, look for a top with cutouts near the neck to help counter the more severe neckline. [4] X Research source A high neck top with cutouts is a good option for the summer when you may want to be a little cooler. For a sexier look, select a high neck top or dress with cutouts near the decolletage. The sliver of skin will help counter the higher neckline."

      "title": "Consider the sleeve length.",
      "content": "Consider the sleeve length. If you're worried about your high neck top or dress looking too dowdy, the sleeve length can make a major difference. Long sleeves with a high neckline can be difficult to pull off, but a sleeveless style can balance the higher neckline for a more modern look. A short sleeve top or dress can also be flattering. If you prefer longer sleeves, opt for a high neckline shirt or dress with sleeves that hit at the elbow instead of the wrist. For a stylish long sleeve, high neckline item, choose one with cutouts. You can even find styles that have cutouts on the arm to help balance the neckline."

      "title": "Choose high-waisted bottoms.",
      "content": "Choose high-waisted bottoms. It's a good idea to pair a high neckline top with bottoms that have a high-waist. That helps accentuate your waistline and create a balanced look for your torso. [5] X Research source If you've been leery of wearing a high-waisted skirt or pair of pants or shorts, they're actually flattering on all body types. They elongate the legs, hide a muffin top, and make your backside appear smaller. When you're wearing high-waisted bottoms, it's important to get the right size. If they're too tight, it's an unflattering look. If they're too loose, they can add bulk to your midsection."

      "title": "Pair a high neckline top with shorts or a skirt.",
      "content": "Pair a high neckline top with shorts or a skirt. In addition to choosing high-waisted bottoms, you may want to think about going short when you're wearing a high neckline top. Pairing it with shorts or a skirt exposes some skin that helps balance the more severe look on top. To keep your look balanced, don't choose shorts or skirts that are too short. Look for styles that hit between mid-thigh and the knee for the most flattering look. You can wear your high neckline top with shorts and skirts even in the winter. Just add a pair of tights in an interesting color or texture."

      "content": "Opt for denim to keep it casual. When you want your high neckline top to have a relaxed look, pair with denim bottoms. Your favorite pair of jeans or a denim mini or knee-length skirt can give you a chic casual look for everyday. [6] X Research source If you really want a top with a high neck to feel fresh, modern, and relaxed, wear it with denim cutoffs for a perfect summer weekend look."

      "title": "Go tailored for a more formal look.",
      "content": "Go tailored for a more formal look. If you want to wear your high neck top to the office or out to dinner, choose a tailored bottom to pair it with. A streamlined pencil skirt or a slim-fitting pair of trousers in wool or herringbone can instantly dress up any high neck top. [7] X Research source You can also find tailored shorts if you want a formal look for your top that still feels playful."

      "title": "Wear your hair up.",
      "content": "Wear your hair up. If you're wearing a top with a high neckline, you want to wear your hair in a way that showcases your neck. Pull your hair up into a ponytail or a topknot for a more dramatic look. For a softer feel, wear your hair in a bun at the nape of your neck. [8] X Research source If you don't want to wear your hair completely up, go for a half up half down style. That will keep the hair out of your face, so the neckline is more visible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Opt for a long necklace.",
      "content": "Opt for a long necklace. If you want to wear a necklace with a high neckline, it's best to choose a long style that hits between the chest and the waist. That will draw attention downward to balance the higher neck. With a high neckline, you may want to skip a necklace entirely. The neckline detail may add enough visual interest to your outfit that a necklace isn't necessary."

      "title": "Pair it with hanging earrings.",
      "content": "Pair it with hanging earrings. A high neckline draws attention to your face, so you can maintain the focus by wearing it with dangling earrings. A style that ends right at the top of the neckline is the especially flattering. If you have a long face, stay away from straight dangling earrings. Instead, opt for a pair of hoops or dangling earrings with round pendants."

      "title": "Accent the neckline with a belt.",
      "content": "Accent the neckline with a belt. You can give your high neckline top a more polished look by wearing a belt with your outfit. Tuck your top into the bottoms of your choice, and add a belt at your waistline, which will help define the area so your torso appears balanced. For the most balanced look, choose a belt that's approximately 1 Â½-inches (4-cm) wide. That's the most flattering width for both short- and long-waisted figures."
