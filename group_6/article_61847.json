      "content": "Keep the bathroom door open. Crack your bathroom door while you’re showering if you can so the moisture can escape from your bathroom. When you’re finished in the bathroom, leave the door wide open for at least 15–20 minutes to help dry it out and let fresh air circulate in. [3] X Research source If you have a glass shower door, leave it open so it can air out. If you have a shower curtain, pull it closed after you finish since mold and mildew can form if you leave it pushed to one side."

      "title": "Ceiling vent fan",
      "content": "Ceiling vent fan A ceiling vent either moves air straight up through the roof or horizontally to an exterior wall of your home. Calculate the power of the fan you’ll need based on the size of your bathroom and the fixtures you have to ensure that it vents properly. Typically, 90-100 CFM would be sufficient for a bathroom. If you’ve already got ductwork, you can install a bathroom fan on your own, but contact an HVAC contractor if you’re starting from scratch. [7] X Research source Different fans have different noise levels, usually from 0.3 to 3 sones. The lower the better, but keep in mind that a quieter fan might require a bigger duct. While most fans have a 4-inch duct, the quietest models have a 6-inch duct. Some ceiling vent fans have built-in lights so you can use them as another lighting fixture in your bathroom. Ceiling vent fans can cost around $100–200 USD for the unit, but hiring someone to install new ductwork could cost upwards of $2,000 USD."

The cost of a floor duct fan depends on if you already have ductwork in your floor and how it needs to reach for an exterior wall, but it usually costs around $1,500–2000 for the unit and ducts."

      "title": "Wall vent fan",
      "content": "Wall vent fan A wall vent draws the inside air through the wall to the outside of your home, so they work if your bathroom is on an exterior wall. Wall vents are usually smaller than ceiling or floor vents, but they can be installed directly in an exterior wall without additional ducts. [9] X Research source Air may blow inside through a wall vent, so install an exterior vent cover over the outside of the vent to help prevent backdrafts. Wall vents usually cost less than $1,000 USD to completely install."

      "content": "Increased ductwork If you already have vents in your bathroom but moisture still builds up, the air ducts may not be big enough or you may not have enough vents. You can install wider ducts in your wall to improve the airflow. You can also add multiple vents to your bathroom so moist air has more places to escape.

      "content": "Recirculating fan A recirculating fan filters air through an activated charcoal filter to eliminate odors, but they don’t effectively vent out moisture. Since recirculating fans are ductless, they don’t take as long to install and are great for adding a little circulation to half bathrooms that don’t have a tub or shower. [11] X Research source Check the building codes in your area since using recirculating fans might not be allowed. Recirculating fans usually cost between $50–200 USD."
