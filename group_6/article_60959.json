      "content": "Put on rubber gloves and a facemask before you begin testing. Whenever you're handling materials that may contain lead, it's important to make sure that the bare skin on your hands is completely covered. The same rule applies to sensitive orifices like your nose and mouth. [2] X Research source You might also consider wearing long sleeved clothing and lab goggles or another form of eye protection in order to minimize your exposure as much as possible."

Then, wipe down your scoring tool and scraper tool with a separate swab to sterilize them. [3] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source D-Lead Paint Test Kits can be used on both hard surfaces, like hardwood and trim, and soft ones, like drywall. Standard kits include enough sanitizing swabs (and other testing materials) for about 6 individual uses."

      "content": "Remove a paint chip from an out-of-the-way part of your testing surface. Dig the tip of the scoring tool into an inconspicuous section of paint. Once you've loosed the circular chip, use the edge of the scraper tool to gently pry it free from the wall and into the folded chip catcher tray. [4] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Areas like interior corners, closets, and baseboard borders make good test sites, as they're not immediately visible. There's also less risk of further chipping or peeling than in frequently-used areas. Be sure to make your initial cut fairly deep to scrape away multiple layers of paint—it's possible that an old coat of lead paint could have been painted over with a non-lead variety."

      "content": "Transfer your fresh paint sample to a pre-filled vial of Solution 1. Use the chip catcher tray as a funnel to ensure that the paint chip doesn't come into contact with any other surfaces before it goes into the solution. Add the entire sample to the vial, even if it happens to break into smaller pieces. [5] X Research source Don't attempt to pick up your paint sample by hand or use any other items to brush it off of the chip catcher tray. Doing so could contaminate the sample and consequently throw off your results."

      "content": "Close the vial of Solution 1 and shake it for 10 seconds. Make sure you properly secure the twist-on cap before you begin shaking. After 10 seconds, set the vial aside and allow it to sit for at least 2 minutes. This will give the solution time to completely permeate the paint sample. [6] X Research source If you proceed with the test before waiting a full 2 minutes, your final results may be inaccurate."

Whisk the solution back and forth for 10 seconds as you did the first time. If your paint sample contains traces of lead, you'll notice the solution beginning to change colors as you shake Don't forget to confirm that the cap is on nice and tight before shaking. Solution 2 contains the active lead indicator that will tell you whether there's lead present in the paint sample you collected."

      "content": "Compare the color of the solution to the test standard on the vial. To determine whether your sample contains an unsafe concentration of lead, look through the yellow-tinted viewing window printed at the top of the vial. If the color of the solution is darker than that of the test standard, it means that it's positive for lead. [7] X Research source When the 2 test solutions are mixed, lead-tainted paint will cause them to take on a dull yellow color. If you discover unsafe levels of lead in your home, your next step will be to contact an EPA-certified risk assessor for further inspection or possible removal."

      "title": "Shake the solution a second time if it's lighter than the test standard.",
      "content": "Shake the solution a second time if it's lighter than the test standard. If the solution turns a pale yellow color, it may mean that the solution hasn't had enough time to break down the paint sample. Give the vial another vigorous shake and set a timer for exactly 10 minutes, then observe the color a second time. Assuming the solution is still a light yellow at the end of the 10 minute interval, it means that your sample is negative for lead, or contains an amount that's considered non-hazardous. It's necessary to re-test light-colored solutions because adding Solution 2 to the test solution can sometimes introduce a slight yellow hue."

You can use 3M Lead Check Swabs on all painted walls, fixtures, and furniture, as well as plastics, metals, ceramics, and composite materials. [12] X Research source Lead test swabs may not work as well on porous or irregular surfaces, such as raw stone, metal grating, or painted wicker. If you're testing a painted surface, remove a thin section of the outer coat to expose the underlying layers before you apply the swab. That way, you'll be be able to identify contaminated paint that's since been covered."

If the swab doesn't change color, it means no lead has been detected and you can check that surface or material off of your list. [14] X Research source Always use a separate swab for each individual surface or material you test to avoid cross-contamination and ensure clear, dependable results. Keep in mind that it's possible for the rhodizonate in 3M Lead Check Swabs to produce false positive results when used on red or pink surfaces."

Once time is up, remove the test strip and hold it up alongside the color chart included with the product you're using to determine whether the resulting hue indicates an unsafe amount of lead. With most tests, a positive result is represented by a yellow color. The darker the hue, the higher the concentration. One downside to instant lead water testing kits is that they only give positive or negative results rather than a more exact parts-per-million reading. This means it's possible that the water in your home could contain some concentration of lead that doesn't show up in the test."
