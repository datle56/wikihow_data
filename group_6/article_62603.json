      "content": "The table shows all the Tengwar that were commonly used in the West-lands in the Third Age of Middle-earth as explained by Tolkien in Appendix E of The Lord of the Rings . The arrangement is the one most usual at the time in the kingdom of Gondor. But the original Fëanorian alphabet consisted of a scheme of 24 signs representing consonants. To each consonant the vowel a was attached, as in the alphabet of Rúmil, the other vowels being represented by diacritic marks (usually placed above the consonantal sign). The writing ran from left to right."

      "title": "Learn the numbers.",
      "content": "Learn the numbers. Tengwar can use either base 10 (decimal) or base twelve. It can also be written with the units first (so units, tens, hundreds etc, so 125 is five hundred and twenty one) or the more familiar units last (the way numbers are written in English). Usually, when using base 12, a dot is placed under the units digit. You can also place a dot or an overbar (not both) above every digit to make them stand out."

    {
      "title": "Learn the tehtar.",
      "content": "Learn the tehtar. Ancient modes of Tengwar had no letters for the vowels. Instead, they use diacritic marks, called tehtar, for the vowels. The vowels were variously represented. The usual system, especially with Elvish languages, or others of fairly simple vocalic system, was as follows: The sign like a dotless i was the vowel­ carrier: normally= a. The sounds i, e, o, u were denoted by diacritical signs as shown above."

    {
      "title": "The placement of the tehtar varies:",
      "content": "The placement of the tehtar varies: sometimes they are placed on the tengwa before them, other times the tengwa after them. If there is no tengwa in the appropriate place, then the tehta (singular of tehtar) is placed on a carrier. The short carrier is used for short vowels, the long carrier is used for long vowels."

      "content": "The punctuation. Each mode has its punctuation marks usage. The Elvish ‘punctuation tittles’ (max 4 dots) are not used exactly as the “European modern punctuation” but rather indicating pauses, the more of dots = longer pause. Texts written by Tolkien in natural languages (Latin, English, Old English) don't use the tengwar punctuation but standard English punctuation instead."

As explained by Tolkien, the ára-tencele mode is used for especially ornamental script or incised inscriptions. The poem \"Namárië\" as published in the book The Road Goes Ever On is written in the ára-tencele mode."

This tengwa is used for an s that developed from a th. E.g. súle was originally thúle. That change in pronunciation was opposed by the Elf Fëanor. Otherwise, for \"s\" use the second tengwa called \"silme\". The third tengwa \"ñoldo\" was used in Classical Quenya for ñ (like English ng in sing), later in Colloquial Quenya it was pronounced \"n\". The fourth tengwa \"ñwalme\" is only used initially (at the start of a word) in Classical Quenya, it had the value ñw. Later in Colloquial Quenya is was pronounced \"nw\". The fifth tengwa is called \"anna\" by Tolkien in Appendix E. It was used in Classical Quenya for the clear beginning or glottal stop initially (at the start of a word). Tolkien should have written \" ’anna\" in Appendix E as he did in other writings. Later this Tengwa became used as a carrier because the glottal stop disappeared. The sixth tengwa is used for a v that developed from a w. E.g. Vilya (Elrond's ring of power) was originally Wilya (meaning air), so it is spelt with this tengwa. The seventh tengwa called \"halla\" is used for independent \"h\". It is used in Classical Quenya for unvoiced initial r and l, hr, hl."
