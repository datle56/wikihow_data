Avoid using ashes from cardboard, coal or painted wood. These substances contain chemicals that can be harmful to your plants. Monitor your soil to be sure it hasn't become too alkaline. Use a soil testing kit to check the PH levels or take a soil sample to your county extension office lab to be evaluated. [4] X Research source Alkaline soil will need sulfur added to it."
