For most people, surgery is a last resort, but if carpal tunnel syndrome is interfering with your life and nothing else is working to improve your symptoms, it may be the best option for you. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of surgery to determine if it is right for you. Carpal tunnel release surgery involved cutting the tissue around the medial nerve in order to release the pressure. There are two types of carpal tunnel surgery: open release surgery requires a two-inch long incision, while endoscopic release surgery requires two smaller incisions, which may reduce the patient's pain and recovery time. It can take several months to fully recover from carpal tunnel surgery, although you may experience relief of your symptoms immediately after the procedure."
