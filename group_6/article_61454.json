      "content": "You can unlock a Samsung phone without losing data (mostly). If you're looking to unlock a device that you've forgotten the password to, you can reset it from a backup with Google's Find My Device. Restoring data after a reset is easy as long as you have a backup and/or sync important data like photos and contacts to your Google account. Backups are made when you connect your Android account and Google account and have basic device backup on. If you don't have backups on and can't remember your phone password, it's very unlikely that you'll be able to get into your device without losing any data. If you can access your device, you can set up Smart Lock (also called Extend Unlock) to keep your phone unlocked without needing the password."
