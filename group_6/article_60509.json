      "title": "Use a phone company service to find out who is calling.",
      "content": "Use a phone company service to find out who is calling. Phone companies offer a variety of services that can help you figure out who is making a prank call. The availability and cost of these services vary by company. A \"trap\" is a service that enables the phone company to determine the number of a prank caller if they call repeatedly. Once a trap is set up you record the times and dates of calls so that the phone company can use them to find the caller's number. A trace can help you find the number of the last caller to your landline phone. Dial *57 (1157 for rotary/pulse phones) right after you receive a prank call and follow the instructions in the recorded message from your phone company. Caller ID is a service you can set up in advance to see who is calling you as soon as the phone begins to ring. Check with your phone company to see what equipment and costs are required to use Caller ID. Anonymous Call Rejection or Privacy Manager are services that can help you find out blocked numbers or prevent them from calling. These services require callers who have blocked their number from Caller ID to reveal their phone number in order to complete a call to your line. If the caller's number normally appears as \"anonymous,\" \"private,\" \"out of area,\" or \"unavailable,\" the service requires the caller to state their name before allowing the call to ring your phone line."
