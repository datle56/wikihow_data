[6] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. The valve is usually housed in a grate in the ground. If you lift up the grate, you should see a hole with a pipe running through it and your home’s water meter. [7] X Research source If you live in a colder climate , the water valve may be inside your home. Master plumber Dave Jones says, “If your home has a basement, you’ll likely find the main water shutoff valve on a basement wall facing the front of your house” or near your water heater. “On slab homes, the valve is often hidden from view inside a closet or wall access panel near the front of the house.” [8] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. To open the water valve grate , simply reach down and pick it up. If this is hard to do, Jones says you may need to insert a “wrench or meter key” into the keyhole.

      "content": "Identify the water valve. You may notice a water meter or gauge with 1 or more turn handles on either side. These handles are the water shut-off valves. [10] X Research source In newer homes , there may be 2 valves, with 1 on either side of the water meter. In this case, use the valve closest to your house, which is usually a gate (or wheel-shaped) valve. Simply turn this by hand. In older homes , there is often just 1 valve, called a ball valve. It usually has a notched top that is perpendicular to the pipe. Jones says you typically need a meter/water key for “turning the water on and off.” Luckily, you can find these keys online and at most hardware stores.

Opening the valve slowly allows the water to start running fully without the risk of damaging or bursting your pipes. [12] X Research source If the valve is wheel-shaped , turn it with your hands or with a wrench. If the valve is a ball valve with a notched top , use a water key. Hold the T-shaped side and place the other side on top of the notch. Then, turn it. Jones says, “When the valve’s handle is in line with the pipe, it’s open. When it’s perpendicular to the pipe, it’s closed.” [13] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021.
