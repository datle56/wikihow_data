      "title": "Cats instinctively bury their poop to hide their location from predators.",
      "content": "Cats instinctively bury their poop to hide their location from predators. In the wild, predators can smell a cat’s poop and track down the individual cat it came from. Cats thus bury their poop to make themselves harder to find. Though domesticated cats don’t have to worry about being hunted, their poop-burying survival instincts remain strong."

      "title": "Burying poop is a way to avoid challenging another cat’s territory.",
      "content": "Burying poop is a way to avoid challenging another cat’s territory. In the wild, cats use poop to mark their territory. Every cat’s poop has a unique smell, which other cats can detect and interpret as a message to “back off.” [1] X Research source But cats don’t always want to fight for territory, so they’ll bury their poop to avoid confrontation. Like their wild cousins, domestic cats instinctively worry about fighting for territory, even if they don’t live with other cats."

      "title": "They might have a conflict with other cats.",
      "content": "They might have a conflict with other cats. In the wild, stronger and more dominant cats will spray urine or leave their poop out in the open as a signal to other cats. This is their way of saying “back off” or “this is my territory.” If you own multiple cats, one or more of them may mark their territory by spraying urine and leaving their poop unburied. Have your cat spayed or neutered to reduce this “marking behavior.” [2] X Research source"

      "content": "They’re in pain or feeling sick. Health issues like stress, urinary tract infections, kidney problems, diabetes, paw injuries, and arthritis due to aging can all impact your kitty’s bathroom habits. If they’re in pain or not feeling well, using the litter box might become too difficult. [3] X Research source Take your cat to a veterinarian to check for health issues. Make sure to mention that they won’t use their litter box, or recently stopped using it."

    {
      "title": "They don’t like their litter box.",
      "content": "They don’t like their litter box. The box might be too small or in a location that your cat can’t reach. The litter itself could also be unpleasant to the touch. Whatever the case may be, your cat might prefer pooping somewhere else if their litter box is not to their liking. [4] X Research source Try picking a different litter mixture or moving the litter box to a new spot to see if your cat uses it more frequently."

    {
      "title": "Choose a box size and litter mixture that your cat likes.",
      "content": "Choose a box size and litter mixture that your cat likes. Go with unscented, finely-textured kitty litter and spread a layer 2 inches (5 cm) deep. Make sure the box is open, easy to climb into, and doesn't have a lid. Additionally, pick a box with low sides if your cat has mobility issues, or if it’s a tiny kitten. This will make it easier for them to climb in and out. [5] X Research source If possible, get an uncovered box to allow odors to dissipate. An uncovered box also gives your cat a full view of their surroundings, which makes them feel safer while using it."

      "title": "Make sure you have enough litter boxes for all your cats.",
      "content": "Make sure you have enough litter boxes for all your cats. Experts recommend having one more litter box than the number of cats in your home. For instance, if you own one cat, you should have two litter boxes in different locations in your house. Two cats require three litter boxes, three cats need four, and so on. [6] X Research source Remember: cats use poop to mark their territory, and domestic cats are still territorial like their wild ancestors. Give your cats plenty of places to poop to ensure that they won’t compete with each other for litter boxes."

      "content": "Put litter boxes in quiet, private locations that are accessible 24/7. The box should be far from the cat’s feeding bowl, ideally in another room altogether. Avoid putting litter boxes in hard-to-reach places, such as up several flights of stairs, especially if your cat is older and has difficulty climbing stairs. [7] X Research source It's tempting to hide your litter box in a spot like the basement, but your kitty may not be willing to visit it. Make sure the box is easily accessible to your fur baby. Put multiple boxes in different areas of your home. If the boxes are next to each other, your cat might consider them to be one big box. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your litter boxes clean. Wet, smelly, poop-filled litter boxes are gross for people and kitties alike. Scoop out your litter boxes once a day to remove poop, and wash them once a week to keep them extra clean . [9] X Research source Scrub the box itself with unscented detergent with each cleaning. Let it dry and refill it with clean litter. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep trying different box sizes, locations, and litter mixtures.",
      "content": "Keep trying different box sizes, locations, and litter mixtures. Most cats don’t need litter box training since burying their poop is an instinctive behavior. But sometimes, a kitty will refuse to use a litter box until it’s just to their liking. Try multiple litter boxes of different sizes and litter mixtures. Keep moving them around until something works. [11] X Research source Be patient and give your cat time to adjust to a litter box. Once you find a box, little mixture, and location that your cat likes, stick with it."
