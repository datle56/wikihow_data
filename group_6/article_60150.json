Sleeping on your side can restrict the blood flow to injured tendons, which may put a strain on your already irritated tendons and increase discomfort. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Instead, try sleeping on your back with your arms by your side or resting on your stomach to alleviate pressure in your arm and boost your healing while you rest.

Sleeping on your stomach can cause compression and irritation in your neck and upper back, which can increase strain on your elbow. Try putting a small towel in the arch of your back to help support your back while you’re sleeping. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a brace to reduce pressure on your tendons if you clench your fists. If you tend to clench your fists while sleeping, wearing a brace to bed might reduce pressure on injured tendons by keeping the forearm muscles from contracting. A counter force brace that wraps around the upper part of your forearm may also help take pressure off your muscles.

If you’re interested in wearing a brace while sleeping, ask a GP or physiotherapist what type of brace or splint they recommend.

Straighten your elbow out with the palm of your hand facing the ground, use your other hand to gently pull your fingers down toward the underside of your wrist, and hold this position for 30 seconds.
