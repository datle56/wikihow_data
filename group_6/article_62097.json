      "content": "Tell someone you want a casual, sexual relationship on a dating app. Put “FWB” in your profile to let all potential matches know what you’re looking for.

For example, your profile might say: “Only looking for FWB. Swipe left if you want more!” Person 1: “I’m not sure I want a relationship right now, but I’m down for fwb.” Person 2: “Yeah, that sounds good”"
