      "content": "A “tryhard” is someone who puts too much effort into something. “Tryhard” is often used as a derogatory term for someone who, simply put, tries too hard at or cares too much about something, and in the process makes that thing less enjoyable for other people. [1] X Research source It’s most often used in a gaming context, particularly when playing multiplayer games. The word is also sometimes used to refer to a person overcompensating for their lack of skill with sheer effort, instead. It may also be used as a verb. Example: “He only won because he’s a tryhard. The rest of us were playing for fun.” “Stop tryharding and just enjoy the game.” “We absolutely stomped on those tryhards. They’ve got enthusiasm, but no strategy.”"

      "content": "A tryhard might also be someone who’s too concerned with success. Sometimes, “tryhard” refers to someone who’s so obsessed with being successful that they use dubious methods to gain that success. They might imitate people who are already successful, exploit the rules, or even cheat in order to gain victory, fame, or other accomplishments, similar to a “sellout.” Examples: “Those tryhards dumbed down their music so they could hit it big.” “The corporate tryhards are trying to appeal to young people, but they’re too out of touch to pull it off.”"

      "content": "Being a “tryhard” is subjective, and doesn’t make you a bad player. Here’s the thing about being a tryhard: it’s often an insult hurled by people who want to invalidate someone else’s victory. You’ll probably hear it used by a losing team to say, “Well, who cares if you won. You’re just trying too hard, which is more embarrassing than losing.” But what’s the point of playing a game—be it a video game, sport, or any other—if not to at least try to win? [2] X Research source As long as you’re having fun (and not trying to hurt other people’s fun), don’t worry too much about being a tryhard and don’t pay attention to the haters."

      "title": "Tryharding may make you forget to have fun.",
      "content": "Tryharding may make you forget to have fun. While you shouldn’t be too concerned if other people call you a tryhard, pay attention to whether the effort you put into something matches the amount of fun or enjoyment you’re having. Sometimes, when we’re too focused on success or victory, we forget to take pleasure in the process, and can become frustrated when we don’t get the results we want. At that point, the activity brings more heartache than joy, and it might be time to take a step back."

      "title": "Being a tryhard usually only applies to games or recreational activities.",
      "content": "Being a tryhard usually only applies to games or recreational activities. You’ll most often hear the word “tryhard” in contexts like sports, video games, board games, etc.—things people do for fun. In these contexts, having fun is an important aspect of the activity, and even a priority. In other contexts, like your career, personal aspirations, health, or other serious undertakings, there’s not really such a thing as a tryhard. These are areas where you should always be trying hard, no matter what other people say. Of course, these things can also be enjoyable, too, and you should take breaks so you don’t wear yourself out from trying too hard. Life is all about finding that balance!"

      "title": "Do your best, but make sure to have fun.",
      "content": "Do your best, but make sure to have fun. There’s no shame in playing to win or putting your best effort into whatever you’re doing. That’s the whole point of video games, sports, hobbies, and passions, and doing your best is how you get results. Just be sure you’re actually enjoying the effort, too. Winning is fun, but if the journey is no fun itself, is it really worth it? [3] X Research source If you find yourself getting angry or upset, handle your frustration by taking a break from the activity and coming back when you’ve cooled down. Also, remind yourself why you do the activity in the first place—because it brings you pleasure, or makes you feel accomplished. Not because you have to be the best."

      "content": "Make sure other people are having fun, too. While it’s important to try your best, it’s also important to play by the rules so that everyone has a fair shot, and so that everyone can have fun. If the way you’re playing a game seems to make others uncomfortable, pause and ask yourself: Am I taking this too seriously? Am I stopping other people from enjoying the activity? It might be times to loosen up and relax a bit. Even if your strategy is within the rules, it might go against the “spirit of the game,” which is the idea that everyone should play the game with fun and fairness in mind. [4] X Research source Focus on what you can do yourself to help other people have fun, like including them in your game or strategies, asking them for advice, or giving them a chance to show off their own skills. That said, other people’s fun can’t always be your responsibility. Sometimes, people will be sore losers, and that’s out of your control."

      "content": "Be a kind winner and a gracious loser. Sore losers complain after a loss, even when they lost fair and square. When you lose, take a moment to appreciate how much fun you had, and ask yourself what you learned, and how you’ll take what you learned into the next game. Even when you don’t win, you can still be proud of your efforts and cherish the good times you spent with other people. [5] X Research source And when you do win, be a gracious victor by complimenting both your teammates and your opponents on their skills, and tell them you had fun! Also, try not to call other people “tryhard.” It’s rude, for one thing, but is also often an indicator that maybe you’re taking things too seriously, yourself."
