      "content": "Audio ducking is a technique that balances the volume levels of different tracks. If you have multiple audio tracks playing at the same time, audio ducking is the process of lowering one of those tracks so the other track can be heard more clearly. One example of audio ducking you likely have heard before is when the music in a track gets quieter once someone starts speaking. The music is \"ducking down\" so as not to obstruct the other audio track (in this case, the speaking). Some common uses for audio ducking are as follows: Making ample space for spoken words: When adding a voiceover to a video, presentation, podcast, or other audio project, audio ducking can be used to highlight spoken words by lowering the background music. This helps ensure the voiceover can be heard clearly. Balancing vocals and background music: When a singer is singing, you want to make sure they can be heard over the background music. Audio ducking can be used to lower the instrumental track enough so the singer's voice can be heard clearly. Creating immersive audio experiences with sound design: By strategically lowering the volume of a track during specific moments, you can make your listeners feel more immersed in the audio experience you've made. Emphasizing sound effects: If your audio has a lot of sound effects, you may want to use audio ducking to slightly lower the background audio so the sound effects come across clearly."

[1] X Research source The audio ducking setting in VoiceOver will lower the sound of media playing on your phone (such as a video or music) when VoiceOver is speaking to help improve audio clarity. [2] X Research source If you use VoiceOver on your iPhone and find it hard to hear VoiceOver when you're listening to music or watching a video, the audio ducking setting can help by automatically lowering other sounds while VoiceOver is talking."

In this method, we'll teach you how to do some basic audio ducking manually, but check to see if your favorite audio editor has a built-in tool or supports an audio ducking plugin. If you don't see the words \"audio ducking\" look for any tool with the word \"duck\" in the name. You may also want to look for \"sidechain compression.\""

      "title": "Place four points on the volume of the audio track you want to duck.",
      "content": "Place four points on the volume of the audio track you want to duck. How you do this varies based on what program you're using. In Adobe Premiere Pro, for example, these are called keyframes. Place the points where you want the audio to get lower. The two outermost points (the first and fourth points) should go where you want the audio to start and stop ducking. Place the second point directly to the right of the first point, and place the third point directly to the left of the fourth point."
