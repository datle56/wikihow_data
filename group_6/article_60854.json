      "title": "Is your partner in touch with their emotions?",
      "content": "Is your partner in touch with their emotions? Emotionally available people can put how they’re feeling (both good and bad) into words. When your partner shares their feelings with you, it shows trust. On the flip side, your partner might find it hard to talk about their feelings if they didn’t grow up in a culture or environment that encouraged vulnerability and self-expression. They might express their feelings differently (for instance, they might show you they love you by doing a task for you or giving you a gift). [1] X Research source If your partner is reluctant to express their feelings, be patient. Encourage them to go on when they do express their emotions and respond kindly: “I really appreciate that you shared that with me.” Often, willingness to talk about feelings is linked to attachment styles that people learn from when they’re a child. [2] X Research source However, even if your partner has an insecure attachment style, they can learn to open up with time."

Not everyone can send a lightning-fast response back via text, and you might not have deep conversations every time you see your partner. Still, you’ll know they’re emotionally available if you feel secure in knowing you’ll get an honest, thoughtful response from them if you reach out (online or IRL).

Do they talk to you about what’s going on in their life?"

It’s an even better sign of emotional availability if they’re willing to discuss future plans specifically involving you and your relationship! After all, studies show that conversations about future goals and values foster closeness, even between strangers. [5] X Research source To get a conversation about the future started, and to get those warm and fuzzy feelings flowing, here are some ideas: “What’s something you’ve dreamed about doing for a long time?” “If someone could predict what your life would be like in five years, would you want to know? What do you think it would look like?”"

      "content": "Your partner doesn’t bring “baggage” into your present relationship. Instead, they’ve used their past relationship experience to learn more about how they can be a better partner, as well as what they’re looking for in a future partner.

When you and your partner argue, it shows emotional availability because you’re both expressing your own set of needs. [7] X Expert Source Sarah Schewitz, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 April 2019. Contrast that with the “silent treatment,” which is a key sign of an emotionally unavailable person. Good conflict prompts you to make a change to better collaborate and address your different perspectives. [8] X Research source To work towards productive conflict, focus on these key strategies: [9] X Research source Focus on the present and future—what you two can do moving forward, rather than dwelling on the past. Use “I feel” statements rather than accusatory comments. For example: “I feel disappointed you couldn’t make it tonight” rather than “You screwed up dinner again.” Address one problem or situation at a time. Listen to the other person’s perspective. Let go of being “right.”"

By bringing you into other relationships in their life, your partner allows you to gain a better sense of their own values, upbringing, and who they are outside of your dynamic.

      "content": "You aren’t the only one moving the relationship forward. Big steps like saying \"I love you\" for the first time can be scary, but they're important when it comes to openness. Notice how often your partner is willing to take an emotional risk—a situation when they don’t know how you might respond or might face rejection. That’s a key sign of vulnerability and emotional investment into the relationship. [14] X Research source Some other examples of emotional risks include: Asking to be “exclusive.” Labeling the relationship, whether that means calling yourselves a couple, partners, girlfriend/boyfriend, etc. Making plans for the future, like moving in together."

That’s a sign of emotional availability, respect, and care. On the other hand, it’s normal to not be able to make an event or date once in a while, but chronic flakiness might be a sign of a lack of commitment to the relationship. [15] X Research source"
