The portable filter in an espresso machine is filled with a shot basket depending on the size espresso you want. Insert either a single or double shot basket into the portable filter. [2] X Research source If you use a double shot basket for a single shot, or vice versa, your espresso may not turn out. Before filling the basket, double check that you're using the right one.

If any loose grounds got on the side of the filter, wipe them off with your fingers. [4] X Research source If you're grinding beans, most espresso machines have a built-in grinder you can use. If you have them on hand, use espresso grounds over coffee grounds. Espresso grounds are ground finer than coffee grounds. Espresso gets its layers and flavor from the fact hot water is forced through very small grounds. Using coffee within a few days generally helps it stay fresh and makes strong-tasting espresso.

      "content": "Use your tamper. A tamper is a small device with a handle that you use to push down your coffee grounds. This helps ensure the grounds are compressed so you can make a strong-tasting shot of espresso. To use the tamper, press the top of the tamper on top of your grinds. Push downwards as far as the tamper will go to get your coffee grounds nice and compact. [6] X Research source"

A steam wand is used with a stainless steel pitcher. In most cases, the pitcher is filled about one-third of the way up with milk prior to the frothing or steaming process. To use the steam wand, you place the tip of the wand in the milk and then proceed to turn it on. [15] X Research source Some espresso machines come with a built-in steam wand that can be turned on using the machine's control panel."

Place the tip of the steam wand about half an inch (1.27 centimeters) into the milk, keeping it to one side of the pitcher. Turn the steam wand on and wait until the milk creates a natural whirlpool. Let the milk swirl until it doubles in size and has a nice, foamy texture. [16] X Research source If a whirlpool doesn't form on its own, swirl the pitcher clockwise slightly to create a whirlpool."

Screw on the lid tight and then shake the jar as hard as you can until the amount of milk has doubled in size. This usually takes between 30 and 60 seconds. After this, microwave the jar for 30 seconds so the foam rises to the top of the milk. [17] X Research source"

Once there is a steady whirlpool spinning, and the milk is lukewarm, tilt the pitcher at a slight angle. Let the milk heat until the pitcher begins to feel uncomfortable to touch.
