      "title": "Open the arms of the can opener.",
      "content": "Open the arms of the can opener. The arms of the can opener need to be in the open position so that the cutting edge can be fitted to the can. Grasp 1 arm of the can opener with each hand and gently pull the arms apart. The arms will lightly lock in place when they are in the open position. [1] X Research source The arms of the can opener only need to be open while you are fitting it to the can, rather than while the can opener is in use. You can either keep the can on a flat surface while you use the can opener or hold it in the air."

      "title": "Place the cutting edge of the can opener on top of the lip of the can lid.",
      "content": "Place the cutting edge of the can opener on top of the lip of the can lid. Keep the arms of the can opener in the open position while you align the cutting edge. Ensure that the cutting edge is resting on top of the lip of the can and that the serrated wheel is lined up in the furrow that circles the can’s edge. Then make sure that the rotating handle is positioned on the outside of the can, so that you are able to easily turn it. [2] X Research source On the can opener, the cutting edge is situated alongside the handle, the axle, and the serrated wheel that bites into the rim of the can lid. The purpose of the serrated wheel is to hold onto the can lid, keeping the can opener attached and stable while the cutting edge cuts into the can lid. The cutting edge hangs over the small raised lip adjacent to the furrow."

      "title": "Close the arms of the can opener to puncture the lid of the can.",
      "content": "Close the arms of the can opener to puncture the lid of the can. Press the handles of the can opener together. This pushes the cutting edge into the lid of the can. Listen for the hissing sound as the cutting edge punctures through the lid and releases the pressure from inside the can. [3] X Research source You may need to use 2 hands to close the can opener arms if it’s too difficult."
    },
    {
      "title": "Twist the can opener handle to rotate the cutting edge around the lid.",
      "content": "Twist the can opener handle to rotate the cutting edge around the lid. Hold the can opener arms in 1 hand and twist the handle clockwise with your other hand. This causes the serrated wheel to roll around the edge of the can which makes the cutting edge move and puncture through the can. Work your way around the can lid until it has mostly separated from the can and only 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of the lid remains connected. [4] X Research source Alternatively, you can continue to cut the lid until it comes off completely. If you don't apply enough pressure while you're turning the handle, the can opener might stop puncturing the surface. In this case, detach the can opener from the can, reattach it at the last point where the lid was cut, and try again."

      "title": "Lift the lid from the can to remove it.",
      "content": "Lift the lid from the can to remove it. Once you have almost completely separated the lid from the can, open the arms of the can opener and pull it away from the can. Then use your fingernails or a knife to carefully pry the lid of the can upward so that you can see the contents. Pour the contents out of the can and recycle or discard the can. [5] X Research source Be very cautious not to cut yourself on the razor-sharp edge of the can or the severed lid. It’s safe to pinch the flat top and bottom of the lid, but try not to touch the sides. If the lid has separated from the can entirely and has sunken into the contents, pry it out with a knife or another flat, sturdy object."

      "content": "Unfold the can opener blade from the Swiss Army knife . Get your Swiss Army knife and fold out the can opener blade. The can opener blade has a long straight edge, a rounded tip, and the second long edge which is made up of a curved hook that protrudes into the center of the blade. [6] X Research source The can opener blade can also be used as a screwdriver! Some Swiss Army knife can openers can function as a bottle opener too. In this case, the can opener will have a slight indentation down the long edge. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Puncture the lip of the can with the tip of the can opener blade. Hold the can steady with your non-dominant hand. Then hold the tip of the can opener blade against the lip of the can and press down firmly. Puncture through the can with the blade to hook the attachment onto the can. Then gently rock the handle of the Swiss Army knife back and forth to cut along the can. [8] X Research source It’s important to hold the can steady while you work so that the contents don’t spill out. If your Swiss Army knife can opener is a bottle opener too, hold the Swiss Army knife at a right angle to the can and puncture through the lid by pushing the cutting edge down and then rocking it forward.

      "content": "Work your way clockwise around the can to cut through the lip. Continue the motion of puncturing the blade through the can and then rocking the handle back to forth to cut further along the can. Use your dominant hand to grip the handle of the Swiss Army knife at all times and to apply a lot of pressure as you puncture the can. [10] X Research source You can either continue opening the can until the top is fully separated or you can leave a tiny part of the can still attached. If you are using a Swiss Army knife can opener that is also a bottle opener, it's easiest to work anticlockwise around the can. [11] X Research source"

Simply place the can opener blade where the lid is still stuck to the can and puncture through the can with the blade. Then try to remove the lid again. [12] X Research source"

Insert the can opener blade underneath the separated lid and push the lid up gently. Use your fingers to carefully lift the lid out of the can. Be very careful not to touch the edges of the lid, as these are very sharp."
