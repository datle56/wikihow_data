      "content": "Validate your friend's feelings when they send you “as hell.” When your pal sends you a text with “ash” in it, they want you to know that they feel strongly about what they’re saying, whether it’s positive or negative. Take a moment to read through their text, then respond back empathetically. For example, if they’re excited about your upcoming trip together, message them back that you can’t wait to go, too. If they’re bored, sympathize with them and then make plans to hang out. Your friend : “I’m excited ash for our trip to Fiji! 😆 Next month can’t come soon enough.“ You : “Me too!! I’m literally counting down the days. 😝” Your friend : “There’s nothing to do at home. I’m bored ash 🥱” You : “I feel you 😴 Wanna come over and hang out?”"

      "content": "Thank your friend for apologizing if they’re ashamed of their behavior. If a friend sends you “ash” to let you know that they regret their actions and are sorry for hurting you, accept their apology . Tell them that you appreciate them texting you and explain why they upset you. Then, if you’re ready, text them that you want to move on and continue your friendship. [4] X Research source Your friend : “I’m feeling really ash that I upset you 😞 I’m so sorry and I promise I won’t hurt you ever again.” You : “Thank you for saying sorry. I was really hurt that you’d diss me like that in front of our friends. I know you were stressed out, so I'd like to move past this now.” Your friend : “I’m sorry that I lied to you about my plans yesterday 😔 I don’t know what came over me and I’m really ash about how I acted.” You : “I appreciate the apology and really needed to hear that. I was upset that you felt like you couldn’t tell me the truth. Moving forward, please be open and honest with me.” Before accepting an apology, reflect if you feel like it’s genuine and if you’re ready to accept it. If you’re still feeling hurt , let your friend know that you need time to process what they did. Or, text them that you want to talk it out in person."
