      "content": "Rinse 1 cup (185 g) of rice, then combine it with 2 cups (0.47 L) of water. Use any type of rice you have around the house—the most frequently used are white rice or long-grain brown rice. Rinse it thoroughly under cool water to remove dust, debris, and other impurities, then mix your rinsed rice and water in a large bowl or container. [2] X Research source Maintain about a 1:2 ratio of rice to water if you adjust the amounts to make a smaller or larger batch. Rinse the rice 2-3 times if you’re using non-organic rice, which might have trace amounts of pesticides on it.

      "content": "Set the bowl aside and let the rice soak for 30 minutes. Let your rice soak until the water takes on a milky, semi-opaque appearance. That milky appearance indicates that some of the rice's inositol has been released into the water. [4] X Research source Stir the rice water a couple of times while it soaks to loosen its nutrients. Use a spoon or fork to break up any clumps of rice. Inositol is a carbohydrate that gives rice water its milky appearance. Research suggests that inositol helps protect your locks and add shine. Alternatively, make a more concentrated rice water by adding 2 more cups (0.47 L) of water and boiling it for about 15 minutes. [5] X Research source"

If possible, look for a container with a lip or spout to help you control your pour while you apply it to your hair. [8] X Research source If you don’t plan on using all your rice water in one go, use a sealable container . Rice water lasts up to 5 days in the fridge.

Pour or squeeze the rice water from your container onto your hair, then thoroughly and gently massage it into your scalp and down the length of your strands. If your hair’s extra long, dip the ends in your container of rice water to make sure the tips are adequately hydrated. [11] X Research source Try using a wide-tooth comb to help evenly distribute the rice water through your hair. You do not necessarily need to be in the bath or shower to apply the rice water. In fact, many people soak their hair over a basin or sink. It’s up to you!"

Those with very fine or oily hair benefit most from a rice water treatment every 10 days, while those with thicker, coarser hair may need it every 5 days to see results. [14] X Research source Try not to use rice water daily, since the added protein from the rice can make your hair dry and brittle."
