This bypasses any locking mechanism, including the Control Lock. Once the machine is turned off for several seconds, press the Power button to turn the machine back on. [1] X Research source The Control Lock button freezes your control panel so none of your settings can be altered during the cycle. While this lock is effective when the washer is turned on, it turns off when the machine is powered off. If your machine doesn’t have a Cancel button, press and hold the Power button instead.

      "content": "Select a new cycle and start the load as normal. Wait several minutes for any remaining water to drain out of the machine before selecting your cycle settings again and restarting the load. Make sure that all of your clothing is in the washing drum before starting the new cycle or selecting Control Lock.

If you remember to add something before those 3 seconds are up, then the lock won’t activate."

      "content": "Open the door while the “Add Garment” light is on to access the washer. Check to see if the “Add Garment” LED is lit up on the control panel of your washing machine. If this light is still on, then your washer might not be locked at all. This feature gives you a few minutes at the beginning of the cycle to throw in a few extra items. It can save you some time in the long run, especially if you were going to cancel the load. [4] X Research source The “Add Garment” light will be on for about 8 minutes. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Push the Start/Stop button to unlock the washer door during the spin cycle. Pause the machine by quickly pressing the Start/Stop button once. After a few seconds, the washer will halt and you’ll hear the door unlocking. Add any extra garments into the washing drum at this time, if necessary. [6] X Research source Since a top-loading washer is upright, you don’t need to cancel and drain the current cycle to add in new clothing."

      "content": "Hit the Start/Stop button again to resume and finish the cycle. Throw in any extra linens or clothing that still need to be washed and close the washer lid.

      "title": "Open the lid during the agitation process to pause the cycle.",
      "content": "Open the lid during the agitation process to pause the cycle. Lift the washer during the early stages of the washing process to automatically pause the load. The clothing and other laundry will be agitated by the spinning drum before the spin cycle begins. It’s safe to open the washer at this point, and the machine will pause as soon as it senses the lid opening. [8] X Research source This occurs in the first few minutes of the wash cycle. An LED near the Start/Stop button will indicate once the door locks."

Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the single screw connecting this compartment to the washer. Be sure to keep the loose screw nearby once you’ve removed the cover. If your washer was in the middle of a cycle, wait until the water has cooled off to prevent any burns or injury."
