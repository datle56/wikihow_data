      "content": "Check the disabled message. If you see a message on your iPad that says it's disabled, it's because you've tried one too many times to unlock the screen without success. If it says to try again after a certain period of time (such as 1 minute or 15 minutes), don't panic—just try again after that time period. However, after 10 incorrect tries, your iPad will remain disabled until you restore it to factory settings. As long as you've backed up your iPad to iCloud or a computer, you should be able to restore it and easily get your settings and files back where they belong. If you didn't make a backup, those files and settings will be erased . Don't connect your iPad to the computer just yet —first you'll need to put it into recovery mode."
