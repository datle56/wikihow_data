      "content": "Items that have Mending will use experience to gain durability. When a player collects an experience orb, some of its points will go toward repairing the item instead of increasing the player’s experience bar. Here is some information about the mechanics of Mending: [1] X Research source One point of experience repairs two durability points. If the player has multiple Mending items equipped, one item will be selected randomly to get repaired. An item can’t have both the Mending and Infinity enchantment."

      "title": "Look in loot chests.",
      "content": "Look in loot chests. You can find items with the Mending enchantment in chests located in jungle temples, strongholds, and ancient cities. End and ancient cities have stronger loot and are more likely to have iron and diamond tools with Mending on them. [2] X Research source Mending is a “treasure enchantment.” This means it can’t be added to items using an enchanting table. [3] X Research source The Mending enchantment is great for making your equipment last longer. If you’re looking for and mining diamonds , you’ll need as much durability as you can get. It’s also great for conserving resources while playing multiplayer ."

      "content": "Go fishing. There’s a 0.8 percent chance of finding an enchanted book while fishing. It may take several attempts to find Mending, but if you fish enough, it will show up eventually! Make sure to meet the treasure fishing requirements: [4] X Research source The fishing bobber needs to be in open water. This means the area around the bobber is clear 2 blocks horizontally, 2 blocks above the water, and 2 blocks underwater. There can only be air and lily pads or water source blocks and bubble columns. There can also be blocks that don’t have collision, like kelp and coral fans."

      "content": "Trade with a librarian in a swamp. As of 1.20.2, swamp librarians will sell guaranteed Mending books. Other librarians will sell you a random enchanted book in exchange for a book and an amount of emeralds (this varies depending on trading factors like demand and reputation) and likely won't give you Mending right away. Swamp librarians will always have a Mending book. [5] X Research source Since villages do not naturally generate in swamps, you will have to find a zombie villager that spawned in a swamp, trap, and cure it. Then have it become a librarian by setting a lectern down in front of it. You can also build your own Minecraft village for a more personalized look. In older versions of Minecraft, librarians from any biome and village have a chance of trading Mending books. You can reroll trades by breaking and setting down the lectern again until the librarian's trade includes a Mending book."
