      "content": "Watch for tremors in your hands and/or fingers. One of the first complaints presented to doctors by many people later diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face. [3] X Research source JOHN D. GAZEWOOD, MD, MSPH,D. ROXANNE RICHARDS, MD,KARL CLEBAK, MD, Parkinson’s An Update, The American Family Physician, 2013 Feb 15;87(4):267-273 [4] X Research source Reuter, I., Engelhardt, M., Freiwaldt, J., &amp; Baas, H. (1999). Exercise test in Parkinson's disease. Clinical Autonomic Research, 9(3), 129-134. You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses. There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling\" movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor.

      "content": "Check for slowed or distorted movements. Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). [6] X Research source JOHN D. GAZEWOOD, MD, MSPH,D. ROXANNE RICHARDS, MD,KARL CLEBAK, MD, Parkinson’s An Update, The American Family Physician, 2013 Feb 15;87(4):267-273 This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous. These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time."

      "content": "Look out for a shuffling gait. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \"festinating gait,\" and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. [7] X Research source JOHN D. GAZEWOOD, MD, MSPH,D. ROXANNE RICHARDS, MD,KARL CLEBAK, MD, Parkinson’s An Update, The American Family Physician, 2013 Feb 15;87(4):267-273 This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease."

      "title": "Examine your posture.",
      "content": "Examine your posture. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down. [8] X Research source JOHN D. GAZEWOOD, MD, MSPH,D. ROXANNE RICHARDS, MD,KARL CLEBAK, MD, Parkinson’s An Update, The American Family Physician, 2013 Feb 15;87(4):267-273 Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor."

While symptoms alone cannot provide an accurate diagnosis, you can test for the symptoms elsewhere in this article in order to provide your doctor a complete case of your symptoms. The first thing your doctor would do if you came in asking about PD is perform a physical exam, and you can look for some of the same signs they would look for. Rest your hand in your lap and look for tremor. Unlike most other forms of tremor, the tremor associated with Parkinson's is worse when you are at rest. Note your posture. Most people with Parkinson's usually stand slightly bent forward, with the head down and the elbows flexed."

[13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Note that Parkinson’s Disease is not difficult to diagnose, except in the very early stages. There is no single test your doctor will perform. Instead, your doctor may run other tests to eliminate other conditions that lead to similar symptoms as Parkinson’s (such as stroke, hydrocephalus, or benign essential tremor). The condition that most often mimics PD is essential tremor, which often runs in families and is most marked with the hands outstretched. Your doctor may also refer you to a neurologist, which is a doctor who specializes in conditions of the nervous system."

Do you show signs of a tremor with your arms at rest? Do you exhibit rigidity in your neck or limbs? How easily can you stand up from a sitting position? Do you have a normal gait, and do your arms swing symmetrically as you walk? When given a small push, are you quickly able to resume your balance?"

[14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source However, in some cases your doctor may recommend one of these tests to help them distinguish between Parkinson's and diseases that present similar symptoms. Due to the expense of such scans, the invasive nature of the procedures, and the plain lack of availability of the machines, it is unlikely that your doctor will recommend these scans as a diagnostic tool in most cases. An MRI may help your physician distinguish between PD and conditions that display similar symptoms, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multi-system atrophy."

      "title": "Measure your response to treatment.",
      "content": "Measure your response to treatment. Treatment involves increasing the effect of dopamine (the neurotransmitter affected by PD) in the brain. Treatment may consist of administering levodopa, the most commonly prescribed and most effective drug for PD, on its own (usually as a levodopa/carbidopa combination). In some cases, your doctor may also prescribe a dopamine agonist, such as pramipexole, that stimulates the dopamine receptors. [15] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If your symptoms are advanced enough to warrant use of medication, then your doctor may prescribe it to see if it curbs any of the symptoms you experience. Diseases that mimic PD tend to respond to treatment less well than PD does. A good response to medication makes PD more likely."

The procedure involves implanting electrodes into the targeted region of the brain, which are then connected to an impulse generator inserted beneath the collarbone. The patient is then given a controller to turn the device on or off at necessary times. [19] X Research source The effects of DBS are often dramatic and doctors may recommend this route for those who experience disabling tremors, those with adverse side effects to medication, or if medications begin losing their efficacy."
