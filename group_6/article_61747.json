      "title": "Nectar collectors are straw-like dab pens.",
      "content": "Nectar collectors are straw-like dab pens. Dab pens are a tool for consuming concentrated cannabis oil, or dabs. Nectar collectors are similar, but streamline the dabbing process without any excess concentrate left over. They consist of a glass or silicone neck and body, with a titanium, quartz, or ceramic tip. [1] X Research source Nectar collectors come in electronic and manual styles. Electronic collectors heat all by themselves, while manual collectors must be heated with a butane torch. Dab rigs consume concentrate by placing it on a heated coil element, or dab nail, while collectors consume it by touching a hot tip directly to the concentrate. Silicone collectors are often the most affordable style."

      "title": "Assemble the mouthpiece, neck, body, and tip of the collector.",
      "content": "Assemble the mouthpiece, neck, body, and tip of the collector. Each collector is different, so consult your collector’s user manual for how your particular model fits together. Optionally, fill the body of the collector about ⅓ full of cool water before you assemble it for a smoother smoking experience. [2] X Research source Make sure the water covers the percolator holes within the body of the collector when it’s held upright."

      "title": "Place your cannabis concentrate on a clean, flat surface.",
      "content": "Place your cannabis concentrate on a clean, flat surface. Most nectar collector users keep their concentrate in a dab container with a lid for quick and easy access. [3] X Research source Storing your concentrate like this allows you to use only as much as you want, then save for the rest for later dabs. Use your collector with any kind of concentrate, like wax, oils, rosin, or hash concentrate."

    {
      "title": "Heat the tip of the collector with a butane torch for 30-60 seconds.",
      "content": "Heat the tip of the collector with a butane torch for 30-60 seconds. Hold the collector by the neck or body, and keep it about 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) from the hottest, most visible part of the butane torch flame. Spin the collector in your fingers to more evenly heat the tip. [4] X Research source Start by heating the very end of the tip, and work down to about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the tip. If you have an electronic collector, press the “heat” button until the tip is hot. Consult the user manual for more specific instructions, since different models require different operation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Touch the tip of the collector to the concentrate and inhale.",
      "content": "Touch the tip of the collector to the concentrate and inhale. After letting it cool for 15-20 seconds, position the tip of the collector so that it just touches the concentrate, then inhale through the mouthpiece to consume the dab. [5] X Research source Start with a few short inhales, wait several minutes, then reheat your collector and go back in for more if you like. Remember, as with any new marijuana experience, start low and go slow. Better to have a mild high and find your tolerance than to accidentally green out . Also remember that the tip of the collector is hot, so when you’re finished, place it on a heat-proof, flat surface."

    {
      "title": "Clean out any excess concentrate with a cotton swab.",
      "content": "Clean out any excess concentrate with a cotton swab. Use a dampened cotton swab to wipe any residue from the mouthpiece and the tip of the collector. [6] X Research source Make sure it’s completely cooled before you handle it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Soak the collector parts in isopropyl alcohol and water.",
      "content": "Soak the collector parts in isopropyl alcohol and water. [7] X Research source Disassemble the collector and place the parts in a plastic bag or a food-safe container. Fill the container and submerge the parts in a 2:1 mixture of warm water and isopropyl alcohol. Let the collector soak for at least 30 minutes, or even overnight, to loosen any residue. Don’t use alcohol on silicone collectors, as it may damage the material. Instead, add 2-3 tbsp (34-51 g) of salt to the warm water. Don’t soak any electronic components if you use an electronic collector. These often don’t need to be cleaned, but may be wiped down with a slightly damp cotton swab."

    {
      "title": "Shake and rinse the collector and let it air dry.",
      "content": "Shake and rinse the collector and let it air dry. Gently shift the collector pieces around in the cleaning solution to loosen any remaining residue. Then, remove the pieces and run them under warm water. Place them on a paper towel or rag to air dry for an hour or two before you use them again. Wash your collector about once a week during regular use, or any time you notice residue buildup in any of the parts."

      "title": "Nectar collectors are portable and help preserve concentrate.",
      "content": "Nectar collectors are portable and help preserve concentrate. Since nectar collectors can be disassembled, they’re easy to transport. And since they only consume the concentrate that the hot tip touches, they cut down on wasted dabs. [8] X Research source Glass and silicone collectors are also often more affordable than more complex dab rigs, and are a bit easier to use and clean."

    {
      "title": "Nectar collectors are still a bit harder to use than other pipes.",
      "content": "Nectar collectors are still a bit harder to use than other pipes. Nectar collectors require a butane torch to heat, and so they’re not quite as accessible as traditional pipes, or even just rolled joints. [9] X Research source Nectar collectors also have less temperature control than dab rigs, and may take some practice to get the perfect dab with. Nectar collectors are also often a bit bulkier than more traditional pipes or dab rigs."
