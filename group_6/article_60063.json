      "content": "Check the tag on your shirt. Certain types of fabric will shrink with heat, while others will not. For example, cotton and wool will shrink when you wash them with hot water. [1] X Research source Your shirt might also have some specific instructions on the label about how to wash it to avoid shrinking. For example, the tag might specify a water temperature, such as warm or cool. By washing the garment in the opposite temperature, you may be able to shrink the garment."

      "content": "Fill a sink with hot water. [2] X Research source If the garment is cotton or wool, then you can shrink it by soaking it in a sink full of hot water. Allow the shirt to soak in the water for about five minutes and then remove it and wring it out. However, keep in mind that if the shirt is any color other than white, then soaking it in hot water may pull out some of the color. [3] X Research source The hotter the water, the more the shirt will shrink, so use the temperature that seems appropriate to you. To get the water even hotter, boil a pot of water and pour it into the sink. If you want to wash the shirt as well as shrinking it, place a teaspoonful of laundry detergent in the sink. However, you will need to rinse the shirt in a separate tub or sink full of water after. If you are worried about affecting the color of the shirt, then you can also try soaking the shirt in cool or lukewarm water and then hang it up in a warm place to dry, such as near a heater."

If you don't have a drying rack, lay the shirt flat on top of a dry, absorbent towel. Don't hang the shirt to dry. This will cause the shirt to stretch in the shoulder area. When the first side of the shirt is dry, flip it over and let the second side finish drying. Try placing the shirt in a warm place to help it dry faster and shrink up a bit more.

If soaking and air drying the shirt did not shrink it enough for your needs, then you can also try washing the shirt in a washing machine on hot. To do this, select the \"whites\" setting so that the washer uses hot water to rinse the shirt. If you're concerned about fading the color of your shirt, then you can add a cup of vinegar to the machine to preserve the color. The process of agitating the shirt may also help to shrink the shirt, so if you're concerned about adding heat to your shirt, you can use the \"permanent press\" setting or cold water instead of hot water."

Use the \"gentle dry\" setting if you're concerned about how the fabric will hold up. Use the \"permanent press\" or \"regular dry\" setting if you want to dry the shirt as fast as possible."

If the shirt was stretched out before, it should now be refreshed and ready to wear. If you want it to shrink more, repeat the process and use a higher heat setting on your dryer. Place a fabric softener sheet in the dryer with your shirt to freshen up the smell, too."

If you have a dry clean only shirt that you want to shrink to a smaller size, then ask the dry cleaner if that is something they can do. Keep in mind that water is necessary to shrink a garment, so dry cleaning will not usually shrink your clothes unless the machine is leaking. However, your dry cleaners might offer a safe method for shrinking items without affecting the color and integrity of your garment."
