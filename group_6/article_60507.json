Remove all the groceries from your refrigerator and freezer and place them someplace cool, like an ice-filled cooler or a secondary fridge.

[2] X Research source It may help to remove ice chunks by hand as they start to melt and dislodge. If you’d like to chip away at any existing frost, use an ice scraper. Modern-day refrigerators are designed so that you shouldn’t have to defrost them. However, older appliances may need to be defrosted periodically.

Adjust the dials inside your appliance so that each section stays consistently at these temperatures. This way, your food can be stored safely without encouraging any excess ice buildup in your refrigerator. Avoid setting your fridge to any colder settings as you might encourage frost.

Saturate a cleaning cloth or sponge with hot, sudsy water, holding the damp cloth directly on top of any ice buildup or frost. Press down on it gently to warm up the ice below. If the cloth starts to get cold, soak it in some more hot water and reapply it to the frost. Continue this process until the frost melts away completely. [5] X Research source Use a paper towel or a dry cleaning cloth to soak up any moisture before you close your fridge. Avoid using a sharp object to chip away at the frozen buildup; you may risk damaging the inside of your refrigerator.

      "title": "Limit how often you open the fridge and freezer doors.",
      "content": "Limit how often you open the fridge and freezer doors. Opening the door frequently increases the humidity levels inside your fridge and freezer,which can lead to ice buildup and frost. With this in mind, try not to leave your fridge or freezer doors open when you’re deciding what to eat or trying to figure out which ingredients to pull out. Instead, make a quick mental list of what you’ll need so you can take all of those things out at one time. [7] X Research source Only open 1 door at a time. Try to be as quick as possible and close the doors in under 1 minute. For instance, if you’re going to be baking, take out the eggs, butter, and milk at one time. This way, you only have to open the door once. If you have a hard time remembering what you stock in your fridge, keep a list of what’s inside posted on the refrigerator door."

      "content": "Raise the front legs so that your refrigerator doors close automatically. Ask another person to help you pull the fridge out about 1 ft (0.30 m) from the wall. Have your partner tilt the top of the fridge backward, toward the wall, to expose the front 2 feet. While they hold it in this position, twist the legs counterclockwise. Unscrew the legs slightly to make them a little taller. This way, gravity will encourage the doors to shut. When you’re done, return the fridge back to its original spot. [8] X Research source Once you’ve tweaked the legs, open the doors and see if gravity help them close naturally. If not, repeat this process to lift the front legs even higher. If your fridge or freezer door are prone to sitting open, or if they swing wide open while you’re moving food in and out, this easily can raise the humidity levels inside your appliance, causing ice to build up."

      "content": "Tighten the door hinges if they’re loose. If you notice that the door or the screws on the hinges are wobbly, use a screwdriver to tighten the screws by turning them clockwise. Keep tightening them until they don’t spin around anymore. [9] X Research source Depending on the type of fridge you have, you may have to lift off a plastic cover to expose the hinges. Loose hinges on your fridge or freezer doors will result in an incomplete seal; this will increase the humidity inside your appliance, which may result in ice buildup."

      "content": "Wipe down the seals around the inside of each door to remove any residue. If the seals lining your fridge or freezer doors are caked with food residue or ice crystals, they won’t close properly. Working on 1 door at a time, use a damp cleaning cloth and mild dish soap to quickly scrub the inside of the seal. Clean off the frame of the fridge opening, as well, to ensure that the seal can sit flush against it. Use a dry towel to wipe off any remaining moisture and then shut the door. [10] X Research source Make sure you don’t leave any moisture behind, as it might form an ice crystal."

Look at the flexible rubber seal on the inside of your fridge and freezer doors—these are called refrigerator gaskets. If either one appears to be damaged, replace it to ensure that your appliance’s doors close completely. Contact your fridge manufacturer to order a replacement gasket. Once you have it, unplug your appliance and move all of the perishable items to coolers. Unscrew the damaged gasket and then screw the new one into place. [12] X Research source Make sure you know your appliance’s model number, as you’ll need this in order to get the right replacement part. Test out the seal of your new gasket before you turn the fridge back on and start loading it up. It should sit flush against the frame of the fridge or freezer opening without any gaps."

A straight section of coat hanger or pipe cleaner may also help clear away the blockage. If you still aren’t able to clear away the clog, you may need to drag out your unplugged fridge to inspect and clean your fridge’s check valve (a rubber valve connected to the drain hose) by hand.

While your fridge or freezer is running, place your hand inside to locate the cold air source—this is usually along the back wall of the appliance. If this area is blocked by a dense arrangement of food items, move these out of the way. Leave some open space around the cooling mechanism so that the air can flow around. [15] X Research source Don’t block any of the vents with bulky freezer boxes or bags. Keep these items further away from the sides and walls of your appliance."

Store items in the designated drawers and spots, with fruits in the crisping drawers, meat in the meat drawers, butter in the butter tray, and condiments in the narrow shelves inside the door. Use fridge organizers and bins to keep your appliance organized and clutter-free. [16] X Research source Take a few minutes each week to check your fridge for old or expired items. Toss these out as soon as they go bad to make space for fresh foods. An overstuffed appliance will restrict the airflow and may trap cold air in certain pockets, which could result in frosty patches."

Turn off your fridge and stash the perishable items in coolers. Pull out your appliance far enough from the wall so that you can easily access the back. Use a soft bristle brush attachment to vacuum the dust and debris off of the coils. Then, return your fridge to its usual spot. [23] X Research source Move the vacuum attachment in the direction of the coils so you don’t dent them. Clean the coils more frequently if you have pets whose hair might end up behind your refrigerator. Depending on the fridge model you have, the condenser coils may be located below or on top of the appliance. Check the user manual to see how you can access these coils."
