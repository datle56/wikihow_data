A virus or malware could have been used to hack your computer and use it for DoS attacks, which can result in your address being blocked by a website or service. If you skip fixing a malware issue or don't run a system scan, you're running the risk of immediately being blocked again. If you're using Windows 10, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security to run a scan. If you're using a Mac, restart your Mac in Safe Mode (hold the Shift key while it's booting up), locate the malicious application (usually in the Applications folder in Finder), drag the application icon to the trash, and right-click on and empty the trash can."

Keep in mind that a lot of sites and services block the IP addresses of public proxy servers. To find a free proxy, search the internet for \"free web proxy.\" When you find a service, you can navigate to the website by entering the site's URL into the proxy website. Avoid entering any personal information when browsing with a public proxy server. It's best to use these services just for checking out websites."
