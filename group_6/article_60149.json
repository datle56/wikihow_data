Here are a couple of options that you can try before hitting the hay: [7] X Research source https://www.newportortho.com/images/system/blog/safman-blog[1].jpg Lumbar side-bend pushup: Roll out a yoga mat or towel and sprawl out on your side, propping yourself with your forearm. Tuck your knees back at around 45 degrees and rest your free hand on your upper hip. Then, anchor your knee and lower leg before lifting your hip off the ground and lowering it back down. Repeat this exercise for about 1 minute, doing a single rep every 4 seconds. Take a breather for a minute, and then do the same stretch on your opposite side. Bent knee raise: Find a comfortable spot where you can lie flat on your back with both knees bent. Tighten your belly and pretend that you’re pulling your belly button beneath your ribs. While keeping your abs tight, raise 1 leg up in the air, keeping your knee bent at a 90-degree angle. Then, bend your other leg at the same angle and lift it up. Stay in this position for up to 10 seconds before bringing your legs down separately. Feel free to do up to five 1-minute sets, spacing out each rep by 4 seconds."

[8] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Feel free to apply ice throughout the day, too! Experts suggest icing your SI joint up to 2-3 times each day. Bags of frozen veggies can work in a pinch if you don’t have any ice packs on hand.

Repeat this technique at least 3 times. 4-7-8 breathing: Place one hand on your chest and another on top of your belly. Breathe in slowly for 4 seconds, and then hold it for 7 seconds.
