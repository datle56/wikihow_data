      "content": "Decide what types of pets you will sit and where to provide the services. The majority of pet sitting businesses focus on dogs and cats, and this is where the majority of your revenue will come from. Decide if you will pet sit out of your home, at the homes of your clients, or both. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that as a pet sitter you will have irregular hours that include nights and weekends. Consider if you will offer to stay at the homes of clients, or just visit at scheduled hours to take care of their pets. Your clients may also want other basic services, such as bringing in the mail and watering plants at their homes while they are out of town. You must really love and care about animals if you want to be a successful pet sitter. It is not a business to start just for the money. You will be responsible for taking care of animals that some people consider as their children, so treat the responsibility with care!"
