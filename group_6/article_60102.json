Thinning here will be gradual and look like a stereotypical “bald spot.” [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is the most common type of hair loss (for men and women) and typically affects people more severely as they age. Depending on the cause of the hair loss and other factors (like genetics or a specific health condition), you may see thinning across your whole head all at once rather than just at the crown or temples. This is more common in women than men, though."

However, if you’re noticing large clumps come out when you’re combing your hair or showering, or waking up with excessive strands of hair on your pillow in the morning, you may be experiencing accelerated hair loss.

      "title": "The most common cause of early balding is male pattern baldness.",
      "content": "The most common cause of early balding is male pattern baldness. Male pattern baldness, or androgenic alopecia, is very common and can affect anyone assigned male at birth (AMAB). About two-thirds of men will have male pattern baldness and experience some degree of hair loss in their life, with increased loss as they age. The early stages of balding typically begin in your 30s, but it can start as early as your late teens. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The exact cause of androgenic alopecia is believed to be related to increasing levels of the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as you age. Genetics also play a role. If your maternal grandfather (your mother’s father) has male pattern baldness, you’ll likely develop it as well. If your father is bald, your chances of getting male pattern baldness are twice as high. Other types of alopecia that may be to blame include alopecia areata (small balding circles) and cicatricial alopecia (scarring and permanent damage to your hair follicles)."

      "content": "Other underlying conditions or genetics can cause early balding, too. While androgenic alopecia is responsible for most hair loss in your 20s, there are a variety of other family, environmental, and medical conditions that may be to blame, too. These conditions include things like: [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your family genetics and age: If you have relatives with thinning or balding hair, you’re more likely to experience hair loss as well (especially as you grow older). Certain medications or supplements: Hair loss may be a side effect of certain drugs, particularly those used to treat cancer, arthritis, depression, heart disease, gout, and/or high blood pressure. Radiation therapy: Radiation, like that used to target cancerous tumors, can cause balding if it's focused on or near the head. Hormonal changes: Thyroid conditions may be to blame if there’s no apparent underlying cause for the hair loss. Other hormone-altering events like pregnancy, childbirth, or menopause may also be the culprit for female balding. Infection: An infection of or on your scalp (like tinea capitis, a fungal infection) can cause hair loss and potentially scarring, which prevents the regrowth of hair once the infection clears up. Nutritional deficiencies: Rapid weight loss or a deficiency in protein, iron, or certain vitamins may cause hair loss (although having a true deficiency is rare). Stress: Chronic stress may cause gradual hair loss, while acute stress or trauma may lead to hair loss several months after the initial physical or emotional shock. This type of hair loss is usually reversible and known medically as telogen effluvium. Damaging hairstyles: Excessive styling or styles that pull your hair very tight may lead to a type of hair loss called traction alopecia. Using excessive hot oils or styling instruments can also damage your hair and cause it to fall out."
