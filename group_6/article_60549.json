You might have a simple flat iron with only high and low settings, or a space-age iron with a digital display for temperature. Temperature variable flat irons, where you can more precisely adjust the temperature, are an investment you will not regret, as these allow you to apply the right heat setting to your hair with greater accuracy, yielding better results. [1] X Research source Flat irons come in different sizes for different purposes: ½\" Flat Iron : pixie cuts and bangs 1\" Flat Iron : short and fine hair 1¼ Flat Iron : shoulder length and/or medium thick hair 1½\" Flat Iron : thick, coarse, curly hair shoulder length or longer 2\" Flat Iron : very long, very thick hair [2] X Research source"

Use a gentle shampoo while bathing to clean your hair, and consider using a conditioner intended for smoothing and detangling to make your hair more manageable.

Generally, you should apply your straightener and heat protectant before you use any heat tools on your hair, but after it has been towel dried damp. Be sure you get all parts of your hair, including the roots, by massaging your product into your scalp. For most straightening products, a dime-sized amount should be sufficient for your hair.

      "content": "Dry your hair completely. Avoid using a flat iron on damp hair as this can cause water locked inside to boil, leading to hair damage. To prevent your hair from harm, you should blow dry or air dry your hair until it is completely dry. [5] X Research source Use the cool setting of your blow dryer intermittently to prevent overheating your hair and damaging it while drying. Keep your blow dryer angled downwards while drying your hair to limit frizzing. [6] X Research source Try to get your hair as straight as possible with the blow dryer so you don't have to apply as much heat to it with the straightener. If your hair is particularly thick or coarse, separate it into sections so it's easier to dry."

You should aim for a straightening temperature of 365°F (185°C) to gain the most styling benefits while minimizing potential heat damage. [7] X Research source If your hair is thin and fine, set your flat iron temperature closer to 300 °F (149 °C). If your hair is thick and coarse, you may need to set your flat iron temperature closer to 400 °F (204 °C). As long as your hair is of average thickness, even simple \"high-low\" model flat irons should work for your hair. Set the iron to \"high\" and work quickly to prevent fry. [8] X Research source"

Your goal should be regular sections that are easy to work with. For most people, three sections should be enough, but if you have thicker hair, you will likely need more sections. [9] X Research source Divide your hair horizontally along the back of your head from ear to ear. Further separate your hair by parting your hair vertically at the middle of your horizontal part. Gather all hair above the horizontal line out of the way and to the top of your head. Divide your hair into .5–1 inch (1.3–2.5 cm) sections if it's particularly thick. [10] X Research source"

Use a mirror when you believe you are finished to check that your hair has been completely straightened."
