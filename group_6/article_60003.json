      "content": "Set out 5 six-sided dice for the players. You need at least 2 players for a game of Ship Captain Crew, but it’s the most fun with more people. Use the same set of dice for all the players, or give each person their own. When you roll the dice, a 6 is known as the Ship , a 5 is the Captain , and the 4 is the Crew . The other 2 dice become the Cargo and their total count as points when the round is over."

      "content": "Roll the 5 dice up to 3 times trying to get a Ship, Captain, and Crew. When you roll a Ship (6), Captain (5), or Crew (4), they get set aside. However, you must take them in order, so you must roll a Ship before a Captain, and a Captain before a Crew. If you don’t get Ship, Captain, or Crew on your first roll, then roll the remaining dice to try again. You may roll the dice a total of 3 times. For example, if you rolled a 5 or 4 but didn’t get a 6, then you can’t keep any of the dice. If you aren’t able to get Ship, Captain, and Crew within your 3 rolls, then your turn is over and you automatically score 0 points for the round."

If you’re able to set aside a Ship, Captain, and Crew within 1 or 2 rolls, then you can choose to stop with the Cargo you have or use your rerolls for a chance at a higher score. If you choose to risk it, roll both dice and keep the result, even if it’s lower. [2] X Research source The lowest number you can roll is 2, and the highest you can roll is 12. If you have 5 or lower on your Cargo dice, there are good odds that you’ll get a higher number if you reroll."
