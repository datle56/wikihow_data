      "content": "Eating cold foods can irritate the nerves in your digestive tract. When you eat cold foods like ice cream, it may activate your vagus nerve, which is responsible for regulating your digestion, heart rate, and respiratory system. By cooling down this nerve, you could trigger certain defensive responses in your body, such as coughing or sneezing.

Also known as chronic acid reflux, this condition occurs when stomach acid keeps flowing back into the tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus). This backwash can upset your esophagus lining and cause an irritating cough, especially if you lie down right after eating ice cream.

      "content": "You might have asthma. Although various allergens can trigger this chronic condition, eating ice cream may cause asthma symptoms like coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. This can happen if your airways become narrowed and inflamed, due to the sharp contrast in temperature between your body and the ice cream, or because of a food allergy. [6] X Research source Food allergies are less likely to prompt coughing than temperature changes, but some people have found that sulfite, a preservative found in most processed foods (including ice cream), can trigger their asthma symptoms.

[8] X Research source A respiratory tract infection is usually caused by viruses or bacteria, and it affects the parts of your body responsible for breathing, such as your sinuses, throat, airways, and lungs. If you have an infection, it can cause coughing or other discomfort after eating food, whether it’s cold, hot, or room temperature.

[12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source However, it might also mean the ice cream is cooling your trachea and thickening the mucus in your throat. This thickened mucus can make it increasingly difficult to clear the airway, so you might cough more to relieve the blocked, stuffy feeling in your throat. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re coughing up clear mucus, it usually means your body is trying to flush out an allergen, like pollen or dust. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re coughing up yellow or green mucus, your body is probably fighting off some type of infection, such as sinusitis or bronchitis. If you’re coughing up white mucus, it might mean you have GERD, COPD, viral bronchitis, or congestive heart failure (if you develop other symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, or leg weakness, call your doctor ASAP). Red, pink, or bloody mucus indicates a more serious condition, so contact your doctor immediately or head to your nearest emergency room."

Or, you can make your own dairy-free chocolate ice cream . If you suspect you have a dairy allergy, pay attention to your body’s response after consuming milk, cheese, or yogurt.
