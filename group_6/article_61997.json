Slide your arms through your bra, and, holding your bra’s clasps with both hands, pull the bra to your chest so that the cups catch your breasts. Guide the clasps under your shoulders so that they meet on your back. Finally, clasp the band together. [2] X Research source Make sure to hook every clasp. If your bra has 3 clasps, for example, hook all 3. By leaning forward first, you allow your breasts to perfectly fit into your bra’s cups."

      "content": "Have a professional fitting done. Bra sizing can be confusing, and while you can measure your own bra size , your best bet is to go to a lingerie specialist who can help you identify your perfect fit. They can help you find a bra that’s not only the right size, but also the right shape and style for your needs. Cup sizes vary depending on band sizing, which can make finding a bra that fits difficult. For example, the cups on a 34B are actually the same size as those on a 32C, but the 32C has a shorter band. If you’d rather not do a professional fitting, consult a bra sizing chart . Figure out your cup size by subtracting your bust measurement from your band size. For example, if the difference is about 3 inches (7.6 cm), that probably means you need a C-cup in your band size. If you know your measurements, you can also fill out online questionnaires to help you find your perfect fit. Do a search using terms like “bra fit questionnaire” or “find my bra fit” to get started."

      "content": "Buy a bra that suits your breast shape. In addition to being different sizes, breasts also come in a wide variety of shapes. To get a truly comfortable bra, it’s a good idea to take the shape of your breasts into account. Examine your breasts and determine if they are: East-west, or outward-facing: T-shirt bras and partial underwires work best with this breast shape. Widely separated: If your breasts are relatively full but there’s a lot of space between them, try a plunge bra . Bell-shaped: If your breasts are narrower on the top and rounder at the bottom, a full-coverage bra is a good bet. Globe-shaped: Thin, light-coverage bras work well with this breast type. Long and narrow: Opt for a plunge bra, which can help lift and center your breasts. Asymmetrical: Try a bra with removable inserts to create a more even appearance. Teardrop: These are similar to the bell shape, but not as narrow at the top. They also work well with balconette bras and pushup bras . Get a bra with close-set straps if you have narrow shoulders. Try a bra in a plunge or racerback style with straps that rest relatively far in on your shoulders."

Make sure your band is snug, but not so tight that it feels hard to breathe or the underwire digs into your breasts. Look for a band that you can slip 1 finger under with only about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of additional stretch.
