      "content": "Set the washing machine to hot. Most fabrics react to heat by shrinking, so use the hottest setting available for your cotton or wool socks. If you have other laundry that can be washed on a hot setting, add it into the load, too. [1] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Green Cleaning Expert Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. If you’d like to shrink socks made from polyester or another synthetic material, use a cool wash setting instead. Synthetic fibers react differently to heat, so treating them like you would cotton won’t have the same effect!"

      "content": "Wash the socks on the longest setting possible. This will make sure the socks have enough time to react to the heat and shrink. To make sure you’re getting the best result, you can check on the socks mid-way through the wash. For wool socks, use a slightly shorter wash cycle to prevent over-shrinking.

For old, worn out socks or pre-shrunk socks, boiling them in water may give you the extra heat you need to shrink them.
