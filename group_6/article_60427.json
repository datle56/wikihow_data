      "content": "Stick to low-alcohol drinks. Anything with a low alcohol-by-volume (ABV) prevents overdrinking. While you should still limit your drinking to the recommended daily maximum—2 drinks or less for men and 1 drink or less for women—ordering low-alcoholic drinks will help control your blood alcohol level (BAC). Grab a low ABV option like a beer that contains just 1.15% alcohol so you can enjoy the experience of drinking without getting too much alcohol in your system. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Alternate alcoholic drinks with soda or water. Use non-alcoholic beverages as “drink spacers” between alcoholic ones. Whenever you're thirsty or just want a drink as a fun distraction, reach for something like a root beer or non-alcoholic spritzer. Avoid drinking more than 5 drinks in 2 hours if you're a man or more than 4 drinks in 2 hours if you're a woman by trying out this swap. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Skip mixed drinks.",
      "content": "Skip mixed drinks. Avoid mixed drinks—it’s hard to figure out how much alcohol they have. Just one mixed drink, even if it looks small, can contain a lot more alcohol than 1 standard drink, like a bottle of beer. Also steer clear of mixed drinks because they usually have a high percentage of pure alcohol, like vodka, which can get you inebriated a lot quicker and encourage you to binge drink.

      "title": "Eat a meal before you go out.",
      "content": "Eat a meal before you go out. Have some food first so alcohol enters your bloodstream more slowly. Avoid any amount of drinking on an empty stomach—the alcohol will go right through your bloodstream, which will make you feel intoxicated right away. Instead, make sure to have plenty of carbs—like bread, rice, or pasta—3 hours before you drink so your body can gradually break down alcohol in your system. That way, you're less likely to feel nauseous or experience a hangover. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Bring only enough money for 1-2 drinks. Make sure you don’t even have the cash for excessive drinking. Calculate the rough cost of a couple of drinks. For example, maybe you estimate that 2 cocktails cost 20 USD. If the bar or restaurant you’re going to has its menu online, check it out. You might find out that 2 glasses of wine add up to 30 USD. When you create a strict budget for yourself, it’ll be easier to consume a lot less alcohol."

      "content": "Sip on anything you order. Pace yourself and savor your drink so you don’t feel like you need more. As a really healthy goal that will keep you from drinking a lot more than you expected, aim to have just 1 drink. Order a drink you know you'll really enjoy instead of just one that will get you \"buzzed.\" Try to have lots of conversations before you've even finished your beverage. If you're able to have a great experience with just 1 tasty beverage, congratulate yourself for making the most of it! [5] X Research source"

Instead, focus on some fun challenges that require skill, reflexes, and a clear mind. For example, go for pool, darts, karaoke, or arcade games. You'll be able to bond with your friends without even thinking about alcohol. [6] X Research source"

If you feel like your whole social life revolves around alcohol or the \"bar scene,\" then step outside your comfort zone. Visit new spaces that offer different activities—you might try out something bold like archery or chill like hiking. Also embrace some solo time at home. For example, do yoga or meditate to get to a state of balance. Any sober option you choose will be a great investment in your health and a good way to pass the time. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid hanging out with people who drink a lot. If you're friends with a certain crowd that binge drink and see it as \"normal,\" skip their parties and nights out. Look out for anyone who denies that excessive consumption of alcohol has any consequences. Also watch for patterns—do you have any contacts who drink heavily and then avoid their responsibilities? If that's the case, it's best to spend more time with people who are positive influences instead.

      "content": "Reflect on why you binge drink. Identify emotional triggers to find out what tempts you to binge drink. Before, after, or during the times you drink, try to pinpoint why you had more than just a couple drinks. Acknowledge the feelings you experienced—were you anxious, sad, or angry? Describe situations that stirred up these states of mind. When you’re clear about what sets off binge drinking, you can find ways other than alcohol to handle those emotions. [9] X Research source Trigger : “I feel socially anxious when I’m around people I don’t know, so I have 3-5 drinks to loosen up.” Trigger : “I feel sad because of my breakup, so I down cocktails at parties to drown out my feelings.” Trigger : \"I feel angry when my family belittles me at reunions, so I drink a lot of wine to block out their comments.\" Trigger : \"I feel pressured to be exciting when my friends hang out at the bar, so I drink as much as they do to look cool.\""

Be aware that binge drinking is defined as having 5 or more drinks in 2 hours if you’re a male and 4 or more drinks in 2 hours if you’re a female. Whenever you drink, whether alone or out with others, write down an entry in your “drink journal.” At the end of the week, tally up all the drinks you’ve had so you get the full picture of your habits.

When you're sober and have had time to reflect on why you're worried about your binge drinking, reach out to your friends and family.

      "content": "Alcoholism is a disorder; \"binge drinking\" refers to how much you drink. Because it impacts your daily life, alcoholism is classified as a disorder. If your everyday work, home, and interpersonal routines are negatively affected by drinking, then you'd likely be diagnosed with alcoholism. However, if you mostly avoid drinking throughout your week but have an excessive amount of alcohol in a short amount of time, you are binge drinking. [14] X Research source For example, you might go 3 months without drinking at all, but then have 4 beers in 1 hour at a friend's birthday party. That incident would be considered \"binge drinking.\" Reader Poll: We asked 309 wikiHow readers how they approached setting boundaries with an alcoholic parent, and 60% of them said that they limited the parent’s involvement in their life.
