Understand the cat’s body language so you know when they’re threatened and need space. According to Molly DeVoss, certified cat behavior consultant, scared cats usually “hold their body close to the ground…The ears might be out to the side or flattened. The whiskers will be held back against the face and they may be growling, yowling, or hissing.”"
