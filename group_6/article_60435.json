      "title": "Contain your evil biome before entering Hardmode by digging tunnels.",
      "content": "Contain your evil biome before entering Hardmode by digging tunnels. Dig a tunnel three to six blocks wide around the entirety of the evil biome to contain it. By digging a tunnel this wide, you will block the corrupted blocks from spreading past it. You should do this before defeating the Wall of Flesh boss. [1] X Research source To ensure vines and thorns don't spread corruption past your tunnel, encase your tunnels in stone. While this is a vital step to keeping your corrupted biome contained, it can take quite a bit of time. You can speed it up by using Mining Potions, Slices of Cake, the Ancient Chisel, and the Deathbringer, Nightmare Pickaxe, or Molten Pickaxe to increase your mining speed. You can also use Scarab Bombs, Bombs, or Dynamite to clear large areas of ground quickly."

      "title": "Plant Sunflowers to slow the spread of your evil biome.",
      "content": "Plant Sunflowers to slow the spread of your evil biome. This method works in both regular mode and Hardmode, but becomes less effective once the corruption spreads underground in Hardmode. You can purchase Sunflowers from the Dryad for 50 Silver Coins."

      "title": "Buy the Clentaminator from the Steampunker.",
      "content": "Buy the Clentaminator from the Steampunker. The Steampunker will only show up once you're in Hardmode if you've defeated one of the Mechanical Bosses ( The Destroyer , The Twins , or Skeletron Prime). The Clentaminator uses various colored Solutions as ammunition, which will change the biome it's fired at to the biome associated with that solution. The Clentaminator can fire through blocks and works in water. [2] X Research source The Clentaminator costs 2 Platinum Coins and each Solution costs 15 Silver Coins. The best Solution to use is the Green Solution. This Solution will remove Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow, though the converted biomes can be re-corrupted if you don't fully eradicate your evil and Hallow biomes. Green Solution can be purchased from the Steampunker if she's not in the Hallow. If the Steampunker is in the Hallow, she will sell Blue Solution. Blue Solution spreads Hallow, which can be used to keep evil biomes from spreading as Corruption or Crimson cannot spread through Hallow."

    {
      "title": "Evil biomes can also be removed with Purification Powder.",
      "content": "Evil biomes can also be removed with Purification Powder. This, however, is not as ideal as using the Clentaminator, because Purification Powder is more expensive in the long run than the Clentaminator and has a higher likelihood of failure as purified biomes can be re-corrupted before you're able to fully remove Corruption or Crimson."

    {
      "title": "There are two evil biomes—Corruption and Crimson.",
      "content": "There are two evil biomes—Corruption and Crimson. When you start a game of Terraria, you'll have either a Crimson or Corruption biome, though some world seeds have both. These worlds are the same difficulty, so it doesn't matter which one you pick, though your choice does affect which weapons and armor you can create due to available materials. Hallow is a Hardmode-only biome that isn't evil, though it is very dangerous. It functions almost exactly the same as Crimson and Corruption and will start to spread once you've entered Hardmode."
