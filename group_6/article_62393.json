      "content": "Puppy teeth are sharp to help them wean from their mother’s milk. Puppies are actually born without any teeth, which makes breastfeeding safe and comfortable for puppies and their mother. However, puppies can’t survive on milk forever. As their teeth start to grow, they accidentally bite as they suckle. Their mother pushes them away when that happens, which encourages the puppies to start eating solid foods. [1] X Research source"

Your puppy’s bones and muscles are still strengthening and developing, so their super sharp teeth compensate for the fact that their jaw is still growing.

When their sibling stops playing after they nip at them, they learn that biting stops playtime. And when they get nipped back, they realize that teeth are sharp and that they shouldn’t bite.

      "content": "At 4-5 months, dogs lose their puppy teeth and gain less sharp adult teeth. This is often called teething, or when your puppy’s adult teeth emerge as they lose their puppy teeth. They will lose their puppy teeth and gain their adult teeth over the course of a couple months. By the time your puppy is 8 months old, they will usually have all 42 of their adult teeth! [5] X Research source Do not try to pull your puppy’s teeth out, as that can damage their teeth and gums. Your puppy naturally loses their teeth all on their own! You might find their teeth around the house, but it’s just as normal for your puppy to swallow them. Sometimes an adult tooth emerges where a puppy tooth is still in place. If you notice this, call your veterinarian. They might need to remove the tooth. You can actually tell how old a dog is by their teeth ! Counting the number of teeth they have and determining if they are puppy or adult canines, incisors, or molars, gives you a great age estimation."

Instead, you have to teach them not to bite! Bite inhibition is one of the best ways because it mimics how puppies play and learn about biting. Keep your hand limp when your puppy bites you. Immediately jerking your hand back can encourage your puppy to jump and grab at you.

This will let your puppy know that they can chew on the toy, but not on you. Be sure to rotate the toys that you give them to keep them entertained and stimulated.
