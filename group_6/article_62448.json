      "content": "A burnt hair smell comes from using styling tools that are too hot. When straighteners or curling irons reach very high temperatures (above 200°C/392°F), they can damage the hair cuticle, which is the outermost protective layer of your hair. The extreme heat essentially burns through the cuticle, causing it to crack and break down. [1] X Research source This can result in a burnt smell that lingers even after you’ve washed your hair. Because of this, it’s important to avoid using temperatures above 356°F/180°C when styling your hair with hot tools. A slightly burnt smell is usually nothing to worry about, but a very strong smell may indicate some damage to your hair, and it may be tougher to get rid of. Luckily there are a few steps you can take to neutralize the odor and repair your hair, and we’ll cover them all below!"

      "content": "Apply baking soda to get rid of the smell. If a burnt smell has been lingering in your hair, try applying some baking soda. Baking soda is an amazing natural deodorizer, so it can help clear away the unpleasant odor quickly and easily. [2] X Research source There are a few different ways you can apply it: Make a paste: Mix ¼ cup (57 g) of baking soda with 1 quart (.946 liters) of water, then apply it to your hair, working it in with your hands and fingers. Thoroughly rinse the paste out, then shampoo as normal. [3] X Research source Shampoo with baking soda: Mix about a 1 teaspoon (4.8 g) of baking soda with a bit of your normal shampoo. [4] X Research source Use this mixture to wash your hair, then follow up with your normal conditioner. Note: Baking soda is great at neutralizing odor, but it may leave your hair and scalp feeling a bit drier than usual. Because of this, it’s important to use a nourishing conditioner or deep conditioning mask to restore moisture afterwards. You’ll also want to avoid doing this on a regular basis—just one baking soda wash should be enough to get rid of the burnt smell you’re experiencing. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use scented hair products to offset the smell. Many hair oils, serums, leave-in-conditioners, mousses, and hairsprays have lovely scents that can help make the burnt smell a bit less noticeable. You can also spritz your hair with a bit of body spray, perfume, or hair perfume (which is formulated specifically for hair). [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Do a deep conditioning treatment to nourish damaged hair. Unfortunately, the burnt smell you’re experiencing is most likely a sign that the heat has caused some damage to the hair cuticle, so it’s important to take action to repair it. Try doing a deep conditioning treatment once weekly to seal the cuticle and add some much-needed moisture to your hair. [7] X Research source Purchase a deep conditioning hair mask at the drugstore or beauty supply store, or make one yourself . Apply the mask to your hair and allow it to sit for 20-30 minutes before washing out. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your hot styling tools under 400°F/204°C at all times. Many hair straighteners and curling irons can reach much higher temperatures, but this can easily damage and burn your hair. To be safe, aim to keep your tools around 356°F/180°C for regular everyday styling, and never use temperatures over 400°F/204°C. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Style your hair in smaller sections.",
      "content": "Style your hair in smaller sections. When you try to curl a large chunk of your hair, you'll need to keep the hair on the curling iron longer, which increases your chances of burning it. The same goes for straightening a large section of hair at once—you’ll likely find yourself running it through your straightener over and over again, which causes damage. To avoid this, split your hair into small sections, and patiently work through them. This may take awhile, but it will be worth it! [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid using heat styling tools on wet hair.",
      "content": "Avoid using heat styling tools on wet hair. Your hair is most fragile when it’s wet, so straightening or curling it in this state can cause some serious damage. You’ll likely hear sizzling or popping sounds, and the whole process can leave an unpleasant burning odor. Because of this, it’s best to avoid using hot styling tools until your hair is completely dry. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Don’t overload your hair with product before using hot tools.",
      "content": "Don’t overload your hair with product before using hot tools. Adding a bunch of creams, mousses, sprays, and serums to your hair will likely leave it slightly damp, which is a big no-no when using a straightener or curling iron. If your hair isn’t 100% dry before using these tools, you’ll likely experience sizzling, smoking, and that all-too-familiar burning smell. [13] X Research source Plus, certain products like texturizing sprays and dry shampoos aren’t meant to be heated at all, so they can easily burn and cause more damage to the hair underneath. [14] X Research source Remember, all you need before straightening or curling is a good heat protectant spray. Apply it liberally to your hair, then wait until it’s completely dry to start using your hot tools."

      "content": "Avoid products that contain silicones. Silicones work by coating your hair in a water-repellant protective layer—kind of like a raincoat. If you’re trying to prevent outside elements from getting to your hair, this can be a good thing. This can be a problem, however, when you’re trying to heal your hair from heat damage. The protective layer builds up over time, blocking moisture from absorbing into your hair. This essentially makes your deep-conditioning products ineffective and leads to dry, brittle hair. [15] X Research source While you’re working to heal your hair from heat damage, opt for silicone-free hair products as much as possible. If you do use silicones sometimes, make sure to use a clarifying shampoo once per week to prevent product build-up. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean your hot styling tools regularly.",
      "content": "Clean your hot styling tools regularly. Over time, hair products can build up on your straightening or curling iron, leaving a sticky residue. This residue can easily smoke or burn, and the unpleasant smell may transfer to your hair. It can also cause the tool to snag on your hair more often, causing extra breakage. To prevent all this, clean your hot styling tools regularly. [17] X Research source If you use your hot tool daily, wipe it off with a microfiber cloth at least once per week. If you only use your hot tools a few times per week, a monthly wipe down should do the trick. If there’s a lot of visible product buildup, consider doing a deep clean: Add a drop shampoo or face wash onto a toothbrush, then rub the toothbrush on the gunky product buildup until it breaks down. Mist the area lightly with water from a spray bottle to wash away the cleanser and residue, then wipe down with a cloth until dry. [18] X Research source Note: Do not submerge your tools or place them under running water while cleaning, and make sure they are completely unplugged the entire time. Ensure that your tools are completely dry before plugging them in and using them again."
