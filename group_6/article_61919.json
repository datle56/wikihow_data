Then, turn on your kitchen faucet to cool water and rub the outside of each sprout as the water runs over them. This helps remove any dirt or debris. [1] X Research source Alternatively, soak the sprouts in a bowl of cool water for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, rub and rinse them off under cold water. [2] X Research source Wash your hands with antibacterial soap before handling Brussels sprouts or other produce to avoid transferring bacteria to your meal. [3] X Research source Throw out bad sprouts before washing them. Spoiled sprouts smell bad and feel mushy while fresh sprouts have bright green, compacted leaves. Don’t use hot water. It can wilt some of the leaves or allow microorganisms to seep into the sprout. Tip : Only wash as many sprouts as you plan to eat. Storing washed sprouts can make them spoil faster, as it encourages bacteria and mold to grow. [4] X Research source"

Cut about 1 cm (0.4 in) off of the stem using a sharp paring or chef’s knife. Then, discard or compost the stems . [5] X Research source Only cut off a small portion of the stem. Cutting off too much can cause the leaves to fall off or the sprout to fall apart."
