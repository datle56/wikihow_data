      "title": "Gaffer tape",
      "content": "Gaffer tape and medical tape offer the most support. “Boob tape” can describe anything from duct tape (no thanks) to boob adhesives. But if you’re looking for comfortable support that lasts all day, go for gaffer tape or medical tape. Gaffer tape is slightly stronger, but it does hurt a little more to remove. If you have sensitive skin, opt for medical tape. Looking for the boob tape that Kim K loves? She used gaffer tape in most of her iconic plunging neckline dresses."

      "content": "The adhesives in tape can irritate your skin, so test it out beforehand. If you’ve never worn boob tape before, cut a small piece off the roll and put it on your chest for 24 hours. If your skin gets red or starts itching, take the tape off right away and find an alternative to using tape. However, if your skin is fine after a full day, you’re good to go. [1] X Research source If you know you’re allergic to adhesives already, stay away from boob tape or any kind of adhesive tapes."

      "title": "Make sure your skin isn’t slippery so the tape sticks well.",
      "content": "Make sure your skin isn’t slippery so the tape sticks well. Take a shower and use a mild cleanser to remove any dirt or oils from your skin. Pat your skin dry, and avoid putting on any lotions or sunscreens, since that can make tape less likely to stick."

      "title": "Tape can be a little painful, so protect your nipples beforehand.",
      "content": "Tape can be a little painful, so protect your nipples beforehand. You can use nipple covers or pasties , or you can simply use a cotton pad . This will help keep your nipples protected to avoid any pain or irritation when you take the tape off. [2] X Research source Plus, covering up your nipples helps them become less visible when you put your dress on. If that’s a concern for you, nipple covers or cotton pads are your friend!"

      "content": "Use scissors to cut strips that are about 12 in (30 cm) long. This will help you apply your tape much faster. Make sure your strips are about the length of the area from the bottom of your breast to just underneath your shoulder. [3] X Research source Most boob tape has an adhesive backing on it, so it won’t be sticky until you peel that off. If yours doesn’t, you can stick the edge of your strips onto a countertop or table to have them at the ready."

      "title": "Hold your breast as high as you’d like it to sit in your dress.",
      "content": "Hold your breast as high as you’d like it to sit in your dress. Stand in front of a mirror so you can see, then hold your breast with one hand. Lift it up gently and keep your boob in place as you apply your tape. [4] X Research source If you’re having trouble finding the perfect position for your boobs, put on a bra you love and see how much lift it gives you. Then, take off the bra and replicate that lift with your hand."

      "title": "Support your breast by going from the bottom up.",
      "content": "Support your breast by going from the bottom up. Peel the backing off of the tape, then gently apply the bottom of the tape to the base of your breast. Press the tape down to secure it onto your skin, stopping once you get to your collarbone. [5] X Research source Keep supporting your breast with one hand as you apply the tape to make sure it stays lifted."

      "title": "Keep the tape wrinkle-free so it doesn’t show through your dress.",
      "content": "Keep the tape wrinkle-free so it doesn’t show through your dress. As you apply your tape, use your hand to smooth it as you work your way upward. Don’t worry about small wrinkles—just pay attention to big ones, as those might show through a sheer dress. [6] X Research source When your first piece of tape is smooth and wrinkle-free, you can apply a second piece of tape to your other breast."

      "title": "Depending on your dress and cup size, you may need more tape.",
      "content": "Depending on your dress and cup size, you may need more tape. If 1 piece of tape gives you the support you need, then you’re good to go! However, if you need more support, add a second and third piece of tape, starting from the base of your breast and going upward. This will give you more lift and support to keep your boobs up all night long. The placement of your tape depends on the straps of your dress. If your dress has wide, thick straps with a plunging neckline, keep the tape on the outer portion of your breasts (near your armpits). If your dress is strapless, tape your boobs horizontally instead of vertically."

      "title": "Put your dress on and carefully cut the tape so it doesn’t show.",
      "content": "Put your dress on and carefully cut the tape so it doesn’t show. Once your boobs are secured, it’s time for the finishing touches! Use a pair of scissors to carefully cut away pieces of tape until your straps cover the tape completely. [7] X Research source This can be a little tough to do on your own, so don’t be afraid to ask a friend for help with this step."

      "title": "When the night is over, steam or baby oil will help with removal.",
      "content": "When the night is over, steam or baby oil will help with removal. Take your dress off and stand in the shower for about 5 minutes. Get out of the shower and carefully peel the tape off, starting from the top and working your way down. Apply baby oil or olive oil to your skin underneath the tape to help it slide off. [8] X Research source Boob tape is usually single-use, so unfortunately, you can’t reuse it for another night out."
