      "title": "Use leave-in conditioner daily or as directed.",
      "content": "Use leave-in conditioner daily or as directed. Leave-in conditioner is typically safe to use once daily, though how often you use it is ultimately up to you. For example, if you have particularly dry, coarse, or frizzy hair, using a leave-in conditioner daily may provide the hydration and nourishment your hair needs to thrive. Alternatively, if you have fine or oily hair, using leave-in conditioner daily may result in unnecessary product build-up that may weigh your hair down, so try it every few days or once a week. Some leave-in conditioners have particular instructions for usage, so be sure to read your product’s directions before applying it to your hair. Leave-in conditioners aren’t a permanent substitute for standard conditioners, as they’re formulated to be lightweight and not bond to follicles as a normal conditioner would. Think of a leave-in conditioner as a great way to provide your hair with extra nourishment and TLC when it’s feeling dry or unruly. Don't wash out leave-in conditioner—it's meant to be left in until your next wash day."

From bleached to bright red and anything in between, leave-in conditioners with UV and heat-proof ingredients make fighting damage from the sun and styling tools a breeze.

      "content": "Nourish coarse or curly hair with a protein-rich leave-in conditioner . Curly and coarse hair requires more moisture than straight hair because the oils produced on the scalp have more difficulty making their way down the hair shaft—in other words, the more moisture, the better! Protien-rich leave-in conditioners penetrate deep into the hair shaft, helping you to achieve bouncy, happy curls. [7] X Research source Unlike other hair types, leave-in conditioner can be applied from the root to tip rather than just the ends. When searching for a good leave-in conditioner, look for hair-healthy ingredients like antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and botanical extracts such as aloe vera and chamomile."
