      "content": "A high-maintenance woman requires a lot of attention and time. Does she get really upset if you take an hour or two to reply to her text? Does she get frustrated if you say you want to go out with your friends this weekend instead of hanging with her? High-maintenance women tend to require a lot of effort from their partners, so pay attention to what she needs from you. [1] X Research source This may not be a bad thing. A woman who requires a lot of time and energy may be deeply loyal and committed to you."

      "title": "High-maintenance women expect the world to bend to their every whim.",
      "content": "High-maintenance women expect the world to bend to their every whim. High-maintenance people do not allow themselves to be treated poorly. She may expect cops to let her off with a warning when she gets pulled over for speeding, or think that it’s automatically okay if she calls out at work at the last minute. If she thinks everyone will go out of their way to get her what she wants, she may be high-maintenance. [2] X Research source If you’re the kind of person who refuses to send a burger back when you ordered it medium-rare and it came out well-done, a high-maintenance gal will have no problem speaking up for you."

    {
      "title": "A high-maintenance gal will have requirements—not preferences.",
      "content": "A high-maintenance gal will have requirements —not preferences. She probably won’t order a “coffee with cream,” but she might opt for a “double mocha with light cream and two sugar packets.” If she seems like she’s extremely specific about where to eat, what to wear, or how she spends her time, it could mean that she’s high-maintenance. [3] X Research source There’s nothing wrong with having specific preferences, and if you tend to be kind of indecisive, having a high-maintenance gal calling the shots might be a good thing."
    },
    {
      "title": "It’s hard to roll with the punches when you have super high standards.",
      "content": "It’s hard to roll with the punches when you have super high standards. She may lash out at you for trying to reschedule a date, or refuse to let you pick the restaurant. A high-maintenance girl is likely to become frustrated if things don’t work out the way they were supposed to, and you may be expected to stick to your plans more rigorously than you’re used to. [4] X Research source If you’re kind of wishy-washy and you struggle to commit to things, dating someone who holds you to your word may be productive."

    {
      "title": "When someone is high maintenance, things don’t go their way very often.",
      "content": "When someone is high maintenance, things don’t go their way very often. Having super high standards for how you’re treated can result in a lot of people not living up to those standards. Since a high-maintenance girl will be let down a lot, they’re likely going to let you know. A high-maintenance woman won’t hesitate to air her grievances when people come up (understandably) short. [5] X Research source The good news is that you’ll have someone who understands where you’re coming from whenever you need to vent!"

    {
      "title": "It’s hard for high-maintenance people to even realize they’re wrong.",
      "content": "It’s hard for high-maintenance people to even realize they’re wrong. Even if she is in the wrong, she’s unlikely to acknowledge it. In a high-maintenance girl’s head, she can do no wrong. It’s a by-product of her high standards for herself—she may have so much self-confidence that it’s hard for her to imagine she made a mistake. [6] X Research source This is also why high-maintenance people tend to hold on to grudges for very long. Her inclination to put the blame on other people will also make it difficult for her to apologize."

      "title": "Obsessing over looks is a sign that superficial things really matter to her.",
      "content": "Obsessing over looks is a sign that superficial things really matter to her. If she dresses to the nines and her hair and makeup are always on point, it means that she’s really invested in how she looks. If outward appearances matter to her, she’s going to have preferences when it comes to how you look when you’re standing next to her. [7] X Research source If you know you lean on the sweatpants and T-shirts a little too often when you go out, a high-maintenance girl will whip you into shape in no time!"

      "title": "Likes and follows don’t really matter, but they will if she’s high-maintenance.",
      "content": "Likes and follows don’t really matter, but they will if she’s high-maintenance. This is an extension of her desire to be seen and respected by others. A high-maintenance woman is more likely to post tons of travel photos and selfies on Instagram, or regularly update people on how she’s thriving on Facebook. [8] X Research source If you ever share a photo of you two and she asks you to take it down because she doesn’t like the way she looks in it, it’s a good sign she really cares about how she is perceived online."

      "title": "If you feel like you’re always doing her favors, it’s because she asks a lot.",
      "content": "If you feel like you’re always doing her favors, it’s because she asks a lot. Does she send you on morning coffee runs? Is she always asking you to pick something up on your way over? A high-maintenance girl has no problem letting you know she needs you to do something, and you may find yourself running around with a to-do list more often than usual. [9] X Research source If your love language is acts of service and you enjoy feeling important to someone by making their life easier, a high-maintenance girl may be ideal for you."

      "title": "It’s exceptionally difficult to be realistic if you’re super high-maintenance.",
      "content": "It’s exceptionally difficult to be realistic if you’re super high-maintenance. Does she expect everyone will bend to her every whim? Does she think everything is going to work out in her favor? These are signs that she’s high-maintenance. The same way she holds herself to high standards, she holds the universe to lofty expectations. [10] X Research source If you tend to be a bit of a pessimist, a high-maintenance gal’s healthy hope and optimism may help balance you out."

      "title": "If you feel like she’s a ton of work, you aren’t imagining things.",
      "content": "If you feel like she’s a ton of work, you aren’t imagining things. Being with a high maintenance girl can be challenging—especially if you’re a super laid-back kind of person. However, it can also be deeply rewarding to be with someone who is engaged, active, and focused. A high-maintenance girl knows what she wants, and that can be a good thing! [11] X Research source If all of this is too much for you, there’s nothing wrong with breaking up and moving on. You deserve a partner who treats you right, and there are always more fish in the sea."
