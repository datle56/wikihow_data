      "content": "Grab one end of each P-shaped ring with both of your hands. Hold the puzzle as evenly as possible so you don’t twist it the wrong way while you work. Align the puzzle horizontally before you begin twisting it, with both ends of the P-shaped rings facing outwards. [1] X Research source The two Ps should make something resembling a \"W\" shape before you begin twisting them."

Then, loop the right ring around the upper \"P\" loop of the left ring. Your two P-shaped rings should look stacked on top of each other and mirror each other at the loops. [2] X Research source The rings should resemble a heart shape at this stage."

To avoid losing either ring and to put the puzzle together again, insert one ring through the top loop of the other ring. Pull the first ring all the way through the second ring, then turn the second ring up to secure both in place. [4] X Research source"
