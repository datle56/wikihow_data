      "content": "Select a microneedling device. Prior to microneedling at home, you need to choose a device that is best suited for you. There are three different types of at home microneedling products: a derma roller, derma stamp, and derma pen. Derma rollers are the least expensive option and roll along your skin like a paint roller. Some dermatologists recommend derma stamps and derma pens because the vertical penetration is less painful and allows for easier maneuvering around the mouth, eyes, and nose.

      "content": "Determine the length of the needles. Most at home microneedling is performed using much shorter needles than those used by aestheticians. For instance, at a clinic needles can range in length from 0.5mm to 3mm depending on the type of treatment. When performing the treatment at home, you should use shorter needles. Needle lengths that range from 0.25mm to 1mm are recommended for general anti-aging procedures. If treating acne scars , you may want to use a longer needle around 1.5mm in length. [3] X Research source If you are opting for a longer needle, talk with your dermatologist prior to treatment."

      "title": "Visualize your face in sections.",
      "content": "Visualize your face in sections. Mentally divide your face into approximately six sections. You do not need to actually mark your face. For example, you could try mentally dividing into the following sections: forehead, cheeks, chin, eye area, nose, and upper lip. This will help to ensure that you adequately cover the entire surface of your face and will help to break up the procedure. If desired, you can also use a microneedling device on your neck and upper chest."

      "title": "Glide the derma roller across your face.",
      "content": "Glide the derma roller across your face. Turn on the device and gently glide the roller across your face. You should move the roller vertically, horizontally, and diagonally across the surface of your skin. This should be done in stripes covering each section of your face. While moving the roller across your face, use your other hand to pull your skin tight. This will make it easier to maneuver the device. Do not go over the same section of skin too many times in 1 sitting. It is recommended that you do not pass over the same patch of skin more than 10 times per treatment. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Do not apply too much pressure.",
      "content": "Do not apply too much pressure. When using the microneedling roller, stamp, or pen, do not apply too much pressure. Instead, you should apply light to moderate pressure.

      "content": "Lift the roller when changing directions. Always lift the roller completely off of your face when you are changing directions, then return it to your skin facing in the direction you are headed. Never drag or turn the microneedling roller from a vertical position to a diagonal position while it is still touching the surface of your skin. This could cause your skin to tear and may result in damage to your skin."
