      "content": "Recline on or place a wedge-shaped pillow under your belly. While lying on your side, place the narrow edge of the wedge pillow under your belly to relieve strain on your stomach. [1] X Research source Or, lay on your back with the pillow elevating your head to relieve pressure on your lower spine. Benefits: Wedge-shaped pillows are great for relieving pain and pressure in your belly or back, and are great for sitting upright while awake. Elevating your head with a wedge while sleeping on your back may also relieve reflux. Feel free to place your usual pillow on top of the wedge-shaped pillow for added comfort. These pillows are also great for sitting upright while awake."

      "title": "Lie on your side in the center of a C-shaped pillow.",
      "content": "Lie on your side in the center of a C-shaped pillow. Lie with your head in the curve of the C, then wrap your arms and legs around one of the “arms” of the C-shaped pillow while lying on your side to support your belly, relieve neck pain, and keep yourself stationary during the night. Lie with your belly supported by the pillow, or with the C’s opening cupping your belly, for more freedom. [2] X Research source Benefits: These pillows provide support for your head, neck, back, and pelvic area. They are great for relieving pelvic tension and reducing water retention in your legs and ankles. C-shaped pillows are typically the most expensive, and largest, pregnancy pillows. J-shaped pillows can be used similarly, and make great, smaller, and less-expensive alternatives."

      "title": "Lie on your side in the center of a U-shaped pillow.",
      "content": "Lie on your side in the center of a U-shaped pillow. Rest your head on the curve of the U-shaped pillow , and settle in between the arms of the pillow. Lie on your back or side and hug 1 arm of the pillow with your arms or legs, if you like. [3] X Research source Placing the pillow between your legs and arms will help relieve tension in your knee and ankle joints. Benefits: U-shaped pillows offer a bit more freedom and flexibility than C-shaped pillows, while still providing security and limiting movement. U-shaped pillows are also often large and more expensive. If you’re on a budget or have a small bed, opt for a J-shaped pillow, instead."

      "title": "Wrap a J-shaped pillow around your neck.",
      "content": "Wrap a J-shaped pillow around your neck. Wrap the curve of the J-shaped pillow around your neck while you sleep on your back or side, rest your head on top, and hug the pillow with your arms and legs, if you prefer. This position gives your lower and upper back, as well as your pelvis, support while you sleep. Benefits: These pillows are great for when you need a smaller, more maneuverable shape than a C or U-shaped pillow. These pillows can help prevent you from rolling on your back while you sleep, which is great if you find that position uncomfortable."

      "title": "Embrace an I-shaped body pillow.",
      "content": "Embrace an I-shaped body pillow. These pillows are most commonly used by sleeping on your side and wrapping your arms and legs around them. You might also use them to elevate your feet while lying down, or position them under your lower back to stretch and relieve pressure on your spine. [4] X Research source Benefits: I-shaped pillows, also just called body pillows , are incredibly versatile, and ideal for someone who likes to have a little freedom and wiggle room while still being supported. You might also place your belly on top of them for support."

      "content": "Use a standard pillow as a more cost-effective solution. Pregnancy pillows aren’t a must, and oftentimes, a regular pillow can get the job done just fine. Stack pillows to elevate your feet or head, place one under your belly or lower back to relieve pressure, or embrace one while lying on your side for more comfort and security."

      "content": "Experiment with different positions to get comfortable. While these are the most popular positions for each of these pillow shapes, don’t hesitate to experiment and go with what works for you. You might even use more than one, or multiple shapes, to find your optimal sleeping position. As long as you’re comfortable, you’re doing it right!"

      "content": "Choose a pillow with hollow fiber filling or polystyrene foam. Both of these fillings are hypoallergenic, as well as water- and smell-resistant. These fillings are also washer-friendly, keep their form, and are lightweight for easy maneuverability. [5] X Research source Pillows with this type of filling are typically less expensive, though prices vary by size and pillow shape. Just remember, whatever pillow you choose, make sure it can support your weight and will not lose its shape throughout your pregnancy; for example, if you are a plus-size woman, you may want to choose a memory foam pillow since these tend to hold their shape better."

      "title": "Use a pillow filled with styrofoam for a lightweight option.",
      "content": "Use a pillow filled with styrofoam for a lightweight option. Pregnancy pillows filled with styrofoam balls are very lightweight. Additionally, the balls allow the pillow to conform to your body easily. While these pillows tend to be much cheaper than others, they do make more noise as you move around, similar to the noise a bean bag makes. [6] X Research source Pillows with styrofoam ball filling are generally not machine washable, so make sure to choose one with a removable cover that you can wash."

      "title": "Use a microbead pillow for a lightweight, more supportive option.",
      "content": "Use a microbead pillow for a lightweight, more supportive option. Pillows made with microbead filling are more supportive than the ones with styrofoam ball filling and, while more expensive, are still on the cheaper side—around $40. They are also very lightweight and make very little noise as you move around. [7] X Research source Pillows with microbead filling may or may not be machine washable. If you choose one that is not, make sure it has a removable cover that you can wash."

      "title": "Choose a memory foam pillow for greater support.",
      "content": "Choose a memory foam pillow for greater support. Pillows made with memory foam conform to your body and hold their shape very well. However, memory foam is not very breathable, so these pillows can become very hot as you sleep throughout the night. [8] X Research source Memory foam pillows tend to be more expensive, around $100 or more, depending on the size of the pillow. Additionally, memory foam pillows are typically machine washable. If you're worried about becoming too warm at night, try a pillow with shredded memory foam. This has many of the same benefits, but more air can move through the pillow, cooling it down."

      "title": "Choose a pillow with a removable cover for easy washing.",
      "content": "Choose a pillow with a removable cover for easy washing. Pillows with removable covers are great because they make keeping your pillow clean very easy. All you need to do is remove the cover and wash it per the instructions on the tag. Look for pillows with zip or slip on covers. [9] X Research source If the pillow you like does not have a removable cover, then make sure it is machine washable and can fit inside your washing machine."

      "title": "Purchase a pillow suitable for your height and bed size.",
      "content": "Purchase a pillow suitable for your height and bed size. If you’re taller than the average woman, look into getting a pillow that is 8 to 11 feet (250 to 350 cm) long. If you are average height, then get a pillow that is 5 to 6 feet (160 to 170 cm) long. The size of the pillow you want will also depend on the size of your bed and your personal preference. For example, if you have a small or mid-sized bed, make sure to get a pillow that is not too big for your bed. The length of the pillow can also be affected by style; for example, U-shaped pillows tend to be longer than the other types of pillows."

      "title": "Opt for a firmer pillow, when in doubt.",
      "content": "Opt for a firmer pillow, when in doubt. Although it may be tempting to get a soft pillow, it is recommended that you get a pillow that is at least slightly firm. A firmer pillow will provide more support and keep its shape longer. It may be uncomfortable at first, but over time you may get used to it. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Pregnancy pillows relieve pressure and pains in bed. The largest benefit of a pregnancy pillow is just getting comfortable! When you’re pregnant, your body can get stressed under all that extra weight, leading to joint pain in your neck, hips, back, and shoulders. A strategically placed pregnancy pillow can alleviate these pains, leading to a better night’s sleep. [11] X Research source Elevating your legs with a pregnancy pillow can also help collected fluids drain and circulate back into your body. Elevating your head may help reduce reflux, nausea, heartburn, and sinus congestion."

      "content": "Use a pregnancy pillow if (or when) sleeping becomes difficult. The truth is, pregnancy pillows aren’t a necessity, they’re just a handy invention that makes your life easier. There’s no set timeline, but many women start feeling the burden of their bellies in bed at around 20 weeks. Introduce a pillow then, or just whenever you feel like you could do with a little more support at night. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Continue to use your pregnancy pillow for post-natal support.",
      "content": "Continue to use your pregnancy pillow for post-natal support. Even after your baby is born, you may find that you still need some support as your body gets back to how it was before pregnancy. As before, you may keep using your pillow to relieve pressures and pains, or just to help get into and out of bed. That said, avoid using a pregnancy pillow with your newborn unless directed by your doctor. These pillows often aren’t made for infants, and may lead to stress or injury if used incorrectly."

      "title": "Sleep on your left side.",
      "content": "Sleep on your left side. Sleeping on your side while pregnant is often considered by experts to be the safest position. Sleeping on the right side of your body may strain your liver with the excess weight, and lying on your back may limit your blood flow, as the weight presses on major veins. [13] X Research source Of course, lying on your stomach is often impossible without a specialized, more expensive pillow, but even then it’s not recommended. Also, avoid sleeping on your back in the second and third trimesters to avoid putting weight on your uterus and spine.

      "content": "Get 30-60 minutes of light exercise during the day. Exercise is super important for pregnant women! It keeps your blood pumping and your body working as it needs to support a child, and fights cramps and promotes sleep during the night. [17] X Research source Go for a walk in the sun each day, or even just on the treadmill. You might also bob around a bit in a pool, or use an elliptical for a sit-down exercise."

      "content": "Avoid caffeine and large meals a few hours before bed. Caffeinated drinks keep you up and energized, so only consume them in the morning if at all. Then, try not to eat or drink much within 3-4 hours of going to bed, as too much food or drink can lead to nausea. Instead, have larger meals in the morning and afternoon, and keep evening meals to light snacks, like fruits or veggies. [18] X Research source Also, try to urinate just before bed to avoid late-night trips to the bathroom."

      "content": "Stretch your legs before bed to reduce cramps. Many pregnant women experience cramping in their calves or thighs during the night. To avoid this, stretch your legs just before bed. If you do cramp up, stand on the cramped leg, or place your feet flat on a wall while lying on your back and press hard on the wall. [19] X Research source Adding calcium and magnesium to your daily meals can also help, like with dairy or seeds, but avoid taking supplements without your doctor's opinion."

      "content": "Stick to a consistent sleep schedule. Your body likes a routine, and if you go to bed and wake up at the same times each day, it becomes easier to sleep through the night. It helps your body to go on a sort of “autopilot” and get into the habit of shutting down. [20] X Research source Also, aim to get 7-9 hours of sleep each night."
