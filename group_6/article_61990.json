      "content": "Wear a bandeau or strapless bra if your tank top has thin, spaghetti straps. Most bra straps won't fit under thin, spaghetti straps. The extra pair of straps also won't always look good. A bandeau or strapless bra will give you the support you need without drawing attention to your tank top. [1] X Research source If you can't find a strapless bra that fits, try getting one with clear straps instead. If you are going to be wearing another shirt or cardigan over your tank top, then you can wear any bra you want."

      "content": "Choose a tank top with thicker straps if you have a large bust. The larger bust size you have, the more support you need. A strapless bra may not give you the support you need, so you will have to wear a regular, strapped bra. If you have to wear a strapped bra for support, then you will need to wear a tank top with wider shoulders to conceal the straps. [3] X Research source Alternatively, you can wear a tank top with skinny shoulders, when wear a cute cardigan over it to conceal the bra straps."

If you want to make your bust appear fuller, choose neckline with detail, such as ruching, pleating, or ruffles."
