      "title": "Capricorns value trust more highly than anything else.",
      "content": "Capricorns value trust more highly than anything else. Trust doesn't come easily to a Capricorn—you have to earn it. That trust is priceless, and betrayal of a Capricorn's trust is unforgivable. While you might not see fireworks (it takes a lot to make a Capricorn explode), you also might never see them again. Generally, it's more important to be direct and honest with a Capricorn than anything else—even if you're afraid the truth will hurt. They'd rather you be honest than try to spare their feelings. If you do something to violate a Capricorn's trust, come clean about it as soon as possible. Be humble and take ownership of what you did. They'll be more likely to forgive you if you show that you understand and respect their feelings."

      "title": "Do what you say you're going to do.",
      "content": "Do what you say you're going to do. If you have any doubts about something, wait until you know for sure before you tell your Capricorn about it. That ensures you don't have to go back on your word. They will fault you for it, even if what happened was beyond your control. Plan for things very carefully, including having at least one backup plan in case the first plan falls through. This is what a Capricorn would do, and they can't understand why everyone else isn't doing the same. If you do have to change plans, let them know as soon as you know—don't wait until the last minute. They'll be more understanding if they have time to arrange an alternative."

      "title": "Capricorn is ruled by Saturn, the planet of organization.",
      "content": "Capricorn is ruled by Saturn, the planet of organization. The adage \"a place for everything and everything in its place\" was probably written by a Capricorn. These Goats hold strong to their belief in the value of cleanliness and careful organization—if you upset that delicate balance, expect to get the horns. [1] X Research source Pay attention to where and how the Capricorn in your life keeps things, then mimic them. You won't go wrong if you take care of things the same way they do. If you need help cleaning out closets or storage, call a Capricorn! They'll absolutely love to straighten things out for you and get you on the right path."

      "title": "Proud Capricorns don't take well to snobbery.",
      "content": "Proud Capricorns don't take well to snobbery. Give off the impression that you know more, or are more important, to the Capricorn in your life, and they won't be in your life for long. A Capricorn is something of a perfectionist and they feel they're the best at everything they do. If you so much as imply that there's a better way of doing things, you're likely to find yourself getting the cold shoulder. Gentle suggestions work well with a Capricorn if you have an idea for a better way to do things. Get them headed down your path and then let them think it was their idea. Be careful with back-handed compliments and other passive-aggressive comments—a Capricorn will see right through them and not want anything to do with you."

      "title": "Goats pride themselves on their efficient use of time.",
      "content": "Goats pride themselves on their efficient use of time. The meme about time-waster meetings that could've been an email was probably created by a Capricorn. This hard-working earth sign has a lot to do and doesn't like to be kept waiting for anything. Be direct and to the point when you're telling a Capricorn something. If they need more information, they'll ask, but they don't like a lot of superfluous details. With a Capricorn, early is \"on time\" and \"on time\" is late. If you get held up, text them immediately with a new ETA so they can find something to do in the meantime and aren't sitting around waiting on you."

      "title": "The grounded, logical earth sign dislikes when people are overly emotional.",
      "content": "The grounded, logical earth sign dislikes when people are overly emotional. Capricorns have emotions, they just tend not to express them too freely. In the zodiac, Capricorn sits opposite Cancer, the astrological seat of sensitivity and emotions. This doesn't mean that Capricorns don't have any emotions—they do. They just tend not to express them very freely. [2] X Research source If you're trying to convince a Capricorn of something, focus on the logical reasons to do it rather than the emotions behind it. They don't usually consider feelings a good reason to do anything. In a volatile situation, you'll win points with a Capricorn if you can take a deep breath and keep your emotions in check until the situation is resolved."

      "title": "The hard-working Capricorn focuses intently on the task at hand.",
      "content": "The hard-working Capricorn focuses intently on the task at hand. If you derail a Capricorn's train of thought, you're likely to get an earful. Let them finish whatever they're doing before you bring up something else. Send them a quick message if you can see that they're busy and let them know that you need to talk to them when they're free. This puts the ball in their court (where they like it) and they'll reach out to you when they get to a good stopping place. Even if a Goat doesn't seem busy, it's always a good idea to ask if you can talk to them before you launch into whatever you're going to say. They'll feel respected, which a Capricorn really appreciates."

      "title": "A Capricorn doesn't understand the concept of venting.",
      "content": "A Capricorn doesn't understand the concept of venting. Ever the earth sign, Capricorns are very practical. They get easily frustrated if you're complaining or whining about something—especially if you're not interested in fixing the problem. If you're in a relationship with a Capricorn, you need someone else to go to when you want to let off steam. Only go to a Capricorn with a problem when you're looking for a concrete solution. If you're going to express frustration about something that's bothering you, do it with humor. If you act as though you find it ridiculous, chances are, your Capricorn will too."

      "title": "The stubborn Capricorn bristles under authority.",
      "content": "The stubborn Capricorn bristles under authority. Capricorns respect rightful authority, but in a social setting, they're not going to let anyone else boss them around. If you're the type that always has to be in charge, you probably won't get along well with a Capricorn. Ask a Capricorn to do something and you'll usually get a pleasant response. Since Capricorns are such hard workers, they're always willing to do things—they just don't want to be ordered to do them. It also helps to let them volunteer. If you say, \"We've got company coming and the living room is a mess,\" they'll likely get started picking up before you finish the sentence. Saying \"clean the living room,\" on the other hand, will likely result in a cold stare."

      "title": "Capricorns work hard and expect others to do the same.",
      "content": "Capricorns work hard and expect others to do the same. As a cardinal sign, Capricorns are highly motivated people who love initiating new plans and activities. The influence of Capricorn's earth element also means they value hard work. And their ruling planet, Saturn, makes them driven and ambitious. It's like the perfect storm: there's nothing about a Capricorn that will tolerate laziness in any form. [3] X Research source This can be a hard one because a Capricorn's definition of \"lazy\" is probably going to be different from the average person's. But as long as you're willing to pull your own weight, you'll be fine. If you're interested in dating a Capricorn, you'll get bonus points for having drive and ambition. They want to be with someone who's as driven as they are and knows what it takes to accomplish what they want."

      "title": "The planet Saturn makes people in this sign sticklers for structure.",
      "content": "The planet Saturn makes people in this sign sticklers for structure. For a Capricorn, rules are rules, regardless of whether they're actively enforced or even make sense. If you break a rule, you can expect a Capricorn, of all people, to call you out on it. Show respect for the established order by always keeping things \"by the book\"—especially in the workplace. If you're cutting corners, don't let a Capricorn know about it. If you think a rule should be changed, go through official channels to make that happen. A Capricorn will appreciate efforts to change something that's inefficient or impractical."

      "title": "A Capricorn places a lot of stock in their public appearance.",
      "content": "A Capricorn places a lot of stock in their public appearance. Stories that feature your favorite Capricorn as the butt of any joke (no matter how loving and well-meaning) are sure to draw their ire. Likewise, if you're in a relationship with a Capricorn, anything that happens in private between the two of you is off-limits for public consumption. If there's a funny story you want to share that potentially puts your Capricorn in a bad light, ask them first. They'll love that you thought of their feelings first. When you're in a group where someone's picking on your favorite Capricorn, stand up for them or do what you can to change the subject—they'll be forever grateful."
