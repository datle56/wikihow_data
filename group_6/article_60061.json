Pick an old pot that you don't want to use for cooking anymore. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that this could cause your shirt to bleed, so don't try it on a shirt you're very attached to.

      "content": "Bring the water to a boil. Set the pot on a burner and turn the stove on high heat. Let the water come to a boil. Small bubbles will appear first, which is a sign the water is about to boil. When you see the surface bubbling and rolling, take it off the heat. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Plunge the shirt in the water to soak. Place the shirt in the water. Use tongs to push any part of the shirt that you want to shrink beneath the water – for example, the cuffs, the collar, or the entire thing. Leave it in the water for at least 5 minutes. [4] X Research source You can leave it in for up to 20 minutes if you want it to shrink a lot. If you just want to shrink part of your shirt, try just putting that part in the water and leaving the rest out of the water. You could even put the rest of it in cooler water to prevent the heat from transferring to other areas."

      "content": "Take the shirt out with tongs to check your progress. Use a wooden spoon or tongs to transfer the shirt to a clean sink. Run cool water over it for a few minutes. Once it's cool, squeeze the water out to see if it's shrunk enough for your liking. If you can't tell, go ahead and dry it to see how it fits. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Toss the shirt in the dryer to finish the process. You can hang the shirt up if you don't have a dryer, or if you just wanted to shrink one part. However, a dryer will help shrink the shirt more. Once it's dry, check to make sure it's shrunk enough by trying it on. [6] X Research source If it hasn't shrunk enough, repeat the boiling process. Keep in mind that a shirt will only shrink about 20%."

Add tennis balls or dryer balls to help with the agitation process, and put the dryer on the hottest setting before turning it on. [9] X Research source Agitation – or vigorous motion – helps the shirt shrink. With some fabrics, agitation may help them shrink more than just the heat itself. Both heat and agitation cause the fibers to curl up slightly smaller than when they started, which shrinks the fabric. [10] X Research source"
