For the time being, delete or block their number so you aren’t tempted to reach out to them. Stay off of their social media pages as well since seeing pictures or posts could bring up sad memories. If you get tempted to talk to them, write out the message in the notes app on your phone instead of sending your ex a text. [1] X Research source"

Although your friends may tell you it’s time to move on, you need to give yourself time to get over the past relationship. Take your time to process your feelings, cry, and feel upset. Just let all of your emotions out however you need to. If you give yourself a full day to grieve, you'll be surprised at how much easier it will be to move on a week later.

It could be taking a long walk out in the sun, reading your favorite books, making a fresh cup of tea, or soaking in a hot bath. Focus on how you feel in the moment rather than dwelling on your ex.

Rejection and breakups are bound to happen if people aren’t right for one another, so it’s nothing that you should feel bad about. You and your ex can both be great people, but you might just not belong together. Rather than blame the breakup on a personal “flaw,” it may have been from different expectations or long-term goals. Look at things from your ex’s perspective so you get a better understanding of their decision. [13] X Research source For example, if you broke up because you wanted to move out of the city in the future when your ex wanted to stay, your decision didn’t cause the breakup. You two just have different life plans. Remember you can’t control how your ex thinks or acts, and their reactions aren't your fault."

Holding a grudge or holding onto the pain only makes you more angry and resentful. Remember that people usually don’t intentionally try to hurt other people, so try viewing it from their perspective so you can understand why they made the decision to break up.

It takes everyone a different length of time to process a relationship, but it’s okay to move on when you think you’re completely over your ex. [19] X Research source If you’re dating to distract yourself from the pain, you’re not ready for a new relationship yet.
