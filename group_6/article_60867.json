Just click “Enroll” on the popup, and you’re good to go! [3] X Research source You may need to restart CS:GO to play the beta. When you do, you’ll be given the option of booting CS:GO or the CS2 Limited Test. Pick the latter. Alternatively, open Steam and navigate to Help > Steam Support > Counter Strike: Global Offensive . If you have access to the beta, the menu will say, \"Added to Steam Library as part of Counter-Strike 2: Limited Test Invite.\""

Valve also may factor in your “Trust” factor, which is a nebulous and vague insider indicator of your Steam account usage.

Also, be sure you're playing in a region where the Limited Test is active—currently, this appears to be everywhere but Oceania. Note that Valve clarified that your playtime during a test period doesn’t contribute to your chances; only playtime before the period. So don’t sweat this one too much if you’re checking for an invite during a Limited Test period. [8] X Research source"

In CS2 , smoke grenades now emit 3D volumetric smoke that interacts with the environment and appears more consistently for all players. You can also create holes in smoke plumes by shooting through them or throwing grenades into them. [9] X Research source These changes make smoke grenades more balanced and open up new tactical opportunities. Close off small tunnels or narrow passages with a volumetric plume to hold off your enemy."

In CS2 , Valve is introducing “sub-ticks,” by which the server can calculate your precise actions even between ticks, which, in theory, will make the game feel much more responsive.
