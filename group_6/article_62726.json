To correctly reset your TV, streaming device (like a Roku), or console, unplug it from the wall for at least a minute. After the minute has passed and the device is still unplugged, press and hold its Power button (if it has one) for 30 seconds.

This may not work if you rushed through the steps to power cycle your device and all the power didn't drain."
