      "content": "Drink 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of water shortly before the sauna. Your body sweats and releases lots of moisture in a sauna—up to a pint—so it’s important to hydrate beforehand. [2] X Research source To use a sauna safely , aim to drink at least 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of water in the hour before you enter, especially if you’ve just been working out. And don’t be afraid to sip more water in the sauna if you feel thirsty.

Plus, the name of the sauna game is sweat, and it’s best to reduce any body odor you might have built up in the gym beforehand. [5] X Research source Then, dry off completely to kickstart perspiration once you enter the sauna. Avoid using fragranced lotion or cream after your shower, since these may clog your pores or emit obtrusive odors when you sweat. If you like, turn the water to cold at the end of the shower to make those first moments in the sauna especially blissful."

Before you step inside, check the external thermometer to make sure the sauna is at a comfortable and effective temperature, about 140 to 170 °F (60 to 77 °C). It can take a while for home saunas to heat up, so turn on a personal sauna at least 30 minutes before you go in. Keep in mind that some home saunas often have a limit on how hot you can set them. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you’re using a gym sauna , avoid changing the temperature if others are already inside. Ask the occupants if they mind a higher or lower temperature before changing it. Many saunas allow you to set a timer so the sauna's heater will turn off after a set amount of time."

[8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Be polite and greet others with a nod when you enter. It’s okay to chat, but do so in a low, unobtrusive voice. Ask a friend to accompany you if you feel uncomfortable, and to monitor your condition or escort you out if you start to feel dizzy or lightheaded. Also, make your entrance (and exit) quick, and avoid keeping the door open to help retain heat inside the sauna. When in doubt about general sauna etiquette, just copy what other people in the sauna are doing, and don’t be afraid to ask questions."

Lay a clean towel on the bench before you sit, or spread it out if you'd like to lay across the sauna bench. Lying on the bench helps evenly distribute the heat along your body, but it may be most polite to simply sit if the sauna is crowded.

Never take your phone or tablet into the sauna. Minimize distractions or socialize with those around you!"

Avoid putting your clothes on right away, as they can make you overheat and begin sweating again."
