      "title": "Libra.",
      "content": "Libra. The connection between Gemini and Libra is immediate and strong. As fellow air signs, they have an innate understanding of the way the other thinks, and they'll be able to talk for hours about anything—which is all Gemini wants from a partner.

      "title": "Leo.",
      "content": "Leo. Love builds like an inferno between a fire sign and an air sign! Gemini can easily fall for Leo's confident, fun-loving personality. Similarly, Leo will adore Gemini's intelligence, wit, and natural charisma. Leo is a fixed sign, meaning they're stable and grounded. Gemini is mutable, making them flexible and comfortable with change. Leo can help Gemini establish routines, while Gemini's impulsive energy can ensure this pair never gets bored. An expert communicator like Gemini can give Leo all the praise they need, and Leo's positive, social nature will give Gemini the fun they seek."

      "title": "Aquarius.",
      "content": "Aquarius. Forward-thinking Aquarius will instantly impress an intelligent Gemini. Together, these two signs can comfortably share all of their wildest and most innovative ideas without fear of judgment. Gemini can bring out Aquarius's fun-loving side, and Aquarius can help Gemini make their dreams a reality. Romance is neither sign's strong suit, but a strong friendship can quickly lead to more for Gemini and Aquarius. Both signs have an intense craving for independence, so they can happily coexist without making each other feel pressure to commit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aries.",
      "content": "Aries. An Aries will be attracted to Gemini's top-notch communication skills and intellect. At the same time, Gemini will appreciate Aries' ability to take charge since Gemini changes their mind so often! A Gemini-Aries couple will move fast, spend time among large groups of friends, and live for spontaneous adventures. Gemini and Aries share playful and childlike energy, so they'll never stop having fun together."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Sagittarius. Sagittarius is opposite Gemini on the zodiac—and in this case, opposites definitely attract. Sagittarius and Gemini are fiercely independent and always looking to learn something new. Sagittarius is passionate and philosophical compared to Gemini's lighter approach, but as long as they learn to communicate respectfully, this will be a great match."

    {
      "title": "Gemini.",
      "content": "Gemini. Two Geminis can understand each other like nobody else. They'll have similar communication styles and approaches to romance, so misunderstandings will be few and far between! However, Geminis can be indecisive and slow to commit, so too much of a good thing could mean that this couple will struggle to make progress in their relationship. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Scorpio.",
      "content": "Scorpio. On the surface, Scorpio and Gemini don't appear to have much in common. And in some ways, they don't; it can be difficult for a free-spirited Gemini to communicate with a rigid and stoic Scorpio. Still, they can make a powerful pair if they learn to work with their differences. Gemini will have a unique appreciation for Scorpio's brand of humor, and clever Scorpio can sate Gemini's passion for intellectual debates. It’s also important that Gemini demonstrate their trustworthiness and honesty in this relationship, since Scorpios are so slow to trust others and value the truth above all else. Reader Poll: We asked 637 wikiHow readers with the Scorpio zodiac sign, and 67% of them agreed that their biggest deal breaker is someone who lies . [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Taurus.",
      "content": "Taurus. This pair will have to do some work to build a happy relationship. As a fixed sign, Taurus is slow-moving, stubborn, and content to stay in their comfort zone. On the other hand, Gemini is fast-paced and always looking for the next new experience. They'll be attracted to each others' natural optimism, but they'll need to find a happy medium between freedom for Gemini and stability for Taurus to make the attraction last."
    },
    {
      "title": "Virgo.",
      "content": "Virgo. Both signs are ruled by Mercury but have very different values. Gemini has a deep-seated need for freedom, and Virgo might struggle to accommodate that need. Virgo wants stability and a reliable partner, which Gemini might not be able to provide. Their strong suit is communication, but it will be difficult to connect with such different outlooks on life."

    {
      "title": "Pisces.",
      "content": "Pisces. While Gemini can blend well with some mutable signs (Sagittarius and other Geminis), Gemini and Pisces are highly indecisive and have little in common. They struggle to connect emotionally, mainly because dreamy Pisces is all about the imagination, and intellectual Gemini is more logical. It'll take them a long time to make up their minds about the relationship—if they ever do."
    },
    {
      "title": "Capricorn.",
      "content": "Capricorn. These two signs have a vastly different approach to life. Capricorn is all ambition, structure, and hard work, while Gemini is flexible and playful. This pair works if both are open to compromise; Gemini can help Capricorn loosen up, and Capricorn can give Gemini structure to accomplish their goals. Still, Capricorn might be aggravated by carefree Gemini, and Capricorn's rigidity could put Gemini to sleep."

    {
      "title": "Cancer.",
      "content": "Cancer. The connection between Cancer and Gemini can be hard to maintain since Gemini thinks with their head and Cancer thinks with their heart. These signs rarely see eye to eye, and Gemini will have trouble dealing with Cancer's extreme sensitivity while Cancer will be hurt by Gemini's need for freedom and personal space. Cancer's craving for stability and comfort may end up boring a Gemini! [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Communicate with your Gemini regularly.",
      "content": "Communicate with your Gemini regularly. This social and expressive sign needs to feel intellectually engaged with a partner. If you tend to hold back in conversations or dislike debate, practice sharing more little by little. As long as you're both respectful, Geminis love a good debate—it's exciting and interesting to them! Don't worry about alienating a Gemini; they'll love seeing you open up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be flexible and easygoing.",
      "content": "Be flexible and easygoing. A Gemini does what feels right at that moment, which means they'll change their minds often. It's okay to make concrete plans (fixed and cardinal signs like Aries and Aquarius are near-perfect matches for Gemini, after all), but learn to roll with Gemini's changeable moods too. Expect the unexpected, and try to compromise when they suggest a new activity half an hour before your next date."

    {
      "title": "Trust your Gemini and let them have independence.",
      "content": "Trust your Gemini and let them have independence. Geminis are flirtatious, social, and take time to commit. [4] X Research source This won't change when Gemini falls in love; they'll be loyal to you, but they'll still need to spend lots of time with other friends too. Respect Gemini's need for space, and communicate your needs to them so that the two of you can find a balance that you'll both be comfortable with."
