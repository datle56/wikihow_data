      "title": "It might have root rot.",
      "content": "It might have root rot. Root rot can happen from overwatering, which causes the roots of your plant to get soggy and start dying. If your plant starts to stink and looks like it’s wilting, check the soil. If the soil is damp or soggy, you might be smelling root rot. [1] X Research source If your aloe plant didn’t stink before but it does now, it’s probably root rot."

      "title": "It could just be aloe’s natural smell.",
      "content": "It could just be aloe’s natural smell. Aloe is in the same family as onions and chives, so it can have a very similar smell. Some plant enthusiasts find aloe smell to be off-putting, especially when you cut a leaf off. Many people describe aloe as having a pungent, oniony smell that isn’t pleasant. [2] X Research source If your aloe plant has always had a stinky odor, it might just be its natural scent. Cutting leaves closer to the center of the plant can help reduce the smell somewhat."

      "title": "Yes, if you put it next to pungent flowers.",
      "content": "Yes, if you put it next to pungent flowers. If your natural aloe plant’s smell is the problem, unfortunately, there’s no way to get rid of it. However, if you place your aloe plant next to a bouquet of strong-smelling flowers, you might be able to mask the scent a little bit. Go for magnolia, gardenia, wisteria, or honeysuckle to overpower the natural onion smell of aloe vera. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "It could have pale or yellow leaves.",
      "content": "It could have pale or yellow leaves. Normally, aloe vera has bright green leaves that stand up straight. If your leaves are turning pale or going yellow, too much water could be an issue. [4] X Research source Pale and yellow leaves can also be a sign that your aloe plant isn’t getting enough light."

    {
      "title": "It might have brown, mushy leaves.",
      "content": "It might have brown, mushy leaves. Aloe vera plants store water in their leaves, so it’s easy to tell when they have too much. If your aloe plant is starting to rot because of overwatering, the leaves will turn brown and be mushy to the touch. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They are usually soft and brown.",
      "content": "They are usually soft and brown. Normal roots are usually white or tan, and they’re more stringy than they are soft. Rotting roots will be mushy, dark brown, and might even fall apart in your hand. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Once every couple of weeks.",
      "content": "Once every couple of weeks. Aloe vera is a drought-tolerant plant, meaning it needs very little water to survive. Wait until the soil dries out completely before you water it again—otherwise, you might overwater it, which can lead to a rotting plant. [7] X Research source Make sure you pot your aloe plant in a pot that has a drainage hole, too. That way, any excess water can drain out of the bottom instead of soaking the roots."

    {
      "title": "Yes, if you dig up the plant and let it dry out.",
      "content": "Yes, if you dig up the plant and let it dry out. Once you notice that your aloe vera plant is rotting, use a spade to gently dig it out of the pot and set it on a paper towel. Leave it to dry out for a day or two, then replant it in a new pot with fresh soil. [8] X Research source Root rot is caused by a fungus that can spread to other plants. If you use any tools on your rotting aloe, be sure to disinfect them before you use them again. [9] X Research source Although root rot is caused by a fungus, experts don’t recommend using anti-fungal products on your houseplants. While they might protect a little bit against root rot, these products can be expensive, and some aren’t available to use unless you’re a farmer or agriculture worker."

      "title": "Yes, especially if they’re mushy.",
      "content": "Yes, especially if they’re mushy. Use a pair of pruners (or even just scissors) and cut the leaves off your aloe plant. Since the leaves are rotting, the aloe inside probably won’t be super fresh, so you can simply throw them away. [10] X Research source If you’re taking your plant out of the pot to dry out for a few days, remove any brown or mushy leaves at the same time. Aesthetically, it is better to cut an entire leaf at a time instead of leaving half of it sticking around.

If the leaves ever start to droop or change color, that’s when you know your plant has an issue.
