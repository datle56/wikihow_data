      "content": "Identify the symptoms of jock itch. The groin, inner thighs, and buttocks are the most common areas affected by jock itch since the region is prone to dampness which help the responsible bacteria and fungi to spread. While you can treat most cases of jock itch at home, you should still see your doctor for an official diagnosis, as well as testing to determine the cause (whether a fungus or bacteria) since this can alter the treatment method. The symptoms of jock itch usually include: [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Itching, redness, or scaling of the skin in ring or half-moon shapes Burning sensations Pain (usually bacterial infection) Blistering along the edge of the rash"

      "content": "Keep the area dry. Excess moisture forms a breeding ground for the bacteria and fungi that can cause jock itch. Dry your groin completely after each time you wash the area, and make sure you dry any excess sweat in the area throughout the day as well. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Change out of gym clothes immediately and wash them between uses to help prevent jock itch. Looser-fitting cotton underwear will help reduce excess sweating, and it will also allow sweat to dry faster. Change your towel every day while treating your jock itch, and do not share towels with anyone. You can use a powder like Gold Bond to keep the area dry."

Aluminum salt solutions, such as aluminum chloride 10% soIution or aluminium acetate, are effective antiperspirants because they form plugs on the sweat glands. To use this mixture: [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Mix one part aluminum salt with 20 parts water. Apply this solution to the infected area and leave it on for six to eight hours. It is best to apply it at night because that is when your sweat glands are least active.

You can: Dip gauze or a washcloth in diluted white vinegar (one part vinegar to four parts water). Hold it against the infection twice a day. Once you remove the cloth, pat the skin dry but do not rub it too hard or the infection could scab over. Pour 1/4 cup of bleach (such as Clorox) into a bathtub full of water and soak in it daily or every other day for minor cases. Ensure that you thoroughly dry the skin when you get out. Apply a 0.6% ajoene gel. This extract comes from garlic and contains a natural antifungal compound. You can apply it twice daily for up to two weeks.

If the condition doesn’t improve within two weeks of home treatments, then you either require a prescription-strength antifungal option, or it may be possible that your jock itch is bacterial instead of fungal. Your doctor will also be able to prescribe antibiotics if this is the case. Your doctor will likely swab the affected area and send the swab to a lab for a culture. This skin culture will help your doctor determine whether the jock itch is indeed fungal or caused by bacteria (commonly staphylococcus).
