      "content": "Consult a doctor or pediatrician before switching formulas. You should always talk with your doctor before switching formulas. This includes if you are switching for dietary or financial reasons. Your doctor will be able to recommend a formula suitable for your baby and can help you with the transition to a new formula. [1] X Research source If your baby gets hives, a rash, redness, or vomits forcefully after drinking formula, they may have a true allergy to the milk or soy protein found within the formula. Your doctor or pediatrician may also recommend switching formulas for dietary reasons or due to poor weight gain. For example, your baby may need more iron in their diet and, therefore, an iron-fortified formula may be best. Certain formulas may also be recommended for babies with severe acid reflux. If the doctor does not suspect a true medical problem; however, they may be able to recommend a brand or formula that can improve other health symptoms, such as fussiness, gas, and difficulty pooping."

    {
      "title": "Consider a new formula with the same protein type.",
      "content": "Consider a new formula with the same protein type. It will be easiest on your baby’s digestive system to stick with the same protein type when switching formulas. If you have decided to try a new brand for cost rather than medical reasons, this should be relatively easy. For example, if your baby's current formula uses cows' milk as the protein type, then you should choose a new less expensive formula that also uses a similar ratio of cows' milk. If the protein in the initial formula was hydrolyzed or partially hydrolyzed, keep this consistent in the new formula. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Choose a formula with a different protein for digestive intolerances.",
      "content": "Choose a formula with a different protein for digestive intolerances. If you are switching formulas because your baby has a digestive intolerance, you will need to choose a formula with a different protein type. See which new formula your doctor thinks will help your baby's digestion. [3] X Research source Your doctor may recommend that you try a soy-based formula instead of a cows' milk formula to treat a casein intolerance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Read the formula labels.",
      "content": "Read the formula labels. If your baby was previously drinking a formula with iron, DHA, or other additives, consider selecting another formula with those characteristics. Reading the label will also help you understand the ingredients and you can avoid any ingredients that may cause an allergic reaction in your baby."

    {
      "title": "Switch formula immediately if you are using the same protein.",
      "content": "Switch formula immediately if you are using the same protein. In some instances, your baby will be able to switch formulas relatively easily and will not fuss about a new type of formula. Try giving your baby a little bit of the new formula to see how they react. If there is no issue, then you can switch to the new formula immediately. [4] X Research source If the baby fusses after trying the new formula, wait a few minutes and try again. Don't offer the baby any alternatives, and don't give them the old formula again. Similarly, if your baby is allergic to their old formula, you may need to switch completely to the new formula with no period of transition."

      "title": "Transition gradually to a new formula if you are changing the main protein.",
      "content": "Transition gradually to a new formula if you are changing the main protein. In some cases, your baby may be a little fussy about the taste of the new formula. In these instances, switch formulas gradually. This will mask the flavour of the new formula and make the transition easier. [5] X Research source Begin the transition by giving your baby ¾ of the old formula and ¼ of the new formula. Feed your baby this mixture for one day. Then, try half of the old formula with half of the new formula and feed your baby this mixture for one day."

    {
      "title": "Increase the ration of new formula to old formula.",
      "content": "Increase the ration of new formula to old formula. Continue to increase the ratio of new formula to old formula each day. For example, on the third day feed your baby a mixture of ¼ of the old formula with ¾ of the new formula and on the fourth day give your baby 100% of the new formula. [6] X Research source By this point your baby should expect the flavour of the new formula."

      "content": "Weigh the baby periodically. Make sure that they're reaching a healthy weight on the new formula. Either use a scale at home or take the baby to the doctor. It is normal for most babies to double their birth weight by 5 months, but you should talk to your doctor about what is a healthy development for your baby.

      "title": "Watch for digestive problems.",
      "content": "Watch for digestive problems. While transitioning from one formula to another, monitor your baby. Watch for persistent vomiting, diarrhea, excessive gas, or constipation. These are all signs that your baby may be experiencing an allergic reaction. Allergic reactions differ from normal digestive irritation because they are chronic and may impact your baby's ability to gain weight. [8] X Research source For instance, acute diarrhea and gas is common among babies, but chronic diarrhea or constipation often means the child has an intolerance. [9] X Research source If you believe your baby has an allergy to the new formula, seek medical attention immediately."
