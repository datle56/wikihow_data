If you aren’t sure, talk to your imam. [6] X Research source Women can wear any color of garment, though simple clothes are usually preferred. Many women choose to wear a black or white loose robe. Note: Women are prohibited from covering their face or hands while in the state of Ihram. So, you aren’t allowed to wear a niqab, burqa, or gloves. However, you can hang a veil or cloth over your face as long as it doesn’t touch it. Many women also wear dark sunglasses.

Talk to your imam as you’re making your pilgrimage preparations to know exactly when you should begin Ihram. [8] X Research source Traditionally, you have to enter into Ihram before you go through the Miqat, which is a boundary point outside of the Hajj/Umrah area. There are 5 Miqat that circle around Mecca. If you are already in Saudi Arabia, most planes, buses, and private vehicles entering the Hajj/Umrah area inform you when it is time to enter the state of Ihram."

Each cloth should be wide enough to cover the area between the top of your navel and the tops of your feet, and long enough to wrap all the way around your body without any skin visible. This is important, since you can’t wear underwear with Ihram! The rules for women’s Ihram are variable , but many groups allow women to use the same 2 cloths men do, except women can have stitching. Women’s cloths should be wide enough to reach from the armpit to the tops of the feet, and long enough to wrap all the way around the body. Men can’t pin or sew Ihram cloths in place, so make sure you have a belt or clips to keep yourself dressed. Sandals are the only permitted shoes to wear with Ihram. You can use any sandals, including flip-flops, as long as the tops of your feet are visible. Some groups believe that women may wear socks with their sandals. You can bring a small bag to carry necessities, as long as it isn’t pinned to your clothes."

I intend to perform Umrah. Please make it easy for me and accept it from me. Amen.” or “O Allah, I intend to perform Umrah.” If you’re performing Hajj , specify which type of Hajj you’re making (i.e., Tamattu, Ifrad, or Qiran).
