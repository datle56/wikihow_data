      "content": "You may just feel it when they’re around. If you walk into a place where your loved one spent a lot of time in life—such as their house or their favorite restaurant—you may feel their presence. You might also experience this sensation when visiting their gravesite. You might not be able to see them, feel them, or hear them, but you just somehow know they’re there, and they’re watching out for you. [1] X Research source Their presence may linger in places that were familiar and comfortable to them when they were alive. They may show up in times of trouble to offer you support or guidance. For instance, if you receive alarming medical news from your doctor, or if you undergo a painful breakup, you might sense their presence protecting and comforting you. They may also be nearby during celebratory moments to cheer you on, like at your graduation or on your birthday. They’re not missing out on your milestones, even if they’re not physically there!"

      "title": "Your loved one may leave you a particular sign of their presence.",
      "content": "Your loved one may leave you a particular sign of their presence. Some people believe the dead communicate by leaving small signs that they’re nearby or that they’ve passed over into heaven peacefully. These signs might be unique to the dead, or they may be common signs angels leave behind to help their surviving friends and family cope with their loss. Certain animals, like butterflies, cardinals, and blue jays, are believed to be signs the dead are nearby. If you see any of these animals, your loved one may be sending you love and peace. Specific signs that your loved one is visiting might include things they loved in real life. For example, if your mother always loved daffodils, you may see daffodils growing in your yard after she passes and know she’s near."

      "title": "Your loved ones may send you messages through number patterns.",
      "content": "Your loved ones may send you messages through number patterns. Maybe you've noticed a certain number or series of numbers popping up everywhere you look lately. The numbers might even be connected to your loved one somehow: for example, if your deceased sister's jersey number was 55, you may see the number \"55\" everywhere. Many people refer to series of inexplicably recurring numbers as \"angel numbers\" and believe that their guardian angels or the spirits of deceased loved ones are using the numbers to send them messages or to say hello. If you're thinking about a loved one who has passed away and then you see \"their\" number, you can take heart and know they're watching you. For example, if their phone number ended in 1147, you might notice the time on the clock reads 11:47. Your loved one may also show you common angel numbers that aren't specifically relevant to them, but that carry their own innate significance: for instance, the angel number 6666 is generally believed to encourage self-trust and overcoming obstacles."

      "content": "You may get a whiff of your deceased loved one’s scent. Perhaps it’s the perfume your grandmother always wore, or maybe you inexplicably smell your great-uncle’s famous apple pie when you walk in his house after his passing. Some people believe the dead send their signature scents to us as small signs they’re still nearby. Of all our senses, our sense of smell is the most powerful tool we have for eliciting memories. [2] X Research source It’s no wonder the dead may use it to reach out and remind us they’re still with us."

      "content": "Your loved ones may still speak to you even after they’re gone. You might hear your father call out to you in his familiar booming voice, or maybe you hear your grandmother singing the lullaby she always sang to rock you to sleep when you were a child. Many people have reported hearing their loved ones’ voices after they’ve passed on. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It’s possible the dead may speak to comfort you or to let you know they’re OK in the afterlife. You may not only hear their voice, but their footsteps or knocks at the door. Some deceased people speak in words, and others communicate by making sounds. If you hear your loved one speaking, try to speak back. Even if you don’t hear them, speaking to the dead can bring about peace and healing."

[4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Usually, the deceased person will be alive and will figure prominently in your dream.

They might continue to appear throughout your life at significant moments, when you’re in need of guidance or support."

      "content": "If your loved one is nearby, you may physically feel their touch. Maybe you felt a hand resting comfortingly on your head, the way your mother did when she was alive, or maybe you felt someone hugging you like your husband used to. The dead may not always appear in corporeal form, but many people have claimed to experience their deceased loved ones touching them the way they used to in life. They might touch you to remind you they’re still nearby, and that the connection you had when they were alive isn’t really gone."

      "content": "The dead may reveal themselves via flickering lights or static on the TV. Lots of people believe that unexplained electrical activity is a sign a deceased person is nearby. The deceased one’s energy may interrupt the electrical field, or they may intentionally turn the lights, the radio, or what have you on or off to let you know they’re nearby. If you experience unexplained electrical phenomena in your house or your loved one’s home, they may be reaching out to you from the beyond. [5] X Research source If you didn’t experience the same electrical activity before they passed, it could mean they’re causing it—especially if they turn the radio on to their favorite song, or turn the TV on to the show you always watched together."

      "content": "Some people believe the dead can reach out over the telephone. You may remember the famous Twilight Zone episode in which a young boy is able to speak to his deceased grandmother over the phone. Some people believe this phenomenon isn’t limited to science fiction, but that it could actually occur in real life. If you've ever picked up the phone only to hear static, it may be your loved one trying to communicate from the afterlife. Even if you don’t experience this sign of your loved one’s presence, many people find comfort in calling their loved one and leaving a voicemail message to them, or texting them to say goodbye. The dead may not speak directly, but they may still receive your message of love."

      "content": "The dead have been believed to move things—or even take them. Some people report losing or finding objects after a loved one dies, and it’s believed the deceased person may have moved the item! They might move items to show you they’re still there or to playfully tease you, or they may steal an item if they were particularly attached to it in real life. For instance, if you keep misplacing your deceased aunt’s cherished bracelet, it’s possible her spirit is responsible! Despite no longer being corporeal, she may still want to keep her jewelry for herself. Most people report noticing an item has moved without them noticing, but some people claim to have witnessed items moving on their own."
