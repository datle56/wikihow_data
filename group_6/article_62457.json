      "content": "An obstructed air vent means your computer can't cool itself down. That makes the fan run, as it's trying to cool off your computer. Using your computer on a soft surface like a pillow, blanket, or a bed can block the vent. [1] X Research source Working on your computer while it rests on an uneven surface, like a pile of books on your desk, can also block your computer's air vent. [2] X Research source To make the fan stop running, switch to working on a flat surface like a table or a countertop. This will give the vent room to breathe. Vents are usually located on the back edge or the sides of the computer. Keep these areas clear to protect them and prevent them from getting blocked. [3] X Research source"

If you haven't cleaned your computer in a while (it's easy to forget to do this), this might be what's causing your fan to work extra hard. Thankfully, this is a common problem with an easy solution. [4] X Research source Purchase a can of compressed air online or at an office supply store. Then, point it in the direction of your computer's vents (usually located on the back of the computer, the bottom of the computer, or on the sides) and spray the air to get rid of the dust.

Any games that use VR technology or heavily detailed animation can be hard on your computer's processor. [6] X Research source To stop the fan, close out of your game and take a break. Your fan will stop running once your computer cools off, and this will expedite that process."

Thankfully, this particular problem is temporary. [7] X Research source Wait for the computer to finish compressing the file and give it a few minutes after, too. Your fan should stop running after some time. If the fan still won't stop after that, it might be due to another reason."

A computer is never supposed to surpass 158 째F (70 째C). If it has or is starting to get close to that temperature, your fan might start working overtime to bring it down. [14] X Research source To stop the fan (and cool down your computer) take it to a cooler space. You might try going to an air-conditioned room or stepping inside with your computer if you've been working outside. Try not to bring your computer anywhere that's hotter than 95 째F (35 째C). [15] X Research source Consider downloading an app that can detect your computer's temperature. For PCs, try Speccy. [16] X Research source For Macs, you might try iStat Pro. [17] X Research source"
