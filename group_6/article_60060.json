      "title": "Set your washing machine to hot.",
      "content": "Set your washing machine to hot. When an item of clothing is exposed to heat, it allows the fibers to relax and shorten. This will result in shrinkage. Cotton and polyester are both durable fabrics than can withstand the hottest setting on the washing machine. If you are washing a cotton dress, check to see if it is made from pre-washed fabric. If so, it’s been pre-shrunk by the manufacturer and will not shrink further in the wash."

      "title": "Wash the dress using the longest wash cycle available.",
      "content": "Wash the dress using the longest wash cycle available. The longer the cycle, the more shrinkage will occur. Along with heat, the tumbling action of the washing machine causes the fibers in the fabric to move closer together and make your dress smaller. [1] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Green Cleaning Expert Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. You can throw other clothing items into the wash with your dress, but make sure they are all of similar colors.

      "content": "Dry your dress on the hottest dryer setting. Move your dress into the dryer and select the longest, hottest cycle. Like the washing machine, additional heat and tumbling action will help shrink your dress even further. [3] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Green Cleaning Expert Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. Make sure to transfer your dress from the washing machine to the dryer as quickly as possible. Letting it sit and cool will make it less likely to shrink."

      "content": "Check the size of your dress throughout the dryer cycle if it’s cotton. Shrinking an item of clothing in the dryer is not an exact science. Your cotton dress may get smaller than you intended if you don’t keep an eye on it. Stop the dryer every 10 or 15 minutes to check your dress. Once it’s reached the size you want, adjust the dryer to low heat and let it complete the cycle. You can also remove the dress from the dryer once it’s the desired size and let it finish air drying on a hanger or a drying rack."

      "title": "Repeat the process if you are shrinking a polyester dress.",
      "content": "Repeat the process if you are shrinking a polyester dress. Polyester is a synthetic fabric and is much more difficult to shrink than cotton. You may have to wash and dry it on high heat 2 or 3 times to see results. [4] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Green Cleaning Expert Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. It's also a very durable fabric, so washing and drying it several times shouldn't harm your polyester dress."

      "content": "Fill a sink with lukewarm water and add several drops of soap. Use a gentle, non-alkaline soap and mix it into the water with your hands. You can also use a plastic bucket or tub that’s big enough to fully submerge the dress. [5] X Research source If you haven’t washed your dress before, test to see if it’s colorfast. Using a cotton ball, dab a small amount of water and detergent onto the inside seam of the dress to see if the color bleeds. If the color stays put, you can continue hand washing your dress."

      "title": "Soak the dress for no more than 5 minutes, then drain the sink.",
      "content": "Soak the dress for no more than 5 minutes, then drain the sink. Place the dress in the sink full of water and hold it down until it’s fully submerged. Allow it to soak for several minutes to allow any dirt or odors to loosen. Do not let your dress soak for any more than 5 minutes.

Use your hand to gently swirl the dress through the water and vinegar mixture. [7] X Research source Once the dress has been thoroughly rinsed in the diluted vinegar, drain the sink again."

      "content": "Air-dry the silk dress in the sun. Make sure your dress is laid flat to dry on a clean surface that won’t stain the clean silk. The gentle heat from the sun will begin to shrink the fibers of the silk fabric. If it’s a hot day, you may not even need to place the silk directly in the sun. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Set your dryer to medium heat.",
      "content": "Set your dryer to medium heat. Since silk is a much more delicate fabric than cotton or wool, it’s best to use a lower setting on your dryer when attempting to shrink a silk dress. You could dry other items in the same load, but make sure they are similarly colored. Also double-check to make sure that none of the other clothes you’re drying feature zippers or other sharp edges that could damage the silk."

      "content": "Dry the silk dress for 5 minutes, then remove it and check its size. It’s important that you check the dress periodically to prevent it from over-shrinking. Stop the dryer after 5 minutes and pull out the dress to assess its size. Since silk is so delicate, it may have shrunk enough after just one 5-minute period."

      "content": "Continue drying in 5-minute intervals until it's shrunk to your liking. If you want to shrink the dress further, throw it back in the dryer and continue to check its size every 5 minutes. When it has reached the ideal proportions, remove it completely from the dryer. Then, hang your dress up on a hanger to keep it from getting wrinkled."

If you pull you dress out of the dryer during one of the regular checks and it’s already too small, there’s a chance you can reshape it.
