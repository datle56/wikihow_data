      "content": "“Mid” can mean mediocre and is often used as an insult on Tiktok. The slang term “mid” actually came from a viral clip of pro wrestler Jacob Friedman describing the crowd at a wrestling match as “mid” because they were in the Midwest. Ever since, “mid” has become an increasingly popular way to describe or even insult things or people that just aren’t that exciting. [1] X Research source “I don’t know, I think that band is kind of mid. Just not my cup of tea.” “Ya, I know you love that team, but I think they’re mid. What can I say? I’m a 49ers fan 😉”"

      "content": "“Mid” is often used to describe something underwhelming over text. Think of “mid” like a shrug or an eye roll. Whether something’s been overhyped, or you just didn’t like something or someone as much as you thought you would, “mid” is a fun term that perfectly sums up something “meh.” “I’m never listening to reviews again. That shake was totally mid 😐” “Everyone’s so hyped up about that new mascara, but I thought it was mid. Not impressed.”"

      "content": "Say “mid” to subtly express that you don’t like something or someone. If you don’t vibe with someone, or something just isn’t your scene, you can use “mid” to subtly dismiss the subject of your disapproval. Just remember to be respectful, and try not to hurt anyone’s feelings. “Don’t repeat this, but I think Jesse is kind of mid. He never makes an effort to acknowledge me when he comes over 😤” \"I hate to say it, but the dinner Lena made last night was mid. She wanted me to have seconds, but I couldn't do it.\""
