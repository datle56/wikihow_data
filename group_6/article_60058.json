      "title": "Place your garment in a pillowcase before washing.",
      "content": "Place your garment in a pillowcase before washing. Wool is a very delicate material. Agitation will cause it to shrink, but if it gets roughly twisted while in the washing machine, it could be permanently damaged. Place your wool garment in a pillowcase or mesh bag and knot the top before putting it in the machine in order to protect it while it’s being washed. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash using high heat and a short, gentle cycle.",
      "content": "Wash using high heat and a short, gentle cycle. Wool fibers have microscopic scales that “lock” on to one another when vigorously handled or exposed to high temperatures. [2] X Research source This “locking” is what causes woolen fabrics to shrink under while swirling around in a warm washing machine. Using a short, gentle cycle will prevent excessive shrinkage or damage. [3] X Research source Use a small amount of gentle, bleach-free detergent. [4] X Research source Check on your garment every few minutes by stopping the cycle and pulling it out – it may shrink more quickly than you expected. If so, you’ll want to pull it out before the cycle is over. [5] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Green Cleaning Expert Expert Interview. 8 November 2019."

      "content": "Lay the garment on a flat surface to dry. If your garment has shrunk to the correct size, carefully lay it on a flat surface, smoothing out any wrinkles or folds. The wool fibers can still be altered while wet, so don’t wring or hang your garment – you could risk stretching it out or damaging it. [6] X Research source"

[7] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Green Cleaning Expert Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. Use a short cycle and low heat, and continue to pause the cycle and check on the garment periodically to make sure it doesn’t shrink too much. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Spritz your wool with a light mist of water.",
      "content": "Spritz your wool with a light mist of water. If you want to shrink your garment only a slight amount, use a spray bottle filled with water to dampen the fabric (but not soak it) before putting it in the dryer. [9] X Research source Make sure the water is lukewarm. Spraying your garment with water that’s too hot could cause it to shrink to a smaller size than you intended. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Put your dampened wool garment in the dryer.",
      "content": "Put your dampened wool garment in the dryer. Use a short cycle and low heat, because intense agitation and high temperatures can cause wool to shrink quickly. Drying the wool for a short period of time at a lower temperature will prevent it from shrinking too much. [11] X Research source Once again, check on it every few minutes – you can pull it out if it’s shrinking too quickly. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove your garment from the dryer once it has shrunk to the desired size.",
      "content": "Remove your garment from the dryer once it has shrunk to the desired size. Try it on to ensure that it fits. If it does, great! It’s ready to wear. If not, spritz it with water again and put it in the dryer for another short, gentle cycle, continuing to check on it every few minutes."

      "title": "Submerge and gently swirl the garment in the water.",
      "content": "Submerge and gently swirl the garment in the water. After you place your garment in the warm water mixture, swirl it slowly and carefully beneath the surface of the water, once every 2-3 minutes. This gentle motion will encourage the fibers to shrink. Avoid twisting or bunching the fabric while swirling - it could lead to permanent damage."

    {
      "title": "Monitor the garment’s shrinking progress.",
      "content": "Monitor the garment’s shrinking progress. Each time you swirl the garment in the water, pull it out briefly evaluate how much it has shrunk. This is important to ensure that it ends up shrinking to the desired size – wool can often shrink faster than you expect it to. [14] X Research source When you feel it has shrunk enough, it will be time to remove it from the water. Your garment should be submerged for between 5 and 10 minutes overall."

    {
      "title": "Remove and dry the garment.",
      "content": "Remove and dry the garment. When you pull the soaked garment out of the water, lay it flat and blot it with an absorbent towel. Alternatively, you can press the flattened garment against a nearby wall to squeeze the water out. [15] X Research source Again, be sure not to twist or bunch the garment while you’re drying it. This could damage it or reshape differently than you had originally intended."

    {
      "title": "Reshape the garment.",
      "content": "Reshape the garment. Push the wool fibers together by pressing your fingers inward and toward each other. This will tighten the fabric and make sure any shrinkage that occurred while it was soaking in water becomes permanent. [16] X Research source If there is a specific part of the garment you want to shrink, push the fabric inward in that area only. If you want to shrink the entire sweater, repeat this action across its entire surface area."

      "content": "Target specific areas of the garment using a hair dryer, if desired. Using a hair dryer can speed and intensify shrinkage in specific areas. If you’re attempting to shrink a certain part of the garment – such as stretched-out sweater cuffs – reshape them by pressing your fingers inward to reduce them to the desired size. Then, turn on high heat and volume, and blow-dry the spot you wish to shrink until it is barely damp. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay the garment flat to allow it to dry.",
      "content": "Lay the garment flat to allow it to dry. Once you’re done reshaping the garment, lay it flat on a clean, dry surface, arranging it in its desired shape. Make sure the surface is out of the way of pets and children, and don’t hang your garment up – you could risk stretching it out again. [18] X Research source"
