      "content": "This water-earth sign pairing is a near-perfect match in the bedroom. Scorpio and Taurus’s sex life can be summed up in two words: “passion” and “sensuality.” Scorpio brings the passion since they’re ruled by the planet of desire, Mars. Meanwhile, Taurus is ruled by the planet of love, Venus, so they’re all about intensely intimate sex. Taurus and Scorpio are both fixed signs, so they might get stuck in a rut. Try switching things up from time to time, whether that means trying out new positions or toys. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "A Taurus certainly knows how to please another Taurus. Because of their earth-sign nature, Taurus is an incredibly physical, touchy-feely sign. Think lots of cuddling, foreplay, and pillow talk. Another Taurus will be able to match this steady sign’s pace and love of emotionally-intimate sex. Tauruses are ruled by their senses. Create an atmosphere of romance with scented candles, silky sheets, and seductive music."

      "content": "Taurus and Cancer will find stability and comfort in their sex life. Cancer’s water sign energy makes them crave closeness with their partner, and that carries over into the bedroom, too. Between the sheets, these two are all about tenderness and exploring each other’s bodies. Taurus will have no trouble fulfilling Cancer’s emotional and physical need for connection. As deeply domestic signs, these two might spoil each other with rich home-cooked meals and let their physical connection fizzle out. Go out for a romantic evening once a week to keep the spark alive."

      "title": "Libra and Taurus",
      "content": "Libra and Taurus are both ruled by Venus. Thanks to their planetary connection, their sexual compatibility is out of this world. They share a love of a romantic atmosphere (smooth jazz and candles galore), full-body massages, passionate kissing, and all things slow and sensual. Libra and Taurus can be passive signs so they might both struggle to initiate sex. Send your partner a racy text, ask them if they’re in the mood for sex, or seductively lead them into the bedroom."

      "content": "For Pisces and Taurus , sex is all about connection. Pisces , the deeply emotive water sign of the zodiac, will feel totally at ease with Taurus’ grounded yet sensitive energy. For these two, sex is a gentle, intuitive experience full of verbal and nonverbal communication. They’ll be whispering sweet-nothings until they fall asleep in each other’s arms. Ruled by dreamy Neptune, Pisces’ natural creativity will help Taurus expand their horizons. If you’re a Taurus, experiment with letting your Pisces partner take the lead."

      "title": "Virgo and Taurus",
      "content": "Virgo and Taurus can be a dynamic duo or a total disconnect. Analytical Virgo will adore the attention Taurus gives them in bed. But Virgo is ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication, so they sometimes say whatever comes to mind. Virgo’s tendency to criticize and correct might damage a vulnerable Taurus’ self-esteem. However, this pairing is ideal for first-time sexual experiences, since Virgo is the sign of virginity and Taurus is a patient, gentle sexual partner. For both of these signs, if you’d like your partner to do something different, try showing them what you like rather than actively criticizing. That’ll prevent Virgos from jumping into an ultra-analytical mode and it’ll protect Taurus’ pride."

      "content": "Taurus and Capricorn take pretty different approaches to sex. Capricorns tend to have a practical, casual attitude towards intimacy. They’re more of a one-night stand kind of sign.

Taurus and Capricorn will need to build an emotional connection before sex in order for Taurus to feel satisfied."

      "title": "Aries and Taurus will have trouble finding a good rhythm together.",
      "content": "Aries and Taurus will have trouble finding a good rhythm together. The fiery ram of the zodiac likes to jump straight into the main event, while Taurus prefers taking intimacy at a slower pace. While these two signs’ intense emotions might lead to a whirlwind hookup, they’re not likely to satisfy each other in the long run. However, Aries’ ruling planet Mars and Taurus’ ruling planet Venus will make this match full of passion. The key for this pair is to give and take. Aries will want to take the lead, but Taurus, don’t be afraid to speak up and let your partner know exactly what you want."

      "content": "​​Taurus loves stability while Sagittarius loves novelty. These two have pretty opposite desires between the sheets. Taurus likes to stick with the same sexual routine while Sagittarius will want to spice things up. Taurus is a fixed sign, so they’ll have trouble adjusting mutable Sagittarius’ constant need for adventure in the bedroom. Sagittarius should focus on spending quality time with their partner rather than going for wild, spontaneous sex. In turn, Taurus can agree to shake things up once in a while."

      "content": "Gemini is far more spontaneous than Taurus. Gemini will want their Taurus partner to speed things up in the bedroom, but the bull of the zodiac can’t be rushed. These two also have completely different turn-ons. Taurus is all about the physical world, while air sign Gemini will prefer dirty talk to heavy petting and romantic embraces. If you’re a Taurus, practice letting go of a bit of control and trusting your Gemini partner. Gemini, try not to rush or pressure your Taurus."

      "title": "Aquarians are usually too aloof to be good sexual partners for Tauruses.",
      "content": "Aquarians are usually too aloof to be good sexual partners for Tauruses. During sex, a Taurus’ senses completely take over and they’re all about living in the moment. In contrast, Aquarians often get stuck in their heads, over-intellectualizing relationships and sex. As a result, Taurus might feel disconnected from an Aquarius partner during intimacy. If you’re a Taurus, help your Aquarius partner learn to enjoy the present. Focus on sensory experiences like taking a relaxing shower together or trying out tantric breathing."
