      "title": "Feel the beat of the music.",
      "content": "Feel the beat of the music. Skanking falls strictly on the beat, so listen to the drums or bass to find the rhythm of the song. Start tapping your foot to warm up your body, and let the music guide you. If you're having trouble keeping up, take it slow and tap your foot half as many beats as before. [1] X Research source Good songs to ska to include \"Pressure Drop,\" by Toots & The Maytals, \"Skank by Numbers\" by Mustard Plug, and \"9mm and a Three Piece Suit\" by Streetlight Manifesto. Even if you aren't perfect, let go and lose yourself in the music. Skanking isn't about perfection!"

      "title": "Stand on one leg with your weight slightly forward.",
      "content": "Stand on one leg with your weight slightly forward. When you’re skanking, you'll have one foot on the floor at all times. Stand up on your dominant leg and raise your other foot off of the ground. Keep both of your knees slightly bent so you can move quickly, and lean forward to maintain your balance as you start moving. [2] X Research source Approach this step as if you’re about to do the running man ."

    {
      "title": "Bend your raised leg backwards from the knee.",
      "content": "Bend your raised leg backwards from the knee. While you’re standing on your dominant leg, move your other foot behind you, like you’re getting ready to kick a soccer ball. You want the sole of your shoe to practically touch your butt. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Kick your leg out in front of you in time with the song.",
      "content": "Kick your leg out in front of you in time with the song. When the beat drops, kick your leg out so it's fully extended in front of your body. This can be tricky to master at first, so start slowly or practice with a song that has a slower tempo. [4] X Research source If you’re still struggling to get the beat right, listen to the music carefully and try kicking in time with the drum."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hop onto your kicking leg while bringing your other leg back.",
      "content": "Hop onto your kicking leg while bringing your other leg back. After you’ve kicked your leg out, jump on your standing leg while simultaneously bringing your kicking leg to the floor. Basically, you’re switching positions so the leg that you were standing on is now bent behind you, and the leg that you kicked out is now supporting your body. [5] X Research source Remember to stay loose and with your knees slightly bent so that you can hop quickly. This is probably the hardest part of the dance, so practice at a slow tempo to work on transitioning your legs smoothly."

      "title": "Swing your arms along with your feet.",
      "content": "Swing your arms along with your feet. Bend your elbows and bundle both of your hands into fists, then throw your “opposite” arm forward in time with your legs. If you’re kicking your right leg out, for example, move your left arm forward and your right arm backward. Bring your elbow back to your waist, and repeat this swinging movement with the opposite arm. [6] X Research source Though this is the traditional way to move your arms, there’s no \"right\" way to ska. The only essential part is throwing the opposite arm forward when you kick your leg backward. Feel free to throw your arms up in the air, keep your elbows straight, or pump your hands."

      "title": "Skank in a group.",
      "content": "Skank in a group. Skanking is meant to be group dance, so have fun forming skank lines, skank circles, or taking your dance into a skank pit. Just make sure you don’t accidently kick someone when you bust a move! [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Speed up your skank.",
      "content": "Speed up your skank. Once you practice and get the basic skank down, get creative and make the dance your own. If you’re listening to an upbeat tune, add twice as many kicks to skank in “double time.” Reggae music is perfect if you want to speed up your skank, but feel free to slow things down with a relaxing song like “Easy Skanking” by Bob Marley."

    {
      "title": "Spin in place or move across the dance floor.",
      "content": "Spin in place or move across the dance floor. If you really want to let loose, move around the room as you skank or switch up your directions to keep things interesting. Instead of skanking in place, you could skank to one side, spin in a circle, then skank in the opposite direction—it’s totally up to you!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Switch up your style.",
      "content": "Switch up your style. There are so many styles of skanking, with each one following the same basic moves. Depending on the environment you’re in, match the energy of other people in the room and dance your heart out : [8] X Research source For a punk-inspired skank, punch your arms forward and backwards like you’re about to hit someone. For a reggae-inspired skank, sway your arms from side to side instead of moving them in opposite directions. For drum and bass (DnB) skanking, move your entire body up and down as you skank, especially after the beat drops."

    {
      "title": "Wear loose and comfortable clothes.",
      "content": "Wear loose and comfortable clothes. Choose a top that allows you to move and doesn’t restrict your arm movements. A basic white tank top, flannel, band tee, or checkered v-neck sweater aligns with the ska aesthetic, without inhibiting your moves. For pants, opt for slacks, skinny jeans (that aren’t too tight), or cuffed pants. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Put on shoes that have lots of traction.",
      "content": "Put on shoes that have lots of traction. Vans and Converse are classic ska shoes, but feel free to wear boots, loafers, or any other shoe that has laces. If you’re going to a concert, there’s a good chance that the floor will be wet from beer, so make sure your shoes have a good grip—you don’t want to slip while you’re dancing. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Throw on some ska-inspired accessories.",
      "content": "Throw on some ska-inspired accessories. Finish your look with checkered suspenders, a studded belt, or a funky hat. A fedora, houndstooth cap, pork pie hat, or bowler looks great with any outfit, but you can also rock a bandana if that matches your style more. [11] X Research source"
