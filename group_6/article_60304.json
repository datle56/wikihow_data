      "title": "Reach all your friends and family with reputable articles.",
      "content": "Reach all your friends and family with reputable articles. Look online for videos, news articles, and recent research about climate change from sources you trust, such as the EPA, the NOAA, or NASA. Post the links on your Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram feeds and encourage other people to share them as well. Since a lot of people get their information online, it’s a great way to draw the most attention to the problem. [1] X Research source If you can, look for video clips that are around 30–45 seconds long since people are more likely to watch something short than read an entire scientific article. You can also trust facts from academic institutions and journals since they have to go through many rounds of research. Always read through an article and check where it’s coming from before you post it so you don’t spread any misinformation ."

      "title": "Convince skeptical people with facts and data you’ve found.",
      "content": "Convince skeptical people with facts and data you’ve found. Read up on the most recent studies that you can find, and make sure they’re from reputable sources, such as a government climate site like the EPA or a science journal. When you’re talking to someone about climate change, focus your discussion on what’s backed up by science since it can be more convincing. Share where you got your information since people are more willing to believe and trust what you’re saying if they know it’s from someone reliable. [2] X Research source For example, you could say something like, “Did you know that Earth’s average temperature could rise by another 8.6°F in the next 100 years?” Some skeptics may not believe scientists or evidence. It might be better to focus your energy on talking to the people who believe in climate change instead of fighting with someone who doesn’t."

      "content": "Talk about the visible impacts if someone doesn’t see the big picture. Some people might not notice the effects of climate change and don’t understand how severe of a problem it is. Discuss the changes that have happened in your community due to climate change so they have a better idea of the problems. You can also cover how climate changes have affected a person’s interests, such as traveling or nature. For example, you could mention how new insect pests have moved into your area due to the changing climate of their normal habitat. As another example, if your friends want to visit Europe, you can mention how the rising sea levels have flooded Venice, Italy. [3] X Research source If the person loves plants and animals, bring up how 20–30% of species are at risk of extinction if temperatures keep rising. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Focus on how to solve issues to let someone know change is possible. Even though climate change is really scary and can feel inevitable, there are so many people fighting to improve our situation. Give the person hope by telling them about the steps communities and countries around the world are taking to help out. This can help the person realize that they aren’t powerless and they can work to fix the problems. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Resources Defence Council Multinational environmental advocacy group focused on grassroots activism and legislative action Go to source For example, you can bring up how countries are shifting to alternative energy sources, such as wind and solar power. You can also bring up initiatives that are happening around the globe, such as the Turn It Off campaign that asks people to turn off their vehicle’s engines instead of idling to reduce carbon emissions.

      "content": "Reach the people in your community with some simple signage. You can design your own poster or find a lot of premade ones online. Display some facts, images, or infographics on your poster that help you get your point across, such as predictions of the rising sea levels or melting glaciers. Hang the posters up in your community and in places that get a lot of foot traffic in your neighborhood. [9] X Research source For example, you might include facts like how the hottest days of the year will feel 10–15° hotter by 2100 if we continue creating emissions. [10] X Research source As another example, you can include pictures of endangered animals and write than 20–30% of wildlife species might go extinct if temperatures keep increasing. [11] X Research source Many climate change organizations have free images and graphics online that you can print off and use for your posters. Make sure you ask for permission before hanging up posters at businesses or schools since they may have different policies."

      "content": "Showcase the effects and images of climate change through your work. Art inspires so many people, so it might be a good way to show your concerns about climate change. You can make paintings, collages, photographs, sculptures, or whatever medium you think conveys your message the best. Write an artist’s statement about how climate change inspired your piece so someone viewing it knows exactly what you’re trying to portray. [12] X Research source For example, you can edit a photo to make a famous landmark look like it’s underwater due to rising sea levels. As another example, you can recycle pieces of trash or plastic to make a collage that shows how much someone throws away on a regular basis."

Do a lot of research so you find reliable sources, and put the information into your presentation. Include a few images and facts on each of your slides to keep anyone you’re presenting to involved and interested. [14] X Research source This is perfect if you’re in school and need to do a project for science or history. Keep your audience in mind when you’re making a presentation. If you’re presenting to younger kids, make sure you use simple issues they can relate to, such as how picking up litter keeps the playground clean and gets rid of harmful waste in the environment."
