      "title": "Find a long, sturdy piece of string.",
      "content": "Find a long, sturdy piece of string. You will need your string to be skinny enough to fit between the door and door frame, though you might be surprised at the thickness that can make it through the seam of your door. A shoelace is often convenient and is thick enough that it won't break while unlocking your car."

      "title": "Tie a slipknot in the middle of the string.",
      "content": "Tie a slipknot in the middle of the string. A slip knot, also referred to as a \"slip noose,\" is a sliding knot that will cinch tightly around the object it is fastened to when pulled. [1] X Research source This is ideal for unlocking your car, as you'll only need to lasso the lock and pull tight to fasten the knot around the lock."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make two loops.",
      "content": "Make two loops. Make a loop and hold the point where the string crosses itself at the base between your pointer finger and thumb. With the extra string make another loop, which you will also hold where crossed at its base with your pointer finger and thumb. [2] X Research source Then: Insert your second string into your first loop. Continue holding the crossed string at the base of your fist loop. Pull your second loop gently through the first, while releasing your hold on the crossed base of the second loop. Releasing the crossed base of the first loop while continuing to pull your second loop through."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tighten the knot.",
      "content": "Tighten the knot. To prevent your knot from coming loose while forcing it through the seam of your car door, you'll need to pull tightly on the strings leading into and out of the knot. While doing this, also pull outward on the remaining loop that you have pulled through your first loop. [3] X Research source Finish your slip knot by: Holding the string firmly where it feeds into your first loop and where it emerges from your second loop. Pull the loop and the start/end lines taut to tighten and finish your slip knot."

    {
      "title": "Work your way inside from the corner of the door.",
      "content": "Work your way inside from the corner of the door. The top corner of your door closest to the rear of your car is the ideal place for you to slide your string into your car. This can take some time and patience, but move the string back and forth along the seam of your door, much like a piece of floss, until your string has made it inside."

    {
      "title": "Pull gently on the door to relieve pressure.",
      "content": "Pull gently on the door to relieve pressure. This will make it much easier for you to maneuver your string once you have gotten it beyond the seam of the door. Depending on the strength of your string, you may be able to pull on its ends after getting it through the seam to apply outward pressure to the door. Once you do so: Get a finger-hold on the door, or have a friend do so, and pull lightly on it to relieve pressure and create a small gap between the door and car frame. Professional locksmiths often use a plastic tool to pry the door open slightly. A rubber wedge is then slid between the door and frame of the car and inflated to keep the door/door seal from getting in the way. [4] X Research source If you use a tool to try to pry your door free and make space for your string, this may cause damage to your paint or, if excessive force is used, could even damage your car door."

      "content": "Maneuver your slip knot into place. [5] X Research source Depending on the vehicle you are trying to regain entry into, your physical height, and the kind of string you are using, you may have to try various techniques to lasso your car lock. Some recommend pulling the knot along the surface the lock is on until the loop catches around the lock. Once you have lassoed the door lock, maintain even pressure on your string to tighten your slip knot around the lock. Loosening your grip might cause the knot to loosen, requiring you to lasso the lock again."

    {
      "title": "Pull the lock to the unlocked position.",
      "content": "Pull the lock to the unlocked position. Now that your slip knot is cinched tightly around the locking mechanism on the inside of your car, you should be able to disengage the lock by pulling upwards with even pressure. [6] X Research source Remember to use steady pressure; a loose line can slip easily off the lock."
