Thread the laces through the bottom eyelets from the outside in, making sure there is an even amount of lace on each side. Cross the laces over each other in an “X” pattern and thread them through the next set of eyelets up from the outside in. Cross the laces over again and thread them from the inside out through the next set of eyelets. [1] X Research source You will now have only the top set of eyelets remaining to lace. Put the Ultra Boosts on your feet if you want to tie them using the runner’s loop so you can tighten the shoes on your feet as you go and get a snug fit."

Pull each lace up to the eyelet straight above it and thread it back down through the eyelet to create a small vertical loop. [2] X Research source The Adidas Ultra Boost will now have a straight line across the bottom eyelets, then 2 “Xs” up through the next 2 eyelets, and finally a small vertical loop on either side through the last eyelet."

Pull the left lace through the vertical loop on the right side and pass the right lace through the vertical loop on the left side. Pull the laces tight to lock your heel in the shoe. [3] X Research source You will now have 2 overlapping laces creating a very skinny “X” across the top eyelets."

      "title": "Tie the laces",
      "content": "Tie the laces in a double-knot bow. Tie the shoelaces into a standard bow as you would normally do to tie your shoes. Double-knot the bow for added security. [4] X Research source This is one of the most secure ways you can tie your Adidas Ultra Boosts, especially if you plan on using them for running or other athletic activities. You won’t have to worry about the shoelaces coming loose or undone, even after running long distances or over rough terrain."

      "content": "Lace the shoe up all the way in a standard criss-cross pattern. Pass the laces through the bottom eyelets from the outside in so that there is a straight line across the bottom 2 eyelets and an even length of lace on each side. Cross the laces over each other in an “X” pattern and thread them from the outside in through the next pair of eyelets. Repeat this for the next pair of eyelets. Thread the laces from the inside out through the top eyelets. [5] X Research source This is a good casual way to tie your Ultra Boosts if you want a relaxed look, but it’s not secure enough if you want to use them for athletic activities. You won’t be able to tighten them all the way to lock your heel in the shoes. The DS loop is how Adidas Ultra Boosts come tied in the box, so you can just leave the shoes laced as they are if you have a new pair."

Hold the laces together close to where they come out of the top eyelets. [6] X Research source You can do this with the shoes off of your feet since it’s a loose style of tying your Ultra Boosts. Your hand will look like you are making the “OK” symbol at this point."

Use your fingertips to push the middle part of the laces through the loop, but don’t let the tips of the laces go through. [8] X Research source As you pass the middle part of the laces through the loop, grab them with the fingertips that you used to form the loop to help pull them through. This will create another loop through the middle of the original loop."

Hold the new loop you created in your non-dominant hand on one side and the bunch of laces on the other side in your dominant hand. Pull your hands in opposite directions to close the knot. [9] X Research source You are now left with a loose knot that has a loop sticking out of one side and the tips of the laces poking out of the other side. This is how you often see new shoes tied right out of the box."

Pull the ends simultaneously to make sure there is even length on both sides. Don’t pass the laces through the next set of eyelets up yet. [10] X Research source This is the loosest style of “tying” Adidas Ultra Boosts. It will give your shoes a unique look and make them easy to slip on and off. This style is called “uncaged” both because it uses the extra space under the “cages” that hold the shoelace eyelets and because it gives a wild, free look to the laces. It is also sometimes called “hypebeast style.”}"

Let the laces hang loose to stay true to the uncaged style. [14] X Research source Since the shoes are laced loosely, you don’t need to tie the laces because the tips won’t reach the ground. If the tips do look like they are too close to the ground, then loosen up all the laces a bit more to shorten the amount that hangs at the end. You can tuck the tips of the laces under the top space in the lace cage if you don’t like the way they look hanging loose."
