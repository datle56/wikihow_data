      "content": "Choose between a traditional IRA and Roth IRA. If you don’t already have another IRA with another institution, you’ll have to open a new account before making a transfer. You’ll need to factor in your overall financial plan when you choose a new IRA. [1] X Research source If you currently hold a Roth IRA, you’ll need to open a Roth IRA with your new bank. You can’t transfer or roll over a Roth IRA to a traditional IRA. [2] X Trustworthy Source Internal Revenue Service U.S. government agency in charge of managing the Federal Tax Code Go to source If you currently have a traditional IRA, opening a traditional IRA with the new bank is probably your best option, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket or close to retirement. Contributions to a traditional IRA aren’t taxed. You’ll pay taxes on distributions you collect from the account after you retire, and you’ll likely fall into a lower tax bracket during retirement. If you’re in a low tax bracket and expect to pay higher taxes later in life or during retirement, it might be best to open a new Roth IRA. Your contributions to a Roth IRA will be taxed at your current, low tax rate. You won’t have to pay taxes on distributions you collect during retirement when you might have a higher tax rate. Keep in mind you’ll need to pay taxes if you transfer untaxed funds from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. If your tax rate is currently under 20 percent, but you expect to pay 25 percent during retirement, paying taxes on a Roth conversion might save money in the long run.

[4] X Research source Some banks also match contributions for a limited period (such as the first 3 years) or offer other incentives. Make sure these incentives won’t be canceled out by high portfolio management fees. Paying higher ongoing fees by even a fraction of a percent can cost thousands over the life of your IRA.

When you shop around for a new bank, compare potential provider’s fees. Ask your current bank how much they’ll charge, and make sure switching justifies the cost. [6] X Research source For instance, a new bank might offer lower portfolio management costs that, in the long-term, will justify paying transfer fees."

If you can’t transfer an asset, you might have to liquidate it, which will incur tax liability. You might be able to leave non-transferable assets with your old bank, but you’ll incur fees if you don’t make contributions to the old IRA. [7] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Independent U.S. government agency responsible for regulating the securities industry, which includes stocks and options exchanges Go to source Non-transferable assets might include securities sold only by your old firm or mutual funds not available at a new firm. If you have a sizable non-transferable asset, liquidating it might push you into a higher tax bracket, and leaving it in an inactive account could be an unreasonable expense. If necessary, you should reconsider making the transfer or try to find a firm that can facilitate the transfer."

[11] X Research source For example, your new bank might have broader investment options with higher annual returns and lower or no transaction fees.

It’s a good move if you have losses or deductions that balance out the tax liability incurred by the conversion. However, if the conversion would push you into a higher tax bracket and you don’t have extra funds to cover higher taxes, transferring to a Roth IRA probably isn’t wise. [17] X Trustworthy Source Internal Revenue Service U.S. government agency in charge of managing the Federal Tax Code Go to source If your contributions to your traditional IRA were deducted from your paycheck as pre-tax income, they weren’t taxed. When you transfer your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, you’ll need to pay taxes on those funds based on your current tax bracket. Never withdraw money from your traditional IRA to cover your tax liability. The money you use from the old IRA to pay your tax liability would be counted as ordinary income, which would further increase your incurred taxes."
