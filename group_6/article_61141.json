If the option is grayed out, you may not be running Computer Management as an administrator, or the volume is formatted with a file system that cannot be extended. You also won't be able to select this option if your C and D drives are two separate drives (such as an HDD and SSD , two HDDs, or two SSDs). You can only transfer disk space to your C drive if the C and D partitions are on the same drive. It is also possible that there's unallocated space right after the select volume (check that lower-right box for the word \"Unallocated\"). If there is another volume between the selected partition and the unallocated area, you can delete that volume from the middle to allocate that space to the D drive. But if you do this, you'll lose any data on that middle volume."
