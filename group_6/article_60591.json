If the video could be viewed and moderated as the next action is calling the police on the sender, it's probably unwanted. While it's funny to send something hilarious, having others see someone getting hurt or others hurting someone else is just plain stupid. View the Contest Rules link at the bottom of the screen. This is found between \"Video Submission Tips & Tricks\" and \"Terms of Use\" (and) \"Privacy Policy.\" This will tell you what types of videos will not be aired and will not be able to be sent for consideration for the show."
