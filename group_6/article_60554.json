      "title": "Open Windows Media Player.",
      "content": "Open Windows Media Player. In order to stream your content to different devices on a local network you will need to first enable DLNA. This stands for Digital Living Network Alliance and is a standard for streaming content over local media devices. Press and hold Windows key and hit R. A small box will open in the lower left-hand side of your screen. Type in “wmplayer” and hit Enter. Windows Media Player (WMP) should then start."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn on Media Streaming.",
      "content": "Turn on Media Streaming. Once WMP starts, you should see a series of three different options in the upper left-hand corner of the window. These options are “Organize,” “Stream,” and “Create playlist.” Click the down arrow to the right of the Stream option to bring up a drop-down menu. You should see an option called “Turn on media streaming…” Click this and a new window should open with a button near the top that says “Turn on media streaming,” and there should be a little shield icon to the left of it. Click this to continue."
    },
    {
      "title": "Change your settings.",
      "content": "Change your settings. The page should now show a series of different options. At the very top, you will see an area that says “Name your media library.” Click inside the box and rename the library to something more specific. When you are streaming content over your network,, you will want to know which device the content is streaming from. The other options in this area will should configure automatically, so click “OK” to continue. If you are connected to a Homegroup, you may have a “Next” button in the lower right-hand corner instead of a “OK” button. Click “Next”, and a small window should pop up and give you a series of different libraries that you can share with the homegroup. There should be a total of five: Pictures, Videos, Music, Documents, and Printers & Devices. These will each have a drop-down menu to the right. Click the drop-down box and choose either “Shared” or “Not Shared” to adjust each permission. After choosing “Shared” while joined to a homegroup, this library will become available to all other Windows devices on the homegroup as well. Click “Next” and a new screen should appear and display the current homegroup password. Click the “Finish” button to continue on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow remote control of your player.",
      "content": "Allow remote control of your player. Back inside of WMP, open the Stream menu again and select the “Allow remote control of my player” option from the list. A small window will appear with two different options inside of it. These should be “Allow remote control on this network” and “Do not allow remote control on this network”; click the top option to enable this feature. Many media players on mobile devices will have the option to be a remote control as well, so having this enabled is just a good idea. You won’t have to worry about enabling the option in the future, should you want it. You will be able to control media playing on the remote media server as well, basically using your mobile device as a remote control (Play, Pause, Stop, Skip, etc.). This is limited to the features of the application you are using."

It should be listed as “PC-Name:email@address.com,” or “PC-Name:Username” for Windows 7 devices or local accounts on Windows 8 or higher.

The top option should be your current device, and then every other option below should be a network-connected device with a media player running. Select a player and then you should see a series of different remote control options at the top of the screen. Tap “Play” to start the video. Please note that in order to use a network media player, that player will have to be open on the device. So if you want to play a video on your Windows PC in another room, you will need to have it open and keep it open to have it appear in the network-connected players list."
