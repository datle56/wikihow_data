      "title": "If you're a Libra Venus, you get along with almost everyone.",
      "content": "If you're a Libra Venus, you get along with almost everyone. As a Libra Venus, you tend to put others first and to seek their approval—which you get fairly easily thanks to your natural charm. You go out of your way to avoid conflict, seeking calm, peaceful waters over turbulent ones. [1] X Research source The desire for peace is understandable, but some conflict is necessary. If you avoid all conflict, it can damage your relationships over time. Practice confronting problems when they arise to ensure your relationships stay healthy and honest. Your tendency to people-please can sometimes clash with your need for things to be fair: if you go out of your way for others and don’t receive the same treatment in return, you can become resentful. So try to speak up and voice your needs now and again: it'll strengthen your relationships."

      "title": "As a Libra Venus, you're the hopeless romantic of the zodiac.",
      "content": "As a Libra Venus, you're the hopeless romantic of the zodiac. You're always on the lookout for a romcom-level \"meet-cute.\" You're the type to believe in soulmates and in love at first sight and in grand romantic gestures: think “kiss cam at a baseball game” or “rose petals leading up to the bedroom.” And speaking of the bedroom, if your Venus is in Libra, you're a passionate, active lover—as a cardinal sign, you're certainly not a slacker! But your lovemaking is about more than just sex; it’s about emotional intimacy, as well. We're talking lots of cuddling , eye contact, and pillow talk. Sometimes being in love with love can make you blind to your paramour's faults, or cause you to expect perfection: it's important to recognize that love won't solve all your problems, and nobody is perfect, even your soulmate."

      "title": "Flirting comes naturally to you.",
      "content": "Flirting comes naturally to you. Because Libra is an air sign, you're highly intellectual and witty—which comes in handy when you're trying to woo your soulmate. You're extremely charming and flirtatious, making you easy to fall for. You don’t only value flirtation during the early stages of a romance—to you, it’s an integral part of the relationship. You'll be teasing and charming your mate long after the “honeymoon” stage has ended."

      "title": "You tend to seek out an egalitarian relationship.",
      "content": "You tend to seek out an egalitarian relationship. Libra is represented by the scale, meaning that in a romantic relationship, Libra Venuses value harmony and equality. You tend to look for a partner who will give as much as they get, and you seek to maintain a balanced, even relationship. Your habit of keeping things fair is usually a positive—for example, you'll be happy to divide chores evenly with a partner. But your need for balance can sometimes verge on petty: if your partner does something you dislike, try to resist the urge to respond in kind."

      "title": "As a Libra Venus, you tend to be financially successful.",
      "content": "As a Libra Venus, you tend to be financially successful. Venus isn’t just the planet of love and romance—it’s also the planet of money and business. While Taurus—the other sign ruled by Venus—is more often associated with financial success, Libra Venuses also tend to be financially savvy. And why shouldn’t they be? They value hard work, kindness and equality, fastidiousness, and balance—all traits that lead to a big paycheck. You're the type to put in as good as you get, so you're unlikely to put up with poor working conditions or unfair pay. When you're in a work environment that suits you, you're a dedicated worker."

      "title": "You gravitate towards intellectual or artistic jobs.",
      "content": "You gravitate towards intellectual or artistic jobs. Despite being good at finances, you aren’t necessarily meant to work in the financial sector. Your appreciation of aesthetics and your high intellect prime you for creative or academic roles, such as a painter, fashion designer, or professor. Even in roles that aren't traditionally lucrative, like artmaking or teaching, you have a tendency to thrive, thanks to your natural talents and your dedication."

      "title": "If you want to attract a Libra Venus, keep up with them intellectually.",
      "content": "If you want to attract a Libra Venus, keep up with them intellectually. Both Libra Venus men and women are clever, creative, and witty—and they value someone who can match their brain (or at least appreciate it). To get a Libra Venus, show them you have what it takes to ascend to lofty intellectual heights with them. [2] X Research source Libra Venuses thrive on intelligent discussion, so if you want to win a Libra Venus’s heart, pose a deep philosophical conundrum that’ll have you talking all night long."

    {
      "title": "Show your commitment to compassion and justice.",
      "content": "Show your commitment to compassion and justice. Because Libra Venuses value fairness and equality, it’s natural that they’d look for someone who holds the same values. They’re looking for a partner who can give as well as they get—someone who won’t take advantage of them. Libra Venuses aren’t just attracted to people who are kind to them: they’re also invested in the concept of fairness in general, meaning if you champion just causes or are kind to others, you’re likely to catch their eye."

      "title": "Flaunt your chic personal style.",
      "content": "Flaunt your chic personal style. Venus is the planet not just of love, but of aesthetics! Being so invested in their own looks, how could they not be on the lookout for someone whose sense of style complements their own? Libra Venuses are easily wooed by someone who takes care of themselves and puts thought into their appearance. This doesn’t mean looking like a supermodel—just being intentional about your looks, practicing daily grooming habits , having a sense of style, and taking pride in your appearance."

      "title": "Libra Venuses are most compatible with fire Venuses.",
      "content": "Libra Venuses are most compatible with fire Venuses. Sagittarius in Venus, Aries in Venus, and Leo in Venus are natural matches for Libra in Venus. Libra Venus may be in love with love, but sometimes Libra's air-sign intellectualism gets them stuck in their head a little more than they'd like. Fire signs will help them bring their passions out of their head and into their heart (and sometimes the bedroom). Fire signs are all about passion and intensity, and they can make Libra Venus's romantic and sexual fantasies a reality."

      "content": "When Venus is in Libra, love is in the air. Once a year for a little under a month, the planet Venus enters each sign. It happens at a different time every year, but when Venus enters Libra, anticipate seeing a lot of couples holding hands and eligible singles swiping right like no tomorrow. This is the time to get your flirt on, to approach your crush and tell them how you feel, or to take your established relationship to the next level, whether it’s moving in together, getting married, or saying “I love you” for the very first time. If you want to bag a Libra Venus, when Venus is actually in Libra is your best opportunity! Luck is on your side, and your Libra Venus will be feeling even more romantic than usual at this time."
