      "content": "Dilute aloe vera gel for gargling. While it is possible to use pure aloe gel as a gargle, this can be difficult. Aloe vera gel is very thick, which makes it difficult to gargle with. Instead, try diluting it a small amount to make it effective for gargling. If you are using aloe vera juice for your gargle, then you should be able to use it without dilution."

      "title": "Make a basic gargle.",
      "content": "Make a basic gargle. To use aloe vera gel on your throat, you can also mix it in gel form with other ingredients to make an effective gargle. Consider combining the aloe gel with tea or water, for example. There are many possible recipes for aloe gargles. One is to combine ¼ cup of witch hazel, ¼ cup of aloe vera gel, 1 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and 10 drops of tea tree oil. Put them inside a sealable container and shake well. [3] X Research source Don’t swallow the gargle. Gargles are not usually supposed to be ingested. While swallowing some aloe vera may be safe, some ingredients such as tea tree oil can be toxic when taken internally."

Take a small mouthful of the liquid, move it to the back of your throat without swallowing it, and then move it around the back of your throat by slowly exhaling. [4] X Research source Once you have exhaled all of your air, either inhale again through your nose or spit out the gargle and then take in a new breath."

      "title": "Consider using a more concentrated application.",
      "content": "Consider using a more concentrated application. If you have a severe sore throat, a diluted aloe vera gargle mixture may not work effectively for you. You might consider taking the gel in a more concentrated form or internally, for instance. [5] X Research source Some people take aloe remedies internally – in other words, they eat it in very small amounts. One recipe is to put aloe gel inside of a jar with honey, onions, green apples, lemon, and witch hazel. Let the mixture sit for a long time. Then, take up to 1 tablespoon at a time, three times per day. [6] X Research source Even if used in small amounts, pure aloe vera should relieve some of your discomfort while not exceeding the recommended daily dosage."

      "title": "Understand the side effects if ingested.",
      "content": "Understand the side effects if ingested. Aloe vera is safe to ingest in recommended amounts, up to about 3 tablespoons per day. However, it can cause some side effects. In particular, it is known to be a laxative. This means that if you swallow the aloe as you gargle with it, or take it internally, it may cause you to have loose stools or increased bowel movements. [7] X Research source There needs to be more research done on the medical effects of aloe vera. Along with constipation, there is some evidence that it could have carcinogenic properties when ingested in large amounts. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase pure aloe vera gel. When purchasing an aloe vera product, check the label to ensure that it is at least 95% whole leave aloe vera. Try to avoid products that have added sweeteners and thickening agents, such as xanthan gum. Pure aloe vera is typically available commercially at grocery stores, pharmacies, and online retailers."

      "title": "Buy aloe vera juice.",
      "content": "Buy aloe vera juice. Instead of using aloe vera gel, you can also use aloe vera juice, which is typically sold at pharmacies, natural food stores, and grocery stores. Instead of a thick gel consistency, this product is more liquid. A commercial product like aloe vera juice can be very helpful for full strength application but it also can be used in a diluted form."

      "title": "Consider using aloe vera directly from a plant.",
      "content": "Consider using aloe vera directly from a plant. Aloe gel is great to have on hand for a variety of home remedies. It can be harvested easily from the cut stem of an aloe plant, if you have one at home. To harvest aloe vera gel, begin by cutting off one of the leaves at its base. Then cut open the leaf along its length. Once you pull back the outer layer of the leaf, the gel inside will be exposed and it can be scraped out. Growing aloe vera at home is relatively easy. You can grow it indoors in a pot with minimal care. In certain climates, specifically those that never get below freezing, you can also grow it outside. [9] X Research source"
