It’s a good thing, and she’s doing this because she’s comfortable around you , so don’t assume there’s something problematic going on here. She’s not literally saying you’re her father! [1] X Research source While “daddy” often means “father,” people also use it casually as a synonym for “boss,” “protector,” or “provider.” She is 100% using “daddy” to mean the latter here."

I know you mean well, and it’s sweet, but it’s not for me. Any way you could find a new pet name for me?” Always use \"I\" language when addressing a conflict with your partner. That helps prevent them from feeling defensive. [10] X Expert Source Tara Vossenkemper, PhD, LPC Licensed Professional Counselor Expert Interview. 27 October 2021.
