      "title": "Good posture",
      "content": "Good posture in your upper body reduces stress on your SI joints. To find good posture in a seated position, imagine a string pulling your head up towards the ceiling. Puff out your chest to exaggerate the curve in your back. Then, release the exaggerated position by about 10° for the ideal seated posture. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your upper body position affects your SI joints because the Si joints provide stability and transfer impact/motion from your upper body to your lower body.

      "title": "Pull your knees slightly apart to relax your hip flexors.",
      "content": "Pull your knees slightly apart to relax your hip flexors. The hip flexors are muscles that can pull on your SI joint and pull the lower spine out of alignment if they're tight. [3] X Research source In addition to creating a gap between your two knees, keep a gap between the backs of your knees and the front of your seat to keep your pelvis from excessively tilting. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Move your ankles out slightly so that they’re in front of your knees, instead of directly below your knees. Your feet should rest flat on the floor or on a footrest."

      "content": "Position your hip bones so that they’re level with each other. Avoid crossing your legs to make sure one side of your pelvis isn’t tilted higher. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source By distributing your weight evenly, you make it easier for your SI joints to help balance and support your upper body. Bend both your knees to 90°."

      "content": "Try this out if your chair doesn’t provide enough lumbar support. Slide a rolled-up towel or cushion behind your lower back to help maintain the natural curves of your spine. The extra support of a cushion can reduce the pressure on your joints–and reduce your SI joint pain while sitting. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The cushion or towel should be small enough that it doesn’t force your back into an unnatural curve."

      "content": "For every 30 minutes of sitting, stand for 5 minutes. Breaking long periods of sitting is proven to reduce lower back pain–one of the main symptoms of SI joint dysfunction. Taking a small break from sitting even helps reduce brain fog and fatigue.

[8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To get some relief, shift to the front of your chair, and reach your arms backward. Grab the back of your chair, and pull your shoulder blades back as you gently press your chest out. Hold this position for 1-3 breaths. Repeat the stretch as many times as it feels comfortable for you, but stop if you feel any pain."

For the “cow” movement, inhale and lift your chest and chin. Pull your shoulders down and back, away from your ears. Exhale and find the “cat” movement by pulling your belly button in, rounding your spine, and tucking your chin towards your chest. Perform 1-3 repetitions. [9] X Research source"

[10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In turn, better posture equals less pain! Cross your arms in front of your body with your hands on your opposite shoulders. Turn your upper body to the left, as far as it’ll go, for 5 seconds.

      "content": "Your hamstrings are one of the key muscles that stabilize the SI joints. When muscles that support the SI joint are tight or inactive, it’s easier for the joint to cause you pain. [12] X Research source To perform this stretch while you’re seated, keep one leg bent and straighten the other so that your heel touches the ground. Lean forward to try and touch the toes of your straightened leg. If you can’t touch your toes, that’s okay! Just lean as far as you can for 10-30 seconds. [13] X Research source Repeat the stretch on your other leg. Only lean forward enough to feel a mild stretch. Stop the stretch if you feel any pain."

      "content": "This seated stretch is especially helpful if you’re pregnant and experiencing SI joint pain. However, anyone with SI joint pain can benefit from a tailor’s sit. To sit in the tailor’s position, keep your back straight and let the soles of your feet come together. The position should look a bit like a butterfly stretch. A tailor’s sit stretches your thigh, pelvic, and hip muscles to relieve pelvic discomfort and SI joint pain. [14] X Research source Gently lean forward for 5 seconds if you’d like a deeper stretch."

      "title": "Pick a chair",
      "content": "Pick a chair that supports the natural curves of your back. For instance, a good chair will offer lumbar support by curving in slightly to follow the curve of your lower back. Once you have a comfortable chair, adjust the chair height so that your knees are about level with your hips. If your chair has armrests, adjust them so that your wrists are slightly below or at the level of your elbows.
