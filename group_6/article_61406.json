Grapeseed oil : Another popular oil is grape seed. It is easily absorbed by the skin but does not leave a “greasy” feeling after application. It is not as common as sweet almond and is usually a bit more expensive. Sunflower oil : Sunflower oil is a low cost alternative and can usually be found at your local grocery store.
