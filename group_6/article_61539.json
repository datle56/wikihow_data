If you want, you can use a washcloth to gently scrub the infected spot while your foot soaks in the mixture. 5% vinegar should not be too harsh for your skin. However, if you feel burning or a rash occurs, stop soaking your foot and add water to dilute the mixture."

Dilute the hydrogen peroxide by adding water in a ratio of 2 parts hydrogen peroxide to 1 part water. If you experience burning or a rash, dilute the hydrogen peroxide further by adding more water. WARNING: Do not mix vinegar and hydrogen peroxide together, or treat your foot with one after the other. Mixing the two can form peracetic acid, a caustic chemical that can both burn your foot and damage your lungs through its fumes. [9] X Research source"

The fungus that causes athlete’s foot loves moist areas, so having damp feet can mean that the infection will get worse or will come back. A great way to keep your feet dry is to wear socks made of natural fabrics or fabrics that wick moisture away from your feet. Change your socks if they get wet. Consider wearing sandals or flip-flops in hot weather. Wear shower shoes, flip-flops or sandals around pools, gyms, hotel rooms, and shower or locker areas."
