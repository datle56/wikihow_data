      "content": "Yes, if the creator grants you access. The most straightforward way to view a private video on YouTube is to ask the creator for permission to watch it. Creators can invite select users to watch private videos on their YouTube channel. Contact the creator and let them know you want to watch their private video and why you want to view it. Be sure to provide them with the email address that is associated with your YouTube/Google account. You can find the creator's email address by going to their YouTube channel and clicking the About tab. If the creator has chosen not to make their email address or contact information public, you can leave them a comment on one of their public videos or on a post in their Community tab if it is available. Many websites claim that you can watch private videos by replacing \"watch?\" in the URL with a \"/\" and then putting another \"/\" after the \"v.\" This does not work. We have tested it. You will be rerouted back to the normal URL and it will still be private."
