These can be added to a trade with a click. You can remove mis-queued items for trade by hovering your cursor over that item in the current offer window and clicking the \"Remove\" button that should appear there. [4] X Research source You can also initiate a trade from a user's inventory list, where you should find a button towards the bottom that reads: \"Trade Items\". The amount of Robux you use cannot go over 50% the current offer, which is calculated in-game. As an example, if your current trade is rated at R$300, you cannot add more than R$150. Submitting a trade will notify the user with whom you are trading with a private message including your offer. Most traders like to receive higher Recent Average Price (RAP) when trading. For instance, the person will most likely accept when they gain a couple hundred more RAP when completing the trade. It's very risky to send a trade with the person losing RAP."
