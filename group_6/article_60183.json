Similarly, semi-permanent or temporary dyes are less damaging to your hair and last up to 6 weeks before needing to be reapplied. While semi-permanent dyes are less damaging, they’ll need to be applied more often if you want to maintain your color. Over time, this can damage your hair. So, if you want a specific color for longer, opt for permanent dyes. Permanent dyes last much longer but the ingredients necessary (oxidizers and ammonia) are more damaging to your hair. Ammonia-free dyes replace the ammonia of permanent dyes with a less damaging compound. However, using too much of this product can still damage your hair, similar to permanent dyes."
