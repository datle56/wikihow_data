      "content": "A simple restart might do the trick. Temporary glitches can prevent the store from loading properly, so closing it and opening it again can fix the error. To completely close the platform , go to Steam > Exit . Just make sure Steam still isn't running in the background with Activity Monitor or Task Manager , then open Steam again. If this happens whenever Steam auto-starts whenever you turn on your computer, disable that feature so you manually open Steam. If you're using a Steam Deck, you'll need to restart your device instead. Press and hold the Power button for 4(LCD) or 7(OLED) seconds to prompt the restart."
