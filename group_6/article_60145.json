If you don’t have anything thick enough, stack a couple of blankets or towels together for good measure. Once it’s all set up, test your sleeping pad out to make sure it provides plenty of support for your back. Did you know? Sleeping on a padded surface is fairly commonplace in some parts of the world. In Japan, for instance, some people choose to sleep on futons, which are padded sleeping surfaces that are laid out on the floor (or on another surface, like a mat). [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Get a warm blanket to cover yourself at night. Once you have your base set up, complete your bed with some top layers. What you need depends on how warm you feel. Floors are often much colder than a mattress, so plan on having at least 1 warm blanket or thick comforter. If you tend to run hot when you sleep, you might not need very much at all. Experiment with different sheets, blankets, and comforters until you find a setup that works well for you. Don’t underestimate sleeping bags . They’re a source of warmth and comfort whether you’re out in the wilderness or at a sleepover."

If your sleeping spot tends to be on the noisy side, invest in a set of earplugs to keep things quiet. [5] X Research source Get your blood pumping 3+ hours before you plan on hitting the hay.
