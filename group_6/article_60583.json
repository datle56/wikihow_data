Scrunch the product into your hair from the roots to the ends. Then, do the same thing with a curl cream or leave-in conditioner to keep your hair hydrated throughout the day. These products add texture or volume to your fine hair and prevent flyaways that could make your hair look frizzy. If your hair is completely straight, choose products that say they're texturizing since these can help you achieve a shaggy look."

Pull a section of hair onto the brush and direct the blow dryer at it while you slowly pull the brush down from the roots. Then, twist the round brush when you reach the ends, so they curl slightly away from your face. [4] X Research source You can use a flat iron to get the same slight curl at the ends of your hair. Put a small section of hair between the flat iron near your roots and slowly pull it down to the tips. Twist the flat iron away from your face if you want the tips to flip out or turn the iron toward your face for tips that curl in softly. If you want extra volume at the roots, go back and use the round brush on the hair near your scalp."

Then, tease the bangs with your fingers to break up the large curl. If you like, you can separate the bangs, so the hair falls on the sides of your face. If you want a more dramatic effect, blow-dry your bangs without the round brush to create a straight, blunt look."
