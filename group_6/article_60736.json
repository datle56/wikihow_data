      "content": "Find a relaxed moment to introduce the topic. There’s no perfect time to talk to a loved one about climate change—but that doesn’t make it any less important or necessary. If you can, try to find a time where everyone is in a good head space before initiating the discussion. If you or your loved one is already tense, irritated, or tired for whatever reason, you may struggle to have a productive conversation. If you mention climate change and your loved one immediately becomes defensive or aggressive, it may be better to return to the topic at a different time. However, don’t drop the subject completely. Next time, ask your friend or family member when they can carve out a distraction-free time period to talk to you about this important issue."

Focus on hope and optimism rather than fear and negative consequences—many people respond to fear by freezing up and becoming more hesitant to take action. Highlight the positive actions that can be taken to combat climate change, as well as the many climate activists doing important work worldwide.

      "content": "Share the impacts of climate change on your own life. Lean on the pre-established bond that you have with your loved one—whether they’re a friend, family member, or significant other. Be vulnerable with them about how climate change has impacted your life and what concerns you have for the future. If you can, share real-life examples and anecdotes so that your loved ones can really understand and connect to your story. [3] X Trustworthy Source United Nations Official site for the United Nations, an intergovernmental organization devoted to maintaining peace and building relationships between all nations. Go to source For example, you may share your concerns with a statement like, “I’m really scared about my future. I’m not sure I should have kids on a planet that may not be safe for them to inhabit, which is really sad and frightening. That’s why it’s so important to me that I do something.” Or, you could tell a story like, “Many of my friends have lost their homes in wildfires. I’ve seen the kind of pain that they’ve had to go through, and I don’t want that to happen to our family or others.” This person likely cares about you and your well-being. If you’re willing to open up to them and show them just how much this issue means to you, they may be more likely to change their own behavior and mindset."

      "content": "Connect the issue to something your loved one cares about. Relate the impacts of climate change to the interests, values, and political views of your friend or family member. For example, if you’re talking to someone who loves to spend summers on the coast, you could point out that 31-67% of Southern California Beaches may completely erode by the end of the century. [4] X Research source Similarly, you could ask older generations to consider what type of world they want their children and grandchildren to inherit. If you’re talking to your parents, for example, ask them if they want their grandkids to live in a world without access to clean water—which could happen within the next few years if action isn’t taken against climate change. [5] X Research source You can also take a climate justice approach and relate climate change to social issues that your loved one cares about. Climate change disproportionately affects certain individuals, such as residents of developing countries, unhoused people, and other vulnerable or marginalized populations.

Try open-ended questions like “What makes you feel that way?” “How could we change that?” or “What do you think a better solution would be?” Show that you’re actively listening by nodding, making eye contact, and turning your body toward the speaker. [7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Avoid trying to “win” the conversation by persuading someone to see your perspective. It’s actually more productive to give someone a chance to reflect on and explore the issue without feeling judged or strong-armed. Even if you disagree, respectfully asking about their opinions can help them reflect on their stance and even be more open to the possibility of changing it. Plus, you’re giving everyone an opportunity to feel heard and respected in a mutual dialogue."

[8] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source Even if you only agree on one small aspect of the topic, that can be enough to shift the conversation from an argument to a discussion. Once you find your common ground, keep returning to that point throughout the conversation, especially when you and your loved one aren’t seeing eye to eye. For example, you may share a desire to leave behind a better planet for your children and grandchildren. If your friend or family member resists your suggestion to take public transportation in order to reduce emissions caused by driving, connect that idea to the well-being of future generations. Say something like, “Remember how you mentioned wanting a clean planet for your grandchildren? Taking the train is just a minor inconvenience for us, but it could help create a more habitable planet for them.”"

Many people who deny or ignore climate change are misinformed and may only be hearing information that reflects their current beliefs, which is why providing them with hard evidence of climate change can be beneficial. [9] X Research source However, it’s okay to back off if the conversation is getting too heated. If someone is resistant to hearing the evidence you’re offering, this strategy may backfire, and it may be better to change the subject for now. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Don’t feel like you need to be an expert to talk to a loved one about climate change. If they challenge you on something, it’s okay to say that you don’t know the answer! Take the opportunity to do some research and find the answer together—which may actually make your loved one feel more comfortable and supported. Use reputable resources that are science-based, peer-reviewed, and expert-backed.

If you do use some jargon in the context of your conversation, make sure to explain what you mean in a non-condescending way. [11] X Research source While you may be very well-read and fully informed on environmental issues and the complex concepts attached to them, your friends and family may not be. Terms like “biodiversity,” “fossil fuels,” and “carbon footprint” may seem perfectly clear to you, but they can be alienating to others and encourage them to dismiss your points."

While it’s important to mention the threats that climate change poses to the world, it’s equally important to provide solutions so that the conversation doesn’t become an overwhelming, doomsday-type discussion (which may cause the other person to shut down). Come up with potential actions that your loved one can take that appeal to their values and concerns. [12] X Research source For example, choosing to bike to work may seem like a really inconvenient lifestyle choice to someone, but it can also save them money (and time, since it doubles as their workout for the day). Plus, it helps fight climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars and other motor vehicles.

For example, encourage them to take impactful steps in their personal life, such as shifting to a plant-based diet or saving energy at home . Additionally, try to highlight how systemic change is really needed to combat climate change. The actions of corporations, companies, and governments have a greater negative impact on climate change than individual humans do. [14] X Trustworthy Source United Nations Official site for the United Nations, an intergovernmental organization devoted to maintaining peace and building relationships between all nations. Go to source As a result, these major entities have a greater responsibility to take accountability for their actions and alter their approach. While that doesn’t mean that individuals shouldn’t also take responsibility for their contributions to climate change, it may help your friend or family member to feel less guilty and recognize the importance of higher-impact solutions like legal advocacy and policy changes. Global deforestation, for example, causes more emissions than daily car use in the U.S. [15] X Research source While it is still helpful for people to drive less and explore public transportation options, it’s more important to call up representatives and encourage them to hold environmentally harmful corporations accountable."

But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, and the cutting down of forests. These factors are causing air and ocean temperatures to increase faster than at any time in human history. [19] X Research source"
