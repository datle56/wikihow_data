      "content": "Run the shower. Taking a shower is a good excuse for spending lots of time in the bathroom and the steam will also blend with the smoke and help to cover up the odor. The sound of the shower will also help to mask the sounds of a lighter striking or of you puffing and exhaling smoke. You may also want to play some music on your phone to provide an extra layer of sound protection. Make sure that you actually take a shower (or at least get your hair wet so it looks like you took a shower) or people will be suspicious."

      "content": "Direct smoke outside or towards a vent if possible. As you smoke, make sure that you direct your smoke towards an open window or towards a vent. You may want to check out the window first to be sure nobody is outside who might see the smoke escaping from the window."

      "title": "Cover your hair.",
      "content": "Cover your hair. Hair is quite porous and it tends to hold onto smells more than your skin does. Tie back long hair and cover it with a bandanna or towel to prevent the smoke from getting to your hair. If you have a plastic shower cap, then this is ideal because the plastic will protect your hair and it will not pick up any of the smoke’s smell either."

      "content": "Protect your clothing. The more clothing that you have on, the more likely you will be to collect smoke smell on your clothes.

      "content": "Open a window. You want to try to direct as much smoke as possible out of your room. If smoke can't exit through an open window or duct, the smoke will leave its odor on walls, carpets, furniture and linens. If you happen to have a fireplace duct in your room, then that is even better. Fireplaces are specifically designed to allow smoke to escape a building, so it will be easier to direct smoke out of your room if your room has a fireplace duct."

      "content": "Blow smoke toward the exit with a fan. [4] X Research source The better the ventilation of your smoking room, the less likely you are to be caught smoking indoors. Turn on a fan to push the smoke toward the window and to help disperse it after it forms. A tabletop fan pointed toward an open window or air duct is ideal. If you are smoking in a bathroom with a ventilator or exhaust fan, turn it on and aim the smoke toward it to quickly eliminate visible smoke and odors. The special ventilators work by sucking up excess moisture and air particles."

You can also cover the bowl with your hand (as long as it is not too hot) and the lack of oxygen should put it out. If the bowl is hot, then use a few drops of water. To put out a joint, you can stub it in an ashtray or use a bit of water to put out the ember at the end. Just be careful not to get the whole thing wet or you won’t be able to smoke the rest of the joint."

Washing with hot water alone won't be enough to rub off the smell. If you don’t have access to a bathroom right away, then use some alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Brush your teeth . Your teeth and breath will also hold a lingering odor after you've smoked. Be sure to brush your teeth for at least two minutes, with special attention given to the tongue and gums. You can also spruce up your breath by using mouth wash or eating a mint-flavored candy or gum. Take a shower . Smoke will linger on any body part it touches, so showering is the most important part of your post-smoking routine. Use plenty of soap, shampoo and shower gel, paying special attention to your hair, which most often retains the smell of smoke. Change your clothes . Once you're out of the shower, you'll want to put on a fresh pair of clothes. No matter how diligently you directed smoke outdoors, some of the odor will still linger on your clothes. Be sure you are the person who launders the discarded clothes to avoid being caught."
