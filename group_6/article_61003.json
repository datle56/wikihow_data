      "content": "If you’re chatting with customer service More often than not, “thank you for your patience” is a phrase used by customer service representatives. Say you call a company, business, or store with an inquiry. If you’re placed on hold for an extended period of time, the representative may say, “Thank you for your patience,” when they finally return. For example, let’s say you call your insurance company, and your representative places you on hold for 30 minutes. They may then say, “Thank you for your patience, Pam. I was able to get some more information about your bill.” Sometimes, “thank you for your patience” can come across negatively. Many customer service centers encourage employees not to use the phrase as it may cause customers to feel more frustrated than appreciated, especially if they’ve been on hold for a long period of time."
