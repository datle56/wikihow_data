      "content": "It probably won’t fully remove it. It’s true that Vitamin C can strip color from your hair, but it’s fairly weak, so you’re probably going to have quite a bit of color left behind. Permanent hair dye is also designed to last a long time, so it's tricky to remove in the first place. While Vitamin C might get some permanent hair dye out, it’s almost always more effective on semi- or demi-permanent hair colors, which don’t “cling” to your hair as much. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Vitamin C can lighten permanent hair dye, but it's not guaranteed. There are two types of people in the world: those who swear Vitamin C gave them the perfect shade, and those who say it was useless. Both can be right. Vitamin C's bleaching properties are pretty mild to begin with, permanent hair dye is among some of the hardest to remove, and your hair type plays a role here, too.

      "content": "It may or may not be safe—there’s no scientific research on it. There aren’t any studies specifically looking at how Vitamin C affects hair. Anecdotally, some people only report slight dryness after using Vitamin C on their hair, but other people have experienced significant hair damage. [4] X Research source If your hair is already dry or damaged, or if you’ve used harsh treatments on it (like bleach or relaxers), you might want to try something else. Skip the Vitamin C if you have sensitive skin. It’s possible to have skin reactions to Vitamin C, like itching, redness, or soreness.

      "content": "It's not yet clear how Vitamin C removes hair dye. There's some speculation among hair-dyeing circles that the oxidation process of Vitamin C causes the dye to break down. But since there hasn't yet been a formal study on it, that's really just guesswork. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix Vitamin C with shampoo and let it sit in your hair. Blend a Vitamin C powder into some of your shampoo, using a 2:1 ratio of shampoo to Vitamin C. Use warm water to get your hair wet (but not dripping), and then apply the Vitamin C shampoo into your hair, working it into a lather like you’re shampooing normally. Afterward, pull on a shower cap and let it sit for a while before rinsing it out. [7] X Research source There’s commercial Vitamin C powder available, but you can also use a tool or blender to break down one or two Vitamin C tablets into a powder. [8] X Research source Use white Vitamin C tablets or powder. Orange powder isn’t going to give you carrot-colored hair, but it’s not clear whether it’ll leave behind a tint."

      "content": "Leave it in between 20 minutes to 1 hour. Lighter or less-permanent colors usually respond to Vitamin C faster, so you can start on the shorter end if you’re worried about the results. [9] X Research source For darker or more stubborn dyes, though, it needs longer to strip away the color: between 30 minutes to 1 hour. [10] X Research source Don’t leave the mixture in your hair for more than an hour—it could irritate your scalp."

While leaving Vitamin C in your hair overnight might not ruin it, Vitamin C is fairly drying, so an overnight treatment could leave you with roughed-up or fragile hair.

While it’s not totally clear if Vitamin C is safe for your hair, many people report their hair feeling a bit dry after using the treatment. Plus, some types of shampoo can rough up your hair if you leave them in for a long time. After you’ve washed out the Vitamin C, deep-conditioning your hair or using a hair mask will restore some moisture. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "It depends on your hair and dye color.",
      "content": "It depends on your hair and dye color. Since Vitamin C lightens hair dye rather than completely removing it, you might need to use it more than once. Everyone’s hair and hair color is different, though—meaning there’s no set amount of times it’ll take. Some people get the perfect color after one use, and others need many, many tries.

But if the Vitamin C isn't giving you any results at all, or your hair is badly damaged, it's time to see a professional hairdresser. They may be able to suggest alternatives, and can help you safely remove the dye without ruining your hair. [15] X Research source"
