      "content": "A triangle with an exclamation point is your Honda’s VSA Activation Indicator. If this warning light pops up on your car’s dashboard, it means that there’s something wrong with your Honda’s Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA®) system. Your system may have malfunctioned or been disabled for some reason. [1] X Research source Driving with varying tire or wheel sizes can cause a VSA® malfunction. If you recently took your Honda to a mechanic, they may have disabled your VSA® and forgotten to turn it back on. The Honda VSA® system helps stabilize the vehicle during wide or sharp turns, and it also helps your car maintain traction when accelerating on loose or slippery road surfaces. Your vehicle can brake and turn normally without VSA® activated, but its traction and stability enhancement may be less effective. [2] X Research source If the triangle warning light appears on a car that’s not a Honda, it means that your car has an underlying issue that must be addressed. The most common causes of this light appearing are bulb failure, low tire pressure, an overheated engine, brake problems, and transmission issues. [3] X Research source"
