      "content": "Asbestos is fairly uncommon in modern materials. The Consumer Product Safety Commission banned asbestos in wall patching and gas fireplaces (2 of the most common sources of asbestos) in the 1970s, and the EPA banned all new uses in 1989. Though it’s still legal to manufacture and distribute, use of asbestos has dramatically fallen since the ‘70s as we became more aware of its risks.

      "content": "Asbestos is only dangerous when it becomes exposed. Cases of asbestos harming someone’s health mostly occur when someone works with or handles the material directly, as when working construction without proper safety equipment. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Cancer Institute An agency in the National Institutes of Health focused on cancer research and patient support Go to source Most often, so long as the source of asbestos is undamaged, there’s little actual risk.

[5] X Trustworthy Source National Cancer Institute An agency in the National Institutes of Health focused on cancer research and patient support Go to source If you're exposed to high levels of asbestos only once, you’re likely unaffected. That said, there are rare cases of adverse effects as a result of limited exposure.

      "content": "Ambient asbestos in the air is often not harmful. Asbestos is naturally occurring, and there’s often a small amount in the air. That may sound alarming, but the truth is that the majority of people won’t ever notice. Ambient asbestos is low in quantity, and those who have been harmed by ambient asbestos typically have other regular exposure to it in their work, such as manufacturing or installing materials made with it.

      "content": "If the material isn’t damaged, leave it be. Exposure to asbestos typically only occurs if the asbestos-containing product is damaged, which releases asbestos particles into the air. [9] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If you suspect something is made with asbestos but it’s in good condition, leave it be. Wear a respirator and perform a visual inspection of the product to check for tears or damage. If you’d rather dispose of the product, contact your local EPA office or hire a professional to remove it. Any amount of asbestos requires professional handling for proper safety and containment.

      "content": "Get your home or workplace inspected for asbestos. Asbestos isn’t identifiable by sight alone, and requires lab testing to verify. If you suspect your home or workplace may have exposed asbestos, hire a professional to inspect and test for it , or report a violation to the EPA . At-home testing kits are available, but Environmental and Occupational Law Attorney Gregory Cade warns against them due to the hazards of exposure. Hiring a professional is especially necessary before you begin remodeling your home or workplace. Environmental and Occupational Law Attorney Gregory Cade says, “Some materials containing asbestos are marked, which allows for easy online verification of the label details.” Many products containing asbestos can be recognized by a warning label. Professionals often either remove the asbestos, or repair it by sealing it so that fibers don’t escape, or covering it with safety material that quarantines the asbestos."

[11] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If you find yourself overly distracted by the possibility of asbestos exposure, stop those negative thoughts by: Reminding yourself that asbestos exposure is uncommon. Asking yourself if there’s known exposure in your area—if not, there’s likely nothing to worry about. Remind yourself that if you are exposed, there are measures you can take, like contacting a professional inspection and removal service. Do breathing exercises to calm your nerves. Breathe in for 10 seconds, then out for 10 seconds, until you feel yourself relax."

If you’re cleaning in a place with asbestos present, use dampened cleaning tools like mops or sponges to clean dust, and dispose of them in sealed plastic bags. [12] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Asbestos can also sometimes be found outside on unpaved trails or roads.

In older homes, the areas immediately around heating appliances like stoves, ovens, or furnaces often contain heat-resistant asbestos. This is also true of areas with steam pipes that appear to be coated with insulation. [15] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Oil or coal furnaces themselves may contain asbestos in their door gaskets. This is also true of artificial ashes in gas fire places. Asbestos has also been used for its heat-resistance in many heat-proof fabrics, such as aprons, stove-top pads, or fireproof gloves."
