      "content": "Use a fan to blow the smoke out of your home if you have a window. Position your box fan in the window or nearby, angling it so it’s blowing out of the window. Turn the fan on whenever you see or smell the smoke, so the fan can pull the smoke out of your apartment and blow it outside. Turn your box fan into an air filter by taping a 20 by 20 by 1 in (50.8 by 50.8 by 2.5 cm) air filter to the back side of the box fan (the one that air isn’t blowing out of). Make sure that the side of the filter with pointing arrows is flush with the back of the fan. [2] X Research source Warning: You’ll need to open your window to use a fan, so this might not be a great option for you if the smoke is coming from outside. In that case, it’s better to seal your window as best as you can."

      "content": "Apply caulk or tape to seal cracks and gaps in the wall. You may have cracks around vents, cable cords, electrical sockets, lighting fixtures, and windows. If your landlord allows it, use caulk to completely seal these cracks, so smoke can’t enter through them. [3] X Research source Hold the nozzle of the caulk gun flush with the crack, then squirt a thin layer of caulk into it. If you can’t use caulk, use painter’s tape to cover the gaps. Tape won’t work as well as caulk, but it’s better than nothing."

You may be able to block it by installing a rubber door sweep at the bottom of your door. If you can’t alter the door, lay a draft guard or rolled up towel across the threshold to block the gap under the door. Ask your landlord if they will install the door sweep.

You can also make one yourself by rolling up a towel."

      "content": "Apply weatherstripping to windows to block outdoor smoke. Smoke may come in through your windows if one of your neighbors smokes on their balcony or patio. If this happens, keep your windows closed and install weatherstripping to block the smoke from entering your apartment. If you're not permitted by your landlord to install weatherstripping, you can block much of the smoke by tucking a rolled up towel around the bottom of the window. Weatherstripping comes in different forms, like tension seals, felt, reinforced foam, tape, and reinforced vinyl.

You may be able to block the smoke by covering the gaps with insulation padding or painter’s tape. Tuck the padding into the gaps or lay it over a vent. Then, use the painter’s tape to secure the padding in place. It’s best to talk to your landlord to find out if they can seal some of the gaps. Using padding and tape won’t alter the infrastructure of your apartment, so it won’t violate your lease."
