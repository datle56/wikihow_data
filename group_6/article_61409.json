      "content": "Understand the formula for determining probability. Probability is the likelihood of a random event happening. [1] X Research source It is usually expressed as a ratio. The probability of something happening is defined by the ratio p r o b a b i l i t y = n u m b e r o f f a v o r a b l e o u t c o m e s n u m b e r o f p o s s i b l e o u t c o m e s {\\displaystyle probability={\\frac {number\\;of\\;favorable\\;outcomes}{number\\;of\\;possible\\;outcomes}}} , where a favorable outcome is the event you are seeking to happen.

      "content": "Determine the probability of a single event happening. To do this, complete the probability ratio by determining how many favorable outcomes you can have, and how many possible outcomes you can have. [3] X Expert Source Mario Banuelos, PhD Associate Professor of Mathematics Expert Interview. 11 December 2020. Before you can understand more complex probability theory, you must understand how to figure out the probability of a single, random event happening, and understand what that probability means. For example, if you have a jar with 10 red marbles and 5 blue marbles, you might want to know what the possibility of randomly pulling out a blue marble is. Since you have 5 blue marbles, the number of favorable outcomes is 5. Since you have 15 marbles total in your jar, the number of possible outcomes is 15. Your probability ratio will look like this: p r o b a b i l i t y = n u m b e r o f f a v o r a b l e o u t c o m e s n u m b e r o f p o s s i b l e o u t c o m e s {\\displaystyle probability={\\frac {number\\;of\\;favorable\\;outcomes}{number\\;of\\;possible\\;outcomes}}} p r o b a b i l i t y = 5 15 {\\displaystyle probability={\\frac {5}{15}}} Simplified, p r o b a b i l i t y = 1 3 {\\displaystyle probability={\\frac {1}{3}}} . So, the probability of randomly pulling out a blue marble is 1 out of 3."

      "content": "Determine whether the two events are independent. Independent events are ones in which the outcome of one event does not affect the probability of the other event happening. [4] X Research source For example, if you are using two dice, you might want to know what the probability is that you will roll a double 3. The chance that you will throw a 3 with one die does not affect the chance that you will throw a 3 with the second die, thus the events are independent."

[5] X Research source For example, if the first event is throwing a 3 with one die, the number of favorable outcomes is 1, since there is only one 3 on a die. The number of possible outcomes is 6, since a die has six sides. So, your ratio will look like this: p r o b a b i l i t y = 1 6 {\\displaystyle probability={\\frac {1}{6}}} ."

The probability of the first and second event might not be the same. For example, if you and a classmate own the same outfit, you might want to know the probability that she and you will wear the same outfit to school on the same day. If you have five outfits, the odds of you wearing the outfit is 1 5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{5}}} , but if your classmate has ten outfits, the odds of her wearing the outfit is 1 10 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{10}}} ."

      "content": "Determine whether the two events are conditional. A conditional event, also called a dependent event, is an event that may be affected by the event(s) that come before. [8] X Research source For example, if you are drawing from a standard deck of cards, you might want to know what the probability is of drawing a heart on the first and second draws. Drawing a heart the first time affects the probability of it happening again, because once you draw one heart, there are fewer hearts in the deck, and fewer cards in the deck."
