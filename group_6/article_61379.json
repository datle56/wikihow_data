      "content": "Chakras are concentrated energy centers located inside your body. In Hindu and Buddhist traditions, chakras allow energy to flow harmoniously throughout the body. Each chakra corresponds to a specific area and aspect of mental, physical, and emotional health. If the flow of energy gets blocked, your health may be affected in negative ways. [1] X Research source There are 7 main chakras in the human body. The throat chakra is located in your throat near your thyroid. It's believed that this chakra bridges the gap between your heart chakra (in your chest) and your crown chakra (in your head). [2] X Research source The word \"chakra\" comes from the Sanskrit \"cakra,\" meaning “wheel,” which refers to the swirling energy concentrated in each chakra’s location."

      "content": "You can do a basic neck stretch whenever you feel tense or anxious. Stand or sit with your spine straight and drop your chin to your chest.

Then, move your chin back to your chest and repeat the same stretch on the right side. [8] X Research source Keep going until your neck and shoulder muscles relax. This is a gentle stretch that anyone can do! If you feel any pain, though, stop the stretch immediately."

Then, pick a topic to write about and let your thoughts spill out onto the paper! Don’t worry about grammar, spelling, or punctuation; let the words flow. [10] X Research source If you need a few writing prompts to get started, try asking yourself: What do I fear most? Have my fears changed over the years? What parts of my day cause the most stress, frustration, or sadness? Could I change any of them? Which emotions are the hardest ones for me to deal with? [11] X Research source"

[16] X Research source You can do this as many times as you’d like! This chant is called a “bija mantra.” Mantras are ancient “sound tools” used to tap into currents of energy."
