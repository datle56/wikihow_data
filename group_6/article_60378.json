      "content": "Think about your goal. How many people do you want in your coven? Who are possible candidates? What will you achieve in your coven? Will there be a hierarchy or will there be full equality? Write down as many questions as you can about your new coven, leave them for a few days and then come back and answer them."

      "content": "When you have gathered your new coven discuss ideas with them. Perhaps you want a uniform during rituals and meetings? Maybe you could start a collaborated apothecary? Anyone for scary Tuesday afternoons? There are endless possibilities, but don't argue too much."

      "title": "Don't push anyone too far.",
      "content": "Don't push anyone too far. If someone says they don't want to do something, they may be uncomfortable with it, and forcing them to do it will give you a bad name. Never make anyone do dangerous or just plain stupid things to get into your coven. Respect everyone and everyone will respect you. No sacrificial rituals!"

      "content": "If you are not a secret coven, expect a bit of badmouthing from the locals. Most Wiccans choose to stay in the broom closet because modern-day society doesn't support Wicca very much. Don't let people bother you too much, but if it gets out of hand, get some help from the local authorities."

      "title": "Collaborate materials.",
      "content": "Collaborate materials. Candles, herbs, crystals, etc. They're always good to have around; donate some to the Treasury if you have spares you don't want. These are good to have in case someone forgets something for a ritual."

      "title": "Create your coven calendar.",
      "content": "Create your coven calendar. Decide which Sabbaths and Esbats to celebrate. Write some charges or rituals to do with the coven. Perhaps someone can bake some special food for the celebration."
