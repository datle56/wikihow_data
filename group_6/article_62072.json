      "content": "It can make you feel angry. When you put yourself out there in any situation (romantic, platonic, or even career-wise), there’s a glimmer of hope that can feel like it gets dashed. When that happens, you might feel angry at the person who rejected you, or even at the world in general. It’s okay to feel angry, and you can use that emotion to propel you forward and keep going.

      "title": "It might make you feel depressed.",
      "content": "It might make you feel depressed. Getting rejected over and over can make you feel more than just sad. Studies show that constant social rejection can make you feel like giving up, which can unfortunately lead to depression. Depression can often look like feeling tired all the time, having no motivation to do anything, or isolating yourself from others.

      "content": "It can make you feel jealous of other people. You might see the people around you getting accepted instead of rejected, and that can be hard to handle. Jealousy is a normal human emotion, and it’s okay to feel envious of the people we know from time to time.

      "content": "Acknowledge your feelings. You might be feeling hurt, angry, jealous, or any mixture of emotions. It’s okay to let yourself feel things, and you don’t need to bottle anything up. Consider chatting with a close friend who you trust, or even writing down what you’re feeling in a journal. The more you can let things out, the better you’ll feel, since you won’t feel like you have to hide what you’re thinking. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep looking forward. Just because you got rejected this time doesn’t mean you’re going to get rejected again. Even getting rejected a bunch of times can’t tell you what’s going to happen next! Rejection is normal, and almost everyone you know has been rejected at some point in their lives.

      "content": "Yes, being rejected is a fairly common human experience. We all get rejected from time to time, whether that be romantically, platonically, or professionally. Not everyone is going to like us or accept us for who we are, and that’s okay. The fact that you’ve been rejected a lot shows that you’ve been putting yourself out there, which is a great quality to have. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Rejection can cause actual, physical pain, which can be scary. Studies show that social rejection lights up the same centers in our brain as the feeling of physical pain. That feeling is very uncomfortable, and it’s not something you usually want to go through more than once. That’s why rejection can be so intimidating—it can actually hurt you. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Thankfully, this pain doesn’t last forever. Experts note that time is the best healer, and after the initial hurt wears off, your brain will start to recover from the rejection very quickly."

      "content": "It can lower your self-esteem. When you’re rejected by your partner, it can start to feel like they don’t really like (or love) you anymore. While this might not be true, it can really lower your self-image, and it might even make you feel bad about yourself. The best thing to do in this case is to sit down and talk with your partner about why you feel rejected and what you both can do to stop that from happening. [11] X Research source Start the conversation by saying something like, “Hey honey, can we talk? I’ve been feeling a little rejected lately, and I just wanted to check in about our relationship.”"

      "content": "It can make you withdraw from your partner. After you get rejected a few times, either emotionally or physically, you might just stop trying altogether. This can lead to withdrawing from your partner, which can potentially be bad for your relationship. Again, this is a scenario that you definitely need to talk to your partner about so you can work out what’s going on with your relationship.

      "content": "Use it as a learning technique. Did you maybe ask someone out too early? Did you miss the signs that they just wanted to be friends? Try to think about everything that happened leading up to the rejection, and use it as a teaching method for the next time. [14] X Research source For example, maybe you asked someone out that you had only known for a couple of days. Next time, you could try to get to know them a little bit better before you invite them out on a date."
