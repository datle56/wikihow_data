      "content": "Ask yourself if this will matter in 5 years. When you find yourself taking something perhaps a little too seriously, shake yourself out of it by putting things in perspective. Often, as much as something is annoying you in the minute, you can pull yourself out of that mindset if you realize that you probably won't even remember it happening in the short-term future. [1] X Research source Focus on what's really important and what will really make a difference in your life, rather than getting worked up about something just because it doesn't go the way you might want."

      "content": "Give people the benefit of the doubt. If you take things too seriously, you're also likely to take things personally. You might jump to conclusions about what someone meant without considering other equally likely possibilities. [2] X Research source For example, if someone points out to you that you have a small stain on your shirt, they're likely just trying to be helpful—not imply that you're not able to look presentable. Keep in mind that most people don't have some hidden agenda and aren't trying to send you any hints that go beyond what they literally said."

      "content": "Look for the humor in everything. Being able to find the humor in life doesn't mean that you're being immature or not taking things seriously. It's totally possible to laugh at a situation while also taking the steps necessary to deal with it. Being able to laugh at your own mistakes is the first step toward taking life—and yourself—less seriously. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Licensed clinical psychologist and professional life coach Susan Pazak notes that \"when we take life and situations so seriously, we do not allow ourselves to find humor in much of anything,\" and advises that you \"watch funny shows and cartoons or read comics to allow yourself to laugh.

      "content": "Approach the future with flexibility. You never know where life is going to take you and no matter what you do, you can't control or predict the future. When you focus on the present and eliminate your attachment to a particular outcome, it's a lot easier to relax and let go. Developing the mental flexibility to accept the future as it comes is a huge part of not taking life too seriously. [4] X Research source Executive life coach Guy Reichard recommends becoming open-minded and non-attached, so that you can \"accept change, deal with how [you] feel about it, [and] find something positive to look forward to.\""

      "content": "Change the thoughts and ideas that no longer serve you. Take a long, hard look at how you're thinking about things. Make a list of the things that you value the most and challenge any beliefs or assumptions you have that run counter to those values. You'll take things less seriously when you can replace those beliefs or assumptions with more positive ones. [5] X Research source Life coach Taylor Rochestie believes \"a great thing is to have an endless thankfulness type of mentality.\" \"I like to believe what you seek is what you'll find,\" Rochestie continues. \"If you're actively seeking ways to be thankful, your mind is filled with surrounding yourself with positive types of feelings, positive emotions, positive thoughts, positive words.\""

      "content": "Do things spontaneously for a break from routine. It's easy to get stuck in a rut and fall into the trap or tedium. Even a small departure from your routine, such as taking a different route to work, will remind you to pause and focus on things that you'd normally miss. It also keeps you out of your head and more focused on the present moment. [6] X Research source These little detours and breaks from routine can also enhance your creativity by knocking your brain out of autopilot and forcing you to focus on the present."

      "content": "Fight minor frustrations by making jokes about the situation. It's likely you have a funny story of something that happened to you long ago that wasn't funny at all in the moment. A key to not taking life too seriously is seeing that humor in the moment without needing years of time and distance first. If you can see the humor in any situation, it makes it a lot more difficult to take it too seriously. [11] X Research source For example, if you're frustrated that you can't get your printer to work, you might make a joke about how the least advanced piece of tech you have is always the thing that fails. It's also really hard to be upset when you're laughing. Something that might've triggered outrage can also cause a fit of laughter if you just look at it the right way."

[12] X Research source Rochestie cautions that \"everything that you bring into your life becomes the things that you talk about, the things that you think about, and the things that you're doing\" and would caution you to critically evaluate what you're bringing into your life and how it's affecting you or changing you."

[17] X Research source What to do: Remind yourself that you have intrinsic value regardless of your performance.
