      "content": "Turn your triangle bikini into a strapless one with a few simple knots. Turn your bikini top upside down and tie the top string (what used to be the bottom string) behind your back. Cross the bottom string (what used to be the top string) underneath your chest, then tie it together behind your back. [5] X Research source You might need to adjust the triangles in the front a little so they cover everything up. This style doesn’t offer as much support as other styles, so use caution if you have a larger bust."

      "title": "Sometimes you don’t want to hide the bows behind your back.",
      "content": "Sometimes you don’t want to hide the bows behind your back. Slide the cups of your bikini out and away from each other on the bottom strap, but keep the top strap in place. Loop the bottom strap over your head so the cups face downwards, then tie the strings dangling at your sides behind you. Tie the front strings tightly in front of your chest, then pull the cups inward to give yourself enough coverage. [7] X Research source This will give your bikini a cute “U” shape instead of a triangular one. This can also help give you a bit of cleavage since it naturally pulls your chest inwards."

Pull the top strings in front of you, then twist the ends around each other to form a thick rope going down to your chest. When you reach the end, tie the top string to the bottom string in front of your chest. [9] X Research source Pair this look with a swimsuit coverup and some wedges to go out to eat near the beach."
