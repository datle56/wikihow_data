      "content": "Grasp a clam in your hand. Use a towel to hold the clam in your hand. This will protect your hand when you pry open the clam shell with a knife. If you really feel unsteady, you can also wear gloves. Make sure the hinge of the clam shell is nestled in the area of your palm nearest your thumb. The opening of the clam should be at your fingertips. You can also press down on the clam a bit to give it some added pressure to make it easier to pry it open with the knife."

Alternately, you can insert the knife at the hinge of the shell, but then you'd have to use a lot more pressure to try to break open the hinge and shuck the clam that way. You'll have to squeeze the knife between the shells to loosed the adductor muscles and the hinge of the shells."
