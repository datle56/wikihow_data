      "title": "Check for a smooth, bright color that reflects light like water.",
      "content": "Check for a smooth, bright color that reflects light like water. Examine the stone's color to make sure it appears rich and vibrant. In most cases, it won’t be purely opaque or purely transparent. Because it’s a combination of opaque and transparent, look for a shine that's similar to light reflecting off water. If the color is dull or flat, it’s likely a fake stone. [2] X Research source Jade can sometimes be totally opaque, but the opaque stones aren’t very valuable. [3] X Research source If it looks like there are air bubbles in the stone, then it’s likely not real."

      "title": "Examine the color to make sure it’s consistent, not perfect or blotchy.",
      "content": "Examine the color to make sure it’s consistent, not perfect or blotchy. You should notice some color variations throughout the stone if the jade is real. These are likely to be consistent, meaning that you will notice the same patterns throughout the stone. On the other hand, fake jade may have perfect coloration or could have uneven consistency, meaning that it looks blotchy in spots. [5] X Research source It may help to examine the jade directly under a light so that you can view it better."

      "title": "Look for imperfections on the surface of the jade, such as pits or rough spots.",
      "content": "Look for imperfections on the surface of the jade, such as pits or rough spots. Authentic stones are more likely to have minor imperfections, like an uneven shape, dips in the surface, or pitting. These may remain even after the stone has been polished . Check your stone to see if it looks too perfect. If it does, then it’s likely a fake. [6] X Research source This might not work as well if you’re buying a piece of fine jewelry, as the highest quality pieces of jade may not have imperfections."

      "title": "Toss the stone in the air and catch it in your palm to see if it’s heavy.",
      "content": "Toss the stone in the air and catch it in your palm to see if it’s heavy. Real jade has a very high density, which means it will feel heavier than you might expect based on its size. Toss and catch the stone several times to get a feel for its weight. If you can, compare it to a different stone so you can get an idea of how heavy the jade feels. [7] X Research source Although this test is imprecise, it’s a popular way to judge the authenticity of jade."

    {
      "title": "Touch the stone to the side of your face to see if it feels cool.",
      "content": "Touch the stone to the side of your face to see if it feels cool. Jade is naturally a very cool stone, so it will feel cold to the touch. Hold it against your face or neck to see if it feels cool against your skin. If it doesn’t, then it may be a fake. [8] X Research source If you hold the stone against your face for a few minutes, it still shouldn’t heat up. It should feel cold even if you rub the stone up and down on your skin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try to warm up the stone in your hand to see if it stays cool.",
      "content": "Try to warm up the stone in your hand to see if it stays cool. Place the stone in your palm, then wrap your hand around it. Squeeze the stone tightly to try to heat it up. Wait 1-2 minutes, then feel the stone to see if it’s still cool. Real jade should still feel cool to the touch, while a fake will likely be warm. [9] X Research source It’s possible that a fake stone will still feel cool, but this test may help you separate the real stones from the fakes."

      "title": "Tap a suspected jade stone against a real piece of jade.",
      "content": "Tap a suspected jade stone against a real piece of jade. This can help you judge the density of the stone you think might be jade. Clap the stones together several times and listen to their sound. Since jade is hard, you should hear a deep, resonant sound when the stones strike each other. If the stones sound like plastic beads, then the suspected jade stone is likely a fake. [10] X Research source If you don’t have any real jade, you can try doing this test with a different stone. However, keep in mind that it might not work as well as when you use real jade."

      "title": "Do a scratch test with your fingernail or a piece of metal.",
      "content": "Do a scratch test with your fingernail or a piece of metal. For a simple scratch test, rub your fingernail along the side of the stone to see if you can scratch it. As another option, use a pair of scissors or a knife to scratch the surface of the stone in an inconspicuous place. If the stone scratches, it’s likely not real. [11] X Research source Real jade is a hard stone, so it won’t scratch easily."

      "title": "Let a jeweler examine your jade to determine if it’s real.",
      "content": "Let a jeweler examine your jade to determine if it’s real. Jewelers are trained to recognize real and fake precious gems and stones. They can examine the stone under a magnifier to make sure it has the structure of a true jade and to check for signs of a fake. They will evaluate the properties of the stone and then tell you if it’s real or fake. [13] X Research source Typically, the jeweler will do these tests while you’re there. You may want to talk to more than 1 jeweler to get multiple opinions about the authenticity of the stone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask the jeweler to do a density test.",
      "content": "Ask the jeweler to do a density test. Your jeweler can measure the density of the stone you suspect is jade using a spring scale and water displacement test. Then, they’ll compare the density to a jade density chart to see if it meets the standards of real jade. If it does, then your stone is likely real. However, it’s likely not real if the density of your stone is not consistent with jade. [14] X Research source If you have concerns about the density test, ask your jeweler how they typically perform the test before they get started. They may even let you watch them do it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get the jeweler to estimate the value of your jade.",
      "content": "Get the jeweler to estimate the value of your jade. One of the benefits of seeing a jeweler is getting your stone valued. The jeweler can evaluate both the jade and its setting, if the stone is already part of a piece of jewelry. Ask them how much you can expect to sell the jade for, as well as if they think the value could increase over time. [15] X Research source Keep in mind that this valuation is still an estimate. It’s best to talk to multiple jewelers when you’re trying to estimate the value of a piece, but this can help you understand what your stone is worth."
