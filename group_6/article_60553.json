      "content": "Visit Xur in Eternity. To acquire the Strange Key, you must first acquire the Magnum Opus side quest. And to acquire the side quest, you must first to talk to Xur in Eternity. Eternity was made available as part of Destiny 2's 30th Anniversary Pack. Look for the small planet icon just below the moon on your Director. It should be labeled Eternity . Click to travel to it. With enough currency and reputation, you can outright purchase the Strange Key. Do NOT do this however, as players report a bug in which acquiring the Strange Key prematurely prevents you from using it later on in the quest. [1] X Research source To find Xur, select the Xur's Treasure Horde option within Eternity. Once you arrive, you will find Xur behind the door to the left. Speak with Xur to progress the quest, and then speak with him again to pick up the Magnum Opus quest. While you are here, be sure to loot the treasure chest next to Xur, which includes a new weapon."

      "content": "Gather seven Strange Coins. When Xur gives you your new quest, he will instruct you to gather seven Strange Coins. You can complete most Strikes, bounties, and public events to collect these coins. However, we recommend running Dares of Eternity , as this will also help you build reputation with Xur, which you will need for a later portion of the quest. You will need to run several Dares until you have collected the requisite seven Strange Coins."

      "title": "Return to Xur and meet with Starhorse.",
      "content": "Return to Xur and meet with Starhorse. With your Strange Coins in tow, head back to Xur in Eternity. This time, you will find a character named Starhorse (who looks like a horse made of stars) waiting by Xur's treasure chest. Starhorse is selling bounties, and you must complete three of them to continue with the Magnum Opus quest. Purchase three of Starhorse's cheaper bounties (we recommend purchasing daily bounties) and complete them solo or with a fireteam. Youâ€™ll need to complete Starhorse's bounties in a single Dares of Eternity run or it will reset back to zero. Prioritize your objective over your point total, as you are likely to reach your required point threshold naturally."

      "content": "Purchase the Strange Key from Xur. Once you have completed Starhorse's three bounties, you can return to Xur and acquire the Strange Key from his inventory. Find the item labeled Strange Key and click to acquire it. You need a reputation level of Strange Favor or higher to retrieve the key from Xur's inventory. If you ran Dares of Eternity enough earlier, you should definitely have reached this reputation. If not, continue to run Dares of Eternity until your reputation is high enough. With the Strange Key now in your inventory, do not leave the location. Your next steps are nearby."

Continue along the path until you see a group of bronze balls floating up towards the ceiling. You may hop on to one of these balls and ride it upwards if you would like. Otherwise, you can continue to hop on different rock ledges as you work your way up."
