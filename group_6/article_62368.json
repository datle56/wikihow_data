      "title": "A little patience can go a long way with this contrasting duo.",
      "content": "A little patience can go a long way with this contrasting duo . The bold ram and the sentimental crab approach romantic relationships at completely different speeds. Much like their patron element, the passionate Aries wants to turn up the heat and intimacy right away, while Cancers prefer to build up intimacy gradually. This can lead to some miscommunication and hurt feelings if both signs aren’t careful. [1] X Research source Compatibility Tip: Sit down together and discuss what you both want out of the relationship. Give each other a chance to speak openly, so you can both be on the same page."

      "title": "The adventurous Sag and the domestic Cancer may have different priorities.",
      "content": "The adventurous Sag and the domestic Cancer may have different priorities. Cancers are the ultimate homebodies of the zodiac and crave nothing more than calm, domestic bliss with their partner. Sagittariuses, on the other hand, burn with a sense of adventure and a desire to chase new horizons. The archer isn’t known for their commitment skills, either. Compatibility Tip: Be willing to meet in the middle when you spend time together! A fun weekend trip can satisfy a Sagittarian’s insatiable wanderlust, while a movie night at home will definitely appeal to a Cancer."

      "title": "Aquarians and Cancers approach life from separate, unique perspectives.",
      "content": "Aquarians and Cancers approach life from separate, unique perspectives. Cancers prefer to take the steady, safe road, while Aquarians will always prefer the road less traveled. The emotionally-rooted crab likes to follow their heart, while the intellectual Aquarius prefers to follow their mind. Without plenty of open conversations and compromises, these differences can drive a wedge in the relationship. Compatibility Tip: Try to find something in common with Aquarius! Adopt some interests and hobbies that they enjoy, whether that’s playing video games or going to the same sci-fi convention. You can even find out where they shop and hit up that place."

      "title": "Independent Gemini and devoted Cancer don’t always see eye-to-eye.",
      "content": "Independent Gemini and devoted Cancer don’t always see eye-to-eye. Geminis are free-spirited and aren’t big on commitment—in fact, you could argue that they change their mind about lovers more often than they change their underwear! Cancers want nothing more than a committed partnership, which is hard to find with this mutable air sign. Compatibility Tip: Give Geminis plenty of wiggle room in their day-to-day life. This sign hates nothing more than being boxed in."

      "content": "Libras are ruled by the mind, while Cancers follow their hearts. Moon-ruled Cancers aren’t afraid to really feel their feelings and take a deep dive to what lies beneath the surface. Libras don’t share the same subterranean approach to emotion, and prefer to keep their emotional affairs as calm and level as possible. [2] X Research source Compatibility Tip: Make small gestures to meet each other’s emotional needs. A big hug after a rough day can mean a lot to a Cancer, while a Libra might appreciate some breathing room as they handle tough emotions."

      "content": "This water-fire duo can learn how to complement each other. Both of these signs are deeply plugged into their emotions, which can push the relationship to the dramatic end of the spectrum. [3] X Research source Still, Leo is the most affectionate sign of the zodiac, and is not afraid to show their love in friendly, generous ways. This is great for Cancers, who love to be loved.

      "title": "A dual Cancer relationship draws its strength from a mutual understanding.",
      "content": "A dual Cancer relationship draws its strength from a mutual understanding. You’ll get no lack of emotional intimacy and support when 2 Cancers start to hook up, that’s for sure! Unfortunately, the depths of those emotions can cause some hiccups if the non-confrontational crabs aren’t willing to share their feelings in an open, assertive way. Compatibility Tip: Focus on finding healthy ways to express your emotions in the moment. In some cases, that might mean taking a 20-minute timeout in another room. In other cases, it might mean counting to 10 before saying the first thing on your mind."

      "content": "Capricorns and Cancers share a steady, devoted sense of commitment. These signs are total opposites on the zodiac wheel, yet both share similar priorities in a relationship. Cancers are known for being domestic, affectionate, and devoted to their partners. [4] X Research source While not “mushy,” Capricorns care deeply about the close people in their life, and will look for practical ways to care for them. Compatibility Tip: Ask Capricorn for small favors, like giving you a ride or helping with some small household “emergency.” They will automatically hope that you are okay, and you will end up on their worry list."

      "title": "Virgos and Cancers",
      "content": "Virgos and Cancers approach life in similar ways. Cancers can be on the shy, introverted side before they really warm and open up to the people in their life—just like a crab hiding in its shell! [5] X Research source Virgos approach life from a similar frame of mind, and are very careful and cautious. Both signs can stay grounded in their own way, which can lead to a very harmonious relationship. Compatibility Tip: Virgos like honesty, availability, and cleanliness. Really try to embody those traits as you approach and get closer to a Virgo in your life."
