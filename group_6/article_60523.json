      "title": "Cool the salmon to room temperature within 2 hours of cooking it.",
      "content": "Cool the salmon to room temperature within 2 hours of cooking it. If you leave the fish out for more than 2 hours, harmful bacteria can begin to grow. Plan on storing the fish as soon as it's cool. [1] X Research source Don't pack the salmon while it's still hot or moisture could condense in the package. Your salmon won't stay as fresh when it's in a moist container."

      "title": "Put the salmon into an airtight container or wrap it in foil or plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Put the salmon into an airtight container or wrap it in foil or plastic wrap. Get out a shallow container and place the salmon into it. If you don't have a container, lay the fish on a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil or plastic wrap and seal the fish tightly. [2] X Research source If you're storing smoked salmon in plastic wrap, wrap it in aluminum foil too in order to prevent your fridge from smelling like fish. If it's not smoked, there's no need to double wrap it."

    {
      "title": "Label the container of salmon with the date.",
      "content": "Label the container of salmon with the date. As soon as you wrap the salmon, take a pen or marker and write the date on the package. It's also a good idea to label the package \"cooked salmon\" so you don't forget what's in the container. [3] X Research source If you added specific seasonings, you might want to include that on the label. For example, write \"blackened salmon\" so you know that the leftovers might be best in a cajun pasta."

      "title": "Refrigerate the salmon for up to 3 days.",
      "content": "Refrigerate the salmon for up to 3 days. Refer to the date you wrote on the container of cooked salmon and eat it within 3 days or throw it away. Warm the salmon in the oven if you'll be turning it into a new meal or leave it cold and mix it into a quick salad, for instance. If you forgot to write the date on the container of salmon and you think it's been in the fridge for at least a few days, play it safe and toss the fish."

      "content": "Cover the salmon and reheat it at 275 °F (135 °C) for about 15 minutes. If you'd like to warm a salmon fillet before serving it or mixing it into your meal, take the fish out of the fridge. Unwrap it and arrange the salmon on a rimmed baking sheet. Then, cover the fish loosely with foil and put it into a 275 °F (135 °C) oven until it's warm throughout. Remember that the fish is already cooked; you're simply reheating it. [4] X Research source To test if the salmon is thoroughly reheated, insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the fish. Remove the fish once its temperature is between 125 and 130 °F (52 and 54 °C)."

Wrap the salmon tightly in plastic wrap and then wrap it in aluminum foil or place it into a sealable freezer bag.

Since it's easy to forget what things are in the freezer, write \"cooked salmon\" on the package too. [6] X Research source Be specific when you write what type of salmon you're storing. Write \"Thai sweet and sour salmon\" so you know that these leftovers would be great in a curry, for instance."

If you open the package and see tiny ice crystals over the salmon, throw it away since it will have an unpleasant flavor and texture. [7] X Research source Although you can freeze salmon for more than 3 months, your freezer must be set to 0 °F (−18 °C). Keep in mind that the flavor and texture might worsen the longer you freeze the fish."
