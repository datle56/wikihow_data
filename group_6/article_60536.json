      "content": "Wrap the pieces tightly in plastic wrap. If you’ve already cut, cooked, and eaten part of a spaghetti squash, you’ll want to store the rest of it in the fridge. Wrap each piece of squash thoroughly with plastic wrap before putting it in the refrigerator. This will ensure that no air gets to the squash. You can also put the pieces in a tupperware container if you don’t have plastic wrap."

      "content": "Put the wrapped pieces in the humidity-controlled drawer. The cut squash will last much longer if it’s kept in a humidity-controlled drawer, instead of on a shelf in the refrigerator. Squash requires a lower humidity level than many other vegetables, so keeping it in a slightly less humid environment should make a difference."

      "content": "Throw away the squash if it’s moldy and/or stinky. If you open your fridge to take out your squash and you notice that it has a few white, black, green, or blue “fuzzy” spots, it’s likely moldy. If you don’t see any signs of mold but you unwrap the plastic and smell a foul odor, you should still throw out the squash. [3] X Research source These are signs that the squash is no longer safe to eat."

Put the cooked squash in plastic freezer bags and seal them before storing them.

[5] X Research source Let it thaw at least partially, but not all of the way, or else it may have a mushy texture when you reheat it. Let the squash thaw long enough to where it softens some, but is still very cold to the touch."

Whether you’re picking squash at a grocery store or out of your own garden, it’s important that the skin looks healthy. Otherwise, your squash will quickly rot and become inedible.
