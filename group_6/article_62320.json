      "title": "The position of the planets in your birth chart can actually tell you when you'll buy a house.",
      "content": "The position of the planets in your birth chart can actually tell you when you'll buy a house. Look at the section of your birth chart that represents the 4th House and see which planets are there. You'll find either Mars, Saturn, Venus, Jupiter, Ketu, the Moon, the Sun, or some combination of them. The planet (or planets) you find will determine when you'll buy your property. [1] X Research source You’ll need to calculate your birth chart based on the day, time, and location you were born if you haven't done so already. You can easily plug this information into a birth chart calculator online."

      "title": "If the Moon is in the 4th House, you’ll buy a large home early in life.",
      "content": "If the Moon is in the 4th House, you’ll buy a large home early in life. The Moon’s powerful lunar energy will guide you to purchase property after you’ve just established yourself and started off in your career. You’ll enjoy the spontaneity of putting down a large payment and outbidding other buyers to sign the deed on your very first house. [2] X Research source You’ll feel most inspired when Venus also enters the Fourth House, as its influence will give you the courage to get even more extravagant. Since Venus rules over beauty, you’ll seek out and buy an enviable house that’s not only gorgeous on the outside but at least two stories high."

      "title": "If Venus is in the 4th House, you’ll buy a luxurious home when you’re young.",
      "content": "If Venus is in the 4th House, you’ll buy a luxurious home when you’re young. If the Moon is no longer in the Fourth House, you’ll still be able to purchase a house that’s just been put on the market and doesn’t require any repairs. It will feature a design that’s modern and lovingly designed by a professional architect. [3] X Research source Even though your chance for a multistoried home is lower without the influence of the Moon, you can still find a house with lots of space, such as one with an open floor plan. With Venus on your side, you’re also more likely to buy property with a large garden and indoor courtyard."

      "title": "If Saturn is in the 4th House, you’ll buy an antique home before your middle age.",
      "content": "If Saturn is in the 4th House, you’ll buy an antique home before your middle age. Saturn rules over discipline, tradition, and order, so you’ll be drawn to property that comes with a lot of history. You’ll also be charmed by architectural elements from another era. Because you’ll have budgeted for a house over the course of your life, you’ll have a lot of money to spare after you make this purchase. [4] X Research source Saturn will guide you to find a home that’s been well cared for over the years, so you won’t have to spend funds fixing it. [5] X Research source It’s also highly likely that your house will be furnished with valuable collectibles and decor from previous owners."

      "content": "If Jupiter is in the 4th House, you’ll buy a secure home in your early thirties. Jupiter draws in highly analytical thinkers, so your house will be designed by experienced architects and engineers. They’ll focus on adding the best alarm system to your house and make sure it passes a structural home inspection. You’ll be able to feel confident in your investment and feel safe in your new property. While Jupiter will allow you to have a sturdy and well protected home, it also enhances your chances to buy a wood house with a charming, traditional exterior. [6] X Research source Your house will be insured against earthquakes, fire, and burglaries, so you can travel without worrying about any accidents happening while you’re gone."

      "title": "If Mars is in the 4th House, you’ll buy a home that needs renovations in your forties.",
      "content": "If Mars is in the 4th House, you’ll buy a home that needs renovations in your forties. The best time to purchase property is when Ketu, a “shadow planet” south of the Moon, is aligned with Mars. Ketu will inspire you to be clever and creative about your purchasing decision, and you’ll feel more motivated to buy a house that will be really cheap but will also require a lot of work. By the end of your project, you’ll have the home of your dreams and feel proud of all that went into it. Since Mars is a fiery planet, Ketu’s influence will guide your decision-making and inspire you to buy a brick house that can withstand fires. Mars also drives you to take on new challenges, so you’re likely to keep finding new ways to improve the house you buy. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "If Mercury is in the 4th House, you’ll buy an upscale home in your mid-thirties. If Mercury is also in the 2nd, 7th, 10th, or 11th House, you’ll receive a salary that will help you purchase the best home on the market. As Mercury rules over communication and reasoning, you’ll be able to tell real estate agents exactly what you want. In the end, you’ll settle into a home that is a perfect match for your taste in style and design. Mercury also influences speed, so you’re likely to receive everything you want once it enters the Fourth House. Instead of needing to buy a lot of decor on your own, your home may be fully furnished in a way you just love. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "If Saturn and Ketu are in the 4th House, you’ll buy a comfortable home after you’re 44 or 52. Saturn will guide you toward a traditional home that has remained standing for a long time. Ketu will then inspire you to negotiate for the best property out of all your options. These two planets are a powerful force together, and they’ll drive you to search housing listings until you find a great fit with special additions, like a beautiful porch or guest bedroom. [9] X Research source When Saturn enters the Fourth House and you’re in your forties, you’ll have a very clear vision of a home you’ll want to retire in. You’ll be able to relax and enjoy your property for decades to come."

      "title": "If Sun and Ketu are in the 4th House, you’ll buy a home you’ll need to insure after you’re 52.",
      "content": "If Sun and Ketu are in the 4th House, you’ll buy a home you’ll need to insure after you’re 52. If you wait until later in life to purchase your property, then the combination of Sun and Ketu will increase your chances of securing it. However, since the Sun’s energy usually draws in challenges, your home will be built in a location that is scenic but sometimes faces intense weather conditions, such as heavy winds. Ketu’s creative power will remind you to invest in the best home insurance to protect yourself. [10] X Research source The Sun and Ketu will also help you find interesting, unusual properties, such as quirky cabins or even huts. This planetary combination will also make sure you keep a sense of adventure in the second half of your life—your home might require you to gather wood for a stove, draw water from a well, or can lots of food in preparation for the winter."

In order to make sure you make the right decision, the Fourth House will inspire you to act at just the right time. [11] X Research source The Moon enhances your intuition, as well.

With its influence, you’ll be able to think about what you’ll need in the long-term—for instance, if you love to garden, then you’ll insist on a home with a large backyard.

      "content": "The Second House protects your wealth so you can afford a house. Sometimes called the “House of Possession,” the Second House makes sure we hold onto what we’ve earned. It will also reveal how you’d like to invest your money once you’ve saved enough of it. You’ll know exactly when to put down a large down payment, and you’ll feel secure knowing you’ll still have enough funds in the bank after a significant purchase. [14] X Research source Taurus and Venus rule over the Second House—all that earthy energy will allow you to focus on stability."
