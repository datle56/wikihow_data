Each Mega Millions ticket costs $2 USD to play (or $3 USD if you add the “Megaplier”), and there is no limit on the number of tickets you can buy at one time. When you purchase your ticket, you will need to choose six numbers. [1] X Research source The six numbers are split into two parts: the five main \"white\" numbers range between 1 and 70, while the gold \"Mega Ball\" number ranges between 1 and 25. You can select your own numbers or purchase an \"Easy Pick\" ticket that automatically selects random numbers for you. For an extra $1 USD, the “Megaplier” increases the non-jackpot winning amounts by up to five times, based on a separate drawn number. Mega Millions tickets can typically be purchased at gas stations, grocery stores, and convenience stores. You need to be 18 or older to play the Mega Millions, and you may have to show a valid photo ID."

Take it to any authorized lottery ticket seller (grocery store, etc.) in your state for validation. If you win a small amount, you’ll be paid on the spot; otherwise, you’ll end up dealing with the lottery authority in your state. [4] X Research source Anyone authorized to sell Mega Millions lottery tickets is also authorized to accept winning tickets. You don’t have to go to the same outlet where you bought your ticket, but you do have to go somewhere in the same state as where you bought your ticket. When turning in your ticket, you’ll need to sign the back. If the prize exceeds $599, you will likely need to complete a claim form and send it into the state's lottery commission. Make sure that you claim the ticket winnings within the correct deadline. The exact deadline varies by state, but it can range anywhere from 90 days to one year."

      "content": "Buy more than one ticket. The only proven, mathematically valid way to increase your odds of winning is to buy more than one ticket each time you play. Your chances will still be low, but they do improve with each set of numbers you play. [5] X Research source Make sure to pick a different set of numbers for each ticket, or you won’t improve your odds at all! Your odds of winning the jackpot (as of 2023) with one ticket are approximately 1 in 303 million. So, if you buy 2 tickets, your odds become 1 in 156.5 million. Meanwhile, your odds of winning $4 USD are 1 in 89. So buying two tickets (at a cost of $4 USD total) brings your odds of breaking even to 1 in 44.5."

Playing the odds tells you that you’re better off buying more tickets for fewer drawings, rather than buying a smaller number of tickets for more drawings. Confused? Consider the following: [6] X Research source If you buy 1 ticket for every drawing, your odds of winning the jackpot are always 1 in 303 million. But, if you buy 4 tickets for every fourth drawing (and no tickets in between), you’ve spent the same amount ($8 USD) but improved your odds of winning the jackpot for that one drawing to 1 in 76 million."

But taking the lump sum payment does improve your odds of maximizing the jackpot if you do win! While the full jackpot gets paid out annually over 30 years, the lump sum gives you half the jackpot amount all at once. But, if you invest most of that lump sum amount wisely, you’ll almost certainly end up with more than the jackpot amount at the end of 30 years. [7] X Research source Say, for instance, the jackpot is $450 million USD, and you choose the lump sum amount ($225 million). If you invest $200 million and get a fairly conservative 5% annual rate of return over 30 years, that $200 million will grow to over $850 million USD. [8] X Research source"

Ideally, you should aim for either three odd and two even numbers, or three even and two odd numbers. Go ahead and pick either even or odd for the Mega Ball. Even if you don't maintain an ideal ratio, avoid having all odd or all even numbers. Very few past winning combinations have been all odds or all evens. Please note that there’s no statistical basis for this method (or any other listed in this section) to actually improve your odds of winning.

But you can make sure that at least three or four of the eight number groups are represented. For example, instead of picking 13, 17, 19, 30, 33 (only two number groups), try something like 13, 27, 29, 30, 43 (four number groups)."

It's just as unlikely that all five numbers will be \"cold\" as it is that all five will be \"hot.\" Also note that it is impossible to predict when a cold number will enter into circulation again. Two cold numbers can be inactive for equal amounts of time, and one might suddenly become hot while the other stays cold."

Number combinations that have won in the past are unlikely to win again (or at least it feels that way), so duplicating a winning combination from the past seems like it’s destined to end in failure.

There has been one set of five numbers drawn twice since the start of Mega Millions (11-14-18-33-48). [9] X Research source"

Similarly, avoid choosing any set of five consecutive numbers. Consecutive strings are so poorly balanced that they are extremely rare and almost never occur. Note, however, that it is not uncommon for two numbers within a string of five to directly follow one another (e.g., 15 and 16, 43 and 44, 59 and 60, etc.). Consecutive pairs are okay, but consecutive strings of five are very rare."

But, in a random drawing like the Mega Millions, perfect patterns are quite rare and probably won't win. One pattern people mistakenly play involves creating a straight line vertically or diagonally across the number ticket. Number multiples (e.g., 4-8-12-16-20, 8-16-24-32-40, etc.) are another pattern people tend to gravitate toward erroneously. A final pattern you should avoid involves choosing numbers that all have the same last digit (e.g., 7-17-27-37-47)."

Let the computer do the hard work of selecting the perfect set of numbers for you! Using a randomized system to blindly choose the numbers you play can actually work to your favor. You'll be more likely to end up with a set of numbers that is truly random, rather than a set that has been subliminally influenced by your own biases and ideas. If you plan on purchasing more than one ticket, consider both strategies. Choose your numbers for one ticket and let the machine choose random numbers for your second ticket."
