      "content": "A bindi is a traditional religious symbol in Hinduism. If someone wears a red dot between their brows, it’s most likely because they’re Hindu. Traditionally, men and women wear bindis to show their faith and open their “mind’s eye.” The ornament is placed over a person’s sixth chakra or third eye to symbolize spiritual sight or what the physical eye can’t see. The word “bindi” comes from the Sanskrit word bindu , which means drop or particle. Today, Hindu women are mostly seen with bindis; however, men may still wear them for religious occasions or ceremonies.

Similarly to how a Christian wears a cross, or a Muslim woman wears a hijab, a bindi shows the support and pride of a religious culture.

      "content": "Bindis are a sign of marriage. Hindu women place a red mark on their forehead to let others know they’re married. If a Hindu woman sports a black bindi , it’s a sign she’s not married.

      "content": "A bindi helps awaken the spirit. Spirituality is a big part of Hindu culture. Hindus often mark their foreheads before practicing yoga, praying, or entering a temple or other sacred space. The bindi is said to help open their third eye , allowing them to perceive the world in a new light and remind them of their life’s purpose. [4] X Research source In Hindu culture, the third eye or seventh chakra is known as the ajna chakra , which, when activated, is believed to overcome Ahaṁkāra or the ego."

      "content": "Some people wear jeweled bindis, instead. Many Hindu women have added more glitz and glam to the traditional red bindi by decorating their third eye with stick-on jewels. Sticker bindis are often worn during festivities or celebrations as a sign of beauty and prosperity. The jewel or gem is applied between the brows (like a traditional bindi) with an adhesive. [6] X Research source Sticker bindis come in all shapes, sizes, and colors and can be reused. Some Hindus frown against these glamorous, fashion-forward bindis and prefer the traditional application. However, they’re becoming more widely accepted, and many Hindu women prefer using a stick-on application every day."

      "content": "If you’re not Hindu, avoid wearing a bindi as an accessory. Bindis are traditional religious symbols that represent an entire culture. The origins of this simple mark are rooted deep in Indian culture, and wearing one as a beauty mark or fashion accessory could be seen as cultural appropriation. Cultural appropriation is an inappropriate adoption of a cultural or religious symbol that ignores the symbol’s original origin. [7] X Research source For instance, wearing a bindi for a Halloween costume would be inappropriate if you’re not celebrating your own Hindu culture. [8] X Research source Rather than wearing a bindi as an accessory or costume, research its culture (Hinduism) to learn about its significance and origin—reading this article is just the start!"

If you resonate with the bindi’s meaning and it’s culturally appropriate for you to wear one, go for it. [9] X Research source"
