      "content": "Either rent or buy a vehicle that is fairly heavy, lots of room for gear; preferably an SUV or minivan of some sort. Pay close attention to your gas gauge because the last thing you want to happen is to run out of gas when you're just yards away from a tornado. Make sure that the vehicle is as fast or as heavy as possible; fast so that you can escape quickly, or heavy so that in the event that you do come in close contact with the tornado, your vehicle may be able to withstand the winds. The most ideal storm chasing vehicle in the world is the T.I.V. (Tornado intercept vehicle), but this vehicle was hand built by an IMAX film maker and costs tens of thousands of dollars to make. You may choose to create such a vehicle if you decide you want to make a career out of storm chasing."

      "content": "Outfit your chosen vehicle with the essential emergency lighting, HAM radios, search and rescue gear, and comfort essentials. The emergency lighting can be useful not only to warn people that you are speeding toward the storm. It will serve as a beacon for rescue parties to help locate you and your vehicle in the debris after the storm has passed. You may need to armor your vehicle with at least 1/4\" thick steel plating or at the very least steel mesh netting. Remember, you might be spending a lot of time in this vehicle and you want to be comfortable. Also, be sure to get the appropriate SKYWARN training class and then get the stickers so that you will be an official storm observer."

You may choose to film the tornado during your retreat."

You should also understand how to read a radar, such as radial velocity, nautical mile ranges on radars, understand what NEXTRAD is. Don't let this intimidate you. It takes years of experience. Sometimes even the experts who have done this for years make mistakes and get hurt. If you want to chase storms, look for a reputable storm chasing tour company and book a tour."
