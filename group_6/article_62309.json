      "content": "Pick an outfit that you can quickly take off and put back on. Sweatpants, athletic shorts, and baggy T-shirts are all a great choice to wear to a massage. For a high-end salon, try something like a jumpsuit or a romper. Avoid wearing anything tight or form-fitting, since you’ll likely be covered in lotion or oil after your appointment. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Wear comfortable undergarments that you wouldn’t mind getting oily. Even if you take off your underwear during your appointment, they might still get some massage oil on them when you get dressed afterwards. Wear sandals or sneakers that you can easily kick off before your appointment."

      "content": "Get your hair out of the way of your neck and shoulders. Bring a scrunchie or a clip with you to secure your hair before your appointment. Plus, this will keep your hair from getting oily or greasy as your massage therapist works on you. [2] X Research source Some massage therapists will massage your scalp as part of your appointment. If you don’t want them to touch your hair or massage your scalp, just tell them ahead of time."

      "title": "No need to wear makeup, as it's likely to get smudged on the massage table.",
      "content": "No need to wear makeup, as it's likely to get smudged on the massage table. There’s no need to get super ready for a massage—this is all about your relaxation. Stick to minimal makeup if you’d like to do it, or just come with a fresh face. [3] X Research source Some massage therapists will massage your face, but you can ask them not to if you’d prefer them to avoid it. Similarly, avoid using fake tanner before a massage appointment, since it will likely get smudged by the lotion or oil your therapist uses."

      "title": "Wear as much or as little clothing as you’d like during the massage.",
      "content": "Wear as much or as little clothing as you’d like during the massage. When it’s time for your appointment, feel free to take off some, all, or none of your clothing. Most people dress down to their underwear for the first time, while others are completely fine being naked under the massage blanket. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A massage is all about your comfort, so do what feels right for you and your body. Rest assured that your massage therapist will keep your body covered up the entire time. If they’re not working on a particular area, it will stay covered up underneath a blanket or sheet. If you don’t want to take any of your clothes off, let your massage therapist know. They can modify the massage to meet your comfort level."

      "title": "Do a quick wash at home so your body is clean before your appointment.",
      "content": "Do a quick wash at home so your body is clean before your appointment. It’s polite to do a hygiene check before coming in for a massage. Clean your body with body wash, and put on some deodorant before coming in. [5] X Research source Don’t use any heavy fragrances, like perfume or cologne, out of respect for your massage therapist. Strong scents could be overpowering during your appointment. Don’t worry about shaving any body hair if you don’t want to. Massage therapists have seen all sorts of body types, and they definitely won’t judge however much or however little body hair you have."

      "title": "Drink water throughout the day before your massage.",
      "content": "Drink water throughout the day before your massage. Massages can be dehydrating, so sip on water to keep your fluid levels up. However, avoid guzzling a whole bottle of water before your appointment—it will probably just make you have to pee during your massage. [6] X Research source Make sure you drink plenty of water after your massage, too."

      "title": "Try not to get super full to avoid any discomfort.",
      "content": "Try not to get super full to avoid any discomfort. You’ll probably be lying on your stomach for at least part of your massage appointment. Feel free to eat like normal throughout the day, but don’t chow down on a huge feast right beforehand. Otherwise, you might feel a bit uncomfortable. [7] X Research source Don’t drink any alcohol before your appointment, either. Massages are meant to be relaxing and peaceful, and being inebriated could lessen that effect."

      "title": "Put your phone on silent to avoid distractions during the massage.",
      "content": "Put your phone on silent to avoid distractions during the massage. Before your appointment, your massage therapist will likely direct you to a chair or cabinet where you can put your personal items. Be sure to put your phone on silent so it doesn’t ring during your appointment. [8] X Research source Your massage therapist will likely play some relaxing music during your appointment."

    {
      "title": "Communicate with your massage therapist before and during the massage.",
      "content": "Communicate with your massage therapist before and during the massage. If it’s your first massage, you’ll likely chat with your therapist about what your goals are for the session and any spots that have been bothering you. During your massage, feel free to speak up and ask them to adjust the pressure or move to a different area. No need to feel awkward—your massage is all about you! Your therapist wants you to speak up so they know you feel comfortable and relaxed."

      "title": "If you feel uncomfortable being touched on a specific body part, speak up.",
      "content": "If you feel uncomfortable being touched on a specific body part, speak up. Some people don’t like to have their feet touched, while others are very ticklish in certain areas. If there are any spots you don’t want them to work on, let them know beforehand. [9] X Research source “My back is super ticklish; could you avoid that area if you can?” “I’m not a fan of anyone touching my feet. I’d love it if we could skip that area.”"

      "title": "Massage therapists are used to people falling asleep during appointments.",
      "content": "Massage therapists are used to people falling asleep during appointments. Don’t feel pressured to talk to your massage therapist. If you fall asleep during the massage, great! And if you don’t, that’s fine, too. [10] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source Don’t worry about any other bodily functions that might happen during your massage, either. Drooling, snoring, passing gas—your massage therapist has seen it all, and they know how to handle things professionally."

      "title": "A tip isn’t necessary, but it’s considered polite.",
      "content": "A tip isn’t necessary, but it’s considered polite. After your massage when you’re checking out, there will likely be a tip option. It’s customary to tip 20%, but you can adjust that based on your experience. [11] X Research source If you had a really great experience, feel free to tip more than 20%. You can also write a stellar review on the massage therapist’s website to bring them more business. You can also bring cash to tip your massage therapist directly."

      "title": "Don’t talk about sex or make them feel uncomfortable in any way.",
      "content": "Don’t talk about sex or make them feel uncomfortable in any way. You may have heard jokes about “happy ending” massages before, but those jokes usually aren’t received well by professional massage therapists. Treat them with respect and behave appropriately so you’ll both have a pleasant experience. Even joking about sexual acts is enough to get you kicked out of some massage therapist's offices."
