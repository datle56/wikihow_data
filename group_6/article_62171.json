      "title": "The Bible does mention ghosts, but doesn’t clarify if they’re real.",
      "content": "The Bible does mention ghosts, but doesn’t clarify if they’re real. The word “ghost” appears many times in the Bible, but mostly to refer to the Holy Ghost, or Holy Spirit. Sometimes, like when Jesus walks on water in Matthew 14, the apostles claim he’s a ghost. [1] X Research source They also fear they see a ghost in Luke 24, when Jesus appears to them in the upper room, after his death. [2] X Research source Of course, neither of these events involve actual ghosts, but rather Jesus performing miracles. The fact that the apostles fear ghosts doesn’t mean the Bible is telling us that ghosts are real, just that they’ve been a superstition since even Jesus’ time."

      "title": "The Bible does imply that spirits of the dead might speak to us.",
      "content": "The Bible does imply that spirits of the dead might speak to us. In Matthew 17, Jesus leads a few apostles up a mountain, where he speaks with Moses and Elijah, two long-dead prophets. [3] X Research source If Jesus can speak to the dead, then that may be evidence that the dead can speak to others. Or, it may just be another one of Jesus’ miracles! In 2 Kings 6, Elisha asks God to open the eyes of his servant, so that the servant can see the heavenly hosts protecting their town. Some read these heavenly hosts as ghosts, while others take them for angels."

      "title": "The Bible warns against trying to speak to spirits.",
      "content": "The Bible warns against trying to speak to spirits. Leviticus 19:31 says, “Do not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists, for you will be defiled by them.” [4] X Research source Deuteronomy 18:11 forbids the practice of mediums and consulting the dead. [5] X Research source There are similar warnings in 2 Kings 21:6, and Isaiah 8:19. Interestingly, these passages don’t say that ghosts don’t exist, or that they don’t speak to us, only that we shouldn’t practice witchcraft or consult mediums to speak with the dead, as these practices often lead us astray and toward darkness."

      "title": "The Bible suggests that houses don’t become haunted.",
      "content": "The Bible suggests that houses don’t become haunted. Job 7:9-10 says, “As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.” [6] X Research source This suggests that spirits don’t “return” to their homes to haunt them, like in many depictions of ghosts."

      "title": "The Church doesn’t have a concrete answer about ghosts.",
      "content": "The Church doesn’t have a concrete answer about ghosts. If you read the section above, you’re probably scratching your head. Does the Bible say ghosts are real, or not? The truth is, the Church itself can’t seem to pin down an answer. That said, many theologians say that God may permit a spirit to appear to the living, but the living must not attempt to consult with spirits—it’s God’s job to decide when it happens. [7] X Research source This goes for most Christian denominations, not just Catholics! Most denominations don’t take a hard stance for or against the existence of ghosts. Most church leaders prefer to trust in God’s power and mysterious methods, and focus on achieving eternal life after death; not talking with the dead before we pass on, ourselves."

      "title": "Theologians tend to disagree about the existence of ghosts.",
      "content": "Theologians tend to disagree about the existence of ghosts. St. Augustine, one the most respected church scholars, rejects the possibility of ghosts, and argues that “ghosts” are more like “spiritual memories.” But St. Thomas Aquinas, an equally respected scholar, says that “...it is absurd to say that the souls of the departed do not leave their abode.” [8] X Research source This just goes to show that not even the experts can agree on the topic!"

    {
      "title": "The Bible describes heaven as being with the Lord.",
      "content": "The Bible describes heaven as being with the Lord. The Bible says surprisingly little about the afterlife—at least, there are few concrete details. There are many mentions of heaven, or a paradise for the souls of believers to inhabit after they die. 2 Corinthians has perhaps the most thorough description, saying heaven is an “eternal house” that is “away from the body and at home with the Lord.” [9] X Research source This means we won’t have our bodies in heaven, just our spirits, or souls."
    },
    {
      "title": "The Bible does warn us about hell.",
      "content": "The Bible does warn us about hell. Revelations 21 describes hell, which is an eternal “second death” for those who reject God. In the Bible, hell is often depicted as a place full of suffering and torment (Revelations 14, 2 Thessalonians 1, Matthew 25). [10] X Research source Most importantly, hell is eternal life without the presence of God—the opposite of Heaven."

      "title": "Many denominations believe that spirits need prayers to enter heaven.",
      "content": "Many denominations believe that spirits need prayers to enter heaven. Every Christian denomination believes in heaven, but not all of them agree on how you get there. Catholics and others believe that if we pray for the dead, their time in purgatory, which is sort of like Heaven’s waiting room, is shortened. [11] X Research source Others, like Protestants and Anglicans, reject this idea, saying that prayers don’t affect getting into heaven. This rejection is a response to many Church leaders offering “indulgences,” or payments in exchange for spiritual favors, like prayers for the dead."

    {
      "title": "Angels appear many times in the Bible, and are different from ghosts.",
      "content": "Angels appear many times in the Bible, and are different from ghosts. Angels are present in the Bible at the very start, in Genesis, when God places a cherubim at the gates of Eden to guard it. [12] X Research source From there, angels appear often as messengers and aids to God’s disciples, as when Gabriel announces to Mary that she’s with child. It’s safe to say that angels are real, according to the Bible."

      "title": "The Bible suggests demons may disguise themselves as ghosts.",
      "content": "The Bible suggests demons may disguise themselves as ghosts. Demons, too, appear many times in the Bible. Satan himself is present in Eden, and later, Jesus casts many demons out from people who are possessed, like in Mark 5. [13] X Research source Demons are said to be malevolent forces who try to trick, deceive, and tempt mankind into sin, or to corrupt their spirituality. If demons can take different forms to trick us, it makes sense they might appear as ghosts. In 1 Samuel 28, Saul hires a medium to consult the spirit of the dead prophet Samuel, who does appear to scold Saul for trying to contact him. Some Church leaders say this was a demonic apparition, though, not a ghost. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Believers don’t need to worry about ghosts.",
      "content": "Believers don’t need to worry about ghosts. If “ghosts” are in fact real, then the Bible suggests that God will show them to us if we need to see them. Otherwise, as long as we aren’t trying to contact them ourselves, we’re all good. [15] X Research source And if we do see a demon masquerading as a spirit, so long as we believe in the Lord and trust Him to guide us, we need not fear—they won’t harm you physically, as “no weapon formed against you shall prosper (Isaiah 54:17). [16] X Research source As 1 Peter 5:8 says, “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.” [17] X Research source Stay vigilant by praying often and staying steadfast in your faith—attend mass, perform charity, and remember that the Lord holds ultimate power over evil."
