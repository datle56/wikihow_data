      "content": "Shake the bottle. Different sprays contain different ingredients, many of which can settle to the bottom of the bottle. To make sure you are getting the proper mixture, give your bottle a few gentle shakes. No need to shake it vigorously—just enough to mix it all up."

      "content": "Spray your entire, finished face of makeup in an \"X\" or \"T\" pattern. Hold the bottle 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) away from your face. Spray the product a few times, making sure you get full, even coverage. Spritzing in an “X” and “T” pattern is a good way to ensure coverage.

Primer and setting sprays can be used together to lock your look in place. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the spray dry naturally. Once you’ve sprayed your setting spray, let your face air-dry. It won’t take too long for your skin to absorb the spray. Don’t rub or blend the spray anywhere on your face, or you will risk messing up your makeup. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Reapply your setting spray throughout the day. Throw the setting spray into your purse to use it whenever you want. Depending on the specific setting spray you’ve chosen, it can cool you off, mattify your makeup, and rehydrate your skin throughout the day. If you touch up or reapply your makeup, make sure to spray again."

      "content": "Use a setting spray to dampen your foundation sponge in a pinch. Many people use a Beauty Blender , or a generic version of this well-known makeup sponge, to apply their liquid foundation. Experts recommend dampening the sponge before applying makeup. Instead of using water, try using setting spray. [4] X Research source This may not work with all sponges. Some brands may deteriorate from a setting spray, so be careful. The setting spray can also help prevent foundation from coming off over the course of a long day."

      "content": "Spray setting spray on your eyeshadow brush for bolder pigment. Some powder eyeshadows have light pigment, and it seems like you have to pack on multiple coats to get the bold, pigmented color you want. Setting spray can help with this. Take your shadow brush and dip it into your choice of powder eyeshadow. Then, before you apply it to your lid, spray the brush with your setting spray. This can help make the shadow more opaque once it’s applied. [5] X Research source The eyeshadow will be damp going onto your lid, but it will dry quickly. The setting spray can also help your eyeshadow stay in place and last all day without smudging or creasing."

      "content": "Spritz your under-eye concealer brush with setting spray for easier blending. To cover dark circles and make your eyes appear brighter, apply concealer under your eyes. Use your finger to dab on a few dots of the product. Then, spray your concealer brush with setting spray before using it to blend in the product. Dampening your brush with setting spray can make the concealer blend more easily. [6] X Research source The setting spray can also help hydrate the delicate skin under your eyes and keep the concealer from creasing."

      "content": "Look for a setting spray that matches your skin type. As with other facial products, different setting sprays work best on different skin types. [7] X Research source Here are some things you may want to consider before purchasing a setting spray based on your skin type: If you have very dry skin, avoid products with alcohol in them, which can dry out your skin even more. Instead, find alcohol-free setting sprays that have moisturizing and hydrating properties. If you have naturally oily skin, use an oil-free setting spray that provides a matte finish. If you have combination skin, play around with different setting sprays until you find one you like. Many sprays are marketed for all skin types, so those are a great place to start."

      "content": "Purchase a setting spray based on the climate you live in. During hot, humid days, makeup tends to “melt” off your face. Find a setting spray that is cooling and sweat-resistant. If you are in a cold climate or dead of winter, try a hydrating setting spray to protect your skin against the harsh, dry air."

      "title": "Pick a spray that gives you the finish you want.",
      "content": "Pick a spray that gives you the finish you want. This is a matter of personal preference. Some people like their finished makeup to be matte and completely shine-free. Others prefer a dewy, glowing look. Make sure you take this into consideration when you are picking a setting spray. Some will mattify your face, and others will give you a bit of a dewy sheen. [8] X Research source The type of finish will be labeled on the product’s packaging. Look for words such as “matte” and “dewy.”"

      "content": "Use a setting spray with SPF on sunny days. No matter how great our makeup looks, there is no better beauty hack than protecting your skin from the sun. If you are venturing out into the sunshine, find a setting spray that has SPF in it. Apply it to your face before heading out, and reapply it throughout the day.

      "content": "Do you apply setting spray before or after makeup? Setting spray works best when it’s applied after your makeup. Think of setting spray like a top coat of nail polish: it adds a beautiful shine to your look while adding another protective layer. While setting spray can be used on your foundation sponge or makeup brushes, it does its job best when applied over a finished makeup look."

      "content": "Do you need setting spray? No, setting spray isn’t necessary in every makeup routine. Setting spray is best for occasions when you want a full face of makeup to stay on for long periods of time (a night out, a date, a theater production, etc.). In other words, use setting spray when you don’t want your makeup to smudge, crease, fade, or slide off easily."
