      "content": "Scorpios are famous for letting the green-eyed monster take over. In love especially, Scorpio has no patience for even the slightest hints of disloyalty—and this definitely turns some people off to them. Flirting with other people while you’re dating Scorpio is a definite no-go, and if you mess with fire, you’re likely to see just how envious they can be. [1] X Research source But at the same time, Scorpio would never consider breaking their partner’s trust. That's why they find it so hurtful when others don't give them the same respect!"

      "title": "Scorpio is known for holding grudges.",
      "content": "Scorpio is known for holding grudges. Some signs want to drop an argument as soon as it's over, but Scorpio tends to dig their heels in.

But the truth is, every sign has faults, and if you’re willing to treat Scorpio with respect , you’re unlikely to have trouble. Dishonesty and betrayal are Scorpio's pet peeves.

      "content": "Scorpio definitely believes in “an eye for an eye.” If you cross Scorpio, they’re unlikely to forgive and forget—and some people really don't like this about them. Signs that take things less seriously might find Scorpio a little cruel, or even scary. Understandably, there are people who'd hate to think a friend or ex would \"get even\" if they made a mistake—and Scorpio probably would! Revenge isn’t a favorite pastime for all Scorpios, though. Plus, this sign just believes that if you do wrong, you should own up to it. It's not mean-spirited, but rather, a philosophy that some people don’t jive with."

      "content": "Smart and intuitive, Scorpios have little trouble controlling others. As a sharp water sign, Scorpios may seem to know more about you than you do. Plus, they really like for things to be done their way. And what does this lead to? At times, Scorpios might be a little too comfortable (and capable of) convincing you to say and do exactly what they want. [2] X Research source Power-seeking behavior is natural for Scorpio, not intentional. [3] X Research source But that doesn't make it okay. If your resident Scorpio is manipulating you, set a boundary and ask them to do better; they probably care a ton and will be willing to work at it."

      "content": "Scorpios have no interest in small talk, which makes them seem cold. This sign wants things to be real, authentic, and deep, 24/7.

      "content": "Scorpios are known for being ultra-mysterious and secretive. When you first meet this water sign, you’re unlikely to get their life story straightaway. Instead, Scorpio may hold back and wait to learn more about you first. When Scorpio trusts you, they’ll open up—but for a lot of people, their lack of reciprocation early on feels a little selfish. So for this reason, Scorpio earns a bad rep. For close connects though, this isn’t an issue. In fact, some love that Scorpio is a little stingy with their secrets. It can make friends and partners who do earn their trust feel special."

      "title": "Scorpio gives a lot to their relationships, and they expect a lot in return.",
      "content": "Scorpio gives a lot to their relationships, and they expect a lot in return. Scorpio doesn’t need you to be perfect, but they do expect you to put 110% into your relationship with them. Did they call you? You better call back. Did they tell you a big secret? You better keep it close to the chest. For some people, these standards feel unfair and suffocating, which earns Scorpio a bad rep. At the same time, you’ll never have another friend like Scorpio. Whatever they expect from you, they’ll give 5x more in return. Scorpio won’t tolerate any disrespect for their inner circle; you’ll always feel totally protected and loved."

      "content": "Scorpios aren’t always into open and honest communication. If they’re worried about your loyalties, there’s a decent chance that they’ll put you to the test. Scorpios, for instance, might drop a fake secret just to see if it gets out—and if it does, they’ll lose interest in you. To a lot of people, this tendency feels a little childish. The truth is though, Scorpio is just a little insecure. This sign has huge trust issues, and because they’ve been burned in the past, they may feel that they can't trust without insurance. This doesn’t make it right, but it does make it understandable."
