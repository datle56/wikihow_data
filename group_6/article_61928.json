[2] X Research source Agitate the solution with your hand or a whisk to distribute the soap and create bubbles. For even better leather protection, use a soap specially formulated for cleaning leather. These kinds of soaps are available at many general retailers, hardware stores, and craft stores. If you don’t have castile soap or a specialty leather cleaner, you can use a mild soap, like dish soap, as a substitute. [3] X Research source Always test your cleaning solution on an out of sight spot on the leather before using it to clean more visible parts. [4] X Research source"

Avoid using any kind of abrasive material, like a scrubbing pad, as these may scratch leather, creating cloudiness in its finish. Generally speaking, harsh cleaners should be avoided when cleaning leather. These can cause a negative reaction the deforms the leather’s surface."

Cleaning, especially, can leave leather brittle if you don’t replenish these oils with leather conditioner.

Durable items, like boots or jackets, might be the best candidates for machine-washing. [10] X Research source Don't wash leather that is brightly colored, as color may fade in the washing machine. Avoid washing leather items that have delicate seams or lots of detailing, unless you're comfortable risking damage to these features. If an item is expensive and needs to be cleaned, like a fancy pair of boots or a nice suede jacket , use a spot cleaning method or a professional cleaning service. [11] X Research source"
