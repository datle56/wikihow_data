      "content": "Saturn (Shani) is the planet that rules over death. Since Saturn is the farthest planet that's visible to the human eye, it governs endings. It's also a large, slow planet that applies a lot of pressure literally and metaphorically. Even though it's incredibly powerful, Saturn is seen as a malefic planet in Vedic astrology. Malefic simply means bad or negative. While these planets can have challenging implications for your chart, you can also focus on their effects so you know what to work on in your life."

Some astrologers argue that the Sun is a more powerful force, but others point out that Rahu can block the Sun's energy during a total solar eclipse."

      "content": "The South Node of the Moon (Ketu) brings about powerful self-realization in astrology. Think of this shadow planet's force as driving your inner energy. Its position helps you interpret the world around you, so yogis and sages would argue that it's one of the most powerful forces. [3] X Research source Ketu's power can also represent great conflict.
