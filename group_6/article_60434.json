      "content": "Notify your doctor that you’re experiencing contractions. Your doctor will likely ask you to take steps to stop the contractions before coming in for a visit, depending on your pregnancy history. It’s common for women to feel early contractions that either stop or turn out to be false contractions. However, your doctor needs to know that you are experiencing these symptoms and may need care soon. [1] X Research source Say, “I think I’m having early contractions. What do you recommend?” Ask, “When should I go to the hospital?”"

      "title": "Empty your bladder.",
      "content": "Empty your bladder. A full bladder can put added pressure on your abdomen, so emptying it can help relieve the contractions. [2] X Research source Holding in your urine also inflames your bladder, which affects your uterus and can cause contractions. [3] X Research source Plus, it will help you get comfortable while you wait for further instructions from your doctor."

Tilting to the left can help slow or stop contractions, so get comfortable on your bed or couch. [4] X Research source If you have someone who can help you, ask them to position the pillows and help you get comfortable. Try to relax to help your body stop the contractions. You can try listening to peaceful music or watching a distracting TV program or movie. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

Monitor the position of your pillows and ask for help with staying propped up if someone is with you. Lying on your back can worsen the contractions.

If possible, remain propped on your left side as you drink the fluids.

If you feel contractions, immediately stop your activity. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Talk to your family, friends, and coworkers about reducing your activity load. For example, say to family, “I need help with house cleaning right now. I’m feeling contractions, so I need to rest.”"

      "content": "Notice if your contractions happen randomly or infrequently. While normal labor contractions will be regular and frequent, false labor contractions will happen at odd intervals and periodically. You may have several really long contractions that cause you to be concerned, but they do not mean you are in active labor. [14] X Research source For example, you may have regular pains for half an hour, but then have a break from the contractions.
