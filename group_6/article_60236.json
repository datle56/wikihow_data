      "content": "Change the TV audio output setting to your soundbar. When you first connect your soundbar, the audio output device may not automatically change. Open your TV's menu and open the Sound settings. Look for an option labeled Audio Output , Output Device , or something similar.

      "content": "Connect your TV and soundbar with an HDMI cable . Paris recommends using the designated audio return channel (ARC) or eARC HDMI ports when you connect your TV to a soundbar.

Paris notes that using the ARC or eARC HDMI port allows you to use your TV’s remote to control the volume instead of the soundbar remote."

      "content": "Check the sound settings for a “TV + Soundbar” option. Open your TV’s menu and select the Sound or Audio settings. Look for the option labeled Output Device or Audio Output . Check the list for the option labeled TV+Soundbar so audio comes out from both speakers. Not all TVs will have this option, so it may not be possible to use your soundbar and speakers.

Connect your TV to your soundbar, and the “TV+Soundbar” option will appear on your TV’s sound output settings. [4] X Research source"

[6] X Research source If nothing else works, Paris says to check your TV’s audio settings for an Audio Delay or Lip Sync setting to manually sync the audio and video."
