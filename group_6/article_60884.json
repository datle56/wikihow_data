      "content": "Don't be afraid to keep using your older iPhone for a while. While you may not see the latest iOS features or the newest emoji, a lack of operating system updates doesn't mean your iPhone is suddenly unusable. Even if the latest apps no longer work, you can still place phone calls, browse the web, and even listen to music. If your iPhone no longer receives security updates, you could be more vulnerable to attacks. Always use secure passwords , and make sure you're using two-factor authentication with your Apple ID, as well as with any other services you use. Always keep the apps on your iPhone up to date, even when iOS updates are no longer available. Once your favorite apps are no longer usable or supported on your iPhone, it's time to consider an upgrade."

While it's not usually necessary to buy a new iPhone as soon as your older one can no longer receive updates, a lack of updates is a sign that your iPhone's hardware lags behind the newer models. Fortunately, thanks to iCloud, transferring your data to a new iPhone is super easy. Depending on your model, you may be able to trade it in for a discount on a newer model through Apple's Trade In program. Learn more at https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in ."

For one thing, it'll be great to have a backup phone if you ever drop or misplace your new one. A dedicated Apple TV remote—even an older iPhone will be easier to use than some of Apple remote models! An iPod—you can listen to your MP3s in the music app, or stick to streaming apps like Apple Music and Spotify. A dedicated e-reader—the Apple Books app is great for reading e-books, and you can even store them on your iPhone to read offline. A car-based infotainment system—mount it on your dashboard, connect to your car's Bluetooth (or to a Bluetooth dongle), and get driving directions, listen to music, and take phone calls on the go."
