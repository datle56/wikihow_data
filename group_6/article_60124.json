      "content": "Measure your waist with a soft tape measure. The tape measure has to bend around your waist, so it needs to be soft. Place the measuring tape directly against your skin about 4 inches (10 cm) below your belly button. Pull the tape around your back and circle back to the front to measure your waist . Many stores use this measurement, so keep track of your measurements on a piece of paper. [1] X Research source If you’re not measuring against your skin, you won’t get an accurate measurement Your natural waist is actually a bit higher, just slightly above your belly button. However, most jeans sit lower, so you won’t necessarily have to measure there. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Find your inseam by measuring your leg length from the crotch down. With your legs shoulder-width apart, measure the distance from your foot to your crotch on the inside of your leg, starting from where you’d like your jeans to fall on your foot or ankle. If necessary, ask someone you trust to help you get an accurate length. You’ll see this measurement often, especially in men’s sizes. [3] X Research source For instance, if you like your jeans a bit long, measure to the bottom of your foot. Try not to bend to read the measurement. If you don’t have someone to help you, use a mirror or mark the measurement with the finger holding the measuring tape. If you’re struggling to hold the measuring tape in place, try using adhesive tape to secure one end to your ankle while you hold the other at your crotch."

      "content": "Wrap the tape measure around the widest part of your hips. Some jeans will also have a hip measurement. To find yours , make sure the tape measure isn’t lifting or drooping in the back as you wrap it around your hips. You won’t see this measurement as often, but you can still use it if you’re measuring jeans before trying them on. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wrap the tape measure around the thickest part of your thigh. You’ll only need to measure one thigh to get your thigh measurement. If one is slightly thicker than the other, take the measurement for that thigh. Try not to pull the tape too tight or you’ll get an inaccurate measurement; the tape should be snug, but you should be able to slip one finger underneath. [5] X Research source This measurement is not very common in jeans, but it can still be helpful to know."

      "content": "Measure your front rise from your crotch to your belly button. Stretch a tape measure from just behind your crotch line up and over the front of your pelvis to your waist. For women, this is around the belly button; for men, usually an inch or two or a couple centimeters below. It can be helpful to wear a belt for the front rise measurement to give yourself an indication of where your jean waist would lie. You won’t see this measurement as much, but sometimes stores use it to define how high or low the jeans sit. [6] X Research source If you need to measure the back rise, do the same thing going the opposite direction."

In women’s jeans, the waist measurement will usually be the best indicator of size, though you may also use the inseam measurement. For men, use both the length and waist measurement when looking at a size chart. Note that sizes may run a little small or large, so it’s always best to check the actual chart.

Run a tape measure across the top of the jeans, and make sure the waist isn’t drooping or sagging at all. The waist measurement is one of the most common measurements you’ll see in a store. [8] X Research source Wrinkles can throw off your measurements, so make sure your jeans are as smooth as possible before measuring. Button and zip them up beforehand, as well. If your waistband is made from elastic material, don’t stretch it as you measure or you will get an inaccurate measurement. Make note of whether the jeans are labeled as “high-waisted” or “low rise.” If the jeans are intended to sit somewhere other than your natural waistline, you need to know that before buying a new pair."

Make sure the jeans are completely flat when taking this measurement . The inseam is typically used to measure length for pants and is often used by stores to help you find your size, especially for men’s jeans. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure from the crotch to the waist to find the rise. The rise determines where your jeans sit on your waist. Some pant sizes may offer a “front rise” and “back rise” measurement. The front rise is from the crotch to the waistband in front, and the back rise is from the crotch to the waistband in the back. Make note of both of these measurements. [10] X Research source It isn’t as common to see this measurement as it is to see waist or inseam measurements, but you may need it sometimes."

      "content": "Measure 2 in (5.1 cm) below the crotch seam to get the thigh thickness. Measure horizontally across one leg of the jeans. Then, double the number to get your thigh measurement. It’s unnecessary to measure both legs, as they should be the same size. This measurement also isn’t very common when shopping for jeans, but it will be helpful on occasions. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Compare these measurements to a size chart to find your size. For women’s jeans, the waist size will be the most important factor, though the inseam can determine whether you have a tall, regular, or petite pair of jeans. Men’s jeans include both the waist measurement and the length. Plug the measurements you took of your jeans into a size chart to determine the correct size for you. [12] X Research source Most shopping websites have size charts for their products, so if you’re looking for a particular brand, use their size chart to get the most accurate measurements. Keep in mind that with men’s jeans you may need to go up a few inches or centimeters in size. Many clothing manufacturers have intentionally made sizes smaller, a problem known as vanity sizing."

Mid-rise jeans fall just below your belly button, while high-rise sit closer to the natural waist, at your belly button or a bit above. If you need to, take a waist measurement where you prefer your jeans to fall. [13] X Research source"

Plus, many stores will also have size descriptions on the product page, which may include the hip measurement and front rise measurement, so you can get a clearer idea of what you’re buying. [17] X Research source Always be aware of vanity sizing, as you may not be the same size at every store. Don’t worry so much about the “correct” size and instead focus on finding the right measurements. That holds true for men’s sizes, too, which are measured in theory but can also fall prey to being different sizes across stores. If you’re shopping for jeans online, read customer feedback and reviews to get a sense for how the pants fit, like if they run large or small. Consider buying from retailers with generous return policies for online sales so you can trade them in for another pair if you need to."

With the stress from repeated wearing, most jeans loosen up slightly over time, becoming more comfortable to wear.
