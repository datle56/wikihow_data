      "content": "This means clothing that is pure white. The clothes shouldn't contain any designs, labels, or patterns. These clothes can be bleached with chlorine bleach, as they don't contain any other colors and won't be damaged in the process. [1] X Research source Wash your white clothes on hot to kill germs and brighten the fabric. Hot water won't fade whites like it does other colors. Dry them on high heat. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Put white items with labels or designs in this container.",
      "content": "Put white items with labels or designs in this container. Include pastel colors like light yellow, light green, pink, and yellow. Wash these items in warm water. Avoid washing them in hot water, as this can cause the colors to fade. Dry them on medium heat. [3] X Research source Throw in khakis and light blues in this hamper, too!"
    },
    {
      "title": "This includes clothes that are black, dark gray, blue, and purple.",
      "content": "This includes clothes that are black, dark gray, blue, and purple. Include red and orange (unless you want to separate bright colors from dark colors). Wash these in cold water, as colder temperatures are more gentle on the fabric. That way the colors won't fade! [4] X Research source Dry them on low heat. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Throw in reds, pinks, and oranges.",
      "content": "Throw in reds, pinks, and oranges. These items are the most likely to bleed during the washing cycle, so it's a good idea to wash them separately if you have the time. Wash these items in cold water to ensure the colors stay bright. Dry them on low heat. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Denim tends to bleed during the first few washing cycles.",
      "content": "Denim tends to bleed during the first few washing cycles. Wash denim clothes like jeans, jean jackets, and other pieces to ensure that there's no dye transfer. Put all of your denim clothes together and wash them in cold to warm water. When drying, dry them on medium heat. Hotter temperatures can wear down and fade the denim. [7] X Research source Wash your jeans inside out to prevent the color from fading. You don't want those chic dark-wash jeans to become light-wash jeans after a few washes! To really preserve the color of your denim clothes, hand wash and air dry them."

    {
      "title": "This also includes anything with trim, beading, or sequins.",
      "content": "This also includes anything with trim, beading, or sequins. Be sure to check the label before putting these clothes in the washer or dryer. They may need to be hand-washed. If not, choose the delicates cycle if your washer has one. Sometimes delicates need to be air-dried. Check the label, and if they don't, dry them on low heat. This helps prevent damaging the fabric. [8] X Research source Include crochet fabrics and pantyhose in this pile. Consider using a delicates bag to give your clothes extra protection in the washer and dryer. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Some clothes may need special cleaning solution before washing.",
      "content": "Some clothes may need special cleaning solution before washing. If you recently spilled breakfast cereal on your favorite shirt and got grass stains on your jeans (it happens to the best of us!), make a separate pile for stained clothing while you sort. Spray the clothes with stain removal spray or apply a stain remover pen. After, put each clothing item in their designated pile (whites, light colors, dark colors, etc.). [10] X Research source You can also remove stains using vinegar or a mixture of 4 tablespoons (59 mL) baking soda and 1 ‚ÅÑ 4 cup (59 mL) of water."

      "title": "Wash and dry new clothing items on their own to see how they react.",
      "content": "Wash and dry new clothing items on their own to see how they react. Clothing items like brightly-colored sweaters or a new pair of jeans may bleed or damage other clothes in the washing and drying cycle. They may not, though! Test out how they react by washing and drying them on their own. [11] X Research source For example, let's say you just got a cute white blouse with a purple design on the front. Wash it alone and check if the water turns purple or becomes discolored. If it doesn't, that shirt is probably safe to wash with other light colors!"
