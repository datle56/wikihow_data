      "content": "There are two types of data roaming: domestic and international. These two types of data roaming both occur when you connect to a network other than your home network, but have a few differences. Domestic data roaming happens when you connect to a tower outside of your home network while you're in your country of residence. In areas where certain cellular providers don't have much service, these providers may work with providers that do have towers in the area to provide coverage to their customers. [2] X Research source Most providers don't charge an extra fee for domestic data roaming, but your data usage might be limited. Domestic data roaming isn't as common as it used to be, but you may still encounter it if you live somewhere very remote. International data roaming happens when you connect to a tower outside your home network while traveling overseas. This is the type of data roaming that most people are used to. Unlike domestic data roaming, international data roaming will incur (sometimes quite high) fees from your provider unless you have international roaming included in your plan."

      "content": "Keep roaming on if you don't travel abroad or you have a roaming plan. If you don't travel internationally, you can keep data roaming on without fear of a huge bill (but always ask your mobile provider first to check if they charge domestic roaming fees). This is especially important if you live in a remote area without great coverage in your home network. You can also keep data roaming on if you have an international data roaming plan. Some mobile providers include data roaming in their cellular plans, and others have the ability to add international data roaming for a flat daily charge. Call your provider to ask about this if you plan on traveling abroad and want to use cellular on your phone overseas."

      "title": "Turn it off if you don't have a roaming plan or your phone is dying quickly.",
      "content": "Turn it off if you don't have a roaming plan or your phone is dying quickly. If you don't want to get an international roaming plan or your provider doesn't have one, you should keep data roaming off if you're traveling abroad to avoid the expensive fees. You should also turn data roaming off if your phone's battery drains faster than usual, as roaming makes your phone search for cell towers more frequently. You should also turn off data roaming if you spend most of your time in an area where your home network has sufficient coverage because it could lead to an expensive surprise if you end up traveling abroad and forget to disable it."

Some countries may offer relatively cheap, contract-free prepaid phones. Some of these phones may also require a SIM card, so check the phone's packaging or ask the seller for more information."
