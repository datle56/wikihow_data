      "content": "“Stitch incoming” means a creator used content from another video. On TikTok, the Stitch feature allows creators to take a small clip from a user’s content and add it to their video. When a user puts “Stitch incoming” in the caption or video, they’re letting viewers know that they are including content from another user’s video and responding to it. [1] X Research source TikTok automatically adds “#stitch with” and a link to the original user’s content in the creator’s video caption. The Stitch feature is used to respond to or add to another user’s content. So, it’s commonly used for commentary and reaction videos. Some users make videos to be stitched. They might pose a question like, “What’s the greatest song of all time,” and ask users to stitch the video with their answer. TikTok rolled out the Stitch feature in September 2020."

      "content": "“Stitch incoming” helps prevent viewers from scrolling past the video. The clip that a user stitches might be different from their typical content. Because the stitched clip plays at the very beginning of the video, viewers might get confused and scroll past it. So, creators add “Stitch incoming” to tell their viewers that their response or commentary is coming after the stitched content. For instance, a creator who shares information about sustainability might stitch a clip from a user’s fast-fashion haul. The creator’s viewers might be surprised to see a clothing haul on their For You Page, so the “Stitch incoming” caption lets them know there’s different content to come. Because the Stitch feature is used a lot in commentary and response videos, the clips can be controversial. So, “Stitch incoming” also lets viewers know that the creator doesn’t support the clipped content’s message."

In the bottom right corner, look for the “Share” icon, which looks like a white arrow. Then, scroll through the menu at the bottom of the screen and press the “Stitch” icon. [2] X Research source TikTok lets their users decide if their videos can be stitched or not. So, not every video is stitchable."

Simply scroll through the user’s video to select what part you want to respond to. If you don’t need all 5 seconds, simply drag the highlighted bar down. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "A Duet is 2 side-by-side videos while a Stitch is 2 sequential videos. Duets and Stitches both involve a creator using another user’s content in their video. In a Duet, the creator's recording plays at the same time as the original user’s video on a split screen. This is different from a Stitch, which shows a clip from an existing user’s content followed by the creator’s video. [7] X Research source Duets are commonly used in singing, dancing, and comedy videos, where the creator plays off of the original user’s video."

      "content": "“Stitch incoming” refers to using content from an existing video. When watching YouTube Shorts, you might see creators title their videos “Stitch incoming” or add a “Stitch incoming” banner directly in the video. This means the creator clipped content from another user’s video into their own using YouTube’s Sampled Content feature. [8] X Research source Like on TikTok, “Stitch incoming” lets the creator’s viewers know that their commentary or response is coming after the clipped content. As of now, this feature is only available for YouTube Shorts. Some users upload TikToks to YouTube shorts. So, some videos titled or labeled “Stitch incoming” might be stitched content from TikTok."
