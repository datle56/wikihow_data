      "title": "Wear comfortable shoes you can walk in all day.",
      "content": "Wear comfortable shoes you can walk in all day. When you’re at Disneyland or Walt Disney World, expect to do a lot of walking; many visitors average upward of 20,000 or even 30,000 steps a day. Opt for a pair of lightweight, breathable sneakers, or a comfy pair of sandals if you plan on taking it easy. It may be a good idea to pack a second pair, just in case! [1] X Research source Needless to say, you should probably leave your high heels at home! Don’t buy new sneakers for your trip, either. Wear shoes that are already broken in so you’re less likely to get blisters. Consider a pair of anti-blister socks to protect your feet, as well."

      "title": "Wear a lightweight T-shirt or tank top to stay cool.",
      "content": "Wear a lightweight T-shirt or tank top to stay cool. Even if you’re not visiting in the summer, you’ll probably get hot after walking around all day, so you don’t want to be stuck sweating in long sleeves. Choose a T-shirt or tank top made of a lightweight, breathable material—bonus points if it’s Disney-themed! [2] X Research source Lightweight T-shirt dresses are another great option for walking around in the sun all day. If you don’t already have a Disney shirt , find one online or in a store (Walmart and Target almost always have Disney shirts, as do stores like Hot Topic). Or, buy one from the gift shop when you arrive at Disneyland!"

      "title": "Carry a sweater or jacket in case you get chilly.",
      "content": "Carry a sweater or jacket in case you get chilly. While Disneyland and Walt Disney World are still relatively warm in the winter compared to other places, it never hurts to bring a jacket. Even in the warmer months, the temperature can vary depending on the time of day and where you are in the park. Bring a lightweight layer that you can easily put on or take off whenever you need to. [3] X Research source Bringing a rain jacket or poncho is also a good idea. Always check the weather before you head out for the park so you know what to expect."

      "title": "Wear leggings or pants that have some stretch.",
      "content": "Wear leggings or pants that have some stretch. It’s important to wear pants that you can move and breathe in. After all, you don’t want to spend your day chafing from wearing rough denim. Leggings are always a great option, but wear any pants or jeans you know you can walk in all day. Shorts work, too, if the weather is going to be hot. [4] X Research source If you choose to wear a skirt or a dress, consider wearing bike shorts underneath to prevent chafing."

      "title": "Bring a hat and sunglasses to keep the sun out of your eyes.",
      "content": "Bring a hat and sunglasses to keep the sun out of your eyes. While you may have a pair of sunglasses you love, consider buying an inexpensive pair for your Disney trip just in case they get lost or broken. Pair them with a simple baseball cap so you stay cool and don’t have to squint when the sun is beating down on you. [5] X Research source Bucket hats, sun hats, or visors are also great options. If you plan on riding a lot of rides, be sure to put your accessories in a backpack or storage locker so you don’t lose them!"

      "content": "Carry a backpack to hold all your Disney necessities. Preparing for a Disney trip can be a bit overwhelming if you’ve never been before, so make things easier by storing everything you need in one place. Fill a backpack with things like sunscreen, water bottles, a jacket, an extra pair of shoes and anything else you might need to get through a long day at the park. [6] X Research source There are a ton of cute Disney backpacks you can buy online, and Loungefly is a particularly popular brand! Tote bags are another option, but in general, backpacks are easier to carry."

      "content": "Pack sunscreen, a first aid kit, and medication. A day at Disneyland is meant to be magical—you don’t want to be injured or sick. While the park offers medical attention to those who need it, it never hurts to be prepared for the little things. Reapply sunscreen throughout the day, have bandages on hand in case of small cuts or scrapes, and bring over-the-counter medicine like Ibuprofen in case you get a headache. [7] X Research source Of course, if you have prescription medication you need to take daily, you’re allowed to bring that, as well."

      "content": "Bring a phone charger or external battery. Even if your phone has a good battery life, it’ll likely be drained after a long day at Disney. Make sure to bring a charger in case you get separated from your group and need to contact someone, and because you’ll want to take lots of pictures to remember your trip for years to come.

      "content": "Pack snacks and a reusable water bottle. While Disneyland offers a ton of delicious food options, eating at any theme park can get expensive, and sometimes the lines are too long. Luckily, Disney allows guests to bring their own snacks and water bottles into the parks, so bring something to nibble on between meals. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Don’t forget your autograph book and lanyard for pins. If you love meeting Disney characters, bring an autograph book (or a notebook) and get their signatures as a souvenir! Pin-trading is also a popular activity at Disney parks—bring your own and you can trade them with Disney staff. This is a great way to avoid spending extravagant amounts of money on souvenirs.

      "content": "Don’t bring weapons, drugs, or alcohol. Needless to say, illegal substances are not permitted at Disneyland, and guests cannot bring anything that is likely to harm someone or cause unnecessary inconvenience. A complete list of prohibited items is available on Disneyland’s website, but here are the basics: [11] X Research source Firearms, ammunition, knives, and weapons of any kind (or toys that appear to be weapons) Self-defense devices like pepper spray and mace Marijuana or illegal substances Alcoholic beverages (except in Disneyland Resort hotels) Fireworks, explosives, or flammable objects Recreational devices like drones, skateboards, bicycles, etc. Any bag or cooler larger than 24\" long x 15\" wide x 18\" high (61 cm x 38 cm x 46 cm) Strollers larger than 31\" (79 cm) in width and 52\" (132 cm) in length"

      "content": "Dress children as their favorite Disney character. Children under 14 can wear costumes in Disney parks. This includes Disney princess dresses or any Disney Halloween costumes. If your little one is excited about meeting a certain character, dress them up as that character to make the moment even more special. [12] X Research source For example, if your daughter loves Cinderella, get her a Cinderella dress! If your son likes Toy Story , dress him as Woody or Buzz Lightyear. It may be a good idea to bring a change of clothes, especially for very young children, in case they get uncomfortable and cranky. For safety reasons, costumes cannot reach or drag on the ground."

      "title": "Try Disneybounding if you’re an adult.",
      "content": "Try Disneybounding if you’re an adult. While adults (or anyone over the age of 14) aren’t allowed to wear actual costumes, many Disney-lovers get around this rule by Disneybounding, or styling an everyday outfit to resemble a Disney character. Try choosing a shirt and pants that match your favorite character’s color scheme to get in on the fun. [13] X Research source For example, if you were to Disneybound as Mickey Mouse, you might wear a white T-shirt, a black cardigan, and a red skirt or pants. Or, if you want to go as Lightning McQueen from Cars , wear a red T-shirt and a black and white checkered skirt to fit the racing vibe. Men can also Disneybound. For example, if you wanted to be Goofy, wear an orange shirt, some jeans, and a green beanie to represent his bright green hat. Or, rock a white T-shirt, denim vest, and khaki pants as Flynn Ryder from Tangled"

      "content": "Coordinate outfits with your group. If you’re going to Disney with your friends or family, make the trip even more memorable by deciding on a group theme for your outfits. For example, base your outfits around the iconic trio of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy, or if there happen to be 7 of you, go as the 7 dwarves from Snow White! The possibilities are endless. [14] X Research source This idea works for Disneybounding or wearing regular outfits. Find T-shirts with your favorite characters on them, or choose an outfit that resembles what the character wears in their movie."

      "content": "If you’re with your partner, wear Disney couples T-shirts. If you and your partner are both massive Disney fans, this is a great way to show off your love for Disney and each other. Go with a classic Mickey and Minnie duo, Lady and the Tramp, or even Han Solo and Princess Leia from Star Wars !"

      "content": "Wear a Disney sweatshirt and jeans for something comfy. If you’re not the type to go all out, there are still cute ways you can represent your love for Disney. Try a vintage-inspired Disney T-shirt (or sweatshirt, if the weather allows for it) and a pair of ripped jeans for a classic, casual look. Don’t forget the Mickey ear headband to top it all off!"

These days, there are all kinds of unique Mickey ears inspired by different Disney characters, movies, and even theme park rides. You’re sure to find a pair you love! [15] X Research source If you’re not a fan of the ears, there are still a ton of ways you can show your love for Disney. Wear a Disney-themed hat, shirt, necklace, or anything else you think is cute!"

Masks cannot be worn by guests age 14 or older (unless for medical purposes). Clothing with obscene language or graphics is not permitted.
