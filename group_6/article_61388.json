      "content": "Find the drain hose. The drain hose usually ties into the sink drain. Behind the kickplate, locate the drain hose, which should run between the dishwasher pump and the drain. The dishwasher pump is usually located underneath the lower spray bar. The hose is generally made of flexible, thick, corrugated plastic. Some dishwashers may be designed so that the drain hose runs between the pump and the air gap found at the top of the sink near the faucet or directly to a garbage disposal. The spray bar of most dishwashers looks like a thin strip of metal with jets on top. Some dishwashers may have a lower and upper bar, one for each inner basket. You should notice a second hose alongside the drain hose. This is a recirculation hose, which may also have a blockage. Leave this hose for now and focus on the drainage hose. [3] X Research source"
