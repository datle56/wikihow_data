      "content": "Wash your rosemary. Rinse the sprigs in cool water and lay them on a paper towel to dry. Pat them thoroughly with a second paper towel until they’re completely dry. [1] X Research source If you have one, you can also use a salad spinner to get rid of excess water. Washing your rosemary helps get rid of any dirt and bugs that are left on the sprigs. Excess water will cause the rosemary to get slimy when you store it, so make sure the sprigs are dry."

      "title": "Wrap your rosemary in a damp paper towel.",
      "content": "Wrap your rosemary in a damp paper towel. Keep the sprigs whole with the leaves still attached. Wet a paper towel with cool water, wring it out, and lay it flat. Then, just set your rosemary sprigs on the paper towel and wrap them up. [2] X Research source The paper towel prevents the sprigs from drying out when they’re in your fridge."

    {
      "title": "Place the rosemary sprigs in a resealable bag.",
      "content": "Place the rosemary sprigs in a resealable bag. You can use a Ziploc bag or an airtight container. If you’re using a bag, squeeze out all the air before sealing it. For a container, make sure the lid is tightly sealed. [3] X Research source This will protect the sprigs from oxygen, which can cause them to spoil and turn brown. You can write the date on the bag or container so you don’t forget how long your rosemary has been in the refrigerator."

      "title": "Put rosemary in a jar with water as an alternative storage technique.",
      "content": "Put rosemary in a jar with water as an alternative storage technique. Start by trimming the bottoms of the rosemary sprigs. Fill a glass jar with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water, and place the cut ends of the sprigs in it. Cover the top of the rosemary loosely with plastic to let the herbs breathe. [4] X Research source When you store rosemary in a jar, the sprigs absorb the water to help them stay fresh and prevent wilting. You can even store fresh rosemary in a jar on your countertop, but it will only be good for 2–3 weeks."

    {
      "title": "Keep your rosemary refrigerated for 2–4 weeks.",
      "content": "Keep your rosemary refrigerated for 2–4 weeks. Put the rosemary in your fridge’s crisper drawer or on the lowest shelf. [5] X Research source Try to use rosemary in a bag within a few weeks, but it may stay fresh for up to a month if you keep it in a jar. [6] X Research source Refill the jar with water as the level starts to go down. Rosemary is still good as long as it’s green and fresh-looking. When it turns black or brown and feels a little slimy, it’s gone bad and it’s time to throw it away."

      "title": "Place the sprigs flat on a baking sheet.",
      "content": "Place the sprigs flat on a baking sheet. You can place them directly on the sheet or on a piece of parchment paper. Keep the leaves attached to the stem and spread the sprigs out on the sheet in a single, even layer. Make sure the sprigs don’t touch each other so they don’t freeze together. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Freeze the rosemary for 2–3 hours. Set the baking tray in your freezer and shut the door. Check on them every 30 minutes or so, and leave them in the freezer until they’re frozen solid. If the sprigs aren’t able to bend easily, and if the leaves don’t droop or move at all when you pick up a sprig, then they’re ready. [9] X Research source Freezing the rosemary on the tray first allows each sprig to freeze separately so they don’t get stuck to any others. It also helps them freeze faster and more thoroughly than if they were in a freezer bag."

      "content": "Keep your rosemary in the freezer for up to 1 year. When you’re ready to cook with your rosemary, you can grab it right out of the freezer bag without thawing it. Your rosemary will taste fresh for about a year, but it will start to lose its flavor if you keep it for longer. Check on the rosemary every month or so to keep an eye out for any signs of browning or mold. [11] X Research source Frozen rosemary works best in cooked dishes. However, it doesn’t make the best garnish because it wilts as it thaws out."

      "content": "Remove the lower leaves from each sprig of rosemary. Tear off the leaves from the lower part of the sprigs about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) up from the bottom. Clearing off the leaves makes the sprigs easier to tie together."

      "content": "Tie the rosemary in bunches with kitchen twine . Split your rosemary evenly into multiple small bunches. Gather a small handful of sprigs, turn them so that they’re all facing the same direction, and tie the bottoms together. [13] X Research source Ollie George Cigliano, a private chef and food educator, says that rosemary can be “easily dried by hanging it with kitchen twine or a food-safe rubber band .” Tie the string tight, but let the leaves at the top be looser so that the air can circulate through them."

      "content": "Hang the bunches to dry in a dark, well-ventilated area. Use a basement, spare bedroom, or closet as a storage space. Hang your rosemary from a nail or hook in the wall, a clothesline, or a laundry rack so the sprigs are face-down. Use clothespins or pieces of string to keep the sprigs in place. [14] X Research source Avoid drying rosemary in areas with direct sunlight or a lot of moisture, like in front of a window, over a sink or oven, or near a bathroom. Otherwise, it can give the herbs an unpleasant flavor."

      "title": "Dry the rosemary",
      "content": "Dry the rosemary for 2 weeks until the leaves are brittle. Check the leaves every few days by pinching them to if they crumble. If they fall in flakes, they’re ready to go! You can also place a few leaves into a glass jar or plastic bag and seal it tightly. If condensation gathers on the inside of the jar or bag, your rosemary needs a bit more time to dry. The process usually takes a couple of weeks but it may change depending on the climate. [15] X Research source If the sprigs disintegrate into powder when you pinch them, they’re over-dried and the flavor won’t be as strong."

[16] X Research source You can crumble your rosemary before storing them, or store the leaves whole. Your dried rosemary should last for a few months in a pantry or cabinet, but up to 1 year in the fridge. [17] X Research source If the dried rosemary starts to turn brown or has a pungent sour flavor, then it’s gone bad."

Once the rosemary is cool, you can remove the leaves from the stems if desired, crumble them, or keep the sprigs whole if you want to use a larger sprig in cooking or as a garnish. [22] X Research source It’s important that the rosemary is completely cool and dry before you store it. Any heat will create moisture in the container, which can cause mold."
