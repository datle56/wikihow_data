You can see who else viewed your Story by swiping up from the bottom of your screen as the Story plays. If needed, you can change who can see your Story or create a private Story. Since a Story will remain visible on your profile for up to 24 hours, you can see how much of that time your Story has been posted. For example, if the Snap in the Story reads that it was posted \"1 hr ago\", it will be on your Story for 23 more hours."
