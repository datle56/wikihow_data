      "title": "He’s very defensive.",
      "content": "He’s very defensive. When you bring up relationship issues, does he listen calmly, or does he immediately jump to his own defense? In relationships, there are always going to be problems to work on. If your partner can’t listen to you without shouting you down or defending himself, it shows that his anger issues are getting in the way of healthy communication. For instance, maybe you bring up a totally reasonable issue, like how he was late picking you up after work this afternoon. If he has anger issues, he may get unreasonably defensive and start yelling about how traffic was terrible and that you never give him a break."

    {
      "title": "He is often stressed or flustered.",
      "content": "He is often stressed or flustered. People with anger issues often have trouble relaxing. When your partner is at home, does he seem tense, flustered, or on edge? If he’s unable to calm down, then it’s likely that his anger is always bubbling just beneath the surface."
    },
    {
      "title": "He grits his teeth or clenches his fists.",
      "content": "He grits his teeth or clenches his fists. Even if he’s not screaming or shouting at the moment, you might still be able to tell when he’s angry. Look for signs of angry body language like gritted teeth, flared nostrils, dilated pupils, and pursed lips. [1] X Research source If you notice body language like this often, he likely has anger issues. Reader Poll: We asked 1856 wikiHow readers who are good at reading body language, and only 9% of them agreed that the best way to tell if someone is angry is if they furrow their eyebrows. [Take Poll] Be sure to examine the rest of his body language to determine if he’s actually angry."

    {
      "title": "He insults you or calls you names.",
      "content": "He insults you or calls you names. Even when you two are having a simple discussion, he might escalate things to the point where he hurls insults at you. In healthy relationships, partners respect each other, even when they disagree. Your partner may have anger issues if he can’t control himself enough to not call you names when he’s upset. [2] X Research source Afterward, he may feel bad and tell you that it was just the “heat of the moment.” However, reflect on your own behavior: would you ever call your partner names or insult them during an argument?"
    },
    {
      "title": "He belittles you.",
      "content": "He belittles you. Similar to name-calling and yelling, when your partner belittles you, he might insult your intelligence or your skills. He’ll probably do this when he’s angry at you, and he might make broad, sweeping statements about you based on one mistake. [3] X Research source For instance, let’s say you accidentally forgot to pick up milk at the grocery store. If your partner has anger issues, he might explode and say, “You always forget everything I tell you! Can’t you ever do anything right?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "He gives you the silent treatment when he’s upset.",
      "content": "He gives you the silent treatment when he’s upset. Some men experience passive anger instead of outward anger. This might lead him to ignore you or give you the silent treatment when he’s mad. Instead of yelling or shouting, he won’t talk to you until he’s calmed down. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source This might sound better than getting yelled at, but constantly dealing with the silent treatment can cause a breakdown in communication."

    {
      "title": "He’s calm one minute, and angry the next.",
      "content": "He’s calm one minute, and angry the next. Many people with anger issues tend to have a very short temper. Maybe one second your partner seems calm and happy, and the next moment he’s blowing up. This is a key indicator that he has trouble regulating his emotions. For instance, maybe the two of you were just laughing and joking. All of a sudden, he takes a sip of his drink and realizes the waiter brought him the wrong one. Now he’s upset and yelling at whoever will listen. Everyone gets upset sometimes, and it’s normal to feel angry every now and then. However, adults without anger issues have learned to regulate their emotions and can calm themselves down during times of stress."

      "title": "He is extremely impatient.",
      "content": "He is extremely impatient. Do you get worried when your partner has to wait on anything? Be it takeout food, an Uber, or a paycheck, a man with anger issues won’t have the patience to wait long. Being impatient could mean that he deals with a lot of anger and intense emotions.

      "title": "He has trouble communicating with you.",
      "content": "He has trouble communicating with you. Do details tend to slip through the cracks in your relationship? Men with anger issues often have trouble expressing themselves without yelling or shouting, making communication tough. If you find that you two constantly misunderstand each other, it may have something to do with his anger issues. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "He never apologizes for his behavior.",
      "content": "He never apologizes for his behavior. Many people with anger issues have trouble saying “sorry” as well. It’s because it hurts their pride and makes them feel “less-than” to ask for your forgiveness (even when you deserve an apology). [7] X Research source He might even seem remorseful and promise that he’ll change. However, you’ll notice a lack of the actual words “I’m sorry” in his vocabulary."
    },
    {
      "title": "He yells at you.",
      "content": "He yells at you. Shouting, yelling, and screaming are all signs that point to a man having anger issues. As adults, we learn to regulate our emotions and control ourselves enough so we don’t scream and yell when we’re upset. Maybe something small happens, like you accidentally drop your water cup on the floor. Instead of getting up to help you or even asking if you’re alright, a man with anger issues will probably yell at you for your mistake. He might even throw adult-sized temper tantrums. This is also because he’s never learned how to regulate or cope with negative emotions."

      "title": "He starts fights with everyone.",
      "content": "He starts fights with everyone. If a waiter forgets his drink, he’ll snap at them and demand a refund. If a guy accidentally bumps into him at a bar, he’ll ask him what his problem is. When you’re with a man who has anger issues, you’ll probably notice that he’s always looking for a fight, whether it’s from you or a total stranger.

Or are you worried about doing or saying the wrong thing in case he blows up? [9] X Research source Pay careful attention to how other people in his life treat him, too. Sometimes, men with anger issues will lash out at loved ones like their friends and family members, too."

      "title": "He throws or breaks things.",
      "content": "He throws or breaks things. Instead of physical violence against you, your partner may punch holes in the wall, throw things around the house, or slam doors so hard that they crack. This is a warning sign of your partner’s anger issues, and it shows that he has trouble controlling himself when he’s upset. [10] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If your partner lashes out physically like this, there is a very high likelihood that he may attempt to hurt you in the future.

      "title": "He harms himself.",
      "content": "He harms himself. Sometimes, anger issues are directed inwards instead of outward. If the guy you’re seeing has inward anger issues, he may physically harm himself or insult himself, especially after he makes mistakes.

      "content": "Calm yourself first instead of reacting immediately. When your partner gets upset with you, it’s natural to feel hurt or angry and lash out. If you notice that your feelings are starting to ramp up, take a few deep breaths and calm yourself down. If you’re both yelling and angry, the situation is only going to escalate.

Then, when you come back, make sure he’s calm before you two start talking again. [15] X Research source Look for calm body languages cues, like open palms and a neutral expression, before diving back in. Say something like, “I can tell you’re getting upset. I’m going to take a walk around the block, and when I come back, we can talk.” Be sure to emphasize the fact that you’re coming back so he knows you aren’t just walking away from the conversation. When you come back, say something like, “Are you ready to talk calmly now?”"
