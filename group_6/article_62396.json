To reset your Solo Wireless, Solo Pro, Solo3 Wireless, and Sudio3 Wireless headphones, press and hold the power button and volume down button (or multifunction button) for about 10 seconds until the LED or Fuel Gauge flashes. [2] X Research source For Studio, Studio Wireless, and Solo2 Wireless , press and hold the power button for about 10 seconds. On the Solo2 Wireless headset, the Fuel Gauge LEDs blink white, then one LED blinks red; this sequence happens three times. When the lights stop flashing, your headphones are reset. For wired earbuds like the BeatsX, Powerbeats, Powerbeats2, and Powerbeats3 , press and hold the power button and the volume down button for 10 seconds. For wireless earbuds like Powerbeats Pro , put both earbuds inside the case, then press the system button for about 15 seconds, or until the LED light flashes red and white. The light will continue to flash white, meaning you need to pair it with your Android, iPhone, Mac, or another device again. [3] X Research source"
