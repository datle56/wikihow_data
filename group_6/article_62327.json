      "content": "Go up a nipple size if your baby takes 30+ minutes to finish a bottle. Pay close attention to your baby during your next feeding session. Are they feeding at a good pace, or does it take them a long time to finish up? [1] X Research source Also, take a close look at the bottle nipple itself—does it hold its shape, or does it seem to collapse because your baby is sucking so quickly? Fast sucking, fussiness, and especially long feeding times are all common indicators that your baby needs a bottle nipple with a faster flow. [2] X Research source If you’re using a slow-flow bottle nipple, try using a medium-flow nipple instead. If you’re already using a medium-flow one, upgrade to a fast-flow bottle nipple. If your bottle nipple brand uses a numerical scale (like Dr. Brown’s), switch to a higher-rated nipple."

      "content": "Go down a size if your baby is gulping, coughing, or choking. If your baby is getting too much milk or formula at once, they might gulp, drool a lot, cough, or have trouble swallowing as they feed. In some cases, babies might choke or stop eating altogether if the milk flows too quickly. [3] X Research source If your baby is struggling with a medium-flow nipple, try switching to a slow-flow nipple instead. If your bottle nipples are ranked on a numerical scale, try going down a number."

[4] X Research source They’re also a good choice for babies who feed a little too eagerly and often cough or choke during their feeding sessions. [5] X Research source For brands that use a numerical scale (like Dr. Brown’s), slow-flow nipples are the same as levels 0 or 1 nipples. [6] X Research source Level 0 nipples are designed specifically designed for preemies, but they’re also good for any baby struggling with a regular slow-flow/level 1 nipple. [7] X Research source Popular brands: Avent® First Flow Level 0 (0 months), Comotomo® Slow Flow (0-3 months), and Dr. Brown® Preemie flow (0 months) Tip: Make sure that your bottle nipple brand matches the brand of your baby bottle."

Medium-flow nipples offer a slightly faster milk flow than slow-flow nipples, and may be a good fit for your young baby.

Fast-flow nipples are great options for babies who are a little older or just not getting enough out of their current feeding sessions. This type of bottle nipple may also be helpful if your pediatrician has recommended a thickened feeding for your baby. [10] X Research source For brands that use a numerical scale, fast-flow nipples are the same as levels 3 or 4. [11] X Research source Popular brands: Dr. Brown® Level 3 (6+ months), Dr. Brown® Level 4 (9+ months), Evenflo® Slow Flow (0-3 months), and Medela® Wide-Base Slow Flow (0-4 months) The “slow flow” options listed above are considered fast-flow by medical professionals."

Wide-neck nipples are closest in shape to an actual nipple, so they’re a great option if you’d like to continue breastfeeding your child . Slow-flow nipples are also the best option in terms of size—if your baby gets used to a faster-rate nipple, they might experience nipple confusion (where they like bottle-feeding more than breastfeeding). [18] X Research source As you bottle-feed your baby, hold them in a cradle hold (as if you were breastfeeding). Always meet with a lactation consultant if you’re ever having trouble or concerns about breastfeeding your little one."
