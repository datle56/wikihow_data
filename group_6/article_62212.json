      "content": "Royal Sauce is Burger King’s replacement for their King’s Sauce. Burger King took their King’s Sauce off the menu around 2017 and replaced it with their Royal Sauce in 2022, right before they released their Royal Crispy Chicken Wraps. [1] X Research source The ingredients behind the savory sauce are a mystery, but it's thought to include mayo, ketchup, relish, and a host of spices. Burger King doesn’t have the calories available for its Royal Sauce, but by our calculations, it might be around 65 kCal for ½ ounce (about 1 tablespoon) of sauce. [2] X Research source Burger King hasn’t updated their allergen list with this sauce, so if you have any major food allergies, you might want to avoid ordering any of their chicken dishes with it until they do.

      "content": "The Royal Sauce mixes sweet ketchup and mayo with tart vinegar. The Royal Sauce is a soft symphony of flavors, layering sweet tomato-ey ketchup and mayo with tangy onion, garlic, pickles, basil, and a hint of spicy mustard. The sauce also has a hint of pepper and ranch flavor, which can make it the perfect complement to Burger King’s chicken sandwiches and wraps. [4] X Research source Texture-wise, the Royal Sauce is thicker than some of BK’s other sauces and feels very similar to their Mayonnaise."
