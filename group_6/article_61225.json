      "content": "Steam First, fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil on the stove. Once the water is boiling, turn the stovetop off. Place a towel over your head and bend over the pot, moving closer gradually to inhale the steam coming off the water through your nose. The steam will help loosen the mucus, so you may be able to breathe more easily afterward.

[5] X Research source Inhale steam through your nose for about 10 to 15 minutes up to 3 or 4 times per day until your sphenoid sinusitis symptoms improve.

      "content": "Homemade saline rinse Mix 1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) of non-iodized salt, 1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) of baking soda, and 2 cups (470 mL) of lukewarm distilled water in a small bowl. Fill a bulb syringe with the solution, then lean over the sink and insert the tip of the syringe just inside your nostril. Squeeze the bulb to insert the solution into your nose. Repeat this process in the same nostril until the bulb is empty, then refill the bulb and do the same for the other nostril. [7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you don’t have distilled water, you can boil tap water and then let it cool until it’s lukewarm. Don’t use any water that hasn’t been boiled or filtered since it may contain bacteria and could lead to a more severe infection. Repeat this process once per day until your sphenoid sinusitis starts to clear up. Instead of a bulb syringe, you can also use a neti pot to pour the solution into your nostrils."

      "content": "Decongestant If your sphenoid sinusitis is causing nasal congestion, try taking an over-the-counter decongestant to help reduce inflammation and make it easier to breathe. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Opening your sinuses reduces the pressure in your sphenoid cavity and helps drain the bacteria or mucus causing your condition, so this simple step may help relieve a big part of your discomfort fairly quickly. In addition to oral decongestants, you can also try an over-the-counter nasal spray decongestant, such as Afrin. Avoid using a nasal spray decongestant for more than 3 days, however, as it could cause your symptoms to worsen once you stop using it. Before taking an oral decongestant, ask your pharmacist to make sure that it won’t interact with any other medications you take. Always take decongestants as directed on the package or by your doctor or pharmacist."

[9] X Trustworthy Source American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology National professional organization of allergists, asthma specialists and immunologists that focuses on supporting and publishing research Go to source Antihistamines have several possible side effects, such as drowsiness, headache, and dry mouth, so make sure you take them as directed. While they can help reduce allergy symptoms, antihistamines can also slow down drainage and cause your sphenoid sinus to dry out. Therefore, make sure that you talk to your doctor before using an antihistamine to treat your sphenoid sinusitis. [10] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you tend to experience these symptoms around the same time each year, you probably suffer from seasonal allergies. Consider talking to your doctor about a daily allergy medication that you take during the peak of your allergy season to help prevent your symptoms in the first place."

If you’ve been treating your symptoms for more than 7 days with little improvement, have consistent green discharge from your nose, or are experiencing a lot of pain, make an appointment with your doctor. They'll work with you to determine the cause of your symptoms, as well as to develop a treatment plan that will work for you. For instance, you may have a severe case of acute (short-term) sinusitis that requires prescription medication or surgery, or you may have developed chronic sphenoid sinusitis.

Endoscopic sinus surgery can remove most sources of sinusitis, including mucus containing allergens or infection. It might sound a little scary, but this is an outpatient procedure without any incisions. You'll only need localized anesthesia, and your doctor will insert a small metal telescope to remove the blockage.
