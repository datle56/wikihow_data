      "title": "Is it time to go home yet?",
      "content": "Is it time to go home yet? How about now? Checking the clock might seem like a good way to keep track of time, but it can actually make time go by slower than if you weren’t paying attention. If you’re wearing a watch, take it off and put it away. If you have your phone on you, try not to look at it for a long stretch of time. Before you know it, it’ll be time to call it a day. Try making it a challenge to see how long you can go without checking the time. Can you make it 5 minutes? How about 10?"

      "title": "Having 6 hours left in the day can seem unmanageable.",
      "content": "Having 6 hours left in the day can seem unmanageable. But what about three 2-hour periods? You can chunk your time by adding breaks at the end of each chunk or setting a goal to complete a task within each chunk. You can also break up time by your workload or assignments. If you have 3 things left to do today, tackle the first one, then take a break. It will make time go by faster, and you’ll get a little reward for each item on your to-do list."

      "title": "When you’re bored, time seems to drag on and on.",
      "content": "When you’re bored, time seems to drag on and on. Doing the same thing over and over gets repetitive and boring, so mix it up a little. If you’re stuck at home on a long weekend or you don’t have anything to do after school, try out a new activity, game, or puzzle If you’re bored on a commute, try taking a different route to work."

    {
      "title": "Have you ever gotten lost in a project?",
      "content": "Have you ever gotten lost in a project? Homework, paperwork, projects, and crafts can all be useful in this situation, so grab one and dive right in. Math worksheets or dense essays won’t be as engaging as creative projects (unless that’s your thing, in which case, go for it!) Ever stayed up all night because you were so engrossed in your work? Losing yourself in something tough and challenging can help you repeat the trick."

      "title": "A healthy snack can be a great pick-me-up in the middle of the day.",
      "content": "A healthy snack can be a great pick-me-up in the middle of the day. Plus, the protein can give you an energy boost to help you get through the rest of your day. Go for a granola bar, some yogurt, an apple, or a smoothie to fill your stomach and give you the energy to finish up your work. It’s tempting to reach for the donuts or cookies, but eating a bunch of sugar can make you feel sluggish and tired—and when you’re moving slowly, time does, too."

      "title": "Sitting down is comfortable, but it’s not very exciting for your body.",
      "content": "Sitting down is comfortable, but it’s not very exciting for your body. Try taking 5 minutes and getting out of your chair to do something active. Try taking a short walk around the block to stretch your legs. Or, jump some rope to get your heart rate up. If you’re at work, take a quick jaunt around the office (as long as you come back to finish up your work)."

      "title": "If you ever played I Spy as a kid, this one’s for you.",
      "content": "If you ever played I Spy as a kid, this one’s for you. You can try to engage your brain in other ways by noticing the different textures of the vehicle you’re in, taking in the beauty of nature, or looking for objects of a specific color. If you’re on a road trip, you can actually play I Spy with the other passengers (if they’re willing!)"

      "title": "Keep your eye on the prize.",
      "content": "Keep your eye on the prize. Having a fun reward to look forward to can help the time pass by faster since you know you’ve got something exciting coming up. If you’re finishing up a tough stint at school, try buying yourself that new sweater you’ve been eyeing. If you’re working on a particularly tough task at your job, go out for a drink once it’s done."

    {
      "title": "Sitting by yourself doing nothing is really boring.",
      "content": "Sitting by yourself doing nothing is really boring. If you’re at home, have a chat with one of your family members. If you’re at school or work, talk about your weekend with your peers or coworkers. Make sure you aren’t distracting your conversation partner from their own work! That won’t make you very popular around the office or the school yard."

    {
      "title": "Having something to jam out to can make your day go by a lot faster.",
      "content": "Having something to jam out to can make your day go by a lot faster. Pick out some music that doesn’t distract you (maybe classical?) and put on some headphones. If you’re working on something super easy and you can handle being distracted, put on a podcast or an audiobook to really engage your brain."

      "title": "It’s time to really pamper yourself.",
      "content": "It’s time to really pamper yourself. Run the hot water, throw in some bubbles, and light some candles, because you’re gonna relax the day away. You could also make a full spa day out of it, with face masks, leave-in conditioner, and a mani/pedi. If you don’t think a bath will distract you enough, put on some music or a podcast to listen to while you soak."

      "title": "If you do this one, you’ll know you’re really bored.",
      "content": "If you do this one, you’ll know you’re really bored. Mop the floors, scrub the toilet, and wipe down the counters to get productive and fill your time up with chores. Hit the laundromat, go through a car wash, or do some yard work if you’re tired of being stuck inside. Admit it: it’s probably high time for a deep clean anyway, right?"

      "content": "How’s Fido doing today? Maybe your dog or cat would enjoy a walk, or your hamster might like a fresh water bottle. Animals are man’s best friend, after all. Take your dog to the dog park to mix up your routine a little bit. Or, get your cat a new toy so you can run around the house together. If your pet needs some exercise too, combine your walk with their own to pass the time."
