      "content": "You know the saying: Slow and steady wins the race . Although you may not be able to run slowly for the entire beep test, you can at least try to pace yourself. If you push yourself too hard in the first couple of beeps, than you'll be setting yourself up for disaster. For the first 10-15 Beeps, you may be able to get away with a slow jog or by walking at a brisk pace. It will take many beep tests before you figure out a technique that works well for you as an individual."

      "content": "If you're running a beep test while in PE class, there will be others who were running it as well. Chances are, by the end of the test, everybody will be tired. Patting a classmate on the back and saying, \"Good job out there today!,\" can really brighten someone's day. It doesn't matter if you are the first to drop out, just try your best and you'll be fine. Eventually you won't be too troubled by your scores, and you'll just get on with the rest of your day."
