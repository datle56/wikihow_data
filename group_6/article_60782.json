For example, you can keep the kitchen garbage can in a closed cupboard. However, if your dog has figured out a way to open cupboards, you may need to put childproof latches on the handles. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source In other rooms of the house, you could try putting small wastebaskets at a height where your dog could not reach them, [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source such as the top of a dresser. You could also restrict his access to entire rooms that have garbage can or wastebaskets by closing doors or using baby gates. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Consider using a garbage can with a lid that your dog cannot open. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source garbage cans with a step mechanism to open the lid would not be good, since your dog could figure out how to use the step. Look at garbage cans from your dog’s perspective to determine which types would be easy or difficult for him to get into."

      "content": "Make the garbage can undesirable. A common way to correct bad behavior is to make that behavior undesirable. Environmental punishment is a way to discourage bad behavior. There are commercially available deterrent devices that you can set up near the garbage can to keep your dog away from it. One device is a mousetrap-like device that will loudly pop up into the air when your dog steps on it. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source You can also place a motion-activated device near your garbage can that will blow a shot of compressed air when your dog approaches the garbage can. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source There is also a type of mat that delivers a small shock when your dog steps on it. [8] X Research source Environmental punishment is most effective for dogs who have learned to sneak into the trash when their owners are not around. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Although environmental punishment does not cause physical injury, it should not be used with dogs who are naturally skittish or anxious. If your dog is skittish, the sudden shock, blast of air, or loud popping noise may make him even more fearful.

Feeding him several small meals a day can help keep him full to the point where he won’t feel the need to scavenge for extra food. If your dog is on a diet to lose weight, consider talking with your veterinarian to come up with a feeding schedule that will keep him full but will not cause him to gain weight. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If you are away for most of the day and cannot be there to feed him, restricting his access to the garbage can may be easier for you. Be aware that some dogs are not good at knowing when they are full and never stop eating. Don't attempt to feed these dogs until they stop eating or they will become obese."

To keep him from getting bored, make sure that you give him plenty of exercise by taking him on walks and playing with him. If he is well trained, you could also take him to a dog park to let him run around and interact with other dogs. Giving him toys to play with can keep him busy when you are not home.

With the treat in your closed fist, your dog will probably sniff and paw at your hand, and might even bark or whine to get the treat. When he has lost interest in getting the treat—probably after a minute or two— open your fist, immediately say ‘yes,’ and give him the treat. [14] X Research source Every three to four times that you practice this, hold your fist open, say ‘yes,’ and give him the treat.

You may need to practice this many times before your dog learns that direct eye contact with you is necessary to earn his treat when you say ‘leave it.’ [17] X Research source Looking at you also redirects his attention from whatever he may have been tempted to eat."

When your dog eventually loses interest in getting the bait under your hand, pick the bait up off the floor, immediately say ‘yes,’ and give him his favorite treat. [18] X Research source Make sure that he does not eat the bait. If he manages to get to the bait, show him the tastier treat that he could have gotten if he hadn’t eaten the bait.

If you do it after the fact, such as when you see him munching on food that he got from the garbage can, he will be confused as to why you are punishing him.
