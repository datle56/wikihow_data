      "content": "Redeem Super Cash by spending at least $25 during a spending period. At some point after an earning period, Old Navy hosts a “spending period,” where you're given the opportunity to use your Super Cash on your next purchases. You need to spend a certain amount of money before you're able to use a certain amount of Super Cash. [1] X Research source For instance, if you earned $60 in Super Cash but are only purchasing something worth $25, you’d only be able to use $10 of your Super Cash toward that purchase, rather than getting the entire item for free. Only one Super Cash coupon or code can be used per purchase. If you happen to collect multiple coupons/codes, you’ll have to redeem them in separate purchases. How much Super Cash can you use at one time? Spend $25 - $49.99: Use $10 SC Spend $50 - $74.99: Use $20 SC Spend $75 - $99.99: Use $30 SC Spend $100 - $124.99: Use $40 SC Spend $125 - $149.99: Use $50 SC Spend $150+: Use $60 SC"

      "content": "Use your physical coupon or code to redeem your Super Cash. Wait until Old Navy advertises the redemption period for Super Cash—this may be weeks after you originally acquired it. Then, bring your Super Cash coupon with you if you’re shopping in stores and hand it to the cashier at check-out (assuming you’ve spent the minimum amount required). If you’re shopping online, enter the Super Cash code from your email into the provided box during the check-out process. [2] X Research source The email should pop in your inbox within a day after you earn your Super Cash, but it won’t be usable until the Super Cash redemption period starts."

If you have a Navyist Rewards credit card and have untouched Super Cash, head to the “My Points and Rewards” section on the Old Navy website. Then, scroll down to the “Convert Expired Bonus Cash to Points” section, which lets you enter your Super Cash promotional code. If you have a physical Super Cash coupon, the code will be printed on it. [3] X Research source One dollar of Super Cash is equal to 1 Reward Point. [4] X Research source A single Reward Point is worth about 1 penny. [5] X Research source It’s not a great trade-off, but it’s better than your Super Cash going to waste! The Super Cash needs to be less than 30 days old—otherwise, it won’t work."

Old Navy first holds an “earning period”—this is a period of a couple of weeks where you can earn certain amounts of Super Cash by spending certain amounts of money. The minimum threshold that you have to meet is $25, which nets you $10 worth of Super Cash. The more you spend, the more Super Cash you can earn! [12] X Research source Old Navy stores sometimes host “double earning periods,” where you can earn twice as much Super Cash as you usually would. These promotions aren’t available online. If you shop in-store, your Super Cash is given to you as a physical coupon to use with a future purchase (with a code printed on it that can be used online). If you shop online, your Super Cash code is emailed to you. Check Old Navy’s website to confirm if a Super Cash promotion is going on. Don’t worry if you happen to miss one—Old Navy has them frequently.
