      "content": "Connect unrelated passions to your job. It’s perfectly acceptable to talk about a passion that’s not obviously related to the open role. But if you’ve spent time and energy on your passion project, you’ve most likely gained skills that are transferable to your career. [2] X Research source For instance, a passion for crafting can teach you patience and give you a keen eye for detail. Most employers want to hire candidates who are interested in more than just work. Workaholics might seem like the best choice on the surface, but they tend to be stressed and less likely to take creative risks. [3] X Research source Employers like well-rounded employees because they’re more flexible. Many times, a new assignment or project doesn’t quite fit into a particular job description.
