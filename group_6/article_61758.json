      "content": "Load your laundry. For the most part, you will have to do small loads with a portable washer. Your machine's instruction manual should have specific instructions regarding how much clothing it can hold. Most machines cannot hold more than 10 pounds. [1] X Research source Place your clothing into the washer. You can separate loads by color and fabric type the same way you would when using a normal washing machine. Liquid detergent tends to work best with portable washing machines. It's a good idea to add some liquid fabric softener, as portable washing machines only do spin cycles. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Hook up the hose to a faucet. There should be a hose attached to your portable washer. This hose will be screwed onto your kitchen's faucet in order to fill the machine with water to wash the clothing. Hook the hose up to a faucet in your kitchen or bathroom and turn the water on. [3] X Research source Use the water temperature that works best for your clothing type. For example, wash bright clothing in cold water. Some machines may have two different hoses: one to load the water, and the other to drain it afterwards. Refer to your instruction manual to make sure you're plugging the right hose into the kitchen sink. Most machines will have a line inside the washer marking how much water to add. Do not add water above this line as this can interfere with how the machine works and damage your clothing. [4] X Research source"

There will also be a switch to turn to get the machine to start the wash. [6] X Research source Make sure to plug your machine directly into the wall.
