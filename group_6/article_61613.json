[5] X Research source In general, a b = c can be rewritten as log a c = b . So, saying \"ten to the power of two is 100\" is equivalent to saying \"the base-ten log of 100 is two.\" Each logarithmic table is only usable with a certain base ( a in the equation above). By far the most common type of log table uses base-10 logs, also called the common logarithm. Multiply two numbers by adding their powers. For example: 10 2 * 10 3 = 10 5 , or 100 * 1000 = 100,000. The natural log, represented by \"ln\", is the base-e log, where e is the constant 2.718. This is a useful number in many areas of math and physics. You can use natural log tables in the same way that you use common, or base-10, log tables."

Let's say you want to find the base-10 log of 15 on a common log table. 15 lies between 10 (10 1 ) and 100 (10 2 ), so its logarithm will lie between 1 and 2, or be 1.something. 150 lies between 100 (10 2 ) and 1000 (10 3 ), so its logarithm will lie between 2 and 3, or be 2.something. The .something is called the mantissa; this is what you will find in the log table. What comes before the decimal point (1 in the first example, 2 in the second) is the characteristic."

Sometimes the numbers in this row will have a decimal point, so you'll look up 2.5 rather than 25. You can ignore this decimal point, as it won't affect your answer.
