      "title": "Tame hatchlings instead of adults if possible.",
      "content": "Tame hatchlings instead of adults if possible. Quail are skittish by nature and are not easy animals to tame. This is especially true for fully-grown quail. So, if you already have untamed adult quail, consider whether you actually want or need to tame them. [1] X Research source As an alternative, consider purchasing fertile quail eggs and incubating them. It’s far easier to tame baby quail than adults—primarily you just need to interact with them calmly and care for them properly."

    {
      "title": "Care for your quail",
      "content": "Care for your quail properly. The happier your quail, the better your chances of taming them. Give them a high-quality feed and fresh water, eliminate disturbances, house them in a spacious and clean enclosure, and keep an eye out for potential illnesses. [2] X Research source Caring for them daily also means that you’ll interact with them daily. This helps them get used to your presence, which is essential for taming them."

    {
      "title": "Give a new adult quail time to adjust before introducing taming.",
      "content": "Give a new adult quail time to adjust before introducing taming. Allow the new quail time to settle in. Interacting more than necessary straight away can cause excessive stress, so give them at least a week to adjust to you and their new surroundings. [3] X Research source For the first week or so, interact only as much as is required to provide proper care."
    },
    {
      "title": "Maintain your temper and your patience if you want to succeed.",
      "content": "Maintain your temper and your patience if you want to succeed. You cannot tame quail, and especially adult quail, through fear or force—they’ll simply become terrified of you. Never grab them forcefully, shout at them, chase after them (unless they get away!), or approach them from behind or above. [4] X Research source Don’t try to set a deadline for taming your adult quail. The process has to occur on their time, if at all."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t force taming on a quail that rejects it.",
      "content": "Don’t force taming on a quail that rejects it. It’s essential that you accept the fact that not every adult quail can be tamed. They are inherently skittish and fearful creatures, and some of them can’t be trained to overcome this nature. [5] X Research source Some quail-lovers say that button quail are extremely hard to tame, while coturnix and bobwhite are a little easier to tame. That said, the temperament of the individual bird is at least as important as its breed."

    {
      "title": "Approach the quail as closely as they’ll allow each day.",
      "content": "Approach the quail as closely as they’ll allow each day. At a time other than a feeding or other care routine each day, walk slowly and calmly toward the quail enclosure. Get as close as you can without the quail reacting fearfully—running along the sides of the enclosure is the most obvious sign. Ideally, you’ll be able to move this “safe spot” a bit closer each day without causing distress. [6] X Research source If they react fearfully as soon as you’re in sight, remain as far away as you can while still being in view. Hopefully, over time, they’ll settle down. If not, the quail may not be tameable. Each day, try moving the “safe spot” a bit closer, until the quail respond negatively. Then, back up until they calm down. After a few weeks, your “safe spot” will ideally be right next to the enclosure."

    {
      "title": "Sit quietly by the quail in your “safe spot” for 20 minutes per day.",
      "content": "Sit quietly by the quail in your “safe spot” for 20 minutes per day. Taming a quail starts with getting them used to your presence so they recognize you’re not a threat. Sit as close as the quail will allow every day and make sure the quail can see you. [7] X Research source Sit there for at least 20 minutes each day. This doesn’t mean that you have to do nothing during the time—you can read a book if you like. Just make sure you’re not moving about or talking loudly, or you’ll just frighten the quail."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to the quail once you can sit quietly next to them.",
      "content": "Talk to the quail once you can sit quietly next to them. After you’re able to establish your “safe spot” right next to the enclosure, try vocalizing to the quail calmly and reassuringly. Talk in to the quail in a gentle voice, like you would with a sick friend, or try whistling or singing quietly. [8] X Research source Don’t talk or sing loudly, and definitely don’t shout. Focus on being calming and comforting. Look toward the quail as you vocalize. Try something like: “Hello, Quincy, don’t you look happy today? I see you’ve been eating your food…”"

    {
      "title": "Perform routine tasks within view of the quail.",
      "content": "Perform routine tasks within view of the quail. After vocalizing in the “safe spot” for a week, try doing common tasks just outside the enclosure while continuing to talk to the quail. If you’re outdoors, try raking leaves, tending the garden, or something similar. If you’re indoors, try an activity like sweeping the floor or watering the houseplants. [9] X Research source Avoid noisy tasks such as vacuuming, mowing the lawn, or dancing to loud music. If they respond negatively when you start the task, return to sitting and try again the following day."

      "title": "Stick your hand in the quail enclosure for up to 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Stick your hand in the quail enclosure for up to 10 minutes. Once the quail can remain calm with you just outside the enclosure, try reaching your hand carefully and slowly into the enclosure. Hold your palm open and keep your hand as still as possible. [10] X Research source If the quail reacts negatively, remove your hand and try again the next day. Keep extending the time you keep your hand in the enclosure until you can do so for 10 minutes without the quail responding negatively. Once you reach 10 minutes, or if the quail calmly approaches your hand regularly, you can move on in the training process."

    {
      "title": "Offer the quail treats from your open hand.",
      "content": "Offer the quail treats from your open hand. Repeat the normal hand-in-enclosure process, but place some quail feed or a treat they enjoy—mealworms, for instance—in your open palm. If they don’t come to feed from your hand within 10 minutes, try again the next day. [11] X Research source Don’t try to force your hand into their face to take the treat. Be patient, and let the quail choose to come and take the treat on their own terms. Eventually, they will likely overcome their innate fear and eat from your hand. Once they do eat from your hand, try talking to them in your soothing voice afterward. Then, the next day, try talking to them while they eat."

    {
      "title": "Try petting the quail.",
      "content": "Try petting the quail. Once the quail remains calm and in the area after eating from your hand, try slowly lifting your fingers to pet it just beneath its neck. If it reacts negatively, return your hand to the open position and leave it there calmly, then try again the next day. [12] X Research source Once the quail allows you to pet it under its neck, try petting it very gently on the back of its head. Bring your hand up over its head slowly so you don’t surprise it. Some quail will never permit being petted from above. In the wild, they are attacked from above by predators (usually larger birds), so they are naturally skittish about this."

    {
      "title": "Attempt to pick up the quail calmly.",
      "content": "Attempt to pick up the quail calmly. Once the quail is completely comfortable around your hand, see if you can get it to hop up onto your hand in order to reach a treat. Once it does, try very slowly lifting it. If it starts to panic, lower your hand and try again the next day. [13] X Research source If the quail allows you to lift it, bring up your other hand and cup them very gently around the sides of the quail. Don’t squeeze it or envelop it in your hands—just have your hands ready to prevent a potential fall or escape attempt."

    {
      "title": "Keep up with your daily routine.",
      "content": "Keep up with your daily routine. Spend a dedicated amount of time every day working with your quail. In some cases, quail can become comfortable enough to remain calm in your hands for long stretches. [14] X Research source Don’t try to teach the quail to perch on your shoulder. Even a tame quail can get spooked easily and risk injury through a fall or escape attempt."
