      "content": "Whoever asks for the date should pay the bill. If you’re the one who invited your date out, it’s polite to cover both of your meals. On the flip side, if your date set up your dinner plans, they’ll probably be the one to pay for everything. [1] X Research source If you don’t plan on paying for the bill, it’s still polite to reach for your wallet whenever the check comes. Your date will probably insist that they’ve got it, and you can thank them for taking you out. Is your date insisting that you split it, even though you want to pay? Avoid the awkwardness by saying something like, “I’ll get this one, and you can get the next one.” If you're having a hard time accepting that your date wants to pay for everything, try to think about this in another way: remember that this is their way to show that they want to take care of you.

      "content": "After the first date, you two can split the bill. When things start to get a little more serious, both partners can share the weight of paying for a night out. The second, third, and fourth dates can all be a dual effort. If you two end up in a serious relationship, you can talk about who’s going to pay and when to split the bill whenever the time comes. [3] X Research source If you want to bring up who’s going to pay before you go out, say something like, “Since I got our last date, would you mind paying for this one?”"

      "content": "In modern dating, men aren’t expected to pay for every date. That’s a pretty antiquated tradition, and it’s fallen out of fashion in the past few decades. In fact, having the man pay for all of the dates can set a relationship up for failure—eventually, the guy in the relationship might feel like he’s being used or taken advantage of, which can cause resentment. [4] X Research source Having one partner consistently pay the bill can also create a weird power imbalance. The person being paid for might feel like they “owe” their partner, which isn’t a healthy set up. [5] X Research source"

If you’re the one who invited someone else out, make your plans for a spot that you can afford—that way, you can treat your date and make a great first impression. [6] X Research source If you do need to split the bill, just ask your date outright. That way, there are no awkward pauses as you and your date figure out who’s paying. Say something like, “Hey, would you mind if we split this?” or, “Could we go dutch on this one?”"
