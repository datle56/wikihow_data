      "content": "It can be hard to get in enough air while you’re crying. If you’ve ever had a really emotional cry, then you’re probably familiar with the feeling of not being able to breathe properly between sobs. This is called hyperventilating. Because you’re so short of breath, your brain is getting less oxygen than normal. This leads to an overall feeling of drowsiness when you get your breathing back under control. You might also feel dizzy or lightheaded, which may make you want to lie down for a bit until you feel better. [1] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Your level of fatigue usually matches how hard you were crying and hyperventilating. So if you only shed a few tears, you likely won’t feel too exhausted when you’re done."

      "content": "Your heart rate speeds up, leaving you feeling tired afterward. Right before you start crying, your sympathetic nervous system, or your “fight or flight” response, is triggered. This causes your heart rate to increase, which can leave you feeling tired, dizzy, or a bit lightheaded.

      "content": "Your body releases hormones that make you sleepy. One of these hormones is oxytocin, and it directly combats the stress hormone cortisol and calms you down. A side effect of this increase in oxytocin levels is drowsiness since oxytocin naturally promotes sleep. Hormones known as endorphins are also released, and they help relieve pain, reduce stress, and improve your mood.

      "title": "Crying is your body’s way of soothing itself.",
      "content": "Crying is your body’s way of soothing itself. Your body has 2 nervous systems: the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). The SNS drives your fight-or-flight instinct when things get stressful, and your PNS works to calm you down. When you cry, your PNS is active longer than your SNS, meaning that your body is ultimately able to soothe itself and leave you feeling more relaxed despite the initial stress. This calm feeling might translate into sleepiness. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

Many people claim that they feel lighter and much less overwhelmed after crying it out. This feeling of relief is also known as “catharsis” and is good in helping you deal with difficult or painful emotions.

      "content": "Crying reduces your risk of certain health complications. By holding in your tears and bottling up your emotions, you’re actually harming your body. On the other hand, crying has been shown to decrease stress, lower cortisol levels, and make you more resilient to certain cardiovascular diseases, specifically hypertension. Crying is also good for strengthening your immune system and can help prevent certain mental health conditions, such as stress, depression, and anxiety. [6] X Research source"

Letting yourself be vulnerable like this ultimately helps strengthen your connection with those who come to care for you and empathize with whatever you’re going through.

      "content": "Your body sheds tears for many different purposes. Your body has 3 different kinds of tears it produces depending on what’s happening. Some tears are created to protect your eyes, while others are shed as an emotional response to certain events. The 3 types of tears are: [13] X Research source Basal tears : These are the tears your body sheds naturally to keep your eyes moist. These tears also act as a protective shield for your cornea. You’re constantly shedding these tears, even if you don’t notice it. Reflexive tears : You shed reflexive tears when something gets in your eye, like dust, dirt, or whatever it is in onions that makes some people tear up. Emotional tears : These are usually triggered when something really emotional happens. Emotional tears contain different proteins and hormones than basal and reflexive tears. These are what help you regulate stress and bring your body back to a calm state."
