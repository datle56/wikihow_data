      "content": "If you text someone who blocked you, they won't receive your text. In most cases, you won't see anything special on your end—no notifications that you've been blocked , and the message won't fail. The text will look like it went through, but the person you're texting won't know you've texted them. However, if your texting app usually shows \"Delivered\" below the messages you send, you won't see \"Delivered\" when you text a number that blocked you. Not seeing \"Delivered\" does not necessarily mean that you've been blocked—just that the message was not delivered to that person's phone. [1] X Research source If you are using an iPhone and text another iPhone user using iMessage , your texting bubbles will be blue to indicate that you're both using iMessage. If you see a green bubble when you text someone, they may have blocked you, but bubbles can also turn green if you or the person you're texting are not connected to the internet, their phone is off or on airplane mode, or one of you has turned off iMessage."

      "content": "Check the color of the message bubble on iPhone. If you send a text message to another iPhone user using iMessage, the message bubble is usually blue because messages sent over iMessage are sent over the internet. If you are texting another iPhone user and the message bubble turns green, this could mean you've been blocked. If you text somebody with an Android or whose phone is off or not connected to the internet, they're sent through your carrier and will have green bubbles. The message bubble may also appear green if you have \"Send as SMS\" turned on in the Settings. To check, open the Settings app, scroll down, and tap Messages . Then, ensure the toggle switch next to \"Send as SMS\" is turned off."

      "title": "Check the delivery status.",
      "content": "Check the delivery status. Usually, sending a text message will give you a delivery status that says \"Delivered\" or something similar. When the message is read, the delivery status might change to \"Read\" if both parties use read receipts, though this isn't common. You've likely been blocked if the text message is not marked as \"Delivered\" after a few days. If the delivery status reads \"Delivered\" but does not read as \"Read\" for a few days, it could also mean you've been blocked. Another reason a text message may not go through is if the recipient has a poor cellular signal or they do not have access to their phone."

      "title": "Call the phone number.",
      "content": "Call the phone number. Text messaging doesn't give you too many clues as to whether or not you have been blocked, but calling the number might. If you call a number that has blocked you, generally, you will hear one ring, and then your call will go straight to voicemail. If the person rejects your call because they are busy, you will hear a random number of rings. If their phone is off or on Do Not Disturb, your call will generally go straight to voicemail. One ring usually means you've been blocked. You can leave a voicemail for someone who has blocked your number, but they will not be notified that you left them a voicemail. Depending on their phone settings and carrier, voicemails from blocked numbers may be routed to a separate inbox."

      "content": "Use Suggested Contacts on Android. If you have an Android, you can use the Suggested Contacts feature to see if you've been blocked. You will first need to delete them from your contacts, then search for their name. If the person you're searching for doesn't appear as a suggested contact, there is a good chance you have been blocked."

      "content": "Ask them. This may not be possible if they don't want you to talk to them. Still, you can ask if you see them in person, or message them over social media or using a third-party messaging app like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp . Blocking someone on your phone does not affect third-party messaging apps."

      "title": "If you try to text a number you blocked, the text will still go through.",
      "content": "If you try to text a number you blocked, the text will still go through. If you blocked the person on your Android or iPhone, this won't prevent you from sending them text messages or calling them. Blocking a number on your phone only prevents that person from contacting you . However, you will not receive their replies unless you unblock them . The exception to this is if you call your wireless carrier and have them block the number. Different wireless carriers work differently, but if you block a number through your wireless carrier, it is possible you may not be able to send or receive text messages from the recipient."
