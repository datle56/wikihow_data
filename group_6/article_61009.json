      "title": "The Chariot reversed indicates feeling powerless and adrift.",
      "content": "The Chariot reversed indicates feeling powerless and adrift. The Chariot upright depicts a powerful character who is in full control of their situation, so in reverse the card has the opposite meaning–a lack of control. You may be exhausted, confused, or even angry about certain circumstances in your life that are holding you back. Since you don’t feel like you’re in control of your own fate, you may be struggling with apathy and a lack of motivation. [1] X Research source What to do: consider what circumstances or situations are currently within your control and start making positive changes in those areas. Even small changes can make a significant difference in the way you feel, and this will motivate you to make bigger changes. Keywords: lack of self-discipline, opposition, aggression, lack of direction, overcompensation, self-doubt In a yes or no reading, The Chariot reversed means “no.” If you aren't sure where to get started with formulating questions, check out our helpful primer ."

      "title": "If you’re single, the card points to an unhealthy fixation on love.",
      "content": "If you’re single, the card points to an unhealthy fixation on love. Everyone wants to love and be loved in return, and falling in love is all you’ve been thinking about lately. You’re more than ready for a relationship, but you just can’t seem to find the right person–you’re starting to wonder if there’s anyone out there for you after all. Focusing on what you don’t have (a romantic relationship) is preventing you from pursuing your other goals and living your best life. [2] X Research source What to do: no matter how much you want a relationship, you can’t will the perfect partner into existence. Love tends to come knocking when you stop searching for it, so for now, be patient and focus on your hobbies, interests, work/school, and other relationships. You’re more likely to meet your soulmate when you’re out there living life to the fullest . Keywords: obsession with romance, forcefulness"

      "title": "If you’re in a relationship, the card indicates frustration with progress.",
      "content": "If you’re in a relationship, the card indicates frustration with progress. You’ve been feeling like it's time to take your relationship to the next level and you’re eager to do so–maybe a little too eager. You’ve been rushing to reach the next relationship milestone without enjoying where you are now. Conversely, the card can indicate your partner is the one rushing things and you don’t feel ready yet. One way or the other, the relationship is lacking balance. [3] X Research source What to do: when it comes to love, it’s all about the journey rather than the destination, and there’s nothing wrong with taking the scenic route. Get to know your partner thoroughly before moving forward and enjoy every step of the way. When you strive for balance, harmony tends to follow. Keywords: frustration, lack of balance, lack of progress"

      "title": "You feel plagued by obstacles that are preventing you from advancing.",
      "content": "You feel plagued by obstacles that are preventing you from advancing. There are always bumps in the road on the way to success, but you seem to be at a full standstill lately. As a result, you’re feeling unmotivated and unsure about your career goals. It’s also possible that you’ve been overcompensating for feelings of powerlessness by working too much, and you’ve pushed so hard that you’ve alienated loved ones, coworkers, and industry peers. What to do: take a step back to reassess your career goals and figure out what changes you need to make to achieve them. Success isn’t achieved overnight–you’ll get there one step at a time. Try to focus on the quality of your work and what motivates you instead of fixating on the end goal. [4] X Research source Keywords: uncertainty, powerlessness, overcompensation"

      "title": "You may be rushing into a financial decision without thinking it through.",
      "content": "You may be rushing into a financial decision without thinking it through. There’s a major financial opportunity in your life that seems too good to pass up and you’re ready to sign off on it. Or perhaps you have your eye on a big purchase, like a home or vehicle, and you’re eager to set things in motion. You may feel comfortable making this decision now, but The Chariot reversed urges you to get all of the facts first. [5] X Research source What to do: take time to consider upcoming financial decisions from every angle. Make sure you have all of the information you need to make an educated decision, then make your move. Avoid rushing into any big investments and hire a financial advisor if you need to. Keywords: hasty decisions, impulsive purchases"

      "title": "You’re pushing yourself beyond your physical or emotional limits.",
      "content": "You’re pushing yourself beyond your physical or emotional limits. Maybe you’re back at the gym after a long break and you’ve been pushing yourself a little too hard. You may even have suffered a minor injury as a result and now you’re feeling sidelined and upset. Or you’re working hard toward some other health-related goal and your eagerness to make progress is becoming counterproductive and negatively affecting you. Conversely, it's possible that you haven't been taking care of your health and the neglect is starting to have a lasting impact on your overall well-being. [6] X Research source What to do: being motivated to improve is great, but lasting change doesn’t happen overnight. Rushing into your fitness goals and pushing yourself beyond your physical limits will only slow you down, so be patient with yourself. You’ll get there! Keywords: overexertion, strain"
