      "content": "The sidewalk rule is when a man walks closest to the street when they’re with a woman. While you may have seen the trend pop up more recently on TikTok, the sidewalk rule is common social etiquette for a guy trying to be a gentleman. When a couple is walking down the road, a guy following the sidewalk rule will stand on the side closer to the street. That way, if a vehicle drives too close to the curb or a puddle splashes up, the guy is there to protect the girl he’s with. [1] X Research source While most people refer to the sidewalk rule for relationships between a man and a woman, it’s applicable to same-sex couples as well. A partner following the sidewalk rule is simply taking a more protective role. People may follow the sidewalk rule outside of romantic relationships as well. You may follow the sidewalk rule when you’re with your children, siblings, or any other person you care about."

      "content": "Men walked closer to the street in medieval times to protect women from sewage splashes. Back in the Middle Ages before plumbing and sewers were invented, roads had open trenches where waste and water ran. To protect women from splashes getting on their clothes or dresses, men would walk closer to the street. The habit stuck around as a sign of chivalry and etiquette. [5] X Research source Another reason men would walk closer to the street was people emptying their chamber pots from windows on higher stories. The waste was less likely to splash right next to the building, so men would have women walk closer to the wall just in case."
