[2] X Research source Uninstalling bad apps can be a bit of a trial-and-error process, so start with any apps that load immediately when your Android starts up (e.g., Home Screen widgets). You can check that the app you're uninstalling is bad by looking it up online to see whether or not other users have experienced the same problem. To avoid errors with apps, make sure you only download apps from the Google Play Store (or Galaxy Store, Amazon App Store, etc). Downloading apps from unofficial sources may increase the chances of installing malware or viruses on your phone."
