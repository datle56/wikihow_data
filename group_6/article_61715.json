Focusing Ring : This is used so that you can make the object that you are photographing clear. Aperture Ring : This is used to adjust the amount of light that exposes to the film, this is important to adjust according to your light environment. ASA Film Speed : This is used to adjust the ASA which is the referred to as film speed, The film speed you choose depends on what film you have to use the manufacturer will note the film speed: 400 is the most common ideal for indoor and outdoor shots.

      "content": "Use the light meter. After turning on the Light Meter look through the viewfinder to the right side. The circle represents aperture, and the needle represents shutter speed. Move both the shutter speed and aperture until they line up to give you a better idea of what to set your aperture and shutter speed to. Using the light meter isn’t necessary for taking good quality photos with the FTb, but it can help beginners with finding a general aperture and shutter speed. You shouldn’t rely on this light meter though; although it can be a useful tool in guiding you, it is deceptive and not as accurate as it used to be. This is due to the change in voltage with the alkaline replacement battery because the original battery was a mercury battery."

Once you find the right aperture and shutter speed setting and you have your camera focused, make sure your shutter lock is set to “A” and gently press the shutter release button. You will hear a click and that will be the shutter opening and closing, exposing the film to what you have your camera focused on. To shoot another photo you must pull the film advance lever to the right and then you are ready to take another photo."
