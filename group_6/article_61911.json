If you've been walking for a few weeks and are interested in increasing your intensity and overall calorie burn, you'll need to gauge your current level of intensity and figure out how to increase it. If you're working out at a moderate intensity, you can talk and have a conversation with someone, but you're not completely out of breath. If you're working at a moderately high to high intensity, you're very out of breath and can only say short sentences without stopping for a breath. [13] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source In addition to just walking faster or increasing your pace, there are other ways that you can increase the intensity of your walking or increase the calorie burn. You can try: walking uphill or taking a stroller with you (if you have one). You can also try carrying ankle or hand weights in a well-fitted backpack, wearing them for brief one to two minute intervals, and then carrying them in the backpack again. Wearing ankle or wrist weights for 20 minutes or longer can lead to injury and/or joint problems in the knees, hips, elbows and shoulders, so only wear them for a short period of time if you choose to use them in your workout."
