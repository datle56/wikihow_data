[1] X Research source If your pom pom maker only has 1 plastic piece on each side, all you have to do is open the maker and align both sides. [2] X Research source Maker sizes might vary slightly between brands. Check the package to see the size of your pom pom maker. Acrylic or wool yarn tends to be best, however, anything you have on hand will do. The thicker the yarn you use, the fuller and fluffier your pom pom will be. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Wrap yarn around one side of the maker to cover it evenly. Tuck the tail end of the yarn between the 2 pieces of the maker. Wrap around the 2 pieces, moving back and forth, until the inside edge disappears and the yarn is even in thickness. [4] X Research source Alternatively, tuck the tail end underneath and wrap the yarn over it. The more layers of yarn, the denser your pom pom will be. However, make sure it’s thin enough that you can still close the maker comfortably."

      "content": "Cut along the groove under the yarn along the edge of the maker. Most plastic pom pom makers have a small divot on the side, between the 4 yarned plastic pieces. Insert your scissor blade into the hole, then cut along the outside groove to cut the yarn loops on both sides. Use a sharp pair of scissors to more easily cut through the multiple layers of yarn. Hold the center of the pom pom maker tightly as you cut to keep it from moving."

Cross one end over the other and pull on both ends until the yarn is completely tight. [8] X Research source Cross one end of the yarn over the other and insert it into the loop created. Pull tightly to create a knot. Repeat on the other side. [9] X Research source When the yarn slips into the groove, it wraps around the middle of the pom pom inside the maker. Tying a knot on each side holds the pom pom together. If you’re worried about the pom pom coming loose, tie an additional knot on each side. [10] X Research source You can keep the length of yarn to hang your pom pom up as an ornament or to use it for another project, or you can trim them off. [11] X Research source"
