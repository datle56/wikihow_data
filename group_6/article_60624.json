But if we take a closer look, we can see some bigger categories forming from them. Take a look at the following few items from the list: 1) Cafeteria food that makes you sick; 2) uncomfortable uniforms; 3) gym exercises. Notice anything similar about these three items? They all have to do with being physically uncomfortable. Whether you’re throwing up after eating mystery meat, itching all day from your overly-tight uniform, or aching all over after gym, your body is experiencing physical discomfort . This is one category that can help organize your list. Other categories might be social discomfort, or academic discomfort. Social Discomfort might include having few friends, getting gossiped about, getting judged, navigating exclusive social groups (cliques), or attending school dances. Academic Discomfort might include getting called on in class, strict study hall monitors, boring classes, or getting bad grades."

      "content": "Figure out which category on your list summarizes the biggest problems you have with high school. Your “problem category” isn’t necessarily the category with the most number of items. To figure out the problem category you hate the most, think about the individual items on your list and notice how you feel. Does thinking about gym exercises make your chest clench? Does thinking about gossip bring a lump to your throat? Circle the problem category that bothers you the most. Now that you’ve figured out what you hate most about high school, it’s time to start coming up with specific, useful solutions. Do keep in mind that this is only a starting point. You can, and should, go back to each category and repeat the next steps as many times as you need to."

      "content": "Ask yourself why you circled the category you did. When creating a plan, you need to know the exact things that your plan is going to address. In this step, figure out why you hate what you hate about high school. This might be hard to do at first, but keep asking yourself “why do I hate this?” when you look at the items under the category you circled. Here are three examples of ways you might reason through why you circled a certain category: “I circled ‘Physical Discomfort.’ I hate beating up my body every day in gym class, and our uniforms are itchy and too tight. But why do I hate gym class and uniforms so much? Well…when I wake up every morning I feel like I can’t move my legs, and there’s this weird rash on my back that isn’t going away. Those are two things that are making going to high school literally painful for me.“ “I circled ‘Social Discomfort.’ I never get asked out to school dances, and I’m hearing gossip about me every day. I guess what makes things like gossip really bad is that I don’t have a group of friends I can fall back on. No one’s there to back me up against the gossip, and I don’t have anyone to hang out with when school dances roll around.” “I circled ‘Academic Discomfort.’ Math is the most boring subject in school, and I hate it when the teacher calls on me. Every minute of class drags on, and whenever I get called on I don’t know what to say. I’ve had boring classes before, but this class feels like torture. I guess this class is especially bad because I didn’t get a chance to learn half the material we’re covering in middle school, and I can’t even figure out how to do most of the homework.” The point of this step is to figure out the reasons behind your dislike of high school. Write down your reasons on a separate sheet of paper. Now that you’ve identified why you hate high school, you can take specific steps to solve the problem."

      "content": "Brainstorm ways to tackle the problems you’ve identified. For example, if you don’t feel like you have a group of friends you can talk to and rely on, write down some possible ways to make new friends. Don’t limit yourself here! Come up with as many ideas as you can, even if you can’t imagine yourself doing them. Here are a few examples of ways you might write out your thoughts: Problem: I need a group of friends who I can fall back on. Ways I can solve this: 1. Try out new student clubs I’m interested in. 2. Sit with people eating alone in the cafeteria 3. Help out people struggling with things that I’m good at. 4. Try talking with other students sitting quietly on the bus 5. Join activities and organizations outside of school. Problem: Math class is covering material I never learned, and the teacher is always making me participate in class. Ways I can solve this: 1. Talk with my teacher and explain the situation. 2. Figure out what areas I can work on, and borrow the right textbooks from the library. 3. Ask someone if she wants to study for math together. 4. Write down everything I don’t understand, and bring it up during class. 5. Ask my teacher to slow down. Problem: Gym class is making it painful to get up from bed. Ways I can solve this: 1. Try to stretch more after gym 2. Go to the doctor and see if something’s wrong. 3. Talk with my gym teacher and ask her for advice. 4. Find ice and bandages to apply to my legs after class. Keep this list handy. It’ll be useful as you come up with your action plan."

By this point, you've already identified why high school is such a painful experience. You've created a set of possible solutions, talked them over with others, and tried them all.

Ask if you will lose any academic credits by transferring. Depending on the high school you’re considering transferring to, you might have to retake classes or meet new requirements, which will force you to graduate late. It’s probably a good idea to send your transcripts to the registrar so she can check whether or not you’ll lose any credits in the transfer.

High school offers many academic and social experiences you won’t get at home. If you’ve tried transferring and are still hating high school, it might be time to consider getting academic credentials through the General Educational Development (GED) test instead. Note that there is some controversy over the value of a GED. There is debate over whether most colleges and employers see getting a GED as equivalent to getting a high school degree. However, most people would agree that having a GED gives you more options than not having one will. 17 American states currently offer alternatives to the GED, and 10 states don't offer the GED entirely. [5] X Research source Contact your high school registrar for more information on whether your state offers the GED or an alternative testing method. If your state doesn't offer the GED, schedule a meeting with your registrar or academic counselor to get more information on how to get alternative credentials."
