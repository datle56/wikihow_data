      "content": "Know that she’s probably just busy or distracted. That’s all. Don’t overthink it. Don’t start analyzing the last messages you sent. We’re all swamped these days with messages, notifications, and alerts, and it can be overwhelming. She might just need a tech break for a while. [1] X Research source Here are some common reasons she might not want to text right now: [2] X Research source She might be busy with work, school, family, and friends. She might be out of cell reception. She might not want to spend her day glued to her phone. She might feel pressure to come up with “perfect” replies. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Give her some time and space to reply. We know this is a tough one, but when you give her time and space, you prove two things. First, you show her you’re not desperate. Second, you demonstrate you can give her what she asks for and respect what she wants. If she wants a little time before replying, give it to her! [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Distract yourself and enjoy your life. Nothing feels worse than sitting around waiting for the girl you like to text back. But guess what? You’ve got plenty of other options for things to do! Once you realize that you’ve got an interesting, fun life, she’ll be able to sense that confidence and independence when you two talk. [5] X Research source Here are a few activities to get your mind off her: Check out a new coffee shop or restaurant. Text one of your friends. Get in a short workout. Go do something for other people. Help out a neighbor, family member, or charity."

      "title": "If you’re setting up a date, you don’t need to wait 24 hours.",
      "content": "If you’re setting up a date, you don’t need to wait 24 hours. Give her a couple hours of space if you can, but when you need a response fast for scheduling purposes, let her know. This approach works particularly well if you asked her about making plans and she responded “text you later.” [6] X Research source Joke with her: “Don’t think too hard now!” [7] X Research source Bring up the plans you were trying to make: “I get it, picking between the beach and grabbing coffee is a tough choice.” Explain why you need a response: “Are we still on for Tuesday night? Let me know because I need to buy tickets.”"

      "title": "After 1 day, use a bit of humor to revive the conversation.",
      "content": "After 1 day, use a bit of humor to revive the conversation. Instead of sending a serious “Are you okay?” text, keep it light. Chances are, she’ll apologize and respond with a reason why she wasn’t able to text you back. [8] X Research source “I understand if you’re too nervous to text me back. I’ve been told I have that effect on people.” [9] X Research source “I’m going to have to give you an F in texting.” Only use this approach if you two engage in a lot of banter. Otherwise, she might take it as aggressive."

      "content": "Use a silly prompt to get her to reply. Once you’ve waited and given her space, try and restart the conversation if she hasn’t messaged back. Instead of trying to pick up where you left off, throw in a new conversation starter. Keep it playful to continue building your bond and boost her attraction to you. [10] X Research source “Hey if we could go anywhere together, where would you want to travel?” “What’s a superpower you’ve always wanted to have?” “What celebrity do you think would do best in the zombie apocalypse?”"

      "content": "Send her an interesting update about your life. Try this strategy to pique her interest again. It’s even better if you send something cool that you did and back it up with a photo. [11] X Research source Try the cliffhanger approach: “You’ll never guess who I just ran into…” Tell her about amazing food: “I just had the best burrito ever. Guess where I found it.” Send a photo of yourself doing something fun: “Just checked bungee jumping off my bucket list.”"

      "content": "Did you send her a super intense text? If an emotional outburst led to her “I’ll text you later” message, wait a few hours. Then, if you need to apologize, do it. If you hurt her feelings, ask about how she’s doing. Depending on the level of emotions, it might be an even better idea just to call her. [12] X Research source “Hey, I know that last conversation got really intense. Are you ok?” “I’m really sorry about those last messages. That wasn’t cool.” “Can we talk on the phone? I feel really bad about what I said.”"

      "content": "Play it cool and don’t immediately text back. As a rule of thumb, if she does send another text after a few hours, wait a few minutes before replying. [13] X Research source Don’t acknowledge the delay. Instead, continue the conversation as if no time passed. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Limit your text length to about 3 lines.",
      "content": "Limit your text length to about 3 lines. She might find it difficult to respond to long texts or thinking you’re coming on too strong. [15] X Research source Similarly, avoid heavy subject matter in your messages. Some people may really enjoy deep conversations over text, but if you don’t know her well yet, hold off. Be brief if she asks what you’re up to: “Just hanging out with friends. We’re grabbing pizza tonight! Hbu?” Avoid overwhelming her by only sending 1 question per text: “How’s your weekend going?” [16] X Research source instead of “How’s your weekend going? Do you have fun plans?”"

      "title": "As a rule, avoid sending multiple messages back-to-back.",
      "content": "As a rule, avoid sending multiple messages back-to-back. Double or triple texting can send a needy vibe and increase the odds she’ll stop responding or say “text you later.” The exception to the rule is if she’s replying really quickly. Then it’s okay to send multiple messages as long as she’s doing the same. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "If you get stressed out waiting for her to respond, take a breath.",
      "content": "If you get stressed out waiting for her to respond, take a breath. Texting the girl you like can feel super intimidating and stressful. Instead of thinking “I’m texting my crush” just imagine you’re texting a friend. Your messages will probably come out more naturally, and you won’t worry as much about her response time. [18] X Research source Share a funny GIF or meme. Ask her for advice as a way to start a conversation: “Hey can I get your advice on something?” Don’t interrogate her with questions. Add a few normal comments alongside your questions: “I was just thinking about the movie we watched in Psych class. Super weird, right?”"

      "content": "Let her go if she stops responding or keeps saying she’ll text you later. It’s normal if she doesn’t text back a few times or has a few late responses. However, when she consistently ignores your messages, says she’ll respond later (and doesn’t), or leaves you on read, she’s probably not interested. Trust your instincts and be kind to yourself by moving on. You’ll find someone out there who’s right for you! [19] X Research source Don’t take it personally. She might not be interested in seeing anyone right now."
