      "content": "Fill two plastic sandwich bags 1/4 of the way up with water. Seal the bag so that no water can escape. Use easy-to-seal Ziploc bags for convenience. Otherwise, tie the opening of each bag shut."

      "title": "Put the water bags into your shoes.",
      "content": "Put the water bags into your shoes. Wedge each bag deep into the toe box of the shoe. If you want to stretch another part of the heel, then try to arrange the bag such that the water will expand at the desired point. Be aware that this technique works best on leather/suede shoes. It also usually works on fake leather. However, false leather tends to shrink back to its original size rather quickly, so you'll have to repeat this a couple of times for the full effect."

      "title": "Freeze the water.",
      "content": "Freeze the water. Place the heels in the freezer, bags of water and all. Leave them to cool overnight. If you need to stretch the heels more quickly, then make sure to wait at least until the water has completely frozen within the bags. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Thaw the ice.",
      "content": "Thaw the ice. Once the water has frozen overnight, remove the shoes from the freezer. Leave the ice packs to thaw for 20-25 minutes: until the ice melts to water. Remove the bags from the shoes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry the shoes.",
      "content": "Dry the shoes. Wipe off any water that the melting ice bags have left on your heels. Then, try to wear the heels. Check whether they've stretched enough. If the shoes still don't fit, then feel free to freeze again or try another method."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put on a lot of socks.",
      "content": "Put on a lot of socks. Two pairs of thick socks should do the trick. Use more sock layers if you want to stretch your heels even wider. The goal is to make your feet thick enough to stretch the shoes, but not so thick that they will not fit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wedge your feet into the heels.",
      "content": "Wedge your feet into the heels. This might be difficult – but try to get them all the way in. Don't hurt your feet or crush your toes! If you simply cannot fit your feet into the shoes, then remove a layer of socks and try again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blow-dry your feet.",
      "content": "Blow-dry your feet. Now, heat the stuffed-up heels with the hot air from a blowdryer. Focus on the areas that most need a stretch. Wiggle your toes and flex your arches. Keep it up for 2-3 minutes until the leather is hot – but not uncomfortably so. Leave your sock-clad feet in the heels until the leather cools. This way, the leather will cool around your slightly-larger-than-usual feet, and it will settle into a stretched position. Be careful with the heat. Don't let the leather grow dangerously hot. If the heat begins to scorch your skin, then take the heels off and try again later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove your socks.",
      "content": "Remove your socks. Once the leather has cooled, try wearing the heels without the layers of thick socks. If they fit comfortably, then your work is done. If the shoes still need some stretching, then repeat the procedure until you're satisfied. If you want to break in the shoes a bit more: try bending them back and forth to loosen the leather. Then, blast with heat again for 2-3 minutes to wear in the material."

      "title": "Find a cobbler near you.",
      "content": "Find a cobbler near you. If you live in a reasonably populated area, then there's a good chance that you have access to a shoemaker or a shoe repair shop. Search online for a reputable cobbler in your city, and then pay him/her a visit. [2] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 25 September 2020."

    {
      "title": "Be prepared to pay.",
      "content": "Be prepared to pay. A simple stretching job should be relatively cheap – likely in the range of $15-30, depending on the cobbler, the region, and the degree of stretching that you need done. However, this route is almost certainly more time-consuming and more expensive than stretching your heels at home. Remember that in most cases, you are paying for quality and convenience."
