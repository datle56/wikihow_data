If you have an Amazon gift card balance that you were planning on transferring but can't, you may be wondering what you should use it on. Amazon has a lot to offer, which may be overwhelming. Here's a few suggestions on what you can buy instead: Household essentials. If you're running low on essentials like toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning products, batteries, deodorant, or first aid supplies, stock up on Amazon. Use Google (or your favorite search engine) to compare prices with local stores to make sure you're getting the best deal. Whole Foods groceries. With Amazon Fresh, you can use your Amazon gift card balance to get groceries from Whole Foods. You can even get same-day delivery of your groceries right to your doorstep, or you can choose to pick them up yourself from a Whole Foods location. Pet supplies. If you have a pet, you know that they can be surprisingly expensive. Use your Amazon balance to stock up on your pet's food and favorite treats, or surprise your pet with some toys and a new collar (or a full outfit, if you prefer to dress your pet up). Items for a new hobby. If you've been thinking of starting a new hobby but you haven't because you didn't want to buy all the materials, consider using your Amazon gift card balance to pay for it. Just be sure to read reviews before you buy to make sure the items you're getting are good quality and actually work. Gifts for family and friends. If you have birthdays, holidays, or another special occasion coming up, use your Amazon balance to buy gifts for your loved ones. Since Amazon has a huge variety of items for sale, you'll be able to find the items on your friends' and family's wish lists easily. A splurge item for yourself. If you've got a pretty big gift card balance, consider treating yourself to something you wouldn't normally buy because of the price, such as a gaming console, high-quality headphones, a fancy kitchen appliance, or a designer pair of sunglasses."
