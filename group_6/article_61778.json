      "content": "Use the italicized term next to your chosen word to determine what grammatical category it falls into. This will tell you if the word is a noun, adjective or verb and will make sure you’re using the synonym correctly. For example, if your original word was a verb, make sure the synonym you’re using is also a verb. This will also tell you if you’re using similar word the right way. For example, “intent” can be an adjective or a noun. However, “intention” is also a noun with the same meaning."

This will help you understand if your original word didn’t quite mean what you wanted or if it has an entirely different meaning. Your thesaurus will include a definition of your original word to help you understand if a synonym is appropriate or if you want to consider a different word completely. If your thesaurus doesn’t include definitions, look the word up in a dictionary to be sure of its meaning."

Look up how it can be used in a sentence and see if your original meaning still makes sense. [3] X Research source Some words or phrases may be idioms.

Check the word’s spelling and its contextual use in a dictionary to be sure you haven’t used the incorrect word. Rather than list a small selection of synonyms for each term like an alphabetical thesaurus (which can lead to duplication) there is an index to longer, numbered entries.
