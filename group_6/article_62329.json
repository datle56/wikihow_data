      "content": "Transition your baby from a crib to a bed around 1.5 to 3.5 years of age. Much like lowering your baby’s crib, making the switch from crib to bed depends on your child. In general, most parents are advised to transition their child from a crib to a bed when their child begins climbing over the rails, which usually occurs between the ages of 1.5 to 3.5 years. Things to keep in mind: [7] X Research source . You have plenty of options when determining what type of bed is best suited for your little one. Taking out your crib mattress and placing it on the ground is perfectly safe, or you can opt for a normal bed, futon, or more traditional toddler bed, which often come in fun shapes and are both smaller and lower to the ground. Do not transition your child to a bunk bed until they are at least 6 years old, as they are too dangerous for very young children due to the height of the top bunk. No matter what you choose, the important thing is to make sure all sides of the bed you select are protected from potential falls. Remove any obstacles, such as dressers with sharp corners, from the surrounding area to protect your child from injury. Even if they’re too small, using the same sheets or mattress cover on your child’s new bed will make them feel comfortable and help the transition go more smoothly."
