      "content": "A vajacial is a spa treatment done in the bikini area after a wax or shave. Vajacials (vagina facials) focus on the bikini line, pubic mound, and outer labia—nothing is inserted or applied to the inside of the vagina. [1] X Research source These 20 to 50 minute treatments are typically done after a Brazilian wax, but you can also have them done after you shave, lazer, or sugar your hair. Your bikini area must be completely bare in order to have a vajacial done professionally. Most spas have vajacials in conjunction with or as a follow-up treatment to a Brazilian or other hair removal treatments. Ask your esthetician how long you should wait after shaving or waxing your bikini area before getting a vajacial. Vajacials aren’t limited to people who have vaginas—men and people with penises can also get a vajacial."

      "content": "Vajacials promote clear, smooth, even skin after hair removal. Vajacials might help remove ingrown hairs and blackheads, remove dead skin cells, prevent acne from forming, brighten hyperpigmentation, smooth bumps around the bikini area, and maintain healthy hydrated skin. Vajacials can also help boost your self confidence and make you feel refreshed. Vajacials can also help get rid of bacteria and prevent irritation from waxing or shaving. Vajacials aren’t required for vaginal health—instead, they’re a nice relaxing treatment you can get when you’d like. If you have frequent acne problems in your bikini area, consider having a vajacial done once every three to six months. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Most vajacials are completely safe when done by a licensed esthetician. Most vajacials are generally safe and painless. However, vajacials that are performed by inexperienced or poorly trained estheticians can result in infections, pain, and other side effects. [5] X Research source Before you book a vajacial, check to make sure your spa is licensed and hygienic. Book with a medi-spa specialized in intimate care and make sure the estheticians are using the proper safety precautions, like wearing gloves and disinfecting all equipment. [6] X Research source Vajacials are generally safe for sensitive skin. However, you can always ask your esthetician to do a patch test beforehand. If you have allergies, ask your esthetician what ingredients they use before starting the treatment. You can get a vajacial while you’re on your period. However, keep in mind that during a waxing or the extraction portion of the vajacial, you may be more sensitive than usual. You can get a vajacial while pregnant by adjusting the treatment to your needs. Make sure none of the products they use contain essential oils.

Vaginal steaming is believed to tighten, clean, and freshen the vagina, and involves sitting over a pot of steaming water infused with herbs.

[9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try to avoid vajacial treatments that include vaginal steaming.
