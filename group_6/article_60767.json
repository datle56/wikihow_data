You can also print out your own or try drawing your own on notecards. Hold up the image of the animal and ask your preschoolers to identify it. If they get it right, give them lots of love and praise. If they get it wrong, gently correct them and keep up positive energy. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Have some fun with paint and construction paper. Draw different animal shapes on construction paper and cut them out so your kids can make a fun collage. Have them paint different animals on drawing paper or construction paper with markers, crayons, or non-toxic paint. The art doesn’t have to be perfect, just keep it fun and relaxed and talk about the different animals while your kids work on their art projects. [3] X Research source There are a ton of different art projects you could use. Have your kids trace their hands to make the outline for a turkey. Turn toilet paper tubes into adorable penguins by painting them with black and white paint. Try looking up different animal-themed art projects you can try out with your kids."

      "content": "Print out coloring sheets or use a coloring book. What kid doesn’t like to color? Break out some animal-themed coloring books or print out a bunch of blank animal templates. Let the children use their imaginations and use whatever colors they want to fill in the images. While they color, use the time to talk to them about the animals they’re working on. [4] X Research source For instance, if they’re coloring a lion, you could talk about where lions live, what their mane is for, and what kind of food they eat."

[7] X Research source For instance, you could say, “Run like an elephant!” and have them run like they have a trunk, or “Run like a wolf” and have them run on all fours."
