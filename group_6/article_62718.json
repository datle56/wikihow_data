      "content": "“Yiy” is Jamaican Patois for “eye.” The slang term “yiy” (pronounced “eye”) came from Jamaican Patois, a Creole dialect that was shaped by Jamaican colonial heritage. [1] X Research source The term became popular in U.S. hip hop culture after Popcaan released a mixtape called “Yiy Change” that rapper Drake later referenced in his song, “Controlla.” [2] X Research source “Yiy change” can refer to your eyes changing color or size after doing drugs, or to a general change in your mindset. [3] X Research source It can also mean to get some sleep or rest, especially after partying. [4] X Research source Jamaican D.J. Popcaan also released a song called “Fry Yiy” that inspired the name for Night Owl Sound’s podcast, Fry Yiy Show . [5] X Research source Popcaan said that “fry yiy” means “hot skull,” and refers to the short temper he had when he was younger. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "“Yiy” can also be a misspelling of “you.”",
      "content": "“Yiy” can also be a misspelling of “you.” In text or on chatting apps like Snapchat, “yiy” might be mistakenly used instead of the word “you.” If someone sends you “yiy” and it doesn’t seem like they’re referencing the slang term or expressing disappointment, it might just be a typo. If you’re not sure whether someone’s use of “yiy” is a typo or not, ask them what they mean. The “O” and “U” keys are right next to the “Y” and “I” keys, which makes the typo an easy mistake to make."
