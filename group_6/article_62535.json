      "content": "Choose your centerpiece. You might have found a beautiful piece of sea glass while walking the beach, or maybe you have a semi-precious stone that you think is just breathtaking, but either can make a beautiful piece of wire wrap art. Symmetrical shapes can give your wire wrap a more professional look, but sometimes interesting shapes can further accentuate the centerpiece around which you will wrap your wire. For the purposes of this example, a round, polished stone bead will be used. However, the principles of wire wrapping described can be applied to many differently shaped centerpieces. Remember that every stone is a different shape and contours differently to wrapping around."

      "title": "Decide which wire best suits your centerpiece.",
      "content": "Decide which wire best suits your centerpiece. Wire comes in many different varieties, both in terms of the material it's made and its thickness, which is commonly referred to as the \"gauge\" of the wire. Larger and heavier centerpieces will require a thicker gauge of wire. All wire used in this example is either 20 or 22-gauge, which is frequently recommended for beginners. The lower gauge your wire, the thicker it is. For example, 8-gauge wire is very thick, while 26-gauge wire is quite thin. You might consider using copper jewelry wire for your first wire wrap. Copper has a lovely color that compliments many different kinds of centerpiece, and is also relatively cheap. Once you feel comfortable with your wire wrapping skills, you might use fine silver, sterling silver, gold plated, or gold filled jewelry wire."

Most of these supplies should be available at your local hardware or craft store, or even online. For this project, you'll need: 20-gauge square soft wire (4' (1.2 m)) 22-gauge half-round hard wire (1' (30 cm)) 22-gauge square hard wire (4½\" (11.5 cm)) A faceted stone Eye protection Felt-tip pen Flat-nose pliers Neck chain (or other fastener) Penknife (or comparably thin knife) Round-nose pliers Ruler Tape Wire cutter"

      "content": "Prepare your work space. You'll want to clear any obstacles that might get in your way and make working with your wire difficult. Clear a broad area; while you are trying to cut or bend a longer piece of wire, you don't want to accidentally knock something over with the loose end. Consider making use of a workbench, craft table, or laying down a drop cloth where you are working. While shaping and cutting the metal wire, sharp pieces can fly or flake off. A drop cloth will make cleanup much easier."

      "content": "Cut your frame wires an equal length. [1] X Research source Take your 20-gauge square soft wire and clip six pieces eight inches (20 cm) long free. For centerpieces that are bulky or larger, you might need to measure out more wire. The central frame of your wire wrap should be: Long enough to warp around the perimeter of your centerpiece. Thick enough to hold your centerpiece. Heavy/bulky centerpieces might require you to use more than six pieces of wire."

      "content": "Collect your newly cut wires together. Line up the wires and draw them tightly together, making sure each is parallel to the others. Then you should use your tape to bind the ends. This will keep your bundle in shape while you work with the wire. Depending on the contour of your centerpiece, you may find a rounded wire frame works best. In this example, the wire frame has been flattened to better contain the polished bead centerpiece."

After each winding, pull the wire tight while holding it against your bundle with your free hand. The bundle should be wrapped so there are no gaps in its twinnings, and should be equal length on both sides of your middle mark. [3] X Research source Grasping your wire close to its end with your pliers can make shaping it easier. After you finish your bundling, your middle mark should not be visible. This bundle will eventually make up the bottom of your wrap. The width of the finished binding should be approximately ¼\" (6 mm) for a 12-carat stone, like the one used in this example.

Then, use your penknife to pry the topmost wire into the shape of an outward-pointing V. This V-shape should point away from the outer wires of your frame. Repeat this process until you have four Vs, one on each side of the top and bottom of your center binding. Four V shaped twists on all sides of your center binding will create the sturdiest seating for your centerpiece. However, in this example, the polished stone bead is small and light, only requiring two V bends. Each outer wire should have two V's on either side of the middle binding. Each V begins at the edge of the binding, pointing out from the main bundle until the tip is in line with the first ¼\" (6 mm) mark. Then bend the wire to meet the second ¼\" (6 mm) mark. After making your V bend seating, allow the remaining wire run parallel to the main bundle. [7] X Research source"

The spiral design of your wire wrap will give a professional appearance to your jewelry. If you notice your centerpiece is loose in its V and front settings, you may want to take another piece from your bundle and add another spiral wrap to the back for support.
