      "content": "A versatile crop cut has short (or no) sides and a long fringe at the top. Add a few spritzes of sea salt spray to damp hair before blow-drying it on medium heat. Use your fingers to brush your hair and create texture, angling it slightly forward and lifting the top. Then, work a fingerful of matte styling clay through your dry hair to help hold its volume and texture throughout the day. [1] X Research source Sea salt spray adds texture to hair, creating beachy waves and providing a light, flexible hold on hair. It’s a great addition to many textured looks. Keep your fringe between 1 inch (2.5 cm) and 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. A longer fringe tends to work best with thick hair and creates a tousled look, while a shorter fringe works with any hair thickness and looks neater. You could also try a French crop, sometimes called a “Caesar” haircut, which simply means a longer fringe on top. It’s great for covering up receding hairlines since the hair flops forward over the forehead."

      "content": "A short quiff leaves you some hair to style while being easy to manage. Wash your hair as usual before working hair gel or pomade through it. Blow-dry your hair on a low speed and brush your hair forward from the back of your head. Then, brush your hair away from your face from the front of your head. [2] X Research source Pomade can be greasy, waxy, or water-based. Along with hair gel, it helps give your hair a slick, shiny appearance. Quiff cuts feature shorter sides and longer hair on top, angled forward and brushed upwards and backward from the forehead. If you need extra help getting the look to hold all day, spritz on some strong-hold hairspray when you’re done styling."

      "content": "Short sides and a long fringe give you more length to style the quiff. Styling long quiffs is basically the same process as short quiffs—there’s just more hair to work with! Work in your hair gel or pomade before blow-drying, brushing the back of your hair forward and the front of your hair up and back, getting plenty of volume in front. [3] X Research source You could even ask for a fade at the barber if you only want to worry about styling the top of your head."

      "content": "Pompadour cuts feature long hair swept back and up on the head. Work a pea-sized amount of pomade into damp hair short or medium-length hair. Then, brush your hair straight back on the front and sides of your head. Complete the look by placing your free hand on top of your head and pushing that hair forward while you brush the hair on the front of your head straight up! [4] X Research source Once your hair is styled, you can always set it in place with some holding hairspray. To achieve the pompadour look, you’ll need hair on top of your head at least 5 inches (13 cm) long, tapering back to 3 inches (7.6 cm) at the back of your head. You can choose the side length of your hair, though it’s usually quite short for the best effect."

      "content": "The faux hawk gives off a messy, edgy vibe while still being trendy. Work a small amount of matte clay into your damp hair to style it. Blow-dry your hair while twisting small clumps of it with your fingers to add texture. Angle your hair loosely toward the center of your scalp to create a faux hawk shape that looks tousled and stylish, and set it with a few spritzes of sea salt spray. [5] X Research source The difference between the faux hawk and mohawk is that there’s still hair on the sides of your head, trimmed short, while the hair on top of your head is at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. If you want a genuine mohawk, use very firm gel to shape and hold your look."

      "content": "Create a volumized, wavy texture from short, straight hair. Wash your hair and leave it damp to start styling. Work a quarter-sized dollop of styling cream into your hair and comb it using a wide-tooth comb, finding a natural side part for your hair. [6] X Research source Blow-dry your hair while combing it up and to the side, creating a wide, wavy pattern. Finish the look with a few spritzes of sea salt spray. You can also achieve this look if your hair is more curly or unruly; blow-drying while combing at the same time will straighten your hair enough to create a wave effect."

Pour a small amount of hair oil onto your hands and run them through damp, freshly-washed hair from front to back. [7] X Research source Blow-dry your hair the rest of the way, brushing it back as you go. Once dry, spread a finger-scoop of pomade into your hair and use a wide-tooth comb to slick it back into your desired shape. Hair oil has a nourishing, hydrating effect while also making your hair sleek and easier to brush back. Complete the look with a few spritzes of strong-hold hairspray if you need help getting your hair to hold its slicked-back shape long-term. This look works with either grown-out sides (meaning the hair on the side of your head has some length) or an undercut (meaning the sides of your head are shaved or buzzed very short)."

      "content": "Brush your hair to the side for an easy look you can pull on the go. Start with a short haircut, tapered or faded hair on the sides, and a slightly longer fringe that you can style. Blow-dry your hair after washing and add a dime-sized amount of matte styling clay or pomade. Finally, brush it loosely to the side and front with your fingers for a windswept look. [8] X Research source Using your fingers to comb and shape your hair also creates a messy, tousled vibe that’s effortlessly cool. This style is easy to touch up throughout the day; just brush your hair to the side with your fingers if you notice it starting to lie flat."

[9] X Research source Then, just keep running your fingers upward through your hair a few times until spikes form! You can further style your spiky hair if you want. Twist a few spikes with your fingers to give your hair a messy bedhead look, or comb down the sides of your hair for a more polished vibe."

Work a fingerful of hair cream through your hair from root to tip. [10] X Research source Then, scrunch clumps of hair with your hands to bring out the curls! Let your hair air-dry as it is, and enjoy easy, all-day textured curls. Hair cream eliminates frizz, gives your hair some extra shine, and makes it easier to shape and style the way you like it. Pair the curly fringe with a fade on the back and sides of your hair if you’re looking for a modern spin on textured curls. Your curly hair can be as long or short as you want—though it should ideally have a little length to create a tousled bedhead look."

      "content": "This stylish look includes a side-part, tapered cut, and sideburns. Have your barber leave the top of your hair long and layered, blending it into the sides. At home, wash your hair with a volumizing shampoo and then work in a dollop of volumizing mousse while your hair is damp to give it more body. Part your hair, then blow-dry and style it simultaneously by brushing up and to the side. In a low tapered cut, the hair gets gradually shorter, starting just above the ears. This look works best when your hair already has a little natural body. Before getting this cut, the hair should be at least a few inches long on top of your head. You don’t have to part your hair in any particular spot to get this look. Let your hair part naturally and style it from there."

      "content": "If you have longer hair, use hair products to give it a flowing texture. To start, you’ll need to grow your hair to at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. [11] X Research source A barber can thin out bulky areas with a razor to keep your hair looking balanced as you grow it. Styling is simple: just work in a touch of pomade and comb it back slightly before going about your day. While 3 inches (7.6 cm) is typically the minimum for length, a flow style can be longer than that. It's up to you! Hair type is also not a problem when getting a flowing look; it works with straight, wavy, and curly hair. Spritz some sea salt spray into straight hair if you want to make it look wavier."
