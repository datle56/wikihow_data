      "content": "5d indicates there are excessive suds in the washer. Depending on your model, this error code may be 5d, Sd, or Sud, but they all mean the same thing—your machine is full of too many suds. Your machine senses the soap is too frothy and shuts down automatically to prevent flooding and keep bubbles from overflowing. [1] X Research source Depending on your model, the error code may be flashing or perpetually on."

      "title": "Don’t do anything—the machine will solve this one on its own.",
      "content": "Don’t do anything—the machine will solve this one on its own. Whirlpool machines will stop the cycle when they sense too many suds. Depending on the water and suds levels, the machine will either add water to dilute the soap or wait for the suds to dissipate. Once the sensors detect the cycle is ready to continue, it will finish the cycle. [2] X Research source This may take a few hours, and the machine may drain, refill, or pause multiple times. Just be patient! If this error code comes back, run a “Clean Washer” cycle with an empty drum (or add an Affresh cleaning tablet). This will wash away any soapy buildup that may be making the problem worse. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "You’re using the wrong detergent.",
      "content": "You’re using the wrong detergent. All modern Whirlpool washing machines (and most older Cabrios) are high-efficiency. This means that they require high-efficiency detergent. If you use a detergent that doesn’t explicitly say “high efficiency” or “HE” on the label, it will create too many suds for your Whirlpool. [4] X Research source The Fix: Once your current wash cycle ends, stop using your current detergent. Instead, stick exclusively with HE detergent ."

      "title": "You used too much detergent.",
      "content": "You used too much detergent. Adding too much soap to the machine will make the water way too bubbly and soapy. This is almost certainly the source of your issue if you went past the “fill line” on the detergent canister. [5] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source The Fix: In the future, use less detergent. In fact, most people use way too much. You only need about a shot glass’s worth—even for a full load. More soap does not make your clothes any cleaner. It’s actually the opposite. The more excess soap, the harder it is for water to flow through the fabric of your clothes."

      "title": "The drain hose is blocked.",
      "content": "The drain hose is blocked. If you get a 5d error alongside an E1 F9 error , your drain hose is blocked. Being unable to drain, the water level will continue to rise, and your machine may think the suds on top of the water are to blame for the problem. The Fix: Remove the hose from the machine and rinse it out. If the water won’t drain at all, snake the drain with a drain auger to clear the blockage out. Then, reinsert the hose and press the “start” button."

      "title": "The drain pump filter needs to be cleaned.",
      "content": "The drain pump filter needs to be cleaned. If the machine won’t drain, you’re getting and E1 F9 error in addition to the 5d error, and your hose is clear, the drain pump filter is probably clogged. This can cause the water and sud levels to rise and trigger the error. [6] X Research source The Fix: Locate the small panel on the bottom of the front of the machine. Open the panel and pull it out. Turn the circular handle to unlock it and remove the filter. Rinse the filter out under warm water and replace it."

      "title": "The machine is overloaded with clothing.",
      "content": "The machine is overloaded with clothing. If you put too much laundry in the drum, the water and soap will not have a ton of room to flow between items. This can make it difficult for suds to dissipate in the water, and the excess bubbles can trigger the 5d error. [7] X Research source The Fix: In the future, just don’t overfill the drum. If your current load keeps stalling, open the machine and pull some of the laundry out to split the current load into two. You should always be able to reach inside your laundry machine easily with your hand and move the clothing freely around. If the clothing is too dense, your drum is overfilled."

    {
      "title": "You have excessively hard water.",
      "content": "You have excessively hard water. If your tap water has excessive minerals, you have hard water . Hard water is normally not a huge deal, but too much calcium and magnesium in your water can mess with your laundry. As minerals build up in your fabrics, the machine may eventually struggle to deal with the suds when you’re washing bigger loads. [8] X Research source The Fix: If you don’t want to install a water softener , either use warm water in your loads or wash multiple smaller loads instead of single, bigger loads."

    {
      "title": "You used “no splash” bleach.",
      "content": "You used “no splash” bleach. If you added bleach to the bleach compartment to brighten whites and remove stains, check the label on your bleach. If it says “no splash,” “no spill,” “easy pour,” or some variation of the phrase, it’s probably to blame for the 5d error. These thicker types of bleach froth up the same way soap does, which triggers the suds issue. [9] X Research source The Fix: In the future, only use standard, liquid bleach if you’re going to add any bleach at all."
