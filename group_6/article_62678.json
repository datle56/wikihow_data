      "content": "Adopt unit plans to create connections for your students. At its most basic level, unit planning ensures you are linking each lesson plan to the next. As you develop a unit plan you'll support key concepts and learning goals with a carefully mapped structure. Use unit planning to weave key concepts and learning goals together over time and between or among disciplines. Consider overlapping lessons with fellow instructors to provide longer spans of time for study and practice."

Unit plans are also an excellent way to forge interdisciplinary connections. Developing a multi-lesson unit structure provides you with a framework for presenting overarching themes in a variety of ways. Students with diverse learning styles will benefit, and you will be able to explore different ways of teaching without veering off course or running short on time.

[4] X Research source For example, if you're planning a history unit on the Great Depression, you may want students to understand 1) the root causes of the Great Depression; 2) the efforts taken by Herbert Hoover to address the Depression; 3) the accomplishments of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal; 4) challenges to the emerging New Deal order; and 5) the influence of World War II in ending the Depression.

      "content": "List in sequential order the major concepts in outline form to be clear on what concepts you are planning to teach within a given time frame. This exercise will help you understand how much material you can realistically fit into a unit and how you should allocate your time. Remember to leave room for adjustment. You may find that in practice, a given concept takes more or less time to convey than anticipated. [9] X Research source If, for example, you have four weeks to address the five Great Depression unit goals outlined above, you may opt to begin with three lessons on the Depression's root causes and end with two focused upon the influence of World War II in ending the Depression. In between, you might allocate roughly a week to each of the other three goals, but leave a \"float\" day or two built into the schedule. Plan supplemental assignments for \"float\" days that, while enriching, are not required material for meeting state standards. You'll be well-prepared if you do need the lessons, but you'll retain the capacity to sacrifice this material in favor of spending an extra day on a key learning goal."

      "content": "Plan and create your assessment tools. After reviewing what resources you can pull from, creating a diversity of assessment tools to evaluate learning is next. Both formative and summative measures should be in place to ensure a broad evaluation of the objectives is met by all students. Formative assessments monitor student learning to provide ongoing feedback. These tools help you understand how well students are grasping course material so you can make adjustments as you go. Formative assessments typically have little or no point value -- they are meant as a check for the instructor and not as an assessment of student performance. [10] X Research source A formative assessment tool for our Great Depression example might be a request that students submit two key points gleaned from a lecture on the First Hundred Days of the New Deal. Summative assessments evaluate student learning and are typically given at the end of an instructional unit. These tools typically have high point value as they do gauge student performance. [11] X Research source A summative assessment tool for our Great Depression example might be a research paper on a topic of the student's choosing."

Variety will ensure that diverse needs are met. Our unit on the Great Depression, for example, might mix periodic lectures with examination of primary source documents, conversations about images of the Dust Bowl, audio recordings of some of Franklin Roosevelt's \"Fireside Chats,\" and viewing of the film The Grapes of Wrath."

This will help keep you on track for time and ensure that learning objectives are being met. [12] X Research source Formative assessments can provide useful benchmarks. Plan points at which you will commit to move onto new material even if student understanding remains incomplete. Spending too much time on one segment of your unit sacrifices the others."

      "title": "Start your unit planning by considering your goals for the year.",
      "content": "Start your unit planning by considering your goals for the year. Starting with your broadest \"road map\" will provide important insight into how you should allocate your time. [13] X Research source What state standards are you required to fulfill in this course? What are your district's course curriculum requirements? What are your students' specific needs and learning styles? Consider broad factors such as demographics and past assessment data, but also trust your instincts as you consider the dynamics of your student population. A broad \"road map\" allows you to circumvent common pitfalls such as running short on instructional time. When planning a post-Civil War U.S. history course, for example, if you begin with the understanding that you'll end the course in 2001 you can plot out a series of units that will enable you to reach that goal."

      "content": "Develop a series of essential questions that will guide your students toward understanding of course content. These questions will form the superstructure of your course content. Identify key content, skills, and vocabulary. What will your students need to know when they exit your course? Develop ways of assessing your students to determine whether they are learning this information. Remember to diversify your assessment tools; some students will respond better to certain forms of assessment than others. Design a structure that will place these essential questions in a proper learning sequence. Now you have your units, and can focus upon specific lesson plans. Determine what materials you'll need to properly teach these concepts and skills."

Generally speaking, however, too much preparation is better than not enough -- plan with the understanding that you may need to trim extra detail. A wise approach will focus on key concepts and then supplement with supporting material that can be sacrificed if necessary."

      "content": "Work with fellow teachers to meet key standards and goals across disciplines. One of the greatest benefits of unit planning is the latitude it offers for developing interdisciplinary strategies to meet student needs. By planning ahead, you'll set a structure in place that gives students the opportunity to view broad concepts from many different angles. A history teacher undertaking a unit on the Great Depression, for example, may opt to combine forces with an instructor in a related field such as economics or political science. He or she could also travel further afield and coordinate lessons with a science instructor. The history of the Dust Bowl will gain new life from the scientific insight a biology or earth sciences instructor brings, while the science teacher's students will better understand soil science, erosion, and air currents due to the context provided by their study of Dust Bowl history."

      "title": "Think creatively about how your disciplines overlap.",
      "content": "Think creatively about how your disciplines overlap. Scientific research, for example, includes research, reading, and writing -- all hallmarks of English and language arts instruction. If you are a language arts teacher, consider coordinating with your school's biology teacher to coordinate lessons on research and analytical writing with a unit that will require students to write a research report on invertebrates. History or social studies teachers may coordinate with language arts instructors so students are studying the history of the Civil War at the same time they read The Red Badge of Courage. Following our Dust Bowl example, a science instructor's lesson on meteorology and air currents could lead to a predictive study of where students expect dust might have blown during the 1930s. The students might then share this information with their history teacher and determine the accuracy of their predictions. When embarking upon an interdisciplinary unit, ensure you coordinate assessment tools as well as lesson plans. Our imaginary science teacher and history instructor would need to be in communication with each other to determine how well their instruction was translating into important learning outcomes."

      "title": "Expand your students' exposure to key concepts and learning goals.",
      "content": "Expand your students' exposure to key concepts and learning goals. Interdisciplinary coordination can provide your students with longer spans of class time for study and practice. Working together may allow you to spend multiple periods one day focused upon a larger-scale science project, while another day you'll use extra time on a language arts component of the interdisciplinary plan. Approaching the same subject from different angles helps students view concepts in a broader context. Instead of seeing that invertebrate report in isolation, they will understand it as a way to put broader research and writing skills into practice. Students who feel more confident in one subject than another gain the advantage of recognizing the links between their area of confidence and the skills they've previously found challenging.
