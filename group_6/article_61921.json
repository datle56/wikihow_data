      "content": "Check the care label to see if your corduroy is machine-safe. Look for the care tag near a jacket collar, along an inseam, or on the waistband of a pair of pants. Read the label for any specific cleaning instructions, like what water temperature and cycle setting to use. Before washing your garment, be sure to read over any fabric care instructions, and follow them accordingly.

      "content": "Separate your corduroy from lint-producing fabrics. Lint can easily get caught between the nap on corduroy garments and can be difficult to remove once it’s there. Keep your corduroy garments separate from fabrics that are notorious for creating lint, like towels, fleece, felt, flannel, chenille, and wool, to wash them alone. [3] X Research source If there’s already lint on your corduroy, then try shaking the garment or running a lint roller over the surface to remove the largest pieces."

      "content": "Pre-treat stains with baking soda paste or diluted detergent. If you notice a stain anywhere on your corduroy, try to treat it right away before putting it in the wash. Create a paste that’s equal parts baking soda and cold water and apply it to the stain. Let the paste dry before brushing it off. Alternatively, combine equal parts of laundry detergent and water and gently scrub it into the fabric with an old toothbrush before washing it. [4] X Research source You may try using commercial stain pre-treatment to help loosen the stain from the fabric. Just follow the directions on the bottle, and wash the garment right after. Always spot-test stain treatments on an inconspicuous spot, like a pants cuff or jacket inseam, to make sure it doesn’t ruin the color or fabric."

      "content": "Secure any fasteners and turn your garment inside-out. Fasten any buttons and completely zip up any zippers so your corduroy garment is less likely to snag or catch on anything inside the machine. Then, flip your garment inside-out to help protect the corduroy’s nap from getting crushed or collecting lint. [5] X Research source Turning your garment inside out also will prevent the color of the fabric from fading in the wash. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the corduroy in your washing machine with like colors.",
      "content": "Put the corduroy in your washing machine with like colors. Toss corduroy into the wash with garments that are a similar color, but keep lighter clothes separate from darker ones. The dye in corduroy may run and transfer onto other fabrics, so it’s best to play it safe so you don’t ruin any of your clothes. [7] X Research source Avoid packing your washing machine tight with clothes, or else they may not move around freely and won’t get as clean. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Run a delicate cycle with cold water and a shortened spin cycle. Add in the standard amount of laundry detergent you’d use for your load. Choose the gentlest cycle on your washing machine so you’re less likely to damage the fabric. If you’re able to adjust the length of the spin cycle, opt for the shortest one to stop creases from forming in the fabric. Then, run your machine with cold or cool water to wash your corduroy. [9] X Research source Cold water adds extra protection from the dyes bleeding and getting on other garments. For darker-colored corduroy, put 1 tablespoon (17 g) of table salt in the load to prevent colors from running."

      "content": "You can dry corduroy on a low heat setting, but it’s better to hang it. Even though air-drying on a clothesline or hanger will keep your garment the safest, you may still be able to dry it. Double-check the label on your corduroy garment to make sure it’s safe for your dryer. Choose the lowest heat setting and run a short, delicate cycle to prevent any damage or ribbing to the fabric. Then, remove your corduroy while it’s still slightly damp and hang it up to prevent any shrinkage or damage. [10] X Research source Avoid using an iron if your corduroy looks wrinkled after drying it. Instead, use a garment steamer to get rid of any creasing."
