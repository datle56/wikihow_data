      "content": "To tow using the paddlers, use manual mode. Then keep the car in the lowest gear possible by pulling the \"-\" paddle until it wont shift down any more. Only use this to get moving or going up a hill with a heavy load being towed. Use the \"-\" paddle to slow down too, that will take stress off the breaks when slowing down or descending a hill. When on flat ground, to achieve max fuel economy, shift into the highest gear using the \"+\" shift paddle. When you need to have power to climb a hill or overtake, use the \"-\" paddle to move down a couple gears to achieve more power and torque to move faster or have more power to pull the load. The higher the RPM, the more power to pull, but the worst fuel economy. The lower the rpm, the better the fuel economy but less torque to tow with."

Putting the car into a lower gear will give you some extra zip when passing another vehicle on the highway, or joining traffic when there is a short ramp, without having to floor the accelerator. When at steady speed in full auto mode, the Subaru's CVT system keeps RPMs low for fuel efficiency; pushing down the accelerator very rapidly increases torque, but the RPMs still need to build up. Downshifting raises the RPMs so when you accelerate, you don't have to wait for the RPMs to catch up. [1] X Research source Always check your blind spot by turning your head before changing lanes."

      "content": "Understand how the Subaru CVT transmission works. An automatic transmission changes gear ratios as the car moves (so you don't have to change them manually). While most automatic transmissions have a defined set of gear ranges, a CVT automatic transmission changes seamlessly through an infinite number of gear ratios. The Outback can simulate a manual transmission with six programmed speeds that hold the CVT pulleys in fixed positions. You can use manual mode by moving the lever to \"M\" and using the paddle shifters, or (temporarily) by using the paddle shifters while you're driving in automatic mode (select lever at the \"D\" position). When shifting to \"M\" you do not need to press the brakes or press the button on the lever."

      "content": "Keep in mind that the long-term effects of downshifting on a CVT transmission are unknown. Since brakes are much less costly to replace than a transmission, it would be wise to only use manual shifting in situations in which safety is enhanced, such as descending on a long, steep hill or starting off in 2nd gear under slippery conditions. Avoid downshifting in place of braking when approaching traffic lights or other frequent, daily stops. While many people may do this, Subaru technical representatives note that downshifting \"is only recommended in situations where the engine braking would be needed, such as when descending a grade. Normally, a driver would have no need to engine brake when just coming to a stop at a light or stop sign. Since the transmission is not designed to handle this, it would accelerate wear on the CVT.\" [3] X Research source"

If you use the paddle shifters while driving with the lever in the \"D\" position, the car will return to auto mode when it senses a significant change in throttle position. You can trigger this by accelerating. Alternatively, you can shift the lever into manual mode (\"M\") and right back to auto mode (\"D\")."
