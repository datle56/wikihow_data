A private foundation is a nongovernmental, nonprofit corporation organized \"exclusively for charitable, educational, religious, scientific and literary purposes\" under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRS Code. [1] X Trustworthy Source Internal Revenue Service U.S. government agency in charge of managing the Federal Tax Code Go to source It is organized by a family, individual or corporation to make donations (grants) to other nonprofit organizations. Here are some key characteristics of a private foundation. Funding - Unlike many nonprofits whose work is supported by donations from the public, a private foundation is funded by an investment of cash, securities and other assets from the founder. Activities - Nonprofits provide various types of services for charitable or educational purposes. A private foundation's principal activity is making grants to nonprofits to support their activities. Tax Status - Like other nonprofits, private foundations are exempt from income tax. They are, however, subject to a one or two percent excise tax on income generated by investments.

      "content": "Clarify why you want to set up a foundation. There are many reasons people choose to set up a private foundation. Before you make this step, you should think seriously about your reasons, and what you want to accomplish. They might include: Tax advantages - They can be significant. As an individual, you can donate up to 30% of your annual income to a private foundation and receive a tax deduction. Controlling your philanthropic activities - Unlike other planned giving vehicles, a private foundation allows you - the founder - to tightly control what types of charities receive support, as well as the management of the assets funding that support. Supporting a pet cause - If you have a cause that is dear to your heart, you might want to set up your foundation to fund charities that are working in that area. Creating a legacy - You might choose to name your foundation after yourself, to carry on and associate your family name with good works. You could also consider naming the foundation after someone you want to honor. Involving your family - A private foundation can be a way to get your family members involved in philanthropic activities. You can name them to the board, or hire them as staff."

      "content": "Identify your areas of interest. An important aspect of starting a foundation is deciding what types of charitable work you want to support. Sometimes founders know right away what they want to support, but others need to give it some thought. While some foundations are very general about their funding, most foundations have specific topics, causes or geographic regions they prefer to focus on. You can get as specific as you like, depending on your interests. Before you decide on your causes, it's a good idea to do research to learn about the needs in that area and the organizations that are involved in that work."

[3] X Research source You can hire an attorney to do this for you, or you can do it yourself. Specific requirements will vary from state to state. Check with your Secretary of State's business office to learn the exact procedure you should follow for the state in which you live. In general, you will need to do the following: Verify that your proposed foundation name is not registered to another corporation. This can often be done with an online search. Draw up Articles of Incorporation, which is the legal document that governs the management of your corporation. If you are handling the process yourself, look for templates online for incorporating a nonprofit entity in your state. [4] X Research source Identify your board members.

The policy will handle instances where the personal interest of a board member or office are at odds with the best interest of the organization. A common example of a conflict of interest is when a board member's firm is hired to perform services for the organization. These types of transactions are not illegal, and can be perfectly acceptable if the decision was vetted in an objective way and truly benefits the organization. You can find templates of conflict of interest policies online. [7] X Research source A policy typically: Prohibits or limits transactions where conflict is an issue Requires board members to disclose potential conflicts Requires board members to recuse themselves from making decisions in which they have a personal interest Establishes guidelines for requiring competitive bid processes for transactions over a certain dollar amount, to ensure that organizations are getting fair value."

      "content": "Establish funding guidelines. Your funding guidelines will spell out the interest areas you identified earlier, the process by which you distribute funds, and how or whether organizations can request grants from you. Here are some things to include: Selection of grantees - You can decide to give grants only to organizations that you identify yourself, or to accept grant proposals from charities who want funding. If you choose the latter, you can decide whether you want to allow only proposals that you solicit, or whether any eligible organization can apply. Application process - If you opt to receive applications for funding, you'll need to decide what your process will be. What information do you want to know about the proposed project or organization? It can be as simple as a form or a letter mailed to your foundation, or a very detailed proposal, according to your preference. Whatever you decide, your guidelines should carefully and specifically spell out what you want from applicants. Grant ranges - You will need to determine how large your grants will be. This will be determined in large part by the size of your endowment and how your investments are performing. Calendar - If you intend to accept proposals, you will need to decide how often you want to review them. You can set any schedule you like, from a rolling basis to once a year."
