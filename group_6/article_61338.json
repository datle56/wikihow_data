      "content": "Start spending less time with her. That's right. If you want to change your relationship with a girl from \"friend\" to \"lover,\" you need to distance yourself from her immediately. If you're spending all your time hanging out with this girl, it's possible that she doesn't think of you \"that way\" any more. Some people call this the \"friend zone.\" If you want to get her attention, stop hanging out with her as much. You don't have to be mean to her, or try to ignore her, but just stop giving her the same kind of attention you once did. Be friendly, but don't go out of your way to talk to her, chat with her on IM, or run into her in the hallways. Just be casual."

If you want to turn her on, she needs to see that you're a viable partner and a flirty kind of person. She needs to see you act differently than you usually act with her. Make sure she sees! Try doing it in public places, like in the lunch room. Make a point of sitting close to her, but ignore her while you chat up her friends, or people she hangs out with. Make it seem like your eye is roaming around. Do some Facebook flirting, which is its kind of public. Start having funny exchanges with some girl that's in your class. Make sure they're both friends, so it shows up on her feed as well. Worried about your flirting skills? There's no big secret. Just have light, fun, funny conversations.

      "content": "Reassure her if necessary. If you start changing, she may start to think something is wrong and you might have to do a little work to make sure she doesn't get angry with you. Remember, this is your friend. You're not trying to hurt her. Make sure you're friendly with her when you are together, but make sure you pay more attention to other girls in your social circle. If she asks something like, \"What's wrong? Are you mad at me?\" just be casual. Say, \"Of course not! We're buds.\" But keep doing the same things, and don't go out of your way to hang out with her a lot."

      "content": "Wait a while. If you're trying to get this girl turned onto you, slow things down a little. Once you've stopped hanging out and started flirting around with others, let that go on for at least a week or two, depending on how close you two were, to begin with. Make sure to spend enough time that she gets the hint. If you were hanging out with this girl every day, she'll get the hint a lot more quickly. If you only hung out now and then, it might take a while before she sees that you've changed. Go with the flow and try to read her response. Don't wait too long. If she gets the impression that you're not even friends anymore, she might move on from you completely and start dating another guy, or lose interest in you."

After a period of not hanging out, you'll have made her feel like she'll have to do some work to get your attention back since you've been cool to her lately. Sent a text or shoot her a message asking if she wants to hang out. Ideally, she'll be the one to ask if you want to hang out. If she does, you'll be in a lot better shape. Don't cave at first, if she's been asking you to hang out for a couple weeks while you've been laying the groundwork. Now you know she's interested."

Ask if she wants to get a coffee together, or to go do something that might be considered date-like. This will give you the chance to make her think of you differently. You just want to avoid doing something casual, like what you used to do. If you always used to hang out at one or the other's house and watch TV together, go out for a bite instead. You want things to be different now."

Make sure you're smelling good so she'll be able to look on your with different eyes. You want her to think of you as a potential date, not her regular old guy friend. There's no specific way to dress to turn a girl on. Just wear what feels comfortable and what you think makes you look good. Maybe consider dressing up slightly. No ratty B-ball shorts and joke-message t-shirt. Wear a button-down that makes you look good."

If you usually joke around and make crude jokes, have a more serious conversation. Ask her serious questions and open up to her as well. Try complaining about your relationships with other girls. If you want to get her thinking about you differently, try bringing up the subject of dating and see how she reacts. Say, \"I've been so unhappy with the girls I've been seeing lately. I just wish I could find someone who got me as you do...\" [2] X Research source"

She should be excited to be around you, just as you are excited to be around her. If you get similar vibes from her, then keep moving forward and try to turn her on some more. If you don't, call it quits. It didn't work. Move on. If she scrunches her face up and looks confused, or continues to punch your arm like the good ol' buddy you are, this might not work. She's giving you signs that you're friends and nothing more. That's ok. But don't keep going and embarrass yourself. If she's looking good and flirting back, it might be ok to move a little farther and see if she likes you enough for a kiss. Move slowly, but keep going."

The kinds of looks she saw you giving other girls while you were ignoring her. Just smile at her and make eye contact now and then, look away like you're embarrassed. If she asks what you're thinking, say, \"Nothing.\" Don't be creepy and stare, just let yourself act the way you want to act with her. If you're feeling attracted to her, then look at her as if you enjoy it."

It can also be a quick and easy way to gauge how she reacts and see what she's thinking. If you brush her hand when you're talking, to emphasize something funny that she says, see how she reacts. If she smiles big and seems happy, good move. If she backs up, stop. If you've gotten their ok, try touching her hair, or her shoulder. Just a quick caress. Don't make a big deal out of it and be creepy. Just keep it casual. Again, this can come off a little creepy if she's unprepared or if she doesn't feel the same way. You have to lay some groundwork for this."

There's some electric chemistry between you that you're feeling, and you think she feels it too. You don't need to treat this any differently than if you were with some girl that wasn't your friend. Just tell her you've been thinking about there a lot lately, and you've been thinking of her as more than a friend. You might have to be direct if she doesn't pick up your signals! [3] X Expert Source Suzanna Mathews Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 18 August 2021.

It may just be because she doesn't like you in that way. It's ok. That may change in the future and it may not. But if you force the issue now, you may risk losing a good friend and embarrassing yourself. So know when to back off, if it doesn't go your way. If she's not attracted to you, she's not attracted to you. Sometimes it's just as simple as that."
