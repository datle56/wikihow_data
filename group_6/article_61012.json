      "content": "\"The man, the myth, the legend\" is a phrase used to introduce awe-inspiring people.

If they were about to perform or give a speech, the person introducing them may rile up the crowd by saying: “And now, the man, the myth, the legend!” \"The man\" refers to the actual person being referenced, \"the myth\" hints at exaggerated tales about the person's achievements, and \"the legend\" points to their fame or status. The phrase can refer to celebrities, cultural icons, or any legendary person. For example, you might hear references like: “For our next performance, you know him, you love him, the man, the myth, the legend, Harry Houdini!” “Ladies and gentlemen, our next speaker, the man, the myth, the legend, Keanu Reeves!”"
