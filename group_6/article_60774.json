      "content": "Practice counting to 60. Kids need to be able to count to 60 (in the correct order) in order to tell time. Have your child write down the numbers 1 through 60 on a piece of paper. As they write each number, have them recite the number as well. Post this piece of paper on a wall and have them recite the numbers regularly. While you are out in public, like at the grocery store, point out double-digit numbers and have your child repeat the number to you. Use counting songs to help your child practice counting. For instance, you could sing, “100 Bottles of Milk” together. Look for other counting songs online. To encourage your child to learn, make sure to reward them with playtime or their favorite snack for doing a good job."

[1] X Expert Source Courtney Copriviza Elementary School Teacher Expert Interview. 18 June 2021. Have your child write down increments of five on a sheet of paper up to 60. As they write the numbers, have them recite them as well. Make sure to point out that each number either ends in a 5 or a 0. [2] X Research source Make a special “Count by 5s” song to a catchy tune your kid can sing along to. You can even add dance moves to the song; for example, at every quarter, you put your hands in the air or stomp your feet. Sing this song regularly with your kid to help them become comfortable with counting by 5s. You can also find song about counting by fives online, such as on YouTube."

Familiarize your kid with these concepts by associating each concept with certain activities. Then quiz your kid by asking them when certain things happen. [3] X Research source For example, “In the morning we eat breakfast and brush our teeth. At noon, we eat lunch and take a nap. At night, we read a book and go to sleep.” You can ask your kid, “What happens in the morning?” and “What happens at night?” You can post a daily schedule chart so your child has a visual that shows the different things they do during the day. Refer to the chart when explaining the times of various daily events."

It’s 3 o’clock...” Then have your kid repeat what you just did. [17] X Research source Make sure to use the pie slices and colors to your advantage. Reinforce the idea that whenever the hour hand is in a given pie slice, it is ___ o’clock. You can even associate activities with each number to help solidify the hours; for example, “It is 3 o’clock now, which means it is time to watch your favorite cartoons,” or, “It is 5 o’clock now, which means it is time for soccer practice.”"

Move the hands and show me 3 o’clock on your clock,” or, “It is 8 o’clock, which means it is time for bed.

[19] X Research source For example, tell your kid that the secret identity of number 1 is 5. Then have them write down a small number 5 next to the number 1. Repeat this for each number.

Point the hour hand at a number, then point the minute hand at a number. Then say what time it is. [21] X Research source For example, point the hour hand at 3 and the minute hand at 8. Tell your kid that the time is 3:40 because the hour hand is pointing at 3 and the minute hand is pointing at 8. Reinforce the idea that because the minute hand is the secret identity hand, it reads as 40 and not 8. Repeat this activity until your kid gets the hang of it."
