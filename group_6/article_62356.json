Type in the command into the chatbox. If you want to whisper to a specific player, just type in their username. Otherwise, use the following commands: [3] X Research source Use “ @a ” to whisper your message to all players on your Minecraft server. Use “ @e ” to whisper to all entities in the game. Type “ @p ” to whisper your message to the closest player to you. Write “ @r ” to whisper your message to a random player. Add “ @s ” to send the whisper to yourself."

      "content": "Whisper when you only want specific people seeing your chat. If you don’t want to disturb other players on the server and the message only relates to a few players, then whispering is a perfect way to privately send your message. Example: You might whisper to a nearby player for help or let them know that you discovered valuable loot. Example: If your friend is on the other side of the Minecraft map, you may whisper “how are you doing out there?” so you don’t bother other online players."

      "title": "Tell secrets over whispers to hide things from other players.",
      "content": "Tell secrets over whispers to hide things from other players. If you’re trying to share information with one player but don’t want everyone on the server to see, send it over a whisper instead. The person you’re whispering to will see you shared the info to them, and the other players won’t get notified. Example: If you discover a chest but don’t want a player to know about it, you may whisper to a different player to let them know about the location. Example: If you’re moderating a server and want to help players solve a puzzle, you could send a whisper with “@a” to give them all a hint."

      "content": "Whisper something scary to prank another player. If you know another player is out exploring the map on their own, whisper an eerie message to them. Even though they’ll see you sent the message, they may feel a little more on edge when they’re alone. Example: Whisper “it’s right behind you…” to a player alone in a mine to give them a good jump scare. Example: If the player is out in the woods at night, whisper the word “run” to them to make them think they’re being chased or attacked."
