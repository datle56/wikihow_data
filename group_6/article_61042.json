      "content": "Choose a needle that can accommodate your thread’s thickness. Once you've picked out the thread for your sewing project, look at several needles and hold the thread up to a needle's eye. The eye shouldn't be narrower than the thread or you'll have a hard time threading the needle. Look at the point of the needle too. You may want a needle with a sharp point so it can pierce fabric easily, for instance, or pick a needle with a blunt tip if you're sewing knit fabric. Consider buying a pack of needles in many different sizes, so you can try a few until you find one that's the right size."

      "content": "Unspool at least 1 foot (30 cm) of thread and trim the end for a clean cut. Unravel as much thread as you want to use for your project and cut it from the spool. Then, use your scissors to cut the very tip off of the end of the thread that you'll be threading onto the needle. This will make a clean cut so fibers don't stick out from the end of the thread. [1] X Research source Try licking the end of the thread to help the fibers stay together."

Hold the needle between your thumb and forefinger while you hold the end of the thread with your other thumb and forefinger. Then, push the end of the thread through the eye. [2] X Research source Play around with threading the needle. For example, you might find that it's easier for you to tightly hold the end of the thread while you push the eye of the needle onto the thread."

      "content": "Try using a needle threader if you're using a very small needle. If you're struggling to push the thread through the eye of the needle, especially if it's small, buy a needle threader from a craft store. Hold the wide end of the threader and insert the bent, wire end through the needle's eye. Then, push the thread through the larger eye of the threader before you pull the threader back through the needle's eye. [3] X Research source Needle threaders work really well if you're using a thread that keeps splitting as you try to thread the needle."

This will create a tail that prevents the thread from slipping back out through the needle.

Keep in mind that you'll be folding this in half, which is why you should start by pulling out about twice as much thread as you'll need. [5] X Research source For example, if you're darning a sock, you might pull out 3 feet (91 cm) of thread in order to work with a 1 1 ⁄ 2 feet (46 cm) double-strand of thread."

Insert the needle through the middle of the thread loop and keep pulling the needle so the loop travels to the base of the needle. Tug on the needle a little so the loop tightens into a small knot at the base of the needle near the eye. Then, you can tie a knot at the end of the thread. [8] X Research source Creating a small knot near the needle will prevent it from sliding around on the double-stranded thread while you're sewing."
