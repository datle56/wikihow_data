      "content": "Test if your cat is affected by catnip or not. Between 10 and 30 percent of cats are not responsive to catnip. Spray an item with catnip spray and let your cat sniff it. If your cat doesn't react or do anything unusual, it may not be affected by catnip. If that's the case, catnip spray may not be right for your cat. [2] X Research source When cats smell the oils from a catnip plant, they'll often roll around and rub against whatever surface has the catnip on it. The effects usually last for around 15 minutes. Afterward, they may feel more mellow and content. Keep in mind that every cat is different! Kittens may not respond to catnip, but that could change as they get older. Senior cats also tend to be less responsive to catnip. Always purchase catnip spray from a trusted online source or brick-and-mortar pet store."

Spraying something you want your cat to start using will get it interested in the item. [3] X Research source For example, if you want to play with your cat with a new toy but they don’t seem interested in it, you can spray it with catnip to get your cats attention. They will associate the item with fun and good feelings after that, so they’ll know it’s playtime when they see the toy!"

      "content": "Give your cat catnip once every 2 weeks or so. Catnip will produce the best results if you don’t give it to your cat too often. Use catnip spray every 2 weeks so your cat doesn’t become too accustomed to it. However, all cats are different, so find the frequency that works best for you and your cat. [4] X Research source The more cats are exposed to catnip, the less interested they tend to be. Limiting their exposure to once every 2 weeks will ensure they are responsive when you want to use the catnip spray again."

      "content": "Stop using catnip spray if your cat becomes cranky or aggressive. Catnip affects all cats differently, and some cats display heightened aggressive behavior. If your cat becomes aggressive, take away any objects you sprayed and try again at another time. If your cat always responds negatively to catnip, you may want to stop using it altogether. [5] X Research source It’s also best to avoid giving catnip spray to cats that already tend to be aggressive."

      "content": "Remove an item you sprayed with catnip after 15 minutes. Take away an item covered in catnip if your cat shows no signs of losing interest on their own after about 15 minutes because prolonged exposure can cause nausea in some cats. [6] X Research source Most cats lose interest in catnip after the initial effects wear off, within around 10-15 minutes."

      "content": "Spray catnip on a scratching post to encourage your cat to use it. Spritz each side of the scratching post with 1-2 sprays of catnip from the spray bottle. This will help your cat associate the post with something positive and start to use it instead of scratching your couch or other furniture. If your cat already has a favorite scratching surface, such as a sofa or bed, it can help to place the scratching post near the favorite surface so your cat is more likely to use the post as an alternative."

Spritz catnip around a specific room that you want your cat to feel comfortable in, or throughout the entire home, so it will start to feel relaxed and less scared. [8] X Research source When you first bring a new cat home or move to a new place with your cat, it will likely choose a hiding spot to stay in for the first day or first few days.
