      "content": "It's natural to want to defend yourself after receiving criticism. You might feel unfairly put on the spot and embarrassed, or you might disagree with the person's feedback. [2] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 30 September 2021. If you're especially sensitive, you might even interpret a neutral statement as criticism. [3] X Research source For example, if you get some negative feedback from your supervisor, your first reaction might be to dismiss them or tell them why they're wrong. To avoid getting defensive in situations like that, listen to what the person is saying before coming up with a response. After they're done speaking, take a moment to pause and reflect. [4] X Research source If you're not sure what to say in response, you might try, \"I hear you\" or \"Thank you for that feedback.\" Even if you're not sure how you feel, responding like this in the moment defuses the situation and helps you avoid seeming defensive."

      "content": "You might be more defensive if you're not feeling super confident. If you're already feeling vulnerable and down on yourself, you might be extra sensitive to perceived threats and criticism (even when they're not really there). [5] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 30 September 2021. You might be using defensiveness as a way to protect yourself from being hurt or judged. [6] X Research source Perhaps you were bullied a lot growing up. As an adult, you might use defensiveness as a coping mechanism to feel more powerful. To counteract this, try building up your view of yourself so that you don't take others' comments so personally. [7] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 February 2022. You might try repeating words of affirmation anytime you're feeling low, like, \"I am strong and confident\" and \"I love myself.\""

      "title": "You might get defensive if you're feeling socially anxious.",
      "content": "You might get defensive if you're feeling socially anxious. Alternatively, you might get defensive if you struggle with being assertive in a social situation. That might look like dismissing other people's comments, interpreting other people's words in a negative way, or always being on the lookout for threats to your relationships. [8] X Research source Overcoming social anxiety is totally possible. In moments that make you especially nervous, try taking deep breaths and replacing any negative thoughts you might have with positive thoughts. For example, if you're at a party and people are laughing about something, avoid automatically assuming that people are laughing at you. Instead, think, \"They're probably laughing about an inside joke.\""

      "content": "You might react defensively because your family or friends do. Growing up, maybe your parents were pretty defensive. This may have taught you that you also always need to have your guard up and look for perceived threats. [9] X Research source In reality, your parents or the people around you may have been struggling with their own feelings of insecurity, anxiety, or other underlying causes. Thankfully, you can also unlearn defensiveness. Anytime you start feeling defensive, take a moment to breathe and reflect on what just happened. [10] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 February 2022. Ask yourself if the person really criticized you or if you might be reading into what they said from a negative perspective. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "No one likes to hear that they \"always\" do something.",
      "content": "No one likes to hear that they \"always\" do something. It makes you feel like you've been put in a box or unfairly judged, and as a result, your defense mechanisms may go into overdrive. This is completely understandable, but try to respond respectfully to avoid making the situation tenser. [12] X Research source Let's say your sister just said that you never remember to do the dishes, but you just did the dishes 2 days ago. Before lashing out, take a moment to consider her words and formulate a considerate response. You might say, \"I'm sorry that you're frustrated with me. I did the dishes a few days ago, but I could definitely improve. I'll make sure to help out with the dishes more often.\""

      "content": "If someone takes advantage of you, your defenses might go up. That might look like being more guarded around certain people or feeling like you can't trust what they say. If a person has displayed signs that they aren't trustworthy, then you have every right to feel this way. Try setting boundaries and communicating them with these people. It will help you avoid falling into passive-aggressive defense mechanisms while also protecting yourself. [13] X Research source Maybe you've noticed a friend of yours frequently borrows money from you and never pays you back. Instead of lashing out or being passive-aggressive (i.e. rolling your eyes but letting her borrow the money), set a boundary. Try, \"I'd love to help, but I'd feel more comfortable loaning you money if you paid me back the money you owe me first. I hope you understand where I'm coming from.\""

      "content": "Defensiveness can help you (temporarily) avoid remorse. Everyone makes mistakes. It's possible that you made a mistake that you feel bad about and now react defensively when a friend mentions it or another situation like it. [14] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 30 September 2021. Though this is understandable, try working through your real feelings about what happened so that you can apologize, forgive yourself, and make positive changes going forward. Maybe you accidentally bumped another car's bumper last time you parallel parked. If a friend says something like, \"I can drive,\" you might immediately jump to thinking that it's because she thinks you're a bad driver. To avoid this reaction, reflect on what happened and make a change going forward. Practice parking in your neighborhood, remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes, and forgive yourself."

      "content": "You might react defensively if you struggle to admit that you're wrong. It's tough to admit your shortcomings, but remember that everyone has them. If you messed up, you might be tempted to blame the situation on someone else or justify your actions. [15] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 February 2022. This behavior can alienate you from other people, though, because part of forging strong relationships is owning up to your actions, apologizing, and learning from your mistakes. [16] X Research source Let's say that you forgot to include an important detail in a work assignment. When your boss confronts you about it, you might be tempted to say something like, \"Well, Lisa didn't tell me I was supposed to do that!\" To take accountability, pause for a moment before responding and remind yourself that it's much better to just admit the mistake. Say something like, \"You're totally right. I'll go back and include that detail in the next draft.\""

[17] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 30 September 2021. Regardless of what it is, honesty is always the best policy. Counteract your defensiveness by reflecting on why you might be lying and making a commitment to being a little more truthful. [18] X Research source Maybe you told your partner that you went out for lunch, but neglected to say that you got lunch with an ex. If your partner asks about it, you might say something like, \"Why do you care?\" or \"I don't see why it matters.\" Instead of lying, try being honest. Say something like, \"I met up with my ex-boyfriend Timothy. We've always remained friends, but I was nervous to tell you because I wasn't sure how you would feel about it.\""
