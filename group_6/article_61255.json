      "content": "Soak the burned area in warm water for 20 minutes. To start treating your ice burn, heat up a bath, sink, or pot of water until it’s warm but not boiling. The water should be between 99 °F (37 °C) and 104 °F (40 °C). Submerge the impacted skin area into the warm water and let it soak without removing it for 20 minutes. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Avoid using water above 104 °F (40 °C), as extreme heat can make your ice burn worse. As your skin soaks, you may experience a prickling sensation. This indicates that your skin is thawing and that the sensation is returning."

After soaking for 20 minutes, remove the impacted skin area from the warm water soak and let it sit at room temperature for another 20 minutes. This will give your skin time to start to return to its normal temperature. [3] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source After 20 minutes out of the soak, if you find that your burn has started to heal and the pain has started to subside, you may not need to repeat the soak. Room temperature is generally considered to be 70 °F (21 °C). If you are unable to rest in a room at around this temperature, cover your ice burn loosely with a blanket or extra clothing."

If your symptoms have begun to subside after 1 to 2 warm water soaks but your skin is still a bit numb or cold, gently apply a warm compress to the burned area. Hold the compress on the burn for about 20 minutes. For your compress, you can use a hot water pouch, or run a wash cloth under hot water until warm. If holding a warm compress on the burn is painful, place your burned skin gently under a warm blanket instead."

Check your ice burn for the symptoms of a severe burn and see a doctor immediately if you exhibit any of the symptoms. Common symptoms for a severe ice burn include cracking or blistering, white, grey, or yellowish skin tint that remains even after your skin has warmed up, and/or the feeling of numbness, extreme cold, or hardening even after warming. [8] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source In very severe cases, you might also experience an inability to use your muscles in the affected area. You may also notice the signs of an infection, including pus or green discharge, fever, and/or increasing pain. While it is possible for minor ice burns to blister and crack, this is generally an indication that your ice burn is severe. Even if your ice burn is minor, cracking and/or blistering can prevent you from being able to properly clean and care for the wound. Therefore, you should seek medical attention if your wound is open, regardless of the cause or severity."

If your skin turns black or blue, or if you are in severe pain that penetrates deep into your body, you may also be experiencing frostbite and need to see a doctor immediately. The difference between an ice burn and frostbite is often very subtle. While an ice burn causes painful burning on the surface of your skin, frostbite occurs when both your skin and the tissue beneath it freeze and are damaged. [9] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source While both ice burns and frostbite can cause your skin to turn white, red, or pale yellow, generally, only frostbite will turn your skin blue or black. Don’t rewarm frostbitten tissue if there is a possibility of refreezing before reaching emergency care. Don’t rub the frostbitten area because it could cause further tissue damage."

      "content": "Receive treatment to address your specific symptoms. The treatment that your doctor administers will depend on the severity of your ice burn, whether you also have frostbite, and the symptoms you are exhibiting. In most cases, your doctor will begin by rewarming the skin using a 20-minute warm water bath or whirlpool therapy bath. Your doctor will also likely provide oral pain medication, infection-fighting medication, and possibly an IV with medication to help restore blood flow to the impacted area. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source If both the skin and tissue are damaged, your doctor may also perform a procedure to remove some or all of the burned area. In severe cases, your doctor may also conduct an X-ray, bone scan, or MRI to determine the extent of the damage. A severe ice burn can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months to heal. If you also have frostbite, it is possible that the impacted area will never fully recover."
