      "content": "The Industrial Belt is notoriously long. When you wear it, make sure the letters point upward so someone facing you can read them. Wrap it around your waist twice before pulling it through the buckle in the front and letting the excess hang down toward your legs. [1] X Research source This is the style that OFF-WHITE recommends wearing, and they even have a video tutorial of it up on their Instagram. This way your belt won’t only serve as an accessory, but also play a practical role of holding your pants."

      "content": "The long, dangly belt can sometimes get in your way. If you aren’t a fan of having the excess hang around your legs, wrap it twice around your waist before sliding it through the buckle. Then, pull the excess around your waist a 3rd time, and let the 6 in (15 cm) or so left hang down onto your legs. [2] X Research source If you don’t want the belt to hang at all, try tucking the last little bit into your belt loops, too. Then it will just look like a normal belt."
