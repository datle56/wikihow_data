      "title": "Wash your hair as infrequently as possible.",
      "content": "Wash your hair as infrequently as possible. Your scalp produces natural oils which provide your hair with a lot of moisture. When you shampoo your hair, you wash away these oils, leaving your hair dry and frizzy. Instead of washing your hair every day, simply rinse your hair in the shower and only shampoo every 3-5 days. If your hair looks greasy in between washes, use a dry shampoo to soak up the oil and add texture."

      "title": "Use shampoo and conditioner formulated for dry hair.",
      "content": "Use shampoo and conditioner formulated for dry hair. Select a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to help smooth your hair and reduce puffiness. Read the labels and choose products that specify they are “moisturizing” or “smoothing.” Avoid using products with sulfates, which can dry out your tresses and lead to frizzy hair. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Avoid products that advertise increased hair volume, as these will exacerbate frizz. Condition your hair from the mid-lengths to ends, and leave it on your hair for at least 2 minutes before rinsing. You can also try a leave-in conditioner for extra moisture."

      "title": "Rinse with cool or cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse with cool or cold water. Cold water seals the hair cuticle, which will prevent each strand from losing valuable moisture and create a sleeker, shinier look. Enjoy a warm—not hot—shower and rinse out your shampoo and conditioner with cool or cold water. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Carefully blot excess water from your hair.",
      "content": "Carefully blot excess water from your hair. Avoid using terrycloth towels to dry your hair, as they have loops that can disturb hair cuticles and contribute to frizz. Try gently pressing the water from your hair with a T-shirt or microfiber towel instead. Remember to never wring or rub your hair aggressively.

      "title": "Gently detangle your hair with a wide-tooth comb.",
      "content": "Gently detangle your hair with a wide-tooth comb. If you have curly hair, it’s best to comb through it in the shower after applying conditioner. If your hair is straight, you can comb through it when you get out of the shower. Either way, use a wide-tooth comb , begin at the ends of your hair, and work your way up to the roots. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Avoid brushing wet hair if your hair is straight, as this can cause breakage."

      "title": "Let your hair air dry and apply a moisturizing product.",
      "content": "Let your hair air dry and apply a moisturizing product. To avoid damage, let your hair air dry rather than using a blow-dryer, especially if you have curly locks. Apply a moisturizing product like a cream, serum, or oil, then shape your curls as desired. If you have straight hair, simply apply a smoothing product and let your tresses dry on their own. [5] X Research source If you do choose to blow-dry your hair, apply a heat-protectant product first. Then, use an ionic ceramic blow-dryer to help combat frizz. Or, use a hooded dryer so the air flows down over the hair shaft. Another alternative is to plop your hair . Wrap it in a soft T-shirt or microfiber towel to enhance your curls while drying."

      "content": "Let your natural shape work for you. With so many styling products available, there are plenty of options to help enhance your natural curl while fighting off unwanted frizz. Avoid straightening, perming, or relaxing your hair, as these can cause dryness and additional damage. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Products like gels, mousses, and curl-enhancing creams all contain ingredients called polymers, which coat the hair and “lock” your curls or waves into place. If your hair is fine and wavy, mousses are your best choice since they don’t weigh hair down. If your hair is coarse and curly, gel or cream is recommended."

      "title": "Switch to alcohol-free products.",
      "content": "Switch to alcohol-free products. Most hair sprays and mousses have a high alcohol content, which can cause the cuticle to swell up. Alcohol can also dry out your hair, making it look poofy and eventually leading to breakage. Try using alcohol-free products that work to reduce frizz, such as creams and serums.

      "content": "Tame flyaways with a curling iron. It may seem counterintuitive, but wrapping flyaway strands around a curling iron can help set them in place and smooth out your hair. Be sure to completely dry your hair first and use the curling iron sparingly. Keep it on a low heat setting and don’t hold the strands for very long. Whenever you use heat, you risk causing damage to your hair. Always apply a heat-protectant product first."

      "content": "Do a weekly hot oil treatment. A hot oil treatment is a great way to condition and strengthen your hair. Choose a treatment with jojoba oil to help strengthen the cuticle and further prevent frizz. Warm up the oil then massage it into your hair and scalp. This works well for all hair types, so try it out with your friends! [9] X Research source If desired, put a shower cap over your hair and let the oil soak in for 30 minutes before washing it out. Help the oil penetrate deeper into the hair shaft by applying heat with a hair dryer."
