[1] X Expert Source Ashlyne Mullen, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 23 August 2021. If you want to keep a friendly relationship with that person, sometimes you just have to agree to disagree. If that's the case, try to change the subject before the argument goes too far, and avoid talking about that topic again in the future. [2] X Research source For instance, if you and your sibling have vastly different opinions on how to educate your children, you might say something like, \"I know you love your kids very much, and I love mine. I respect your right to do what you think is best for your family, and I hope you'll respect my decision too, even if you don't necessarily agree with it.\" If there are issues you need to address, like dividing up chores in your household, sit down and plan out how you can have that conversation in a healthy, productive way. However, sometimes it's best to let smaller things go without worrying about them too much."

      "content": "Try not to engage with people who enjoy arguing. While you can't avoid every negative interaction with others, you can cut out a lot of them by being choosier about how you spend your time and who you're around. If there's someone you just can't seem to get along with, try to limit how much time you're around them, if it's at all possible. If you can't do that, try as hard as you can to steer the conversation away from controversial subjects that typically end in arguments. [3] X Research source In addition, avoid participating in hotly-contested debates on social media, like commenting on political discussions. People have more of a tendency to be unkind when they're typing words rather than saying them to someone's face, and you might find yourself getting wrapped up in a heated argument that will linger with you for days.

      "content": "Remind yourself that other people's opinions don't define you. It's normal to want other people to approve of you. However, it's important to remember that it's not actually a reflection of your value if someone else doesn't like you. If you don't get as emotionally wrapped up in what the other person thinks, you might find it easier to avoid getting into arguments with them in your head. For instance, instead of confronting a coworker after they make a snarky comment about your lack of experience, you might tell yourself something like, \"Ray might not see why I'm qualified for this job, but he's not the one who hired me. I just have to keep doing my best, and I know I'll get the hang of it.\""

[5] X Expert Source Ashlyne Mullen, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 23 August 2021. However, the more you engage in these negative thoughts, the more you'll reinforce them. Every so often, check-in with yourself. If you catch yourself getting caught up in an imaginary argument, gently remind yourself that it's happening, and try to turn your thoughts to something else, if you can. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source At first, it might be difficult to stop the argument, even after you recognize that it's happening. That's okay—it will take some practice to replace negative thoughts with positive ones.

It's best if you can do something that will engage your body and mind together, like doing a challenging workout. However, anything that gets your mind off the subject will do. [7] X Research source You might also go for a walk outside, talk to a supportive friend, solve a crossword puzzle, or play a tough video game.

If you find that happening often, it can help to designate a specific time during the day for these imagined conversations. That way, if you catch yourself getting wrapped up in one, you can pause it and remind yourself that there's time for that later. [10] X Research source For instance, you might allow yourself an hour after dinner to practice an upcoming difficult conversation or play through an old one. This is similar to the way people with anxiety sometimes designate a specific time of day just for worrying."

Allow yourself to think through your responses to what you imagine the other person would say, or come up with retorts to things they actually did say during your last argument. As you do that, though, try to focus on the underlying thoughts and feelings that are upsetting you, rather than just trying to craft a devastating insult. [11] X Research source For instance, if you keep replaying the time a coworker implied you're not good at your job, you might think about why that really hurts. Are you insecure about your ability to do your job, or maybe bothered because you don't feel like you're recognized at work?"

If you find yourself replaying conversations and arguments over and over again, if it's causing you to lose sleep, or if you're getting really angry or upset, it may help to talk to a mental health provider. This can be a sign that you're struggling with anxiety. A counselor can help you learn techniques to manage that anxiety and express your thoughts when you're around other people.

Once you've narrowed down what's really bothering you, try to find a time when neither of you are busy or distracted, then ask the other person if you can have a moment. Explain that you've had something on your mind you'd like to talk to them about, and ask them if it's okay if you share it. For instance, if you need to talk to a coworker, you might say something like, \"Hey Carol, can I borrow you for a minute before lunch?
