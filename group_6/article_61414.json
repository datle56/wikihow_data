Occasionally, the basic mission designation is left out if the type and the modified mission (see next step) are included (e.g. MQ-9A). [4] X Research source A – Ground Attack (\"A\" is from Attack) B – Bomber C – Transport (\"C\" from Cargo mover) E – Special Electronic Installation (\"E\" stands for the addition of extensive Electronic equipment) F – Fighter (air combat, think of the \"F\" for Fighting/dogFighting) H - Search and Rescue (Think of the \"H\" as in Hospital, flying Hospital ships, and also the common destination for those who are rescued) K – Tanker (think of the \"K\" in tanker or Kerosene, it carries and transfers aviation fuel--frequently a kerosene blend--in flight to other aircraft) L – Laser-equipped (Laser weaponry against air and ground targets; a new designation) M – Multi-mission (A wide variety of possible missions) O – Observation (Observation of enemy or potential enemy positions) P – \"P\" for Patrol, maritime (as in over the ocean) NOTE: Prior to 1962's \"modernized\" designations, \"P\" was commonly used for WWI, WWII and Korean War \"Pursuit\" planes, the first fighter/interceptors R – Reconnaissance (air reconnaissance of enemy forces, territory, and facilities) S – Anti-Submarine (\"S\" from enemy Submarines' search, locate, and attack; see Tips below) T – Trainer U – Utility (base support aircraft) X – Special Research (\"X\" from experimental design and developmental pure research programs, with no operational mission intended or feasible)"

The letter left of the basic mission designation indicates that a particular aircraft has been optionally modified for a mission different than its original design purpose. There should only be one letter for the modified mission designation, but there are a few exceptions (e.g. EKA-3B). These symbols are similar to the basic mission symbols, but contain a few extra descriptors. [5] X Research source A – Ground Attack C – Transport (Cargo) D – Drone Detector (modified to control unmanned aerial vehicles such as drones) E – Special Electronic Installation (addition of extensive electronic equipment) F – Fighter (air combat) K – Tanker (carries and transfers aviation fuel in flight to other aircraft) L – Cold Weather Operations (Arctic or Antarctic environments) M – Multi-mission (catch-all category) O – Observation (observation of enemy or potential enemy positions) P – Maritime Patrol Q – UAV or drone R – Reconnaissance (Reconnaissance by air of enemy forces, territory, and facilities) S – Anti-Submarine (search for, locate, and attack enemy submarines) T – Trainer U – Utility (base support aircraft) V – VIP/Presidential Staff Transport (comfortable accommodations) W – Weather Reconnaissance (weather monitoring and air sampling)"

Usually for ground training of crews and support. Rare. J – Special Testing, Temporary. Aircraft with equipment temporarily installed for testing. N – Special Testing, Permanent. Aircraft with equipment installed for testing and that cannot be returned to original configuration. X – Experimental. Aircraft not yet finalized or accepted for service. Y – Prototype. Think of the \"Y\" in prototYpe, this is a final aircraft creation which is intended for mass production. Z – Planning phase. In the planning/pre-development phase. Not for actual aircraft."

      "content": "Look for the design number to the right of the hyphen. The first number after the hyphen is an aircraft designation. The rule, although often violated, is that normal aircraft are to be designated in a strict numerical series according to their basic mission. The easiest examples are found in the Fighter class of US airplanes: F-14, then the F-15, F-16 and so on. But, there are exceptions. For example, the X-35, which was a research plane, was later redesignated the F-35 when it became fighter capable, even though the next number in the Fighter sequence was F-24. [7] X Research source"

A suffix letter designates variants of a basic aircraft, with the first model being \"A\" and subsequent series letters being assigned the next letters of the alphabet (skipping \"I\" and \"O\" to avoid confusion with the numbers \"1\" and \"0\"). As with other symbols, there are exceptions with out-of-sequence suffixes (e.g. to designate a specific customer, like the \"N\" in F-16N designated \"Navy\"). [8] X Research source"

Distinguishes between minor sub-variants of a specific aircraft variant. \"51\" and \"40\" in the examples above. Sometimes the hyphen before the block number is replaced by the word \"block\" (e.g. B-2A Block 30). Manufacturer code letters. Identifies manufacturing plant."
