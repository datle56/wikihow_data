Slide your staples into the magazine with the flat side down and the sharp edges pointing upward. [12] X Research source This is true for most staple guns, but it could vary depending on the model you have. If you’re not sure, check your owner’s manual. Be sure to note the end of the staple gun where the staples are supposed to come out of, since it's not always located where you might think. The tool is often marked with an arrow of where the staples will come out."
