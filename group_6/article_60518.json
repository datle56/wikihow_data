The urge to self-harm doesn’t even need to come up if you want—you could just hang out with someone and watch a movie or go out to eat. If you do want to discuss the urge, that’s totally reasonable, too. You can seek out advice, or just ask them to sit there and listen while you talk through what you’re feeling.

If you haven’t told anyone about your self-harming, you don’t need to start now if you aren’t ready. You could just try saying, “Hey, I’m having a rough day. Would you mind hanging out with me to keep me distracted?” or, “I’m super bored right now; do you mind if I come over to your place?” [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

      "content": "Moving around may put you in a new headspace where the urge goes away. If you’re sitting in your room, go out to the kitchen and see how you feel. If that doesn’t work, step out on your back porch or front lawn. If the urge still isn’t gone, start walking. Take a stroll through a park, or visit a nearby mall and do some window shopping. Often, the urge to self-harm will disappear if you force yourself to go somewhere new. [4] X Research source People self-harm for a variety of different reasons. If you’re the kind of person who self-harms when they feel detached, bored, or numb, this is a great way to go. Often, just moving around will dramatically help.

Even if you don’t think you’re a very good artist, don’t worry about it. Just let the feelings flow and put what you’re experiencing on paper or canvas. If you prefer writing, try penning a poem or short story. You could even just journal about what you’re experiencing.

Go to source If you aren’t happy with whatever you’ve created, just throw it out when you’re done! There’s no rule that says you have to share whatever art you’ve created, and the point here is to express yourself, not document whatever you’re going through to share it with everybody. People often self-harm when they feel emotions they can’t understand or articulate. If you can find a way to explore those emotions that doesn’t involve hurting yourself, that’s always going to be preferable. That’s why art is such a great coping mechanism!"
