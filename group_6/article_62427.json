      "content": "Working in a morgue or being a mortician is no easy feat. Many women tend to take on this physically and emotionally demanding job because they have the empathy and dexterity to do so. Statistically speaking, women are known for being more empathetic than men, giving them the ability to comfort grieving families and handle sensitive topics with ease. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Along with this, women are also typically more agile than men, which allows them to handle human remains with care. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Some may argue that women have a better eye for detail than men and are more organized.

      "content": "Many have theorized that females primarily work in morgues because they’re less likely to engage in inappropriate behavior with dead bodies. In March 2023, Roxane Gay, author of Bad Feminist , tweeted, “The rabbit hole I just went down after learning why morgues prefer to hire women. SMH…” This tweet sparked a social media conversation and had others digging into the history. As TikTok user “coyoteannie” points out, men have been known to deal with necrophilia throughout history. In a 1989 study, researchers found that 92% of necrophiles are male. Even so, necrophilia is an incredibly rare disorder with very few cases reported worldwide. [4] X Research source Therefore, the theory that women are primarily hired as morticians because of necrophilia is all speculation. In other words, a rumor. Necrophilia is the sexual attraction to corpses, and it’s been proven that necrophiles often choose careers that put them in contact with corpses (such as jobs within a morgue or funeral home). [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Since March 2023, Gay’s original tweet and several TikTok responses to the initial remark have been removed."

      "content": "Even with these theories, women are still out numbered in the mortician field. In 2023, 61.2% of morticians are male while 38.8% are female. Since 2010, the number of female morticians has increased. [6] X Research source Many speculate that this influx in female morticians is a result of trying to curb corpse violations; however, nothing has been officially proven or stated to support this statement. Women are often statistically considered more charismatic, empathetic, organized, and gentler than men. While this is rather stereotypical, from a social standpoint, it may play a part in the hiring process and give them a leg up in the field. At the end of the day, none of these reasons or theories are set in stone—males still out number females in the mortuary field. Yes, women may speculatively be less likely to disrespect a corpse or make administrative mistakes, but that doesn’t nullify them from the behavior. A lot goes into becoming a mortician , and the qualifications of anyone pursuing a career in mortuary shouldn’t be disregarded because of their sex."
