      "content": "Assess whether you have a ball-in-socket style ceiling fan, also known as a down-rod mounted ceiling fan. These type of fans are distinctive in that the body of the fan hangs a bit away from the ceiling on a pole. The pole connects at the ceiling at a canopy, which is just a small metal enclosure that covers the mounting bracket and wires for the fan. This type of ceiling fan can usually be easily removed in a few steps."

[2] X Research source You may need to use a very short screwdriver to get between the housing at the ceiling and the main body of the ceiling fan. Once the canopy is unscrewed, simply lower it down so it rests on top of the fan body. Now you should be able to see how the ball at the top of the fan pole slips easily in and out of the bracket. You should also be able to see the electrical connections between the fan and the wires in the ceiling. If you cannot get into the space between the housing and the fan body, you may want to follow method two below, as it will tell you how to take more parts off the fan apart in order to remove it."

Once you have detached the fan wires from the wires coming from the ceiling, be sure to put the wire nuts back onto the wires coming from the ceiling. This way, if you need to turn the power back on before you install a new fixture, your wires will be safely capped off."

This type of ceiling fan is obviously flush mounted, meaning that the motor of the fan sits right up at the ceiling. These ceiling fans require a bit more disassembly to remove, as the fan itself needs to be taken apart to get to the attachment bracket. However, they are good fans to have in rooms with low ceilings, as they do not hang down as far as ball-in-socket type ceiling fans."

[5] X Research source The light kit is simply the portion of the fan that is the light. On most ceiling fans with lights, the light kit is a separate section of the fan that can be removed separately. On many styles of ceiling fans the lightbulbs are simply accessible by climbing up a ladder and unscrewing them but some models require you to take off a cover that encloses the bulb. Be gentle when removing the lightbulbs. If they happen to break, you should be cautious when removing a broken lightbulb from the socket ."

While some models will allow you to take the fan body off the ceiling without removing the light kit, most flush mounted ceiling fans require that it is removed, so that you can get to the screws that attach the whole fan to the ceiling. This step will require unscrewing the screws that hold the light kit to the fan body. Inside, you will most likely have to disconnect the wires that connect the light kit to the fan. These should simply be connected with wire nuts, which you turn counterclockwise to unscrew. It is a really good idea to retest that you have no power coming to the fan once you have opened up the light kit. This is most easily done with a non-contact voltage tester, which tests for magnetic fields around wires quickly and easily."

[6] X Research source Ceiling fan blades are connected to the body of the fan with metal brackets that screw into the fan body, basically the housing for the fan's motor, and into the fan paddles themselves. It's easiest to keep the fan blade brackets and the fan blades attached and just unscrew the screws that attach the brackets to the fan body. This way, you aren't removing twice as many screws while up on your ladder. If you plan on re-using the fan, be sure to keep all the parts. Placing all the parts in a marked bag or envelope is a good idea."

On most modern ceiling fan models the body is attached to the bracket with a screw on one side and a hinge on the other side. This makes it so that when you unscrew the screw, the body of the fan can hang off the hinge while you disconnect the wiring. Once the screw is unscrewed, simply allow the body of the fan to hang from the hinge on one side. Otherwise you would have to hold the whole fan in one hand and disconnect the wires with the other."
