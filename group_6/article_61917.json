    {
      "title": "You see, hear, or feel the touch of a deceased loved one.",
      "content": "You see, hear, or feel the touch of a deceased loved one. You might notice a shift in the energy around you, sense someone sitting near you, or feel them touch you. Although a spirit’s presence might just let you know that they’re there, pay attention to when these signals appear—they could also be a sign that something bad is just around the corner. You might suddenly feel cold when an unknown person walks into the room, which might be a sign that they’re a source of danger. Maybe you’re falling asleep at the wheel of a car and you feel something grab your hand on the steering wheel."

      "title": "You actually hear them warn you that something’s going to happen.",
      "content": "You actually hear them warn you that something’s going to happen. Sometimes, spirits can muster up enough energy to send you an audible message in the physical realm. [1] X Research source In times of crisis or a moment right before disaster strikes, you might hear your loved one’s voice tell you something that helps you protect yourself. Maybe you were driving too fast when a voice told you to slow down, and a moment later, someone swerved into your lane. Or you heard someone who isn’t there tell you to stand in a stable stairway seconds before an earthquake strikes. While some people hear their deceased loved one in their minds, others might hear an external, audible voice that sounds exactly like them."

      "title": "You keep losing things that you need to complete a task.",
      "content": "You keep losing things that you need to complete a task. You might lose your keys when you’re about to go out or misplace an important letter right before you’re about to send it. These misplacements might be a sign that your loved one has something to tell you—they often won’t stop until it’s clear that you understand the message. These items might also reappear in locations that are significant to the message. You may even find it on a certain photograph or object that provides context to the warning. You might lose your favorite necklace only to find it in a room you hadn’t gone in that day, on top of your loved one’s will. This might be a sign to look through it a little more carefully."

      "title": "You get a whiff of cigarettes, a perfume they wore, or their favorite meal.",
      "content": "You get a whiff of cigarettes, a perfume they wore, or their favorite meal. Scent is closely linked to memory, which might be why spirits communicate through smells. If you smell their presence in the physical world, it might be their way of letting you know they’re still with you, ready to protect you from anything coming your way. [2] X Research source You might smell the cigar your deceased father liked to smoke right as you decide not to turn down a dark alleyway. Maybe a whiff of the sandalwood cologne your departed friend wore reminds you to slow down before you drive through a school zone."

      "title": "Spiritual messengers let you know that they’re looking out for you.",
      "content": "Spiritual messengers let you know that they’re looking out for you. Animals and insects are often messengers from the spiritual realm. If an animal or insect appears when you’re unsure which path to take or when you most need reassurance from your loved one, it might be a spiritual messenger giving you a message about the path ahead. Common spiritual messengers include doves, cardinals, blue jays, butterflies, dragonflies, ladybugs, and dolphins. However, any animal that’s significant to you can be a messenger. You may see your grandmother’s favorite bird, a robin, seemingly shaking its head “no” right when you ask yourself if you should accept a job offer or not. You might see a moth (your friend’s favorite bug) land on a flier for home insurance, which reminds you to increase your plan, weeks before a hurricane hits your neighborhood."

      "title": "You find coins, feathers, or seashells in seemingly random places.",
      "content": "You find coins, feathers, or seashells in seemingly random places. When the spirits of loved ones want to draw your attention, they might put small objects in your path for you to decode. When you find these trinkets, pay attention to patterns that constantly reappear. These could give you clues to figure out what your loved one is trying to warn you about. Do you find only dimes ? Are the feathers from a specific bird? Are the seashells a significant color or shape? Does the date on the coin mean anything? Instead of objects, you might see certain symbols, like butterflies, rainbows, birds, or flowers. [3] X Research source What these symbols remind you of can tell you what your loved one is trying to warn you about. Listen to your intuition to know whether an object or symbol you find is random or if it comes from a deceased loved one. If it’s a message, it might instantly remind you of them."

      "title": "Animals and children sense the spirit’s presence and act strangely.",
      "content": "Animals and children sense the spirit’s presence and act strangely. Animals and young children often serve as messengers for departed loved ones and spirit guides. When they start displaying unusual behaviors like interacting with someone who seemingly isn’t there, it might be a sign that they see a deceased loved one who’s trying to give you a message . An animal might stare at an invisible object, whimper or growl in a certain direction, or act as if they’re playing with something you can’t see. Children might feel or sense the presence of the spirit. They might even tell you the message your loved one is trying to give you without judgment or confusion."

      "title": "An image appears in your mind or you see your loved one in the room.",
      "content": "An image appears in your mind or you see your loved one in the room. Visions of spirits are not uncommon and can be a sign that they’re trying desperately to contact you about something important. Your loved one might appear in front of you or as a two-dimensional image from the great beyond. They might also send you a mental image of a specific place or object you know could only come from them. Try to think about what the vision could be warning you of. Did your loved one touch or try to gesture towards something? Did they try to say something? If you saw an image of something else tied to your loved one, think about its significance. Was it the house they grew up in? An important family heirloom? A flower they liked? Once you understand why a vision is important, try to think about why your loved one sent it to you. Did they touch your wedding ring because they’re worried about your relationship? Did you see an image of their house because it was destroyed and they’re worried about yours?"

      "title": "You hear their favorite song or get it stuck in your head.",
      "content": "You hear their favorite song or get it stuck in your head. If you’re listening to a random playlist or you’re walking into a store and their song comes on, it’s a sign that they’re trying to send you a message. [4] X Research source The lyrics of their favorite song or of the song that plays after it might tell you what your loved one is trying to warn you about more specifically. Your loved one might also send you a series of songs with a similar theme or message that answers a question you have about a certain situation. They might communicate through a song title or a certain line that reminds you of them right when you’re already thinking about them."

    {
      "title": "Your loved one appears in your dreams, prayers, or meditations.",
      "content": "Your loved one appears in your dreams, prayers, or meditations. Spirits can send messages to you while you’re in a relaxed, unconscious state, where the veil between the spirit world and the physical is thin. [5] X Research source While in this state, a deceased loved one might talk to you and directly let you know that something dangerous is around the corner. You might even have an out-of-body experience, entering a liminal space where you can see and communicate with a departed friend or family member. Other times, a loved one might just try to spend time with you or might not have enough time to share a message with you. You might also talk to a loved one on the phone in your dream where they give you a short message that seems far away."

    {
      "title": "You keep seeing warnings from ads, street names, or shop signs.",
      "content": "You keep seeing warnings from ads, street names, or shop signs. Sometimes spirits can use literal signs to capture your attention. You might see billboards, flyers, and other signs that all relate to each other or that you know instinctively were sent by your loved one. These signs can help you decode what danger your loved one is warning you about. If your loved one is trying to warn you against a dangerous situation, like meeting a stranger at night, you might constantly see “Stop” signs or billboards about stranger danger. If they’re alerting you to seek medical attention, you might constantly see advertisements and flyers about a certain illness or medical condition."

      "title": "You see the same angel numbers over and over again.",
      "content": "You see the same angel numbers over and over again. Angel numbers, or repeating numbers, are a way that those in the spiritual realm can communicate with those in the physical. You might notice the same number sequence (like 888, 111, or 4141) in clocks, license plates, street names, prices, or phone numbers. [6] X Research source These numbers might have a personal meaning, like a certain date or a verse from a religious text like the Bible. If you see the number “0505” everywhere, maybe it refers to May 5th, the day that your mother was born. This could be a sign to check in on her. Each angel number also has certain spiritual messages and vibrations that might help you piece together what your loved one is trying to tell you. You might see the number “1717” when you’re deciding whether to move out on your own. “1717” can be a sign to be more independent and forge your own path."

      "title": "Your lights, appliances, or computers turn off and on unexpectedly.",
      "content": "Your lights, appliances, or computers turn off and on unexpectedly. Spirits can tap into energy sources like electricity to communicate with you in the physical realm. They might drain batteries, interrupt electrical currents, or create surges, causing fully-charged phones to drop to low power, lights to flicker, or radios to change stations. Pay attention to when these electrical disturbances occur and trust your gut to decide if they’re coincidences or if they might mean something more. If you set up a date with someone you met online and right before you leave, your car battery dies, it could be your loved one trying to stop you from meeting with them. Some believe that spirits can tap into electricity because they both vibrate at a similar frequency and are charged with high energy."

      "title": "You capture a colorful orb in a photograph or see streaks of light.",
      "content": "You capture a colorful orb in a photograph or see streaks of light. If you take a photograph or video and notice a circular ball of energy in the image, it might actually be your loved one trying to communicate with you. [7] X Research source You might also see streaks of light moving in front of you or out of the corner of your eye, just out of reach. Often orbs are tied to the location the photo was taken in. Think about the significance of the place you’re in—you might be able to decode the warning they’re trying to send you. If you see an orb in an image on top of a certain person, your loved one might be telling you to avoid them. If you see a flash of light before entering a store or business, it might be a sign from beyond to avoid that place. If you have a pet, you might notice them reacting strangely at the same time as they sense this light energy manifestation of your deceased loved one."
