      "content": "It’s usually a combination of bacteria, sweat, and oil. Anyone who hits the gym regularly might recognize this odor on their workout gear, even after they’ve washed it. Your clothes pick up any sweat and natural body oils, so when you work out, your clothes absorb a ton of microbes and odors. If given enough time, all of that stuff in your clothing’s fiber will create a musty odor. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This kind of musty odor will typically come out after a wash, but if you don’t wash your clothes fast enough or your washing machine isn’t clean, it can settle into the fabric and become much harder to get out."

      "title": "If your fresh laundry smells musty after it dries, that’s mildew.",
      "content": "If your fresh laundry smells musty after it dries, that’s mildew. If there’s bacteria, sweat, and oil caked into your clothes, and they get wet without drying out all the way, that damp mixture can turn into mildew. Basically, a microscopic fungus starts growing in your clothes. Unfortunately, mildew tends to stick to your washing machine, so you may need to clean your washing machine to keep it from spreading to other clothes. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source This can happen if you accidentally forget to move your clothes from the washer to the dryer, your washing machine or dryer aren’t clean, or your clothes sit in the hamper for too long."

      "content": "Your washing machine could be harboring the odor-causing bacteria. Open your washing machine when it’s dry and empty, and take a sniff. Does it have a damp, moldy odor? If so, your machine is to blame. [3] X Research source If your machine has a self-clean function, try that first. If not (or if the self-clean doesn’t do the trick), run an empty cycle with warm water and pour in 2 cups (470 mL) of distilled white vinegar. If that doesn’t work, scrub the drum by hand with vinegar and water using a sponge. [4] X Research source You may need to do this multiple times to fully get rid of the bacteria and fungus causing that smell. Your dryer could be harboring the bacteria as well, although it’s typically the washing machine to blame on this one."

      "title": "Your hamper could be keeping that mustiness around.",
      "content": "Your hamper could be keeping that mustiness around. If you toss your sweaty, dirty clothes in a hamper and the fabrics sit there for too long, all of the moisture could contribute to the growth of mildew. To prevent this, turn your clothes inside out and let them sit out in the open air for a few hours before you put them in the hamper. Even better, skip the hamper altogether and hang or lay out your dirty clothes until you’ve got a full load of laundry on your hand. [5] X Research source If you are short on space and you do need to use a hamper, no problem. So long as you air the clothes out for a bit before putting them in the hamper, you should curb that odor dramatically."

      "title": "That musty odor tends to stick around on synthetic fabrics.",
      "content": "That musty odor tends to stick around on synthetic fabrics. Cotton clothing tends to be very breathable, but synthetic fibers, like nylon, have a much harder time airing out. If this must is only developing on your workout gear, get a specialty detergent designed specifically for athletic wear and wash your synthetic workout clothes separately. [6] X Research source You can pick up a specialty detergent designed for synthetic athletic wear at most big box general stores. Traditional detergent is designed for cotton clothing, and it’s not going to get any caked-in scents out of your synthetic gear, but specialty detergent will!"

Add 1–2 tsp (4.9–9.9 ml) of white vinegar to the detergent drawer to deodorize your clothes and run the cycle. [7] X Expert Source Susan Stocker House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. The hotter the water, the faster that bacteria and sweat will dissolve out of the clothing fiber."

If this isn’t practical, get your clothes in the dryer immediately after the wash cycle is over and dry the clothes on a higher heat setting than you’d normally use. [8] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source If the smell still isn’t out, wash the clothes with only white vinegar, then run another cycle with just 1 cup (230 g) of baking soda before drying.

      "title": "Stop using fabric softener, deodorizers, or heavily perfumed detergents.",
      "content": "Stop using fabric softener, deodorizers, or heavily perfumed detergents. Fabric softener, non-vinegar-based deodorizers, and strong-scented detergents will mask the musty smell, but they won’t remove it. In fact, the residue from these products can actually make the moldy aroma worse. Always wash your clothes by using the recommended amount of a mild detergent, or try washing your clothes with white vinegar. [10] X Research source Fragrance-free detergent is likely going to get your clothes cleaner than any scented detergent, even if your clothes don’t smell as fresh! A lightly-scented lemony detergent is probably going to be fine, but that super potent ginger-mango-lavender stuff is probably going to make it harder to get that odor out."

      "title": "You probably aren’t taking them out of the machine fast enough.",
      "content": "You probably aren’t taking them out of the machine fast enough. The longer your damp clothes sit in the washing machine, the more time mildew has to develop in your clothing. When you start a wash cycle, set a timer on your phone that matches the length of the wash cycle so you don’t forget. That way, you can transfer your clothes to the dryer immediately. [11] X Research source Leaving your damp clothes in the washing machine for too long will also cause your washing machine to develop the smell that makes your next load musty."

Unplug the dryer to avoid shocking yourself. Dip a cloth in some soapy water and thoroughly wipe down the drum of your machine. Let it air dry with the door open for a few hours before plugging your dryer back in.

      "content": "Line-drying your clothes should keep mildew from developing. The dryer locks a lot of humidity and moisture into your clothes early on in the dry cycle, but air drying your clothes outside will prevent any mustiness from developing. [13] X Research source The ultraviolet rays from the sun will even help disinfect any of that mildew bacteria. If possible, always line dry your clothes outside for best results! [14] X Research source If it’s too cold out for this or you don’t have the room, then don’t worry about it. So long as you dry your clothes quickly once the wash cycle ends and your washing machine and dryer are clean, you shouldn’t have a problem with this musty smell."

If mildew is caked into an item of clothing and it just seems like it won’t go away regardless of what you do, take your clothes to the dry cleaner.
