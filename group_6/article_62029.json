The order varies for any given year.” —Paul Sweeney “Love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness.” —Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. \"The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.\" —Audrey Hepburn “A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person.” —Mignon McLaughlin “Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.” —Lao Tzu “Marriage is not just spiritual communion, it is also remembering to take out the trash.” —Joyce Brothers \"Love grows more tremendously full, swift, poignant, as the years multiply.\" —Zane Grey “Love seems the swiftest, but it is the slowest of all growths.
