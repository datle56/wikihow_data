The destination language in the link should be set to the actual language of the website. If it’s in English, use “en.” Put this after the “tl” text in the link. Set source language. The source language can be any other language except for the destination language. For instance, you can use “ja” for Japanese. Put this after the “sl” text in the link. Input the site URL. The final piece of the link is the website you want to access. Put the URL of the website after the “u” text in the link. In the example above, this will be https://www.wikihow.com ."
