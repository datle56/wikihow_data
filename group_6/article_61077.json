      "content": "Insert outlet extenders to a sufficient depth for your tile. Since the tile adds additional depth from the wall, the original outlet location will be sunken back from the tile surface. You can use either accordion-style [1] X Research source or box-style [2] X Research source outlet spacers to raise the outlet flush with the tile. The accordion design spacers fold over with 1/8” added for each segment. If the depth of your new tile is 5/8” thick, then you can add five segments to raise the outlet 5/8”. [3] X Research source An outlet box extender is a rectangular ring that fits over and behind the outlet to add additional space between the original outlet box and the outlet. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Reattach the outlet loosely with the spacers in place. Regardless of which type of extender you use, the design has a hole, so you can feed the mounting screw through the extender and back into the outlet box. You won’t tighten it down until after you place your tile. This will also allow you to test if your current screws are long enough to reattach the outlet with the extender in place. You may have to purchase longer screws."

      "content": "Measure the cut you need to make. Depending on the size and placement of your tile up to the outlet, you’ll likely need to make either an L-shaped cut from the corners of four tiles or a U-shaped cut closer to the centers of two. [5] X Research source By attaching the outlet faceplate, you can easily measure the distance between the next closest tile(s) for the length and width up to the faceplate. Since the cut tile needs the faceplate to overlap it, add roughly an additional 1/4” to the measurement—enough so that the tile reaches under the faceplate but not so much that the tile runs into the outlet or mounting screws."

      "content": "Mark those measurements on the tile(s) you need to cut. Since you obviously can’t fit the uncut tile into the space to trace the measurement, you’ll have to copy the measurement onto the tile before cutting. Remember—measure twice, cut once."

Do not attempt to cut the tiles using a snap tile cutter, as this tool cannot make partial cuts. If you haven’t had to cut any tile for the project yet, then you can read Cut Tile for steps how."

After cutting the tiles to fit underneath the faceplate of the electrical outlet, you may still need to cut a small piece away to fit around the screws securing the outlet to the electrical box. Mark the area that needs to be trimmed with a pencil, and use your tile snips to clear away enough material to accommodate each screw."
