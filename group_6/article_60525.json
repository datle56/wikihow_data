      "content": "Plastic is sturdy and an excellent storage option. Plastic containers are affordable and easy to seal, which means that they can keep your fireworks secure for long periods of time. Try to use a lid when storing your fireworks for an extra layer of protection. In a pinch, a plastic tote bag can work as well. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "To protect your fireworks from being tampered with, lock them up. A plastic storage container with a lock works well for this. Even if you can’t lock up your fireworks, be sure to clearly label them. This will let others know to treat your box of fireworks with care. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Storing your fireworks in a cool location keeps them safe.",
      "content": "Storing your fireworks in a cool location keeps them safe. In very hot areas that reach over 130 °F (54 °C), fireworks can ignite. Therefore, try not to keep fireworks in a hot car, attic, or garage if there’s a risk of these places getting extremely hot there. Instead, opt for a cooler location, like a basement.

      "title": "Humidity can ruin fireworks with prolonged exposure.",
      "content": "Humidity can ruin fireworks with prolonged exposure. Although a couple of muggy days aren’t likely to ruin your fireworks, if you live in an area that is very humid (regularly over 50%), it’s best to keep your fireworks inside or in an air-conditioned space. With too much humidity, the gunpowder in your fireworks will collect too much moisture to be able to light. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Open flames and sources of water are fireworks’ worst enemies.",
      "content": "Open flames and sources of water are fireworks’ worst enemies. A firework exposed to an open flame—like any flames from your kitchen, an outdoor barbecue, or a fire pit—can ignite, causing serious damage. Water will render your fireworks unusable, so keep them out of any location where they might be exposed to rain or leaks. [5] X Research source Avoid smoking or using candles near your stored fireworks."

      "content": "It’s unlikely, but refrigerators or freezers could create sparks. During an extreme weather event, such as lightning or power surges, it’s possible that these devices can overload and set nearby fireworks off. Although the chances of this happening are slim, it’s best to be safe and store your fireworks away from any electronic devices. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Keeping your fireworks in one place protects their longevity.",
      "content": "Keeping your fireworks in one place protects their longevity. Moving around your box of fireworks too often can cause the contents within the firework to spill or otherwise fall apart. This can lead to your firework failing to light when you need it. When you’ve found a good place for your fireworks, try not to move them again unless it’s really necessary. [9] X Research source"

Since fireworks will always pose some risk, deciding to dispose of them may be the responsible decision for your property and family. [10] X Research source To dispose of fireworks , soak them in a bucket of water for at least 15 minutes, wrap them in plastic wrap or a plastic bag, then put them in the trash. [11] X Research source If your fireworks came in a brown paper bag, it’s best to dispose of them. These fireworks are meant for professional use, not for households. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "If you have old fireworks gathering dust, get rid of them. Although properly stored fireworks can last for several years, it’s normally best to use them or get rid of them within a couple of years. You can save fireworks for next year, but over several years, the gunpowder inside can become unstable. This might cause them to not ignite the way they’re intended to. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Local laws limit your ability to store fireworks. In the United States, most local communities have their own rules about keeping and lighting fireworks. Your city or state may not allow you to keep fireworks after the 4th of July or other holiday events. Check your local laws to be sure that you can store them in the first place.
