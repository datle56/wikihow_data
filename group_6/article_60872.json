      "content": "Be especially mindful of parvo if you have a puppy. Although parvo can affect older dogs, puppies between 6 and 20 weeks of age are most vulnerable. Parvo is especially serious in puppies because their immune system hasn't fully developed yet. In addition, vaccination may not be fully effective until your puppy is between 14 and 16 weeks old because antibodies in their mother's milk can interfere with the vaccine. [16] X Research source It can be hard to spot the early signs of parvo in a puppy, which unfortunately means the mortality rate can be high for younger dogs. Pay close attention to any changes in their behavior and take them to the vet if you think anything's amiss. [17] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 19 February 2021."

      "title": "Ask your vet to do an ELISA test.",
      "content": "Ask your vet to do an ELISA test. To diagnose parvo, your veterinarian may perform the Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) test. This test checks your dog’s stool for evidence of parvo. It can be done in your veterinarian’s office, and the results typically come back in about 15 minutes. [19] X Research source The ELISA test gives rapid results but can result in false positives. Your vet may recommend further testing, like taking a white blood cell count or sending a sample to a lab. On the other hand, more testing to confirm parvo may not be necessary. Parvo causes severe illness which is managed with supportive care rather than a cure. So, it is not always necessary to run diagnostic tests."

      "content": "Get a white blood count for confirmation. Since ELISA tests sometimes come back with false positives, your vet may also check your dog's white blood cell count. Parvo attacks a dog's bone marrow, so a low white blood cell count is usually a good indicator that your dog has parvo—especially in combination with a positive ELISA test. [20] X Research source"
