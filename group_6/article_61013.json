Consider whether you have other tattoos or want to get more in the future and determine if you’re putting this one in a spot that makes sense with what you want. If you’re unsure about placement, have your artist put the stencil in a few different areas to see what you prefer. Some good placements for a scorpion might be on your arm or leg. If you’re more daring, go for your neck or hands. If you want a tattoo that’s easy to hide when you need to , consider getting it on your ankle, especially if you want a small, fine-line design.

Back and chest pieces are great options for large designs. Go big or go home!"
