[4] X Research source The vet will do a physical exam and ask you about any recent trauma that your cat has undergone. You will need to give them a complete medical history and list of any medications your cat is taking. The vet will try to determine if the problem is due to a problem with the eye or a neurological problem. If they cannot figure out what is wrong, they may send the cat to a ophthalmologist."
