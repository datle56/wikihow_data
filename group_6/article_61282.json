Use one to tune your guitar quickly and easily. [1] X Expert Source Carlos Alonzo Rivera, MA Professional Guitarist Expert Interview. 27 August 2019. Choose a chromatic tuner with a digital display and clip it to the top of your guitar’s headstock. Make sure it doesn’t touch the strings or tuning knobs. [2] X Research source You can purchase a clip-on chromatic guitar tuner for $20-30 on Amazon. This type of tuner works for both electric and acoustic guitars. You can also download a tuning app from the iPhone App Store , or from the Google Play Store on Android devices ."

      "content": "Use your tuner to tune the low E-string (the top string) ½ step down. Turn on your tuner and pluck the top string to confirm that it’s currently turned to E. Then pluck it again and turn the corresponding tuning knob to lower the string’s pitch. [3] X Research source Turn the knob until the display reads D♯ (or E♭). Drop the pitch a little lower, then turn the knob in the other direction to bring the pitch back up to D♯ (or E♭). [4] X Research source D♯ (pronounced “D-sharp”) and E♭ (pronounced “E-flat”) are the same musical note. Most chromatic tuners won’t display flats (notes with the ♭ symbol), and instead only show sharps (notes with the ♯ symbol). Your chromatic tuner will probably show D♯, not E♭, but remember that both of these are correct. Sometimes, the strings on your guitar will stretch as you tune them, causing the pitch to change slightly. To compensate for this, always drop the pitch a little lower than you want, then tune back up to the desired note. If the top E-string wasn’t originally tuned to E, tune it to the correct note first. Then tune it down to D♯ (E♭)."

Then turn the knob in the other direction to raise the pitch back up to G♯ (A♭). [6] X Research source G♯ and A♭ are the same note. Your chromatic tuner will probably display G♯, but both are correct. If the A-string wasn’t tuned correctly to begin with, tune it to A first. Then tune it down to G♯ (A♭)."

[8] X Research source Your tuner will most likely display C♯, but remember that C♯ and D♭ are the same musical note.

Drop the tuning a little lower, then tune it back up to F♯ (G♭). [10] X Research source F♯ and G♭ correspond to the same note, but your tuner will probably show F♯."

Use your chromatic tuner to check the pitch for each string. Use the tuning knobs to adjust their pitches as needed, until all the strings are in tune. [15] X Research source Your strings should be tuned D♯, G♯, C♯, F♯, A♯, D♯ (or E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, B♭, E♭) from lowest to highest. You may need to adjust the tuning several times before all the strings are perfectly in tune."

      "content": "Place a capo (guitar clamp) on the first fret of your guitar. A capo, also known as a guitar clamp, is a device that clamps onto the neck of your guitar, holding all the strings at a specific fret. Place your capo on the top (uppermost) fret of your guitar. This will help you tune your guitar in future steps. [16] X Research source You can buy a guitar capo on Amazon for $7-15, or check your local music shop. When the capo is on the first fret, the low-E string plays an F. Capos are usually used to make a guitar sound higher-pitched. By placing a capo on a specific fret, the player can treat that fret as the lowest notes on each string, allowing them to play higher-pitched chords more easily."

[18] X Research source You can buy a clip-on chromatic guitar tuner on Amazon for $20-30. These work for both electric and acoustic guitars.

[20] X Research source The E2 key is the second-lowest E key on the piano. Press the sustain pedal (the rightmost pedal) to make the note ring out when you release the key. When tuning each guitar string, drop the pitch a little lower than desired, then tune it back up to the correct note. This compensates for stretching or warping that sometimes occurs when the strings are adjusted, which can make them go out of tune."

If you play chords with conventional finger positions, they’ll automatically sound ½ step lower. [22] X Research source You can now play songs that require drop-down tuning. For example, you can play a song in the key of D♯ minor using the same finger positions as you normally would for E minor. Remember that D♯ and E♭ are the same note—that is, ½ a step below E is the same as ½ step above D. This also means that D♯ minor and E♭ minor are the same keys."
