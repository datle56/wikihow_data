      "title": "Get a good grip on the basketball.",
      "content": "Get a good grip on the basketball. Hold the ball balanced on the tops of the thumb, pointer, and middle finger of your shooting hand. This will allow you to generate power in your shot. Cradle the ball with your non-shooting hand so it’s supported. [1] X Research source The palm of your shooting hand should not be touching the ball. The tips of your fingers will allow the ball to spin when it’s released, which generates more power."

      "title": "Position your feet so they’re under your hips.",
      "content": "Position your feet so they’re under your hips. Your feet need to be hip-width apart in order to generate power in your jump shot. Whether you’re dribbling or you were just passed the ball, if you’re going to take a long shot, make sure your feet are properly aligned. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Take a moment to align your feet before you shoot. Don’t position your feet so they’re shoulder-width or wider apart or you won’t transfer as much upward energy when you take your shot. To get a little more power, try stepping into your jump shot with a hop. That will help you build momentum for your jump [3] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview. 9 March 2021."

      "title": "Bend your knees to lower your body down more than a normal shot.",
      "content": "Bend your knees to lower your body down more than a normal shot. Close range shots and three-point shots require you to slightly bend your knees so you can add some power to your shot. To shoot a far shot, you need to bend them even more so you can lower your body down and allow your legs to put more force into the shot. [4] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview. 9 March 2021. [5] X Research source Keep your back flat and straight when you bend your knees. Don’t lean over when you lower down."

      "content": "Jump as high as you can to increase the range of your shot. While you may use a slight jump for three-point shots and layups, you need to use your whole body to add enough power to make a far shot. Once you’ve lowered yourself into position, burst up with your legs to jump as high as you can. [6] X Research source The key to shooting far comes from the power generated by your legs in the shot."

      "title": "Release the ball on the way up in your jump shot.",
      "content": "Release the ball on the way up in your jump shot. Use one motion to shoot a long shot. When you jump up to shoot, don’t wait until you’re at the peak of your jump to let the ball go. Instead, release the ball as you’re traveling up after you jump. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Shoot the ball just before you reach the top of your jump. If you wait too long to release the ball you won’t be able to use your full momentum to shoot further."

      "title": "Start your shot path at a lower position to generate power.",
      "content": "Start your shot path at a lower position to generate power. The shot path refers to the trajectory of your basketball shot. It’s common for players to start their shot path around their chin level. For a longer shot, start your shot path so the ball is level with your chest. [8] X Research source This will allow you to give more push and power when you shoot the ball. A lower shot path makes it easier for a defender to potentially block the shot, so be sure you have an open shot when you’re shooting far."

      "title": "Keep your elbow low when you’re starting your shot.",
      "content": "Keep your elbow low when you’re starting your shot. To generate more power as you’re starting your shot, bring your elbow low rather than flaring it out to start the shot path at a lower position. The top of your shot, or when you release the ball, will still look the same, but keeping your elbow low at the beginning will allow you to use your entire body in the shot. [9] X Research source As you reach the top of your jump shot, your can push your elbow forward to add more power."

      "title": "Do full-body weight training to increase your overall strength.",
      "content": "Do full-body weight training to increase your overall strength. Don’t focus on individual muscles like your biceps or calves. Instead, use compound movements like the overhead press or pull-up to increase your strength across multiple muscular groups. Do 2-3 full-body weight training sessions a week. [10] X Research source Shooting a long-range shot requires strength and power and lifting weights will build up your muscles. If you’re new to weight training, start off slow and use lighter weights to reduce the risk of injury."

      "title": "Use deadlifts and squats to improve your leg power.",
      "content": "Use deadlifts and squats to improve your leg power. Place a barbell with weights across your back, position your feet so they’re shoulder-width apart, lower yourself down until your thighs are parallel to the ground, then push yourself up to perform a squat. To do a deadlift, put weighted plates on a barbell, stand over it, squat down to grip the bar, then stand up keeping your chest up and your back straight. [11] X Research source Aim for 3 sets of 5-6 repetitions. Try to do squats and deadlifts at least once a week. You can improve your leg strength and power by focusing on weighted squats and deadlifts. If you’re new to deadlifts and squats, use low weights and focus on doing the correct form. When you get used to the technique, add more weights to build up your leg muscles."

      "title": "Take 500 long shots a day to increase your wrist and forearm strength.",
      "content": "Take 500 long shots a day to increase your wrist and forearm strength. To really improve your long-range shooting accuracy, you need to have strong wrists and forearms. You can build these muscles while also improving your shooting ability by taking 500 shots at the goal every day. [12] X Research source Shoot from different distances to work on your accuracy and range. You may need to work up to shooting 500 shots if you’re not used to it. If your wrist starts to hurt before you reach 500, stop shooting so you don’t injure yourself. You can always try to do more the next day!"

      "title": "Shoot a heavy ball to boost your shot power.",
      "content": "Shoot a heavy ball to boost your shot power. A weighted or heavy ball that is twice the weight of a regulation ball will train you to be able to shoot further. Take shots with a heavy ball, then drop back down to using a regulation weight basketball to improve your shooting strength. [13] X Research source Shoot away from the basket, around the free-throw line to work on your range. Don’t shoot a heavy ball if you have a shoulder or wrist injury."

      "title": "Practice half-court pull-up shots to get used to shooting far.",
      "content": "Practice half-court pull-up shots to get used to shooting far. A pull-up shot is when you dribble the ball and stop abruptly to take a jump shot. Start past the half-court line and dribble towards the goal. Stop when you reach the line and take the long shot to the goal. Practice this drill to improve your ability to take long shots in a game. [14] X Research source Try doing pull-up shots from different long distances on the court. Pull-up shots are often done at the end of a game to get a last-second score."
