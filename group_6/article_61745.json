Microwaves may have different installation instructions, so it’s important to read the owner’s manual to make sure you set yours up correctly. Reading the owner’s manual will also help you get familiar with your microwave’s unique features and settings."

      "content": "Place the microwave on a flat, dry surface. A clean counter in your kitchen or a solid, wooden table are good locations for your microwave. Do not put the microwave near a gas or electric range, such as your stove. Make sure the microwave’s air vents on one side are not being blocked."

      "content": "Plug the microwave into a 20-amp grounded wall outlet. Make sure the outlet is rated for 20 A, which will ensure it is safe to use to power the microwave. Plug the microwave's power cord directly into a grounded outlet. [1] X Research source Pick an outlet that is not already being used by another appliance or electronic device. Don’t use an adapter or an extension cord when plugging in your microwave. Using extension cords with cooking appliances creates a fire hazard. [2] X Research source Note that a microwave from one country may not work or become damaged in another country. In the Americas and Japan, the outlets are usually rated for 110 V 60 Hz. In Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world, the outlets are usually rated for 220 V 50 Hz."

Sometimes, the symbol will also include an image of a microwave or the word “micro” at the bottom. [4] X Research source If you see any variation of this symbol on a plate, bowl, mug, or Tupperware, it’s safe to heat your food in it. There are a few things you should never put in your microwave. These include: Aluminum foil Metal or stainless steel dishware or silverware Styrofoam Single-use plastics and takeout containers [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose the setting, power level, and cooking time for your food.",
      "content": "Choose the setting, power level, and cooking time for your food. You should see buttons numbered 1-9 on the front of the microwave—use these numbers to enter in your desired cooking time. You should also see buttons for different cooking methods, such as defrosting or reheating, as well as buttons with pre-set cooking times for specific foods like popcorn. If you see a specific button for the type of food you're cooking, you can press it instead of entering the cooking time manually. Depending on what you’re cooking, you may also need to adjust the microwave’s power level using the designated button. Most foods won’t require you to adjust the power level, but there are a few instances when it’s a good idea to do this. For example: When reheating foods that can’t be stirred (lasagna, potatoes, etc), lower the power to 50% to make sure it cooks through evenly. When softening butter or melting chocolate, lower the power to 50% to make sure you don’t overheat them. When heating liquid foods like soups or sauces, lower the power to 50% to prevent splattering. [6] X Research source When defrosting food, lower the power to anywhere between 20% to 50%, depending on the instructions on the package of the item you’re defrosting. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Start the microwave and let your food cook. Press the “start” button, and wait for the microwave to finish cooking your food. When it’s done, it will shut off automatically, and many models will also play a short alarm sound to alert you that your food is ready. Be careful when removing your food from the microwave—it will be hot! Use protective oven mitts, or wait a few minutes for it to cool down."

      "title": "Use the “defrost button.”",
      "content": "Use the “defrost button.” Many microwave ovens have a designated “Defrost” button that you can use to thaw frozen foods . The defrost setting usually sets your microwave to 30% power so that the food will gently thaw but not cook. Just make sure to remove the frozen food from its package and place it in a microwave-safe dish before putting it in the microwave. [8] X Research source This speeds up and simplifies the cooking process since you’ll only need to wait a few minutes for the food to defrost in the microwave rather than waiting several hours for it to defrost on the counter or in the fridge. Once the food is fully defrosted, move on to the next step of the cooking process. For example, if you defrosted frozen vegetables to use in a stir fry, add the defrosted vegetables to your pan and start cooking them."

Depending on the food you’re thawing, you may need to lower the power level to anywhere from 20%-50%, then enter the specific amount of cooking time. Be sure to check the package of your frozen foods; they’ll likely have instructions for what power level to use and how long to defrost the food for. [9] X Research source"

Piling food in the middle of a plate or bowl will cause the food on the edge of the plate to heat up faster than the food towards the center of the plate.

You can use a thick, domed cover made of durable plastic that is designed for use in the microwave, or microwave-safe plastic cling wrap. [12] X Research source A plastic cover will also help to keep steam in as you warm up the food, making it less likely to dry out while cooking. You can also use a paper towel over the food in a pinch."

      "content": "When reheating foods, warm them in short intervals. It can be tricky to know how long to warm up cooked food in the microwave, so it’s important to start slowly to avoid overcooking it or drying it out. Start by heating the food for one minute, then take it out of the microwave and check it to see if it is warm enough for you. Stir the food, look for steam, and taste it to see if it is warm enough. [13] X Research source If the food is not warm enough for you, put it in for another 30 seconds to one minute. Continue heating the food in intervals of 30 seconds to one minute until it is warm enough."

      "content": "Heat certain foods separately so they do not become soggy or dry. Depending on what you are reheating, you may need to deconstruct your leftovers and warm up different foods separately. Heat dense items first, such as meats, as they take longer to warm up. Then, add less dense items like cooked pasta or vegetables to the plate and warm them up. [14] X Research source For example, if you are reheating a burger, put the patty on a plate and heat it in the microwave separately, then add it to the bun. Microwaving a burger with the bun will make it soggy."
