      "content": "A moon chart is similar to a birth chart, except the moon and planet placements are shifted. Your moon chart and birth chart will look very similar, but the position of the moon and planets will be different. This means you see planetary placement from an emotional perspective. For instance, the moon chart can show you where you may find happiness or luck in life. [1] X Research source Some astrologers argue that the moon is more important than either the sun or ascendant sign since it represents everything that's happening in your life. The moon governs the emotions and moods that rule the mind. In the moon chart used in Vedic astrology, the moon sign is used as the first house—instead of the rising sign—to determine the house placements of your planets. A moon chart delves more deeply into how you perceive events and how they make you feel as opposed to what the events are."

      "content": "Shift your moon and planets if you want to manually adjust your chart. If you'd rather make your own moon chart, you'll need your Vedic birth chart . It's a lot easier if you have a blank chart that you can fill in, too. Place the moon in the first house on your empty moon chart. Then, find the moon on your birth chart. Count how many houses you had to move it and then move each planet counterclockwise by that same amount. [3] X Research source For instance, if your moon is in the Ninth House on your birth chart, you'll move it 4 places to place it in the ascendant or First House. Then, for instance, if you have Venus in the First House, you'd shift it 4 places, so it's in the Fifth House. Repeat this for every planet."

If your moon is in a chart with positive planets and supportive houses, you can enjoy happiness, great social skills, and physical attraction. You'll probably find that it's easy for you to accomplish your goals and find success. [5] X Research source For instance, if you have Venus in the Twelfth House, it's a benefic planet, so it will provide support. As another example, if you have a benefic planet like Jupiter in the Second House, the house of wealth, it will give you resources. If you have a benefic planet in the Seventh House, the house of love, it will give you luck in that area."

      "content": "Recognize the challenges from malefic placements in your moon chart. Malefic planets are planets that cause challenges in your life. If malefic planets are placed in houses that should be supporting the moon, you may struggle, become anxious, or feel depressed. Keep in mind that if you have malefic planets in favorable houses, they're not necessarily bad. It just means that these areas won't be as easy or harmonious.Here are the planets and a few placements to watch out for: Malefic planets: Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu. Challenging placements: Malefic planets in the 5th or 9th Houses suggest troubles with your personality. For instance, Mars in the 9th House could make you come across as reckless or aggressive."
