      "content": "Fasting resets and reinvigorates your spirit. Medically, fasting can improve blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight loss. On a spiritual level, reducing what you consume for a set amount of time can help reset the body and soul. Consuming less allows you to meditate on your current state, repent your sins , and remember that your body is a temple of the Lord. [1] X Research source Jesus explains the importance of fasting to His disciples in Mark 2:18-22 by saying, “No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse. And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined.” [2] X Research source In this allegory, the wineskin represents your body and the wine your spirit. Fasting repairs your old wineskin or body to prepare it for God’s word."

      "content": "Controlling when you eat can empower your spirit. Typically, when you religiously fast, you control what and how much you eat and/or drink within a set time frame. Doing this is said to give you strength over physical hunger, cravings, and wants, opening your mind, body, and spirit to God’s will. [3] X Research source Psalm 42:1 reads, “As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God.” [4] X Research source With this, the Psalmist realizes that they need God more than food and that God Himself is the sustainer of life."

      "title": "When you fast, you have more energy to be thankful.",
      "content": "When you fast, you have more energy to be thankful. Pushing personal desires aside, some believe a new desire for self-reflection and appreciation opens up. [5] X Research source Your body is a marvelous creation of God, and He can nourish your spirit with His word. Now is the time to practice gratitude and thank Him for all He’s done for you. As Psalm reminds you, “Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name” (Psalm 100:4) and, “I remember the days of long ago; I meditate on all your works and consider what you hands have done” (Psalm 143:5). Take this gratitude practice with you after fasting by praying before a meal to offer the Lord your thanks."

      "title": "Fasting lets you humble yourself in the eyes of God.",
      "content": "Fasting lets you humble yourself in the eyes of God. Many Christians believe fasting is a biblical way to show God that He is their almighty ruler. When you fast, you give up something important to you, whether that’s eating meat, smoking, or drinking. Sacrificing this desire and resisting temptation proves your spiritual loyalty. [6] X Research source As King David said in Psalm 35:13, “I humbled myself with fasting.”"

      "title": "Fasting allows you to turn designated meal times into moments of prayer.",
      "content": "Fasting allows you to turn designated meal times into moments of prayer. Life is full of hustle and bustle, and it may be hard to find quiet moments throughout the day to pray and talk to the Lord. Use your religious fast to spend quality time with yourself and God. For instance, when you’d normally sit down for dinner, open your Bible and lose yourself in the Lord’s word. Like Philippians 4:6 says, “Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.” [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Minimizing distractions can help you hear God’s holy message.",
      "content": "Minimizing distractions can help you hear God’s holy message. The world is full of distractions and temptations. By fasting, you detox the spirit, canceling out the desire for food and opening your mind to God’s word. Meditate and pray —God may have a special message just for you. [8] X Research source In the New Testament, the prophetess Anna is praised for praying and fasting regularly: “She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem” (Luke 2:37-38). [9] X Research source Open your mind to the Lord’s message by praying before bed . This is a great way to connect with God and tell Him about your day."

      "title": "Finishing a fast reminds you that you can do hard things.",
      "content": "Finishing a fast reminds you that you can do hard things. Many express that finishing a religious fast helps them feel more connected with their community, God, and themselves. [10] X Research source You’ve fought temptation and your own desires to be a better server of Christ, and that deserves some praise. If you can fast, you can do anything in the name of the Lord. Remember, even after a fast, that God’s spirit is the most satisfying and nutritious thing for your soul. As Jesus said, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.” [11] X Research source"
