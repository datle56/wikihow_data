      "content": "Look for a handgrip dynamometer. Using a handgrip dynamometer is one of the most conventional and accurate ways to test your grip strength. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Find or purchase one of these so you can test your grip strength. [4] X Research source The first place to look for a dynamometer is at your local gym or fitness center. Many gyms have a variety of tools to measure progress, and a dynamometer is a common device to have. If your gym doesn't have one, consider looking online or in a fitness or sporting goods store to purchase one. You can use it regularly to track your grip strength over time."

      "title": "Position your arm and hand correctly.",
      "content": "Position your arm and hand correctly. Although using a handgrip dynamometer is fairly easy, it's important to make sure you position your arm and hand correctly for the most accurate results. [5] X Research source Start by holding the dynamometer in one hand. You'll test both hands, but you can only test one at a time. Bend the arm that's being tested at a 90 degree angle at the elbow. Your upper arm should be next to your body with your forearm pointing away from your body. The base of the dynamometer should rest on the heel of your hand (or the muscle right under your thumb). Your four fingers should rest on the lever of the dynamometer."

      "title": "Squeeze the dynamometer with maximal effort.",
      "content": "Squeeze the dynamometer with maximal effort. In order to get an accurate reading, you need to squeeze this tool with as much force and effort as you can. [6] X Research source This will give you your maximum grip strength. When your arm and hand are positioned correctly, begin squeezing the dynamometer as hard as you can. Keep squeezing for at least 5 seconds. Have a stopwatch or friend time you for 5 seconds. Do not move any other body parts while you're squeezing as this can influence the reading on the dynamometer. For the most accurate results, take an average of 3 tests."

      "title": "Analyze your results.",
      "content": "Analyze your results. After you've performed the test on each hand and have found an average of your results, you can score yourself to see where you are compared to standards. According to research, average grip strength ranges from 72-103 lbs for men and 44-68 lbs for women, depending on age. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Research has also defined weak grip strength as less than 57 lbs for men and less than 35 lbs for women. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If youâ€™re scoring in the lower ranges, you can take steps to improve. You may want to consider adding in exercises to help strengthen your grip."

      "title": "Get the right equipment.",
      "content": "Get the right equipment. If you can't find a handgrip dynamometer, you can still test your grip strength at home or at the gym. Using a few household items, you can easily find a fairly accurate reading. You need to make sure you have all the right equipment on hand. You'll need a bathroom scale, a pull-up bar or hanging board, and a stopwatch. Position the scale right underneath your pull-up bar or board. These should be high enough that your arms will be fully extended above your head. You want to test your grip strength for a 5 second time period. Set your stopwatch to 5 seconds or have a friend monitor their watch. To get in the right position, stand on the scale and place your hands on the pull-up bar or board. Look at the scale to make sure the weight reading is accurate."

      "title": "Squeeze the bar with maximal effort.",
      "content": "Squeeze the bar with maximal effort. To test your grip strength with a bathroom scale, you'll want to see how much weight you can carry just by squeezing your hands. [9] X Research source While standing with your feet flat on the scale, squeeze your hands around the pull-up bar or the side of the hangboard. Squeeze the bar as hard as you can with your hands, but don't bend your elbows, wrists or knees. Your entire body aside from your hands should remain stable. You want to lift as much of your body weight off the scale as you can using only your grip strength. Have a friend record what the new weight reading is on the scale. It will be less than your actual body weight. Again, it's recommended to take an average of these readings. Do three to five tests and then take the average of these results."

      "title": "Calculate your grip strength.",
      "content": "Calculate your grip strength. Once you've noted your current weight and the averages from the tests, you can calculate your grip strength. Follow this simple equation: Your grip strength in pounds = your current weight - your weight while gripping the bar. [10] X Research source For example 180 pounds current weight - 80 pounds while gripping the bar = 100 pounds of grip strength. Record this result and continue to track your grip strength using this same method over time. This will help you see any improvements after practicing strengthening exercises."

      "title": "Do hand extensions.",
      "content": "Do hand extensions. To help increase your grip strength, try incorporating exercises like hand extensions into your regular exercise routine. [11] X Research source This exercise is not really a grip exercise, but it will strengthen the muscles that help to give you a strong grip. You can either use a thick rubber band (or multiple rubber bands) or get a professional tool that helps you perform this exercise. To use the rubber bands, pull the rubber band down over your hand so that it's resting near the base of your fingers. In a slow and controlled way, spread your fingers and thumbs out away from your palm. They should be pushing against the rubber band. Hold your fingers and thumbs as long as you can against the pressure of the rubber band. Repeat a few times on each hand. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a hand gripper. Another great exercise to try is squeezing a hand gripper. You will need to get a gripper, which is a handheld device that you squeeze with one hand at a time. Squeezing a gripper will help strengthen your grip by working the muscles in your hand. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Hold on to a gripper in each hand or work one hand at a time. Wrap your entire hand around the handles. Make sure the grippers have a plastic coating to help make this exercise comfortable. Squeeze the handles and hold this squeeze for as long as you can. Repeat a few reps with each hand."

      "title": "Incorporate plate pinches.",
      "content": "Incorporate plate pinches. Another great exercise to strengthen the muscles in your palms are plate pinches. [14] X Research source Grab a few conventional weighted plates to get started on this exercise. Stand and place a 10 pound plate on the ground in front of you, with one side resting on your calf. Squat down and pinch the plate, placing four fingers on the outside of the plate and your thumb on the inside. Raise up from your squat while pinching the plate, and hold it in the air for 10-15 seconds. Squat back down to place the plate back on the floor. Repeat 10-20 times on each side. When you feel yourself getting stronger, you can increase the weight of the plates. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Squeeze wide barbells.",
      "content": "Squeeze wide barbells. If you have barbells that have a wider circumference than the standard barbells, these are a great tool to help improve your grip strength as well. [16] X Research source Improving your grip strength with a fat or wide barbell is easy and simple to do. Grab one of these barbells with both hands and squeeze as tight as you can. Your fingers and thumbs should not be able to touch when your fist is clasped around the bar. To make this exercise more difficult, add plates to either side of the bar. Your goal should be to hold this bar for at least 1 minute and repeat for 1 or 2 more sets."
