      "title": "Take a sip when...",
      "content": "Take a sip when... Choose 5-7 items from the following list and take a sip of your drink every time one of them happens in the movie. Some of these things happen a ton throughout the film, so make sure you pace yourself with small sips. Take a sip whenever… Edward or Bella smiles awkwardly. Bella blinks rapidly. Bella gets hurt. Edward and Bella stare silently at each other. Bella touches her hair. Charlie looks incredibly uncomfortable. Bella stammers or stutters. Edward smiles his signature “crooked” smile. Edward looks confused or like he hates himself. Bella bites her lip. Bella looks longingly off into the distance. James cocks his head to one side. Anyone mentions Arizona. Bella calls one of her parents by their first name. Bella trips over. Any vampire hisses like a stray cat. Edward acts stalkerish or possessive and Bella thinks it’s romantic. Someone says the words “vampire” or “werewolf.” Bella says “Edward” or Edward says “Bella.” A car or truck door is slammed shut. You see Bella’s red truck. Bella does a voiceover. A montage scene happens. Mike tries to flirt with Bella or is mad about her dating Edward. A vampire uses their vampire powers. The werewolves and the vampires act hostile towards each other."

      "title": "Take 2 sips when...",
      "content": "Take 2 sips when... These rules happen a little less often throughout the movie, so it might help to call some of these out to your friends when you see them so you can all take 2 drinks together. We recommend choosing 2 or 3 from this list so they’re extra special when they happen. Take 2 drinks whenever... Edward catches Bella when she falls. Bella swoons over Edward’s beauty. Jacob takes his shirt off. Someone mentions how pale someone else is. The werewolves transform into humans or wolves. A muse song plays. Jasper looks like Edward Scissorhands. Alice uses her powers of premonition to save everyone. Rosalie looks at Bella judgmentally or angrily. Emmett tells a joke. Someone says the word “monkey.” A character shows a police badge. You laugh at something that happens."

      "title": "Finish your drink when...",
      "content": "Finish your drink when... These rules are a little more obvious than the others, but they happen only a couple of times throughout the movie. Choose only 1 or 2 of these to add to your rules for the night. For an extra challenge, you might chug while some of the longer scenes are happening (like when a vampire is sparkling) and stop when they’re over. Finish your drink when... Any vampire sparkles. Edward and Jacob fight over Bella. Someone is killed unexpectedly. Bella makes a really bad decision. Someone calls Edward a “monster.” Someone mentions the Volturi. You cringe at any point."

      "title": "Drink lighter alcoholic beverages or go all out with vampire-themed drinks.",
      "content": "Drink lighter alcoholic beverages or go all out with vampire-themed drinks. This drinking game can get intense, especially if you choose a lot of rules to follow. Try to stick to drinks that have a lower alcohol content, like beer or wine, and have plenty of snacks on hand so you can make it to the end! To be on-theme, try making some of these tasty blood-themed drinks for your friends: [1] X Research source Try a Sangria or make a Bloody Mary to add a little more bloody fun to your night. Enjoy a Bloody Vampire cocktail made with vodka, gin, cherry vodka or liqueur, grenadine, and club soda (soda water). [2] X Research source Make a blood-red Vampire’s Kiss cocktail recipe made with vodka, raspberry liqueur, champagne, and frozen raspberries. [3] X Research source Or, make a \"Team Edward\" version of the Vampire’s Kiss with ginger spiced whiskey, black raspberry liqueur, pomegranate juice, and fresh-squeezed lime. [4] X Research source For extra vampire-themed fun, put your preferred drinks into these fake hospital blood bags ."
