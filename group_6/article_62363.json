While most pillows are machine washable, some might require dry clean or spot cleaning only, as either the fabric or the pillow’s filling will degrade in the wash. [1] X Expert Source Safir Ali Professional Dry Cleaner Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Generally, you can launder down and polyester pillows. Avoid laundering foam, latex, or bamboo pillows. Before you pop it in the wash, make sure your pillow doesn’t have a symbol of a basin of water with a hand in it. This symbol indicates that the pillow is hand-wash only. This applies to most foam pillows. Similarly, a basin of water with an “X” through it indicates that you should never wash the pillow yourself. Take it to a dry cleaner instead. [2] X Research source Washing a pillow contrary to the care tag may void any warranties, or could even release toxins, in the case of some foam pillows."
