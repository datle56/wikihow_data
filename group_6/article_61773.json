Then, place the bottom section inside of the band, pulling the spring closed to lock the two pieces together.

This locking mechanism makes it easier to remove the baked goods later on and create a smooth, straight, and elegant edge."

This will make removing your cake or tart off the pan easier when you cut it for serving. Professional baker Maria Short suggests that you “trace around the bottom of the pan” to cut out your parchment form. [4] X Expert Source Maria Short Baker Expert Interview. 18 October 2022. You can also buy pre-cut parchment paper circles if you plan on using your springform pan a lot. You can also lay a sheet of parchment paper on top of the bottom piece of the springform pan, latch both pieces together, and then cut away the excess. [5] X Research source"

Springform pans are most famous for their use in cheesecake recipes, but they can be a handy tool for more delicate desserts that you don’t want to flip and jostle out of a pan.

Let it cool for at least 10–20 minutes. This will give the baked item a chance to set, and prevent the food from sticking to the edge of the pan. [7] X Research source If you’re making cheesecake, you’ll need to refrigerate the cake in the pan before you undo the latch and remove the mold. [8] X Research source"

That’s because darker materials tend to soak in extra light and heat. [15] X Research source The same logic applies to darker pans—since they collect more heat, it’s easy for your baked goods (especially the crust) to get a little too crispy. [16] X Research source"

Some cheesecake recipes may request that your cake be baked in a water bath to help it get the proper texture. However, it can be easy for water from the bath to leak into the cheesecake itself.
