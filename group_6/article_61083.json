      "content": "Tinder contact cards include the necessary info for you to contact a match outside of the Tinder app. You can only send or receive contact cards in messages with people you've matched with. So you can't send a contact card to a missed match, unfortunately. Tinder contact cards are like dating app business cards. They include a brief blurb with contact options, including space for a phone number and social media accounts. The point of these cards is so you can continue messaging with people outside of Tinder, like on Facebook or Snapchat. The information on the card can include your Instagram username, phone number, Facebook, Snapchat, WhatsApp, KakaoTalk, Kik, Line, WeChat, and VKtchatalk. Contact Cards aren't available in every region, so you might not have the ability to send or look at them."
