      "title": "Wear cropped pants that end between your calf and ankle.",
      "content": "Wear cropped pants that end between your calf and ankle. Most cropped pants are known as ankle pants, capris, or “clamdiggers.” These pants are designed to hit you below mid-calf, where your lower leg begins to narrow. This is the most attractive part of your lower leg, and you should use your cropped pants to draw attention to it. [1] X Research source Cropped pants should not end at mid-calf, which is the thickest part of your lower leg. This is the least flattering part of your leg’s profile and not what you want to emphasize."

      "title": "Wear cropped pants that fall above your ankle.",
      "content": "Wear cropped pants that fall above your ankle. As a rule of thumb, even the longest cropped pants should fall no less than about 2 fingers above your ankle bone. This differentiates cropped pants from typical trousers. The shorter hemline not only allows you to show off your ankle, it’s also perfect for having fun with your shoes!"

      "title": "Choose slim-fit if you have short legs.",
      "content": "Choose slim-fit if you have short legs. Petite women with shorter legs have a harder time picking the right cropped pants than tall women. Cropped pants can make short women look even shorter by causing their legs to look stubby. A slim-fit leg with either a tapered or straight fit will create a sleek look that avoids the stub effect. [2] X Research source If you want to go with a wider leg and you’re a shorter person, try pairing these types of pants with a tucked-in top and heels. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Go with high-waisted pants to make your legs look longer.",
      "content": "Go with high-waisted pants to make your legs look longer. Even for taller women, the biggest drawback of cropped pants is their shortening effect. Choosing a pant that cinches above your waistline can combat this problem at the other side of your leg. These may be some of the most flattering options for women of all heights. [4] X Research source Pair high-waisted pants with a tucked-in shirt to maximize the lengthening effect of these options. Pay careful attention to the fit of high-waisted pants. They shouldn’t be uncomfortable to wear when you’re sitting or standing, and they shouldn’t pinch you when you button them up. You may need to take these pants to a tailor to get the perfect fit around your waist and groin area."

      "title": "Choose mid-rise cropped pants if you have a short torso.",
      "content": "Choose mid-rise cropped pants if you have a short torso. If you have long legs and a short torso, you may be more worried about the top part of your silhouette. To balance the proportion of your legs and torso, pick mid-rise pants pants that sit right at your waistline. This will prevent your pants from looking like they’ve swallowed your upper body.

      "title": "Use heels or a pointed-toe flat to draw attention to your ankle.",
      "content": "Use heels or a pointed-toe flat to draw attention to your ankle. Cropped pants let you show off your footwear with their above-the-ankle cut. Heels and pointed-toe flats are some of cropped pants’ best pairings. These shoes elongate shortened legs while also accentuating the wearer’s ankle.
