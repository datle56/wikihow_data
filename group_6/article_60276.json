      "content": "In the Bible, faith is trusting God’s power unconditionally. Faith is the act of having great trust or confidence in someone or something. [1] X Research source Religiously, this refers to a belief and unwavering trust in the Lord. For instance, when someone has faith, they believe and trust God’s word and love for them. [2] X Research source They don’t need proof of God’s power—they believe it’s there no matter what. As Hebrews 11:1 states, “Now faith is the confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.” [3] X Research source Think of spiritual or biblical faith as swinging on a rope and jumping into a body of water. Faith is letting go of the rope and trusting that you’ll land in the water, whether that’s by God or another divine power’s hand.The term “faith” appears in the Bible around 460 times and is often used to describe instances when God Himself can’t be seen: “For we live by faith, not by sight” (2 Corinthians 5:7). [4] X Research source “Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ” (Romans 10:17). [5] X Research source “Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised” (Romans 4:20-21).

      "content": "Faith focuses on the present, while hope focuses on the future. When you have faith, you have trust in the present moment; when you have hope, you trust what’s to come.

      "title": "Faith is trusting something's true, while belief is knowing something's true.",
      "content": "Faith is trusting something's true, while belief is knowing something's true. While faith and belief can go hand in hand, they’re not the same thing. Faith is having steadfast and unconditional trust in someone or something without knowing if it’s real or not. Meanwhile, belief is the knowledge that someone or something is real. [11] X Research source In Christianity, a strong belief doesn’t necessarily constitute faith; as James 2:19 says, “You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.” [12] X Research source You can believe in God, but if you don’t trust and follow His word unconditionally, you likely don’t have faith."
