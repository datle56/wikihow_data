      "content": "Make sure the previous run cycle is finished. If the door opens in the middle of a run cycle, it interrupts the cycle. If the door isn't all the way closed, it will prevent the previous cycle from completing, and the dishwasher won't drain. Make sure the door is completely closed, and press the Start button to continue the cycle."

      "content": "Run the garbage disposal. If the garbage disposal won't run, debris may be blocking it from turning on, affecting your dishwasher's drainage. Run the disposal for a few moments to clear out blockages. If that disposal remains clogged, check the hoses and pipes connected to it for blockages."

      "content": "An improperly installed garbage disposal can affect dishwasher drainage. If you started having problems with your Whirlpool dishwasher after installing a new garbage disposal, the disposal may not be properly connected to the drainpipe, or the hose may not be connected to the dishwasher or air gap. Ensure the knockout plug inside the drain tube that connects to your dishwasher or air gap has been removed. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the drain for blockages.",
      "content": "Check the drain for blockages. Most modern dishwashers have a removable filter located inside the dishwasher. You'll first need to remove any standing water in the dishwasher. Remove the drain filters and strainers at the bottom of the dishwasher. If they are dirty, rinse them off in the sink. Also, check for clogs in the opening leading to the drain hose below the filters. Appliance repair expert Gevorg Grigorian explains, \"We find a lot of glass, lemon seeds, just food particles, even the fine paper or plastic wrappers from Mason jars or bottles can obstruct the flow of the water draining out of the dishwasher to your sink.\""

      "title": "Clean the air gap.",
      "content": "Clean the air gap. The air gap—the cylinder fitting that sticks up above your sink and is connected to your dishwasher and garbage disposal—prevents wastewater from flowing back into the dishwasher. If it is clogged, your dishwasher won't be able to drain properly. To clean the air gap, remove the cover and use a long-handled bottle brush to remove food particles from the tubing. Grigorian, our expert, notes that the tip of the air gap, which is very accessible to any novice or customer, is where you'll typically find the debris."

      "content": "Check for obstructions in the drain hose. You will need to remove the bottom panel from the dishwasher to do this. You may need to unscrew the screws mounting the dishwasher under the cabinet and slide it out. Remove it from both the drain pump motor and garbage disposal or air gap, and inspect both ends for clogs and kinks. Warning: Water may leak when detaching the hose. Make sure you have something to catch the water in."

      "title": "Check the drain pump impeller for obstructions.",
      "content": "Check the drain pump impeller for obstructions. The impeller is the rotating part of the motor that pushes water through the drain hose. Remove the motor from the bottom of the dishwasher and check to make sure the impeller can rotate freely. Check inside the chamber where the impeller sits for pieces of glass or obstructions preventing it from turning. Warning: To avoid electrical shock, ensure the dishwasher is unplugged or disconnected at the breaker before attempting to repair your dishwasher."

      "title": "Check the solenoid valve.",
      "content": "Check the solenoid valve. Some dishwashers have a solenoid valve that prevents water from entering the dishwasher after it has drained. If the valve becomes jammed close, water will not drain. Check to make sure nothing is keeping the solenoid valve closed. Disconnect the wires attached to the solenoid valve, and use a multimeter to test the resistance. Set the meter's resistance to R x 1. [2] X Research source You can order a new drain solenoid from Amazon, an appliance parts retailer, or Whirlpool's website. Make sure you get the correct part for your model. To replace the solenoid valve, detach the wires from the old solenoid kit and remove the plunger from the inside, as well as the retaining arm and spring. Secure the new solenoid kit with screws and reinsert the plunger. Attach the retaining arm to the plunger, then attach the spring to the retaining arm and reconnect the wires. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Check the drain pump motor. If you can't hear the motor running during the drain cycle, or the motor is making a slight buzz, the motor may need to be replaced. You can use a multimeter to test the motor for continuity. If there is no continuity, the motor needs to be replaced. [4] X Research source You can order a new drain pump motor from Amazon, an appliance parts retailer, or directly from Whirlpool. You'll need to detach the drain hose and the wires connected to the motor. Some motors may be screwed into place, but others you can twist on or off. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "A failed control board will prevent the dishwasher from draining. If you replace the motor and the dishwasher still isn't draining, it could be that the control board is not powering the motor. You will either need to replace the control board or replace the dishwasher. You can order a new control board from Amazon, an appliance parts retailer, or directly from Whirlpool's website and replace it yourself, but you may want to contact a professional. The main control board is behind the front panel on the dishwasher door. You will need to remove the front panel to access it. Take a picture of the main control board so that you know how the wires are connected before detaching them to remove the board."
