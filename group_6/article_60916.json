      "content": "At first, she may be too shy for direct contact. Maybe you get the feeling that someone’s watching your back, or keep seeing her lower her head the second you look her way. This is her sizing you up without putting herself too far outside her comfort zone. Stay away from teasing when it comes to her staring. Instead, go up to her and start a conversation or compliment her. If you’re feeling bold, you can throw in a flirt to let her know you feel the same way. Try, “You have beautiful eyes. It’s a shame you keep hiding them when I’m around.” Reader Poll: We asked 1869 wikiHow readers to tell us what the clearest indicator was that a girl liked them, and 51% said prolonged eye contact. [Take Poll] Every girl is different (and you shouldn’t assume she likes you unless she says so), but this could be a strong sign that she’s interested!"

      "content": "Chances are her small inner circle knows she’s crushing hard. She may be nervous to tell you right away, but that doesn’t mean her friends don’t know every single detail.

      "content": "A girl touching her hair is a universal sign of nerves. Maybe whenever you walk by she looks down and tucks her hair behind her ear, or she twists a strand around her finger when you talk to her. She’s nervous around you because she likes you, and playing with her hair helps her shush those inner anxieties. Gently brush her hand away from her hair if you know she won’t mind you touching her. This sweet gesture can help her relax and spark a little romance. Compliment her hair the next time you see her. She’s beautiful inside and out, so don’t be afraid to tell her so!"
