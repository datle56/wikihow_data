      "content": "Pallet liquidation auctions work like live bids. Pallets are compiled by liquidation companies or independent sellers and then sold on liquidation platforms. The buying process is similar to eBay, where customers bid or offer a price for a listing. The more bids a pallet listing has, the higher the price will likely be. Whoever has the highest bid in the end wins the pallet. [5] X Research source In some instances, a listing will have a reserve price (or a starting price listed by the seller), which is the lowest price the seller will accept for the pallet. Auctions usually last between 48 and 72 hours, but this can be changed by the seller."
