      "content": "Only Roman numerals larger than 3,999 use a non-standard keyboard symbol. That's because originally, Roman numerals only went up to 3,999. In modern times, an overline (also known as a vinculum) is placed over larger values (such as V̅ for 5000) to indicate multiples of 1,000. [2] X Research source When you see that overline bar above a Roman numeral, multiply just that part of the numeral by 1,000 to understand the number. There's obviously no V̅ key on your keyboard, so what do you do if you need to type a larger Roman numeral? You can use Microsoft Word on your PC or Mac to overline characters easily. And if you don't have Word, you can use Google Docs for free.

This replaces your code with the correct Roman numeral. If you're calculating a number that's 3,900 or greater, you'll notice that Word does not place the overhead bar over the value. Instead, it uses a longer notation. For example, the Roman numeral value for 5000 would be MMMMM instead of V̅ . While one could still look at that number and determine that it's equal to 5000, it's not exactly standard."

Instead, let's use the Equation tool. Click the Insert tab and select Equation Type the Roman numeral without the overline into the new Equation field. So, for 8020, type VIIIXX for now. Use your mouse to highlight the part of the Roman numeral that should have an overline. In this case, we want to add the overline over the VIII, as that's the part that we're multiplying by 1,000.
