      "content": "Choose a quiet place to read where you can concentrate. To read closely, find a comfortable spot where you can sit and focus on the text. Make sure the area is well-lit and you have snacks, water, or anything else you might need nearby. Turn off notifications on your phone and do what you can to shut out anything else that might distract you. [1] X Research source If you find it hard to concentrate in complete silence, some soft instrumental music in the background might help. In a public place, such as a library or a caf√©, you might want to try wearing headphones (with or without music) to isolate yourself."

      "content": "Skim the headings to get a general idea of the topic. Flip through the material you need to read to get a sense of how it's organized and the information included. Pay attention to the way the material is divided and subdivided and how much ground you're going to cover. This also lets you know what the main idea or focus of the text is. [2] X Trustworthy Source Darmouth University Academic Skills Center Center within Dartmouth University dedicated to assisting students achieve academic goals by providing pedagogical resources Go to source As you skim, think about the topic or main idea covered and the information you already know about that topic. This can help you figure out if you need to do some background reading before you tackle this material. It also helps to have a goal in mind as you get ready to read the material. [3] X Research source For example, if you're reading something for a class, your goal might be to learn more about the topic of the next lecture."

      "title": "Build a basic understanding of the topic if you don't have one.",
      "content": "Build a basic understanding of the topic if you don't have one. It's much easier to understand what you read if you can fit it into context with other information that you already know. If you don't know anything at all about the topic, you'll have a hard time reading with any continuity because you'll have to stop and look things up all the time. Getting a little background knowledge about the topic ahead of time is a good way to read more efficiently so that you'll get more out of everything that you read. [4] X Research source Wikipedia pages can be good sources for a top-level summary that will give you a good basic understanding of a topic you're not super familiar with. You might also read reviews or summaries of the material you're about to read (you can always save these for afterward as well)."

      "title": "Ask questions as you read to work actively through the material.",
      "content": "Ask questions as you read to work actively through the material. While reading, ask open-ended questions to dig deeper into what the material is trying to say. Simply asking \"why\" after every sentence is often enough to get you thinking about the material on a deeper level. [5] X Trustworthy Source Darmouth University Academic Skills Center Center within Dartmouth University dedicated to assisting students achieve academic goals by providing pedagogical resources Go to source Asking questions turns reading from a relatively passive activity into an active pursuit. When your brain is engaged, you'll tend to understand better and recall more. Asking questions also allows you to pinpoint precise parts of the text that are giving you trouble so you can fill in the blanks where necessary to unlock a greater understanding of the text."

      "content": "Speaking can help you slow down and focus on the words. Research shows that when people read aloud , they tend to remember the material more consistently than they would if they read it silently. This memory-boosting effect also enhances your understanding of the text because you have a more accurate recall of it. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Poetry and a lot of prose have a rhythm and inherent lyricism that makes it a much more profound experience when read aloud."

Typically, when you run into a word you haven't seen before, you can still get a general idea of what it means if you just take a look at the rest of the sentence. While this won't give you a perfect understanding, it should help you understand enough to get the basic idea of the text. [7] X Research source Even if you use context clues to figure out what a word or phrase means by yourself, it's always helpful to take a moment to learn the true definition."

The more words you know, the more material you can breeze through without having to stop to look up a word or figure it out from the context. If you don't have a large vocabulary, spend 5 to 10 minutes a day learning new words and you'll find that you start to understand what you read better. [8] X Research source Keep a list with words and phrases you learn along with their definitions so you can refresh your memory every so often to expand your vocabulary , which will also help you better understand what you read."

If you don't understand the meaning of a specific word or reference, it can seriously impede your ability to understand the material. Make a note of anything you don't know so you can look it up as soon as you reach a good stopping place. [9] X Research source When you return to the material, re-read the paragraph where the word or phrase appears, applying your newfound knowledge to reach a deeper understanding of the text. It also helps to orient your reading by looking up general information about any places mentioned or time periods discussed. Then, you can put your reading in context."

If you have the ability to do so, being able to mark up the text will help you read more actively and really improve your reading comprehension. You'll have to think about which words or phrases you underline, and why, and how those parts relate to everything else in the material you've read. [10] X Research source Writing comments in the margins is another good way to get a better understanding of what you're reading. Include notes with your own thoughts or reactions as well to trigger an emotional reaction to the material, which will help you remember it better."

This will help you see the underlying structure of the material and how the information is connected. [11] X Research source In your outline, include any questions you have or things you want to look into further. These will also help jog your memory as you're reviewing so you can tackle those for a greater understanding of the text."

If you misunderstood or are unable to summarize a paragraph, go back and read it again slowly to try and figure it out. [12] X Research source If you can write your summary directly on the page, it will also help you navigate the material later if you're reviewing and want to re-read something specific. When you're done reading the material, you should be able to put all of your summaries together and get a cohesive overall summary of the material you've read."

      "content": "Make connections to your experience and other things you've read. When you make connections between the material you've read and your own life, you make that material a part of you in a way. It becomes much easier to understand and recall because it's attached to other memories. Any way you can relate the material to something you're already familiar with will enhance your overall understanding. [14] X Research source It's helpful to put the material in context as well. You might look up other articles that reference what you've read or read online reviews to understand how it was received. If there are other authors who write similar material or share a similar school of thought, connections between those authors can also help you discover connections between the material and the world around you."

If you're unable to write anything cohesive, go back and read that section again. If this happens repeatedly, start breaking your material into smaller sections that you can recall more easily. [15] X Trustworthy Source Darmouth University Academic Skills Center Center within Dartmouth University dedicated to assisting students achieve academic goals by providing pedagogical resources Go to source The act of paraphrasing the material requires your mind to use the information you've just read to create something, which helps you understand it better."

      "content": "Talk about the material to enhance your understanding of it. If your reading was school- or work-related, you might talk it over with classmates or coworkers. Mention things that you didn't understand while reading and encourage others to do the same. Explaining something to someone else increases your own understanding as well. [18] X Research source You can also share the material with people you know. Even better if they aren't familiar with the topic‚Äîyou'll have to explain more, which can really boost your understanding."
