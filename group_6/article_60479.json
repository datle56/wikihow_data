The length of time it takes to completely stop taking Zoloft may depend on how long you were on the medication and the dose you were prescribed. Your doctor will determine the best schedule for you to taper off Zoloft while minimizing the potential for discontinuation symptoms.

Relapse symptoms gradually develop after 2-3 weeks and get worse over 2-4 weeks. Contact your doctor if any symptoms last more than 1 month.
