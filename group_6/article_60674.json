      "content": "Ask your doctor if ALA is a good choice for you. Before starting any supplement, always consult your doctor first, as supplements can have side effects and interactions. For instance, ALA can lower your blood sugar levels, which can affect how much insulin or other diabetes medicines you need if you are diabetic. ALA can also lower your thyroid hormone levels, so talk to your doctor if you have a thyroid condition. They may need to monitor your hormone levels more closely. [1] X Research source Some doctors are not experts in how supplements interact with regular medications. If yours isn't, visit a doctor who also specializes in alternative or holistic medications, or talk to a pharmacist."
