Sometimes used to describe something awesome. Other times it is used to say something was horrible. Insane - Way crazier than sick Sketchy - A negative word. It can be used to... Describe a skate spot. (Ex. A rail that was bent and rusty) Describe a person. (Ex. Some guy trying to get you to come and talk to him in a dark alley) Describe the landing. (Ex. Someone almost falls when they land a trick. Usually, a person shakes abnormally/does repetitive small kickturns to regain their balance.) Stoked - Excited or happy about something. Pop - Slamming the tail of your board into the ground (what must be done to do most tricks). Can also be used to describe how well your board pops up when the tail is smacked into the ground (Ex. A board that doesn't go very high would be described as having bad pop. Boards that go high would have good pop.) Nose - The front of a board. Tail - The back of a board. Dude - Can be used as a pronoun (Ex. Did you see what that dude just did?). Also, it can be used as an interjection (Ex. (You get slapped) Dude!) Chick - Girl Clean - A perfect landing. Clean is the total opposite of sketchy. Crash - Sleep Poser - Someone who says that they are better than anyone when they can barely do anything.
