      "title": "Write a short intro discussing your experience in detail.",
      "content": "Write a short intro discussing your experience in detail. Make your intro paragraph 3-4 sentences long. Begin by stating your job and niche, then discuss your writing experience and services you offer. List outlets where your work has been published, or describe the kinds of clients you usually work with. Write in third-person to convey a formal tone, or use first-person for a more personal touch. [2] X Research source Use the following examples to create your intro paragraph: Make your intro concise and straightforward. This makes it easy for clients to determine if you have the skills and background they’re looking for. Choose the proper perspective and tone for the kinds of clients you want to attract. Write in the third-person to sound more formal if you want to create content for companies or news websites. Example: Maria Miller is a freelance copywriter with 2 years of experience creating content for commercial websites. She has a proven track record of creating engaging, high-quality content on a wide range of topics for marketing, SEO, technical documentation, blogs, and social media. Her previous clients have included ABC Pharmaceuticals, XYZ Financial Firm, and Smith & Smith LLC. Use the first-person if you want to write op-eds, narrative stories, or other content written from your perspective. Example: I am a fashion writer and recent graduate of FIT, where I studied fashion merchandising and wrote for the campus newspaper. I have written product reviews, op-eds, and feature-length stories on industry events in the NYC metro area. In addition to writing for FIT’s student paper, I maintain the fashion news blog “Fashion XYZ” on Medium, which has over 2500 monthly readers."

Use a neutral background such as a blank wall, or a professional-looking setting like a home office. Make sure your background looks clean and organized.
