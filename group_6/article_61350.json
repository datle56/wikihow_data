To turn the water supply off, twist the valve for the cold water supply line that enters the tank (usually from above). The breaker switch for your water heater should be labeled, but if it isn't, go ahead and turn off the main power. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Drain and flush the tank to clean it out. To drain your water tank, attach a hose to the bottom of the tank where the spigot is. Choose a hose that's long enough to stretch to a nearby floor drain or utility sink, or all the way outside to the yard. Then open the drain valve on the water tank to start the draining process. By opening a hot water tap close to the tank, you'll help it drain faster while also being able to check on its progress. Open the cold water supply valve again to flush out any extra residue or minerals from the tank. Let the cold water flush through the drain valve for 5-10 minutes. You can skip the flush if it's a newly-installed tank. Don't attach the hose or open the drain valve, and use the nearby hot water tap to know when the tank is full -- a steady stream of water without sputtering is the sign."

Your water tank should now begin to fill back up. Keep the tap open on the nearby faucet so that air can escape while the tank fills up."
