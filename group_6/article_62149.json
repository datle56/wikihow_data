      "content": "On Snapchat, SFS means “snap for snap.” SFS is often used by social media influencers, although anyone on the platform can use it. Typically, a user will post a snap and caption it with #SFS. They're asking their followers to repost their snap as a way to get more attention and increase their reach. [1] X Research source If you respond, they’ll promote your profile/content in return to help you get more likes/followers, too. A user might tag you in a #SFS post to get your attention (especially if you’re a fellow influencer) so you’ll share their content."

      "title": "On Instagram, SFS means “shoutout for shoutout” or “spam for spam.”",
      "content": "On Instagram, SFS means “shoutout for shoutout” or “spam for spam.” Even though the translation is slightly different (after all, only Snapchat has snaps), the basic meaning of SFS is exactly the same on IG—a user who captions a post with #SFS is asking their followers to reshare their content. If you help them out, they’ll cross-promote you in return. [2] X Research source SFS is almost always paired with a hashtag, especially on Insta. A user may DM or tag you in an SFS post if they want to get your attention. The meaning and intention behind SFS is the same on TikTok, WhatsApp, Twitter, and all other social media platforms."

      "content": "Caption a post with #SFS to ask your followers to share your content. Posting content on social media with the caption #SFS is an easy way to ask all of your followers to promote you. Since the idea is cross-promotion, you’ll be expected to promote other users (especially other influencers) in return. For example, to promote your street art photography, post an image and caption it with #SFS. It also helps to include additional hashtags like #photography, #photooftheday, #streetartimages, #artwork, #streetstyle, and so on. If you want to get a specific user’s attention, tag them in your #SFS post. Many people consider SFS posts to be annoying clickbait, so be choosy! Only use #SFS if your story or post is actually worth sharing. [3] X Research source"

They'll share your profile and content with their followers in return. Hopefully, both of you will get tons of new likes and follows as a result! You can also just ignore #SFS posts if you prefer. Even if you’re tagged in a post like this, you aren’t obligated to share the content. It’s totally up to you."

Keep in mind that if you see “SFS” paired with a hashtag, it always means “shoutout for shoutout,” “snap for snap,” or “spam for spam.” [4] X Research source However, you might see this usage in a text message or DM from a friend who’s super anxious about something. For example: ”Got an algebra test tomorrow and SFS about it. Come over and help me study?”"
