There are two types of tablets: There are Wi-Fi-only tablets that can only connect to Wi-Fi, and there are tablets that are capable of connecting to Wi-Fi and cellular data. If you want to use your tablet to access your phone's cellular plan, you need to choose a tablet that is capable of connecting to cellular data, such as 4G or 5G. To find out if your tablet has cellular capabilities, check if it has a SIM card tray. The SIM card tray is usually an oval-shaped panel with a pinhole. On most newer iPads, it is located on the right side. On some older iPads, it may be located on the left side. [1] X Research source On an Android tablet, it may be on the side or top edge. You can also go into internet or connection settings in the Settings menu and check if there is an option to connect to mobile data, cellular data, 3G, 4G, or 5G."
