Personal wardrobe stylist Paul Julch says that “when [jeans are] wet would be the easiest time to try to pull that waistband.” [1] X Expert Source Paul Julch, MA Personal Wardrobe Stylist & Speaker Expert Interview. 29 July 2020. Spray down the area really well so the waistband is at least damp. The water will help stretch out the fibers of the jeans. Be sure to spray both the front and back of the waistband. If you don't have a spray bottle, dip the waistband area in lukewarm water. You can also heat the area with a hairdryer or iron. Julch says that you can also try stretching your jeans after they get out of the washing machine [2] X Expert Source Paul Julch, MA Personal Wardrobe Stylist & Speaker Expert Interview. 29 July 2020."

      "content": "Stretch the waist with your hands. Julch says that one of the best ways to stretch a tight waistband is to button the jeans, then take one side of the waistband in each hand and “try to pull the width of the waistband.” Pull outward as hard as you can to stretch the waistband of the jeans. [3] X Expert Source Paul Julch, MA Personal Wardrobe Stylist & Speaker Expert Interview. 17 September 2020. Grab the area around the button so that the button won’t pop off when you stretch the waist. Try not to grab onto the belt loops as you pull so they don’t pull off. Grab just below the waistband and stretch the jeans that way, too. To loosen up the fibers, stretch the jeans in more than one direction. You can also purchase a waistband stretcher that will do the stretching for you. Wrap the waistband around the stretchers, then turn the crank to stretch the pants out."

      "content": "Stand on part of the waistband and pull upward for more power. If your jeans don’t stretch as far as you need them to, you may need more muscle power. Stand on the inside of the waistband and pull up while holding onto the other side of the waistband. You can also have someone help you stretch out the jeans. Have them grab one side while you grab and pull the other."

According to Julch, “If you stretch it wet and put it in the dryer, you're negating what you just did.” [4] X Expert Source Paul Julch, MA Personal Wardrobe Stylist & Speaker Expert Interview. 29 July 2020. Heat from the dryer can make your jeans shrink again. Instead, place them flat on a towel or drying rack and leave them to dry out overnight. Alternatively, place a stack of books, a couple of coathangers, or a table clamp inside the waistband to stretch it out as it dries. [5] X Research source If you must use the dryer, turn it on low heat or tumble dry."

Sink down into the bath while wearing your jeans. It may feel a little weird, but it's an easy way to stretch them out! Make sure the waistband is completely submerged underwater. [6] X Research source The water helps the jean fibers relax, allowing them to fit your body. Hot water may cause your jeans to shrink. You can achieve the same effect by wearing the jeans as you normally would without washing them, but it can take longer. [7] X Research source"

Cut to the top of the yoke in back, which is the v-shape stitched line across the pants between the pockets and the waistband. Cut 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) down the jeans. [10] X Research source Cut right along the seam, which is where the pants are stitched together on the side. You'll have a \"V\" when you stretch the area out slightly. This process will add an extra piece of fabric on each side of the waistband, which will make it slightly bigger. You can also snap a button pin onto the lapel of your jeans next to the sewn-in button. Insert the button pin into the button hole to give you a little more room in the waistline."

Cut the fabric so that it’s twice the length of the cut, plus 0.25 in (0.64 cm) more. [11] X Research source It doesn’t matter how wide the fabric is—after you sew it into the jeans, you’ll cut off the excess. If you want, you can sew a piece of thick elastic here, instead."
