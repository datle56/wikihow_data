      "content": "Breaking the touch barrier is a very good sign. If you two are chatting and she keeps patting you on the shoulder or touching your arm, it means she’s okay with physical affection.

      "content": "A girl might grab your arm to hold onto while you’re walking. Since this is pretty close to holding your hand already, she’s probably okay with grabbing hands in just a bit.

      "content": "Even if it was an accident, she probably won’t take her hand away. If you two are walking around and you accidentally touch hands, she’ll probably step in even closer.

      "title": "This is an indirect way of holding your hand.",
      "content": "This is an indirect way of holding your hand. If a girl grabs you and pulls you along to show you something really cool, it means she wants to hold hands with you.

Let me show you!” before she grabs your hand."

      "content": "A wavering voice usually means someone is into you. While she might not even realize she’s doing it, women who are interested in you will often talk in a more sing-song nature. If you notice her voice going up and down during the conversation, she’s probably open to holding hands with you.
