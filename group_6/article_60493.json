This type of barking occurs because your dog is fearful and sees strangers as a potential threat. [1] X Expert Source David Levin Dog Training Coach Expert Interview. 19 December 2019. Dogs are wired to defend their territory, so they will use their bark when they detect unknown people in familiar places like their homes and their yards. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source In fact, your dog may be so motivated to bark at the perceived threat that he may ignore your shouts to stop barking or any scolding you might give him. Even if you use harsh punishment to stop your dog from barking, it may escalate to the point that he might try to control his territory other actions, such as biting someone. Some dogs also bark at strangers to alert their owners to a potential threat. Alarm barking is triggered by sights and sounds.

      "content": "Don’t yell or shout at your dog for barking. Most canine experts agree that yelling, scolding, or even hitting your dog for barking can in fact make his barking worse. If your dog is barking out of fear or anxiety, punishing him will only add to his stress. Instead, you need to train him to respond to strangers in an appropriate way, and to only bark when necessary. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source We bred dogs to bark, so do not get upset if your dog barks at sudden sounds like car doors slamming and loud noise in the street. However, dogs who bark at strangers require training to ensure they do not become too aggressive towards others."

      "content": "Obscure your dog’s view of strangers at the door. It’s important that you manage your dog’s barking by creating an environment that will limit his sight of others. Keep your curtains or blinds closed during the day when your dog is home. You can also set up a baby gate so your dog cannot get into rooms that have large bay windows where he can see outside. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source For a more permanent option, place a removable plastic film or spray a glass coating on the windows so its harder for your dog to see people outside. Doing this will limit your dog’s ability to see people so he is less motivated to defend his territory and bark."

Your dog should bark no more than three to four times and then stop when you calmly give him the command: “quiet”. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Practice this technique when a stranger comes to the door, for example, a delivery man. Let your dog bark three to four times. Then, stand over him and say “quiet”. Go to your dog and gently hold his muzzle closed with your hand. Then, say “quiet” again. Release your dog’s muzzle and step back from him. Then, call him away from the door or the window by saying his name and “here”. Command your dog to sit and then reward him with a treat. If he remains seated and quiet, give him several more treats for the next several minutes until the stranger is gone. If your dog starts barking once he sits down, repeat the sequence again and do not reward him until he sits and remains quiet."

If you feel uncomfortable holding your dog’s muzzle or if you feel doing so might scare him, try the “quiet” method without holding him. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Allow your dog to bark three to four times. Then, approach him and say “quiet”. Encourage his silence by feeding him pea-sized treats like cooked chicken, hot dogs, or pieces of cheese. Repeat this sequence several times over a period of several days until your dog seems to understand what “quiet” means. Your dog should stop barking once you say “quiet”. After several days of training, extend the time between giving the cue “quiet” and giving your dog his reward. Say “quiet” and wait two seconds before feeding your dog his treats. Gradually increase the wait time to five seconds, then 10 seconds, then 20 seconds. Work up to 30 seconds of wait time before rewarding your pup."

      "title": "Use treats to prevent your dog from barking during a walk.",
      "content": "Use treats to prevent your dog from barking during a walk. If your dog tends to bark at strangers when he is outside of his home, you can distract him from barking by using special treats that are soft, like cooked chicken, cheese, or hot dogs. Learn to read his body language and the cues that indicate when he is about to bark. This differs from dog to dog but may include: his hackles rising, ears pricking, or a change in the way he walks. When you notice these changes then distract him before he barks. [10] X Research source Hold the treat in front of his nose so he can see the treat. Instruct him to nibble the treat as he is walking past a person who might cause him to bark. You can also command your dog to sit and eat the treat as people pass by him. Always praise him and reward him again if he does not bark as people pass by."

Some dogs tend to bark while riding in the car and can feel anxious or fearful of strangers on the street or in other cars. Keeping your dog in the crate during a drive will restrict his view and give him less cause to bark. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If your dog isn’t comfortable riding in a crate, you can train your dog to wear a head halter in the car. A head halter can have a calming effect on your dog. You can also put a head halter on your dog during walks or around the house if he tends to bark. But you should avoid depending solely on a head halter to stop your dog’s barking. A more permanent solution to the problem is training your dog not to bark at strangers."
