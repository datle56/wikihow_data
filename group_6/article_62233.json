[6] X Research source To improve both, try studying and memorizing the layout of your computer keyboard (most use the QWERTY layout).

Even if you're already a fast typer, these practices can help you improve both your accuracy and your speed. Experts agree that it's best to work on your accuracy first, as you'll develop a faster speed as you get more comfortable using the keyboard. If you have a high WPM but low accuracy, the speed at which you type won't be valuable to employers. [8] X Research source Though many jobs don't necessarily require a certain WPM, improving your typing speed can help you get your work done more efficiently. You can also boast about having a stellar WPM if you get super fast!"

This may be surprising, but resting your wrists on your keyboard can cut off the blood circulation in your wrists and put pressure on your tendons. This tires out your wrists over time and makes you type less efficiently. To improve your speed and keep your wrists comfortable, hold your wrists straight over the keyboard. [14] X Research source If you need to use a wrist pad, try pushing it straight against your keyboard and resting your palms on it instead of your wrists. Think about investing in an ergonomic keyboard and one of those roller mice. [15] X Expert Source Luigi Oppido Computer & Tech Specialist Expert Interview. 31 July 2019."

      "content": "Alternative keyboard formats like Dvorak and Colemak may help you. These keyboards have rearranged which key is assigned to which letter to increase typing productivity, and the quick access to common letters on both keyboards may help you increase your WPM. [16] X Research source The Dvorak keyboard places the least common letters on the bottom row of the keyboard. This allows quick access to more common letters at the top and the home row. The Colemak keyboard places the most commonly used letters on the home row, which boosts the number of words you can type using just the home row. Note that if you're used to typing on a standard U.S. QWERTY keyboard, getting used to a new keyboard layout will take some time."

You can also use an onscreen keyboard to avoid looking down at the keyboard on your device. To activate this, visit your computer's search bar and enter \"keyboard\" to find your preferences."
