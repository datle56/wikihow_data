In astrology, your Venus sign placement speaks to how you express love and desire and what you value when it comes to love—so, if you were born with your Venus in Pisces, you’re an ardent romantic. You likely dream of true love and want committed relationships (though you may be hard to pin down at first), and you use empathy and intuition to build an unbreakable bond with your significant other. [1] X Research source Pisces is a water sign: deeply emotional, sensitive, and passionate. That’s why, if your Venus sign placement is in Pisces, you tend to prioritize emotional connections above all else when it comes to romance. Pisces is also a mutable sign—flexible and sometimes indecisive. That’s why you may be elusive, especially at the beginning of a relationship, if you have Venus in Pisces on your star chart."
