      "content": "Wear sarongs as a cover when going to the beach or pool. They are perfect for keeping you covered during the short trip between your car or hotel room and the pool or beach. Keep in mind that some sarongs are transparent. If you are self-conscious about this, place your hand behind the sarong before you buy it. If you can see your hand, people will be able to see your swimsuit. Avoid wearing white sarongs with dark-colored swimsuitsâ€”unless this is the look you are going for. White sarongs will be transparent. Patterned sarongs can make great, long dresses."
