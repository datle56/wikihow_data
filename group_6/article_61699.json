      "content": "Recognize what types of options you have to choose from besides using the radio. With a 2012 Ford Fusion and its affiliated Microsoft Sync system, you have access to an auxiliary jack as well as a USB jack (which also provides access to charging capabilities). (At that time, there was no USB-C, but with adapters, you may find something to bring it up to those specs.) Both of these are found in the center console, but each type needs to be represented in the two-line menu - as you'll find out soon. Microsoft Sync also provides you with access to Bluetooth Audio, assuming you pair the phone with the System. However, with certain phones, it may not work as well as others and also requires you to switch into this mode solely by requesting the switch to this device. The 2012 Ford Fusion's Sync supplement guide goes further into detail with information about connecting it, but as long as you understand where to plug it in and that you will need to wait until indexing is complete after turning the system on and pressing the \"Aux\" button until either USB or Aux or Bluetooth shows in the display, you'll be fine. The User's guide also mentions that it's able to play from nearly all digital media players out on the market including iPods, Zunes, and many more devices - among the USB and Aux-connected devices. This system will support audio formats in MP3, WMA, WAV, and ACC. [1] X Research source 2012 Ford Fusion: Say the Word guide"
