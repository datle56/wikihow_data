      "content": "“Sorry to hear that” is a polite and acceptable way to express sympathy , though it can come across as formal or detached on its own. If you’re talking to someone you don’t know well, it’s appropriate to simply say “I’m so sorry to hear that.\" If you’re talking to someone you’re closer to, add personal details and offer support to make the phrase more meaningful. [2] X Research source For example: “I’m truly sorry to hear about your grandmother's passing. She was an incredible woman. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to ask.” “I’m sorry to hear you didn’t get into the school you were hoping for. You’re so talented, intelligent and capable—it’s truly their loss!” “I’m so sorry to hear about the break-up. I know you must be hurting right now, so if there’s anything I can do to help or cheer you up, I’m here for you!”"

      "content": "“I’m here for you if you need to talk.” When a loved one is going through a tough time, your first instinct might be to “cheer them up.” Your intentions might be good, but this can make them feel like they can’t share their difficult emotions with you. Instead, tell them you're there to talk about their feelings (whatever they may be). Remember, they likely just want to feel heard. [3] X Research source Avoid saying things like, “You’ll feel better in no time,” or “Things could be worse.” Simply let them know that you’re ready to listen, and that they can be completely honest about how they’re feeling.

      "content": "“I’m thinking of you and wishing you strength and peace.” It’s natural to want to offer your “thoughts and prayers” to someone who's struggling. However, because this phrase has become so overused, it’s now seen as hollow and inauthentic. [5] X Research source To avoid sounding insincere, be specific and personal when you’re telling someone they are in your thoughts and prayers. “I’ve been thinking of you since I heard about your father’s passing. I’m sending love your way and praying you’ve been able to find peace.” “I heard about your diagnosis, and I just wanted to let you know that I’ve been thinking of you. I hope you’re feeling okay, and I’m wishing you strength.” [6] X Research source"

      "content": "“If you need any help during this tough time, please let me know.” When someone goes through a difficult event, like the death of a loved one or a mental health crisis, they may struggle with their everyday needs. While expressing your sympathy, offer to help them with basic tasks or chores. [7] X Research source This gives them one less thing to worry about, so they can focus on healing. “I’m so sorry for your loss. I’m available to drop off dinners for your family this week, so you don’t have to worry about cooking. Just let me know what days work best for you!” “I know you’re going through a tough time right now with the divorce. If you need any help with getting the kids to school, they are completely welcome to carpool with my kids.” “I’m so sorry you’re struggling with your mental health. I’m free to come over this weekend to do some laundry and help out around the house, if that works for you.” [8] X Trustworthy Source Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration U.S. government agency whose mission is to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on America's communities.

      "content": "“I’m available to just be here with you—You’re not alone.” Sometimes, your presence alone is enough to let them know you care . If your loved one is not quite ready to talk about their difficult situation, simply offer to be in the same physical space as them. [9] X Research source This helps them feel less alone without pressuring them to open up. “I know you said you weren’t ready to talk about what you’re going through, but do you want to have a movie night? We can hang out and get your mind off things.” “I’m so sorry about everything. I can come over with ice cream, cookies, and face masks if you want to relax and have a self-care night.”"

      "content": "“I can’t imagine what you’re going through right now—I’m truly sorry.” When you’re trying to be sympathetic toward someone, you might feel tempted to talk about a similar situation you went through to relate. Your heart may be in the right place, but this shifts the focus of the conversation to you instead of them. To avoid this, validate their emotions and resist the urge to say you know exactly how they’re feeling. [10] X Research source “Thank you so much for sharing your emotions with me. That sounds really tough, and I’m so sorry you’re in pain.” “I’m so sorry for your loss. I can only imagine how you’re feeling right now, and I want you to know you can talk to me about anything.”"
