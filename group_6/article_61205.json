To check a dog for ticks, run through the following list: Run your fingers over the entire length of your dog's body. Check hard-to-see places like armpits, between toes, and behind ears. Look for bumps or raised spots. Any time you find a raised spot, pull the fur apart to inspect the bump. Use a magnifying glass if you need to.

To safely remove a tick from your dog: Use a clean pair of tweezers to grasp the tick's head, as close to your dog's skin as possible. You may wish to wear disposable gloves to reduce the likelihood of infection to yourself. Pull the tick straight out of the skin. If the tick breaks apart, be sure to remove any pieces left behind, as these may also transmit Lyme disease."
