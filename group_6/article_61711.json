      "content": "Choose a snake that is the same caliber as your gun. Guns come in all sorts of different sizes, and bore snakes do too. A bore for a .22 caliber handgun is going to be a different length and width than one meant for a 12 gauge shotgun. The caliber is the size of the bore in the gun. If the calibers don’t match, then the snake won’t clean the bore out enough and could possibly get stuck in it. [1] X Research source Boresnakes are available online and at many gun shops. The type of gun the boresnake is compatible with will be listed on the packaging. Many manufacturers also stamp the caliber rating on the snake itself. If you have multiple guns, you'll need a different snake for each one unless they are the same caliber."

      "content": "Spray a bore cleaner in front of the snake’s bristles. The tail end of the snake is a long nylon rope with some bronze bristles in the middle. Apply the cleaner to the nylon directly in front of the bristles. Moisten about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of the nylon with a light amount of the cleaner. Remember to turn the snake over and coat the other side as well to ensure the cleaner treats the gun’s entire barrel. [2] X Research source You can buy bore cleaners online or at most gun shops. If you’re looking for an easy way to get the products you need, shop for a bundle containing the boresnake, a cleaner, and a lubricant. The head of the cleaner is the end with the brass weight. Put the cleaner on the stretch of rope between the bristles and the head. If it’s behind the bristles, it won’t be as effective."

      "title": "Apply lubricating oil on the opposite side of the bristles.",
      "content": "Apply lubricating oil on the opposite side of the bristles. Select a quality gun oil you like, then spray it onto the nylon rope. This time, use enough to lightly moisten about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of rope length behind the bristles, closer to the tail end of the snake than its head. Also, turn the snake over to apply oil to the other side. [3] X Research source The lubricant keeps your gun in working order and prevents rust, so apply it after adding the cleaner. Alternatively, you can send the snake through with only cleaner on it, then repeat the process with the lube. This comes down to personal preference and doesn't affect the performance of the gun."

      "content": "Unload the firearm to remove any bullets still inside. Check for bullets before handling the gun. If the magazine is present, detach it and set it aside. Point the gun away from you as you unload it. Depending on the type of gun you have, eject the magazine or open the barrel and shake the bullets out into your hand. In addition to being a safety issue, any bullets still in the chamber will get in the way of the boresnake. [4] X Research source With a handgun, for instance, press the eject button on the magazine, then slide back the chamber to open it. Press the cylinder latch or ejector rod to open and empty a revolver. For a pump-action shotgun, pump it until all the cartridges are ejected. Unload a semi-automatic by pulling back the charging handle. Other types of shotguns open at the handle. [5] X Research source Unload a rifle by pulling back the bolt or lever on the barrel and ejecting the magazine if there is one. Auto-loaders have [6] X Research source Even if you’re certain the gun is unloaded, check it again. Safety is an important part of being a responsible gun owner!"

      "content": "Drop the brass weight into the barrel to guide the snake into the gun. Open the gun’s barrel if you haven’t already. Then, place the brass weight inside like it’s a bullet. Since it won’t move on its own, tilt the gun so the barrel points toward the floor. Keep feeding the snake in until the brass head comes out the other end and the bronze bristles enter the chamber. If you’re cleaning a long gun like a rifle, consider putting it in a holder so you can focus on getting the snake into the barrel. After the snake's \"head\" emerges from the barrel, stop feeding the rope into it. Be careful not to pull the snake back through the barrel. Gravity is your friend when inserting the snake, especially with a larger gun. Position the barrel perpendicular to the floor, drop the snake in, and let gravity do the rest."

      "title": "Pull the bore snake all the way through the barrel.",
      "content": "Pull the bore snake all the way through the barrel. The snake can be a little stubborn when it gets inside that narrow barrel. If it doesn’t slide out with ease, tug it out from the far end. You are far likelier to snap the snake than you are to damage the barrel. Pull the snake out through the end of the barrel rather than pushing it back the other way. The snake is meant to go in one direction. If you push it backward, the bristles could scratch the gun or push debris deeper inside it. The snake often gets stuck when you haven’t cleaned out your gun in a while. Clumps of debris in the barrel get in the way of the snake, requiring you to pull a little harder to break through it. If you are unable to pull the snake out, clamp the head in a vice to hold it still, then pull the rope away from the gun’s barrel. Another option is to tie something heavy to the head, such as a gym weight, before pulling it again. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Repeat the process if necessary. The barrel should look polished like a mirror once it is clean. If it still looks dirty, feed the snake back through the chamber opening. Pull it through the barrel again. Expect to use the snake 2 or 3 times per session in order to fully clean the gun. [8] X Research source You don't need to add additional fluid to the snake each time you pass it through. The extra cleaner could make the barrel too oily, leading to more buildup."

      "title": "Give the gun a more thorough cleaning if the snake can’t get through.",
      "content": "Give the gun a more thorough cleaning if the snake can’t get through. Use a cleaning rod dipped in oil to remove buildup and lubricate the barrel. Cleaning rods help a lot if the barrel is permanently attached to the gun. Feed the rod into the bullet chamber, then pull it out of the end of the barrel. To keep your gun pristine, do a complete cleaning once a month. [9] X Research source Handguns, for instance, have detachable parts to remove for thorough cleaning. Eject the magazine, slide back the barrel, then press the release buttons on the barrel to detach it. [10] X Research source Boresnakes work best as a temporary solution and are great when you’re away from home. Use it before doing a more thorough cleaning to save yourself some time."

      "content": "Wipe the outside of the gun down with oil and a cloth. Spread a light amount of the gun oil onto a separate cloth. Clean rags and old T-shirts are good choices. Then, rub the oil onto the gun’s exterior to remove fingerprints and other debris. Do this each time you clean the barrel to prevent rust and other common problems that could damage your gun. [11] X Research source Use enough oil to coat the entire gun. You don’t need a lot, only enough to dampen the gun. Scrubbing with the cloth spreads the oil around, giving your gun a nice shine without leaving it oily."

      "title": "Clean",
      "content": "Clean the boresnake in soap and water when you’re finished. Fill a sink or bucket with warm water, then mix in a couple of drops of a liquid laundry or dish detergent. Stir the water around until it looks soapy. Then, soak the snake for up to 40 minutes, swishing it around and wiping the nylon tail with a towel. Rinse it off, squeeze out the moisture, and hang it to dry so it is ready to be used again. [12] X Research source Avoid scrubbing the metal bristles on the tail. They can shred your cloth or sponge, leaving pieces that end up in the gun. Clean your boresnake regularly, usually after each use if you have time. Washing the snake prevents it from reintroducing debris back into your gun. Boresnakes can be machine washed. Put the snake into a mesh laundry bag and set the machine to it’s gentlest setting for delicates. Although you could try washing it with clothing, consider washing it on its own to avoid oil stains."

      "title": "Use the boresnake after each shooting session.",
      "content": "Use the boresnake after each shooting session. Take advantage of how quick cleaning with a boresnake is. After you're done using the gun, pass the snake through the barrel. It’s better if you have oil available, but the snake will still do a good job if you have to use it dry. Regular maintenance will break up the debris before it has a chance to settle in the barrel. [13] X Research source Prevention is better than trying to eliminate heavy buildup. It will also help ensure the snake passes through the barrel so you no longer have to worry about it getting stuck. You won't need to use a snake on a gun you aren't shooting. Instead, consider doing a deeper rod cleaning every 1 to 6 months to prevent rust from forming."
