      "title": "Examine the snake's ring pattern.",
      "content": "Examine the snake's ring pattern. If the red and yellow rings are touching, the snake is a venomous coral snake. If the red and black rings are touching, you’re looking at a non-venomous king snake. [1] X Research source Herpetology expert Clint Bartley says this simple color check is the easiest way to tell the difference between a coral snake and a scarlet king snake in the US. A coral snake’s ring pattern is red, yellow, black, yellow, red. A scarlet king snake’s ring pattern is red, black, yellow, black, red. Tell other non-venomous snakes in the US apart from coral snakes using this patterning guide. For instance, the milk snake and scarlet snake also have red and black rings that touch."

      "content": "Look at the color and shape of the snake's head. Determine if the snake’s head is yellow and black or red and black. The coral snake's head is black with a short snout. The scarlet king snake's head is mostly red with an elongated snout. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "See if the snake has a black and yellow tail. The venomous coral snake's tail has only black and yellow bands—there are no red rings. [3] X Research source The non-venomous scarlet king snake's band pattern remains the same throughout the length of his body. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn rhymes to tell the difference between the two snakes.",
      "content": "Learn rhymes to tell the difference between the two snakes. People who live in regions where coral and scarlet king snakes are common have made up these easy-to-remember rhymes to help figure out which is which. Bartley recommends learning one to help identify these snakes quickly. Red touches yellow, kills a fellow. Red touches black, friend of Jack. Red touches yellow, kills a fellow. Red touches black, venom lack. Red touches yellow, you're a dead fellow. Red touches black you're all right Jack. Red touches yellow, death says hello. Black touches red, keep your head. Yellow touches red, you'll be dead. Red touches black, eat Cracker Jacks. Think of a stoplight: If yellow and red touch, take caution and stop. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Remember that these rules apply only to snakes in the US.",
      "content": "Remember that these rules apply only to snakes in the US. The suggestions in this article only reliably apply to coral snakes native to North America: Micrurus fulvius (Eastern or common coral snake), Micrurus tener (Texas coral snake), [6] X Research source and Micruroides euryxanthus (Arizona coral snake), [7] X Research source which are found in the southern and western United States. Different coral snake species can have quite different patterns elsewhere in the world. So, no assumptions can be made about the venomous or non-venomous natures of the snake without knowing the species. This means that the rhymes don't apply to coral snakes elsewhere, nor to the snakes that mimic them."

      "title": "Coral snakes tend to be more active in the morning.",
      "content": "Coral snakes tend to be more active in the morning. Both coral snakes and scarlet king snakes are nocturnal and like to hide underground or under logs and leaf piles during the day. [8] X Research source However, coral snakes might be more likely to come above ground during dawn and dusk than king snakes. [9] X Research source Both coral snakes and scarlet king snakes can also be found in caves and crevices in rocks. So, be very careful when lifting rocks or logs, or entering an underground space."

      "content": "Look for king snakes climbing trees. If you see a colorful snake with a ring pattern climbing a tree, it's probably a non-venomous scarlet king snake. [10] X Research source Scarlet king snakes are excellent climbers, while coral snakes very rarely climb trees. [11] X Research source You should still look carefully to make sure it's not a coral snake, and play it safe by not getting too close."

      "title": "Check for defensive tail-wagging behavior in coral snakes.",
      "content": "Check for defensive tail-wagging behavior in coral snakes. When coral snakes feel threatened, they often move their tails and heads back and forth to try to confuse their predators. Scarlet king snakes don't display this behavior. If you see a snake wagging its head and tail strangely, it's probably a coral, so stay back. [12] X Research source Coral snakes are very reclusive, so it's extremely rare to see them in the wild. They are not aggressive and only strike when they feel extremely threatened or are picked up. If you see one, keep your distance. If very threatened, king snakes may vibrate the tip of their tail on the ground to make a buzzing or rattling sound. However, like coral snakes, they aren’t aggressive and only attack when threatened. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Watch out for a coral snake's venomous bite. In order to inject its venom, a coral snake must clamp its fangs into its prey and “chew” for several seconds. The coral snake venom contains neurotoxins that can lead to paralysis, respiratory failure, and in rare cases, death. [14] X Trustworthy Source U.S. National Capital Poison Center Independent poison control center providing resources to prevent poisonings and save lives Go to source A coral snake bite is not usually painful at first. If it injected its venom, it can be a few hours before you show symptoms. Symptoms often include nausea, slurred speech, double vision, numbness, muscle spasms, and weakness. [15] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If you ever get bitten by a coral snake , call 911 or seek medical attention immediately, even if the bite doesn’t hurt or look serious. Stay calm and remove constrictive clothing and jewelry while you wait for help. [16] X Research source"
