      "content": "Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil or butter in a pan over medium heat. Place a medium-sized non-stick pan or a cast iron skillet on your stove over medium heat. Then, add 1 tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil or 1 tbsp (14 g) of butter to the pan and let it heat up for 1 minute. [1] X Research source The olive oil is fully heated when it moves quickly around the pan and starts to shimmer. The butter is ready when it’s fully melted. Feel free to use a different oil in place of olive oil, like coconut, sesame, avocado, or sunflower seed oil. Alternatively, spread soft, room-temperature butter on both sides of your bread instead of adding it directly to the pan. Note : This step is optional. Feel free to skip it if you don’t want to toast your bread in oil or butter."

Then, gently press it down with a spatula to ensure it toasts evenly. Toast the bread for about 2 minutes, or until the bottom side is crispy and looks golden. [2] X Research source Lift up one corner about every 30 seconds to ensure the bread is cooking to your liking. If your stovetop runs hot or you don’t want your toast to be super crispy, turn down the heat to low. To speed up the toasting process, cover the pan with a lid to trap the heat. Any sort of bread is delicious to toast. For instance, use sandwich bread, a baguette, or ciabatta."
