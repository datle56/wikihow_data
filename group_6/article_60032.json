      "title": "Choose right size and fit for your bust.",
      "content": "Choose right size and fit for your bust. A good bra supports and lifts your breasts, and this will increase the amount of cleavage you can show. If you don’t know your bra size, you can either measure your bra size on your own, or you can have a professional bra fitter or tailor measure you."

      "content": "Select a bra with underwire for more support. Underwire supports the breasts and gives them a slight, natural boost. [1] X Research source Avoid bras without an underwire. These offer less lift and support, and will make creating cleavage more difficult."

      "title": "Use bra inserts to make your bust look larger.",
      "content": "Use bra inserts to make your bust look larger. These usually come in fabric, silicone, or foam, and can add a little extra volume to your chest. Silicone bra inserts (sometimes called “chicken cutlets”) come in a wide variety of styles that fit comfortably inside most bras. Silicone inserts will look and feel the most like a real breast. [2] X Research source Fabric and foam inserts feel less realistic, but are soft and can help create the appearance of an ample bosom."

      "title": "Pick a push-up bra for additional lift.",
      "content": "Pick a push-up bra for additional lift. A push-up bra has a little extra padding at the bottom of the cup, helping to naturally enhance your bust line. Look for a push-up bra made with minimal fabric that cups the breast properly. Push-up bras made with too much fabric do not look as natural, and may overwhelm your bust instead of creating attractive cleavage."

      "title": "Manipulate your bra to create cleavage.",
      "content": "Manipulate your bra to create cleavage. You can create and accentuate cleavage with a couple of simple, temporary bra adjustments. Try twisting the front of your bra, clipping the back two straps together, or even wearing two bras to create some cleavage. Twist the small piece of material between the cups once, and then put the bra on as you normally would. The small twist will bring the cups closer together and give you some cleavage. Use a safety pin or hair tie to fasten the two back straps of your bra together towards the top of your back. This will create a sort of halter in front, lifting your breasts and bringing them closer together. [3] X Research source Wear two bras for extra volume and lift in your chest. The first bra you put on should push your breasts together (try the twisting technique if you don’t have a bra that naturally does this). The second bra should be one that provides lift, like a push-up bra. Two bras may seem like a bit much at first, but you’ll get accustomed to the feeling, and they will do the trick.

      "title": "Wear clothes with a lower neckline.",
      "content": "Wear clothes with a lower neckline. Lower-cut tops will inherently show more of your breast, and are the perfect canvas for creating cleavage. V-necks and scoop necks work well. The V-neck works especially well because it supports and frames your cleavage in a naturally flattering way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for tops that frame your bust.",
      "content": "Look for tops that frame your bust. Empire waists and wrap tops are always good choices for creating cleavage. An empire waist separates the bust from the waist, allowing the bust to stand out. A wrap top hugs the curves of your chest and bustline, creating a fuller appearance. When paired with a low neckline, these cuts can enhance the illusion of cleavage."

    {
      "title": "Keep your tops close-fitting.",
      "content": "Keep your tops close-fitting. Avoid baggy fabrics that drape across your chest, minimizing your bust. Even if a baggier top has a low, revealing neckline, your chest will ultimately look flatter because parts of your bust are hidden beneath piles of material. The less fabric you use, the more your bust can stand out."

      "title": "Visit a tailor if necessary.",
      "content": "Visit a tailor if necessary. Tailors can customize any dress or top to enhance the look of cleavage. A professional tailor can help enhance cleavage by sewing some extra breast padding right into your clothing. [5] X Research source A professional can also tailor your clothing to flatter your body and enhance the natural curves of your chest."

      "title": "Choose a bust-enhancing swimsuit.",
      "content": "Choose a bust-enhancing swimsuit. Swimwear can be great for making and accentuating your bust. The elastic, clingy material in most swimsuits lends itself to the creation of cleavage. Swimsuits with a halter top are great for showing cleavage. The closeness of the cups, tight material, and lift of the halter push the breasts together nicely. Some swim tops are made with underwire and a little padding, like a bra. The underwire gives the chest some structure, and the padding creates a nice lift. Try a bikini top with a really low front scoop. The scoop will expose more of your chest, making your breasts look larger. The elastic fabric of the top will also push your breasts together a bit. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Use cosmetics to create more pronounced cleavage. Using makeup is an easy way to create cleavage on a smaller bust. By applying darker shades to your bust where shadows should fall and lighter shades to areas that should be highlighted, you can create the illusion of ample cleavage."

      "title": "Apply some foundation to your chest.",
      "content": "Apply some foundation to your chest. Evenly apply the foundation to your neck and cleavage area. This will help create an even tone on your skin, giving you a clean canvas on which to apply your makeup. Look for a shade a little lighter than your skin tone in order to highlight your cleavage."

      "content": "Trace the upper curve of your breasts with an eye pencil. Trace the lines a little higher than where your breasts are fullest, then blend the shade into your skin. Use a darker shade of eye pencil to draw on your chest. Blend the shade in using a makeup brush. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Blend the lines further into your chest with a contour shade. Using a brush, blend the contour between your breasts in a “V” shape. Look for a contour shade with a bit of a grey/ashy tone. This will create the illusion of shadows while still looking natural."

      "title": "Add a highlighting shade in between the breasts.",
      "content": "Add a highlighting shade in between the breasts. Apply the highlighter to the tops of the breasts as well. A light highlighting shade accentuates the roundness of the breast, giving it a fuller appearance."
