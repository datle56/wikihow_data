      "content": "Prepare the parents of your Rattata. In order to use the F.E.A.R strategy, you will need to breed two Rattata that know particular moves. Get a male and a female Rattata and teach them Quick Attack (at level 4) and Endeavor (at level 44)."
    },

      "title": "Breed",
      "content": "Breed the two Rattata and hatch the egg. This will allow you to have Quick Attack and Endeavor on a Level 1 Pokémon."

      "content": "Obtain a Focus Sash. This can be gotten from Route 221 in DP/Pt, as well as by spending 48 BP at the Battle Tower in DP/Pt, the Battle Frontier in HGSS, the Battle Subway in BW/BW2, and the Battle Maison in XY and ORAS. You can also purchase it for 24 BP at the Pokémon World Tournament in BW2. Give this item to the level 1 Rattata to hold."

      "title": "Battle a sufficiently strong Pokémon with the level 1 Rattata as your lead.",
      "content": "Battle a sufficiently strong Pokémon with the level 1 Rattata as your lead. If in the middle of a battle, switch in the Rattata in a way that it will not take any damage. This can be done by switching it in when another Pokémon faints, when your opponent uses a non-damaging move, or when a slower Pokémon use U-Turn, Volt Switch, or Baton Pass after the opponent's attack. Make sure there are no entry hazards on the field, and Hail or Sandstorm is not active. Any damage the Rattata takes before it gets a turn, or that doesn't leave it at 1 HP, will break your Focus Sash and render your Rattata unable to win."

    {
      "title": "Choose Endeavor as your first move.",
      "content": "Choose Endeavor as your first move. Your opponent will hopefully hit your Rattata with a strong attack that would one-hit KO Rattata. The Focus Sash saves Rattata from getting one-shot, leaving it with 1 HP instead. Endeavor then makes your opponent's HP equal to Rattata's, putting it at 1 HP. If your opponent did not attack your Rattata or leave it at 1 HP, and its Focus Sash is not broken, use Endeavor again."

    {
      "title": "Use Quick Attack to finish off the opponent.",
      "content": "Use Quick Attack to finish off the opponent. Since Quick Attack has priority, it will always move first regardless of speed, except against other priority moves. This will do the minimum of 1 damage, hopefully KOing the opposing Pokémon."
