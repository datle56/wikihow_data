If she feels like she can express herself, she’ll be more likely to work on her issues with you. [2] X Research source It’s important not to yell over her or cut her off. If you do that, you’ll only make the issue worse. If you’re dealing with an adult daughter who is angry at you, it’s even more important that you listen to what she has to say. If you two can have a real discussion about what’s bothering her, you may be able to repair your relationship."

Thank her for opening up to you to encourage her to do it more in the future. [3] X Research source You could say something like, “Thank you for telling me that. I had no idea you felt that way. It sounds like you’re going through a really tough time.” Try not to talk down to her, especially if you’re dealing with an adult child. Talk to her like she’s an adult to have a more rational discussion."

      "content": "Have the same boundaries that you’ve always had with your daughter. If she’s still living at home, keep her curfew the same. If your daughter is an adult and out of the house, let her come over and visit whenever she likes. The more you maintain stability, the better the outcome will be. [8] X Research source It’s natural to want to buckle down and enforce rules on your daughter, especially if she’s a teenager. However, children with strict parents tend to act out in secret, and they won’t open up to you as much about issues in their lives."

If your daughter is a teenager, praise her for good test scores or following her curfew. If your daughter is an adult, praise her for larger things, like her direction in life or her own children."

You can calmly and gently ask her about what’s going on, but be careful not to push it (and don’t get offended if she doesn’t tell you anything). [12] X Research source You could say something like, “I noticed that you haven’t been as excited about school lately.
