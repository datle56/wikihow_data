      "content": "Take all the players’ hands, shuffle them, and deal them out evenly. Once you play the Wild Shuffle Hands card, collect each player’s hand including your own. Shuffle the cards thoroughly. Starting with the player to your left, deal the cards out as evenly as possible to all the players. After that, choose the color you want the next player to start with. [1] X Research source Some players may get fewer cards than others after you deal out the new hands. If the Wild Shuffle Hands card is the first one turned up from the deck at the beginning of the game, do not shuffle everyone’s hands together. The player to the left of the dealer picks the game’s starting color."
