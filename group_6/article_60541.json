      "content": "Keep your onion clean when preparing it for storage. Minimize exposure to harmful bacteria by preventing cross-contamination with uncooked meat and dairy products. Wash your hands before cutting the onion, use separate cutting boards for meat and produce, and ensure your knife is clean. [1] X Trustworthy Source Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA Food safety information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Go to source If you have space, set up dedicated areas for produce and meat preparation so you don’t spread germs while cooking. Avoiding cross-contamination is especially important when preparing food for storage because storing food gives bacteria time to grow."

      "title": "Wrap large pieces of onion with plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Wrap large pieces of onion with plastic wrap. If you have half of an onion remaining or a few large wedges, wrap the cut side tightly in plastic wrap. Plastic wrap insulates the onion from the outside air while helping it retain moisture. [2] X Research source Tear off a piece of plastic wrap big enough to cover the cut onion. Place the cut side down on the plastic and wrap the excess over the rest of the onion. The plastic wrap also helps prevent onion odors from stinking up your refrigerator. Tip : Keep the skin on the rest of the onion. The papery shell helps protect onions from drying out. [3] X Research source There are also new, silicone products designed to stretch over and cover the exposed side of cut produce. Exercise caution when using these with onions. These products might not fully cover the onion, which can cause your refrigerator to smell."

      "content": "Seal large and small onion pieces in a plastic bag as another option. Both onion halves and chopped pieces store well in airtight plastic bags. Simply place the pieces in the bag, press out the excess air, and seal the bag closed. [4] X Research source Do not use cloth storage bags, as these are intended for whole produce and will not protect a cut onion from exposure to air."

      "content": "Place cut onions in airtight containers as another alternative. Glass and plastic food storage containers are great for storing onion halves, slices, and chopped pieces. Add the onion into the container and press or snap on the lid so it’s airtight. [5] X Research source Make sure the container you use has an airtight seal. An airtight seal helps the onion last longer and prevents smells from escaping. Opt for glass storage containers when possible, as they do not absorb odors, unlike plastic containers.

      "content": "Cover halved onions in aluminum foil for another option. Aluminum foil works similarly to plastic wrap, protecting onions from air exposure and preventing smells from seeping into your fridge. Tear off a strip of foil, place the cut side of the onion face down, and wrap the rest of the foil over the piece. [7] X Research source For extra protection, wrap the onion in plastic wrap and then cover it with aluminum foil."

      "content": "Place cut onions inside onion-saver containers as an alternative. Onion-savers are round, airtight containers made specifically to store halved and cut onions. Simply place your onion pieces inside and twist or snap on the lid. These containers are helpful to have as they can prevent your other food storage containers from absorbing onion odors."

      "title": "Store onions in your refrigerator’s crisper drawer for 7 to 10 days.",
      "content": "Store onions in your refrigerator’s crisper drawer for 7 to 10 days. Always store cut onions in your refrigerator instead of at room temperature. Place them in your fridge’s crisper or vegetable drawer to keep them cold and protect other foods from absorbing onion odors. Just use them within 1 week of storing them. [8] X Research source Make sure your refrigerator is set at or below 40° F (4° C). Low temperatures inhibit bacterial growth and allow you to safely use the onions later. Store all cut onions for the same amount of time regardless of variety. Even though you may find different storage recommendations for different onion varieties—such as yellow, white, red, pearl, or Vidalia—these recommendations are relevant only for whole onions, not for cut ones. Warning : Ignore any storage recommendations that suggest cut onions can be stored at room temperature. Some common tips include storing onions in a bowl of water on a countertop. This approach only promotes bacteria growth. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Chop the onion into small pieces. Large pieces of onion—like an onion half or wedges—do not freeze well. To freeze cut onions effectively, chop your remaining onion into small pieces, preferably 1 ⁄ 4 inch (6.4 mm) cubes.

Just make sure the onion is spread out as thinly as possible in the storage container you use. [11] X Research source The thinner you spread the onion, the more evenly it will defrost when you’re ready to use it. Choong says that you don't have to blanch onions beforehand if they're chopped. Optional step : Place the chopped onions in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze for 1 hour before placing them in a bag or container. This can keep them from sticking together.

If you’re using a container, write the date on a label or piece of tape and stick it on the container. [13] X Research source It’s easy to forget when you put something in the freezer. Having the date written on your onion container will ensure that you don’t lose track of when you stored it."

Or, serve the onions raw on top of sandwiches and salads. [16] X Research source It is safe to eat cut and refrigerated onions raw. [17] X Research source However, they may taste more harsh or even sour compared to fresh onions. If you’re concerned about food safety, cook refrigerated onions instead of eating them raw. The heat helps kill off any potentially harmful bacteria that grew during storage. Note : The cut side of the onion may dry out in storage. Simply cut off a thin slice to remove the dried pieces."

Pickled onions keep well for 6 months in the fridge when unopened and last 2 weeks in the fridge when opened. [20] X Research source To pickle the onions : [21] X Research source Slice the onions into ¼ inch (0.6 cm) rings or pieces. Heat 1-2 c (237-473 ml) of water to a boil. Bring 6 tbsp (88 ml) of apple cider vinegar, ¼ tsp (1 g) of sugar, and ¼ tsp (1.5 g) of salt to a simmer. Place the onions in a sieve and slowly pour the boiling water over them. Put the onions in a sterilized jar (such as a canning or mason jar). Pour the vinegar mixture into the jar. Choong says, “ensure that there is an inch [2.5 cm] of headspace” between the liquid and the top of the jar and “no air bubbles.” Seal the jar and let the mixture cool before putting it in the fridge."

[22] X Research source To dehydrate onions : [23] X Research source Choong says to peel off the skin and slice the onions thinly, about ⅛-¼ inch (0.3-0.6 cm) thick. Heat your dehydrator to 130-140° F (54-60° C). Place the onions in a single layer on the dehydrator rack. Dry the onions for 3-9 hours. Let the onions cool and pour them into a clean, airtight container. Check for moisture in the jar every day for 1 week. If you see moisture, dehydrate the onions again. [24] X Research source"
