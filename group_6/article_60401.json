      "content": "Remove any dirt from the leaves and trim them so they’re tender. If you’re using some freshly picked spinach that you picked up from a grocery store, farmer’s market, or if you grew the spinach yourself, it’s completely normal for the leaves to have some soil on them. Rinse the leaves under cool water and use your fingers to gently rub and remove any dirt from them. If there are any long, fibrous stems, use a knife or a pair of kitchen scissors to trim them off. Pat the leaves dry with a paper towel or let them air dry a bit before you cook them. [1] X Research source The thin, green stems near the leaf are actually tender and tasty, but longer, thicker stems can be tough. Even if store-bought loose spinach looks clean, give it a good rinse just to be sure."

      "title": "Save yourself some time without having to wash and trim the leaves.",
      "content": "Save yourself some time without having to wash and trim the leaves. If you’re looking for the easiest way, pick up a bag of pre-washed, pre-packaged spinach. Because the leaves have already been thoroughly washed and trimmed, there’s no need for you to do anything but cook them! [2] X Research source Most grocery stores sell pre-washed bags of spinach in the produce section."

      "title": "Use a stainless steel knife to avoid discoloration.",
      "content": "Use a stainless steel knife to avoid discoloration. Some people don’t love the longer leaves of cooked spinach. No problem! Place the spinach on a clean cutting board and use a stainless steel knife to chop it up into smaller pieces. It’ll cook down into a dish that’s much easier to chew and eat. [3] X Research source Chopping the spinach doesn’t affect the flavor or the cooking time."

      "title": "Add about 4 ounces (110 g) at a time.",
      "content": "Add about 4 ounces (110 g) at a time. Place a few handfuls of spinach into a microwave-safe container such as a glass bowl or a casserole dish that’s designed to be used in a microwave, such as Corningware. Try not to overfill the container so the spinach cooks evenly. [4] X Research source Don’t use plastic containers unless it’s microwave-safe. If you aren’t sure, don’t use it, just to be safe. If you have a larger container, you can add more spinach if you like."

      "title": "The spinach will soak up the flavors as it cooks.",
      "content": "The spinach will soak up the flavors as it cooks. You can season the spinach after it cooks, but if you want to infuse it with more flavor, you can add some before you place it in the microwave. Add 2 tablespoons (17.24 grams) of minced garlic, 5 tablespoons (71 grams) of butter, and 2 tablespoons (32 mL) of lemon juice into the container. [5] X Research source This is totally optional and you can add plenty of flavor by seasoning the spinach after it’s cooked."

      "title": "Use a microwave-safe lid, damp paper towel, or plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Use a microwave-safe lid, damp paper towel, or plastic wrap. If your container has a lid, place it on top. If you don’t have a lid, use a slightly damp paper towel or wrap the top of the container with plastic wrap so the steam doesn’t escape and will cook your spinach evenly. [6] X Research source Make sure the lid is microwave-safe so it doesn’t melt or get damaged."

      "content": "Spinach cooks super quickly with just a bit of heat. Place your container of spinach into the microwave and nuke it for 2 minutes on the highest heat setting. Once it’s finished cooking, give the spinach a minute or two to finish up and to allow the container to cool so it’s easier to remove without burning yourself. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Give it a quick stir to finish up any uncooked leaves.",
      "content": "Give it a quick stir to finish up any uncooked leaves. The container may be hot and the trapped steam could burn you. Use a pair of oven mitts or potholders to remove the container and place it on your counter. Carefully remove the lid and check the leaves. Stir it up to help finish cooking the spinach evenly. [8] X Research source The spinach may not look fully cooked at first, but it’ll finish cooking after you stir it all together."

      "content": "The cooking process can leave some moisture in the dish. Extra water can turn your spinach into a mushy mess. Carefully pour out the excess at the bottom of the container into your sink so you’re left with crisp, steamed spinach. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix it all up and enjoy!",
      "content": "Mix it all up and enjoy! You can add salt and pepper to enhance the natural flavors of the spinach. You can also add seasonings like cayenne or red pepper flakes if you like a little bit of heat. Stir the spinach well to evenly distribute the seasonings and it’s ready to serve. [10] X Research source You can also add the spinach to dishes such as pasta or rice."
