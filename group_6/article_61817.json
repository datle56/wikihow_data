He is the founder of the Grand Exchange and will give you a longer, more interesting tutorial, while the tutor will be more concise. You will need to be tutored in order to use the Grand Exchange or get tips from any skill helpers on the latest prices. Accept the tutoring and you'll watch a \"movie\" to show you how to use it. You can find him on the minimap by the question mark symbol."
