      "content": "Pick an electric tuner that listens for the note if you're a beginner. With this type of tuner, you play a string, and then the tuner tells you whether you are sharp or flat. This type works well if you don't have a very good ear yet, as it does the hard listening for you. You can find these types of tuners online or at music stores. You'll also find many smartphone apps that will act as tuners. Most of these cost a little money, but they are generally cheaper than a physical tuner. Try Tunable, ClearTune, or insTuner, to name a few."

      "content": "Try a tuning fork or piano if you can find the notes. The notes you need to find and play are G, D, A, and E, which match the violin strings. On the piano, the \"G\" is the one just below middle \"C,\" and every other note you need is spaced out at 5 intervals higher, starting with \"D.\" Play the note on the piano or tuning fork, then play the matching string on your violin. Adjust the string on your violin up or down to match the note you're hearing. With a tuning fork, you'll hit the tuning fork on a table and move it towards your ear so you can hear it better. A tuning fork is just a metal instrument that always hits a certain note when struck. With this method, you'll play the note and then match try to match your violin to it."

Turn the tiny fine tuner clockwise to make the string higher and counterclockwise to make it lower. Play the string with the bow to see if it matches the sound you just heard. Keep adjusting and playing the string to get the right note. You can only make fine adjustments with this tuner, so if your string is majorly out of tune, you'll need to move to the pegs instead. If the screw is turned all the way down, turn it back the other way to loosen it all the way. Then move on to tuning with the peg. That way, you're less likely to break the string."

Match the note of the string with the note on the tuner. [6] X Research source You may only have a fine tuner on the \"E\" string or the \"E\" and \"A\" string. If you do, just adjust the other strings at the pegs instead. The fine tuners are the small \"screws\" on the tailpiece of the violin, which is where the strings end near the chin piece.
