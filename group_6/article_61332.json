      "title": "Open the picture you want to use.",
      "content": "Open the picture you want to use. After opening the Photoshop program you’ve chosen to work with, click the “File” tab in the upper lefthand corner of the screen and choose the “Open Image” option. Then, select a photo from the appropriate folder on your computer. For best results, pick an image with a clear subject and well-defined edge detail. [1] X Research source Portraits of people are good candidates for converting into digital sketches, as are small-scale landscapes and shots of one or two distinct-looking items. If the picture you want to use is stored on a separate device or camera, you’ll need to transfer it to your hard drive before you can edit it via Photoshop."

      "title": "Turn the color saturation of your photo down to zero.",
      "content": "Turn the color saturation of your photo down to zero. Look for the boxlike panel labeled “Adjustments” on the right-hand side of the screen and click on the Hue/Saturation icon. This will be the first icon on the left in the middle row. When the Hue/Saturation slider bar appears, drag it all the way to the left until the slider rests on “0%”. [2] X Research source You can also convert your image to grayscale by simply hitting “Ctrl+Shift+D” (or “Cmd+Shift+D,” if you’re using a Mac). [3] X Research source Yet another way to desaturate your photo is by clicking on the “Image” tab and selecting “Hue/Saturation” from the expanding “Adjustments” menu or clicking the “Desaturate” option closer to the bottom of the list."
    },
    {
      "title": "Duplicate the background layer of your image.",
      "content": "Duplicate the background layer of your image. From the “Layer” tab at the top of the screen, click on “New,” then “Layer via Copy.” Alternatively, you can press “Ctrl+J” or “Cmd+J,” or drag the layer onto the “New Layer” icon at the bottom of the Layers window. This will create a second identical layer of your existing image titled “Background Copy.” [4] X Research source In order to achieve that authentic hand-drawn look, you’ll be merging two separate layers into one image."

      "title": "Invert the copy layer of your background image.",
      "content": "Invert the copy layer of your background image. Click on the layer labeled “Background Copy,” then hit “Ctrl+I” or “Cmd+I.” Doing so will invert the tones in your photo, turning the black portions white and the white portions black. This layer will now be the exact opposite of your original layer. [5] X Research source It’s okay if you invert the original layer by mistake. All that matters is that you have one normal version and one inverted version of the image."

      "title": "Change the blend mode to “Color Dodge” or “Linear Dodge.”",
      "content": "Change the blend mode to “Color Dodge” or “Linear Dodge.” Locate the bottom drop-down menu on your Layers panel—it should currently read “Normal”—click on it, and choose one of the two aforementioned blend modes. As you do, most of the detail will disappear from your image, leaving a predominantly white screen. Don’t worry, this is supposed to happen. [6] X Research source Selecting the “Color Dodge” option will give your photo thin, sharp lines like those in an actual pencil sketch, while “Linear Dodge” will soften them a bit so that they resemble a charcoal sketch."

      "title": "Apply the Gaussian Blur filter and adjust it until your image looks just right.",
      "content": "Apply the Gaussian Blur filter and adjust it until your image looks just right. Head to the “Filter” tab on the top toolbar and highlight the “Blur” option, then select the “Gaussian Blur” filter about halfway down the list. Move the slider left or right to increase or decrease the effectiveness of the filter. The higher the filter radius, the more detail that will be preserved, and the more like a photograph the image will appear. [7] X Research source A radius somewhere in the neighborhood of 8-30px will usually offer the most convincing results. If the lines in your image still aren’t as bold as you would like, one thing you can do is create 2-3 additional layers of your edited image and merge them together to beef them up a bit. [8] X Research source When you’re satisfied with the look of your image, right-click your original layer and click “Merge Layers.” This will combine the properties of all of your individual layers into a single layer. Keep in mind that you won’t be able to make any further edits once you’ve merged your layers."

Open the GIMP editor and select the “File” tab in the upper lefthand corner of the top toolbar, then click “Open.” Choose your source image file from the appropriate folder on your computer’s hard drive. [9] X Research source A well-framed photo with a clear subject and distinct edge details will work best. If it’s your first time using GIMP for this type of project, run a quick search for stock photos that you can play around with. Many stock photos are perfectly suited for converting to digital sketches and will give you a sense of what each step of the process does. [10] X Research source"

Most of these apps are easy to use, with intuitive controls and a number of tools that allow for greater customization. [22] X Research source Photo Lab, Paint, Enlight Photofox, Prisma, and Clip2Comic are all free apps that boast a wide range of filters and effects meant to emulate traditional art styles. [23] X Research source If you’re surfing the web, check out popular photo editing sites like Pixlr and Paint. NET. There’s no need to use a fancy photo editor if you just want to play around. These days, the newer version of many common programs, like Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, feature their own built-in photo effects. [24] X Research source"

Sharpen your pencil to a nice fine point, and make sure you’ve got at least one dedicated eraser. It’s also a good idea to keep a few spare sheets of paper handy just in case you mess up and want to start over. [29] X Research source A pencil is much better suited for this project than a pen, as you’ll have more control over your lines. The eraser will also allow you to correct and drawback over any mistakes you happen to make."

That way, you’ll be able to use it as a visual aid and have something to compare your drawing to as you work. [30] X Research source Take a few moments to study your photo in depth before you get started. Familiarizing yourself with a many details as possible will help you reproduce the image more faithfully and keep you from having to stop and look at it every few seconds."

      "title": "Start by sketching out the outline of your subject.",
      "content": "Start by sketching out the outline of your subject. Use short, light pencil strokes to gradually develop the shape of the person or object in your photo. Do your best to keep the proportions of your drawing the same as those in the original image. Scaling each individual part of your sketch so that it’s roughly the same size as your photo can help. Don’t bear down too hard. You can always go back and make your lines thicker and darker once you’re happy with the way they look. Another useful technique is to section off both your paper and original photo into identically-sized squares, then zero in and focus on copying only what you see in each square. [31] X Research source You can start your outline wherever it feels most natural to you. As a rule, it’s just easier to start with the basic form before moving on to smaller details, rather than vice-versa."

    {
      "title": "Fill in smaller details.",
      "content": "Fill in smaller details. Once you’ve completed your outline, flesh it out with that give your subject its unique character. If you’re drawing a person, this will include things like their facial features, hair, and clothing. If you’re bringing to life a nature scene, it might mean adding rippling water, leaves, and clouds. [32] X Research source As you did with the outline, try to match the proportions of your drawing to those of your photo, and keep your lines light and loose until you’re ready to commit to them. The idea here is essentially just to recreate the kinds of lines, shapes, and contours you see in the original image onto your paper. This requires a keen eye and a steady hand more than anything else. [33] X Research source If you need to make small touch-ups, like fixing someone's eyes, try a Tombow mono eraser . Since it's so small, you can erase tiny details with a ton of precision."

      "title": "Shade your sketch for added realism.",
      "content": "Shade your sketch for added realism. There are a number of ways to shade a drawing. The simplest and most common method is to hold your pencil at a narrow-angle to the paper and rub the side over broad areas. Apply more pressure in areas with deep shadows and lighten up when you get to spots that are meant to represent glare or light colors. [34] X Research source To achieve the most realism possible, study how light falls on your subject as well as the shadows cast on them. You can also give techniques like hatching (drawing straight, parallel lines close together), cross-hatching (crossing your hatching lines perpendicularly to produce a gridlike pattern), and stippling (making small dots with the tip of your pencil) a shot for parts of your drawing where conventional shading may not look right. [35] X Research source Shading is a crucially important artistic skill to possess if your goal is to make your drawings more lifelike."

      "content": "Place a piece of tracing paper over the photograph you want to draw. Line up the edges of the paper with the edges of the photo and make sure it’s lying smooth and flat. Tracing paper is thinner and more translucent than normal paper, which makes it possible to easily trace over the picture below. [36] X Research source Alternatively, you can use a regular sheet of printer paper (or any other type of paper you want) and light both the photograph and your paper from underneath with an art projector. [37] X Research source For best results, it’s important to use a type of paper that’s at least as big as the photo you’re working with, preferably larger."

Use the edge to shade in darker sections and lend a sense of depth. Take your time and work carefully to avoid mistakes. [39] X Research source Some smaller details may not be visible on your tracing paper. This usually happens when part of the picture is especially light or made up of thin lines."

      "title": "Incorporate fine details or embellishments of your own.",
      "content": "Incorporate fine details or embellishments of your own. If you like, you can add a few extra touches to put your own personal stamp on your finished drawing. You might free-hand new features into the scene or take some artistic liberties with the shading or composition. It’s totally up to you! [41] X Research source Transfer your tracing paper to another photo to create a composite drawing made up of elements from different images. If you want to add some texture or special effects after you've colored in your drawing, take out a Tombow mono eraser and try out different strokes. For example, rub your eraser in downward strokes to create highlights in someone's hair."
