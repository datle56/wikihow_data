To accomplish this, and secure your row of stitches in the process, you need to stitch over the tail. Thread your needle with approximately three feet of yarn or floss. Insert the needle through the backside of the canvas until you are left with a two-inch tail of yarn or floss. Hold the tail against the back of your canvas so that it runs along your stitch line. Execute your stitches over the tail until it is completely covered. [5] X Research source"

Pull the thread or yarn to the left side. Pull the needle up through the back of the canvas at the same hole. Create a loop in the thread or yarn. The loop will hang from the backside of the canvas.
