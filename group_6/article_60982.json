      "content": "Emojis will help lighten the tone of your texts. Leos like to keep their texting lighthearted and full of positivity. To match her energy, include emojis and GIFs that communicate your intention in texts. Happy emojis and smiley faces add extra warmth to a text, and you can send a quick silly GIF when you want to make her smile. Use any of the smiley face emojis to add warmth to your message. “Hey, text me when you get a chance! 😊” feels more inviting than “Hey, text me when you get a chance.” Add romantic vibes to your text with a heart emoji (❤️), a kissing face (😘), a kiss (💋), or even a rose (🌹). You could add some emoji flair to a “good morning” or “good night” text. Send a text along the lines of “Good morning, cutie! ☀️” or “Sweet dreams! 🌙✨” Send 1 or 2 emojis per text. Otherwise, it might feel like you’re coming on a little strong."

      "content": "Leo women want a partner who puts effort into their style and hygiene. Send her a random selfie from time to time when you’re feeling good about yourself. Make your selfie more alluring by putting on flattering clothes, styling your hair, and adding any embellishments that you enjoy such as makeup or accessories. You gain confidence when you feel good about yourself, and Leos will love seeing that confidence in a selfie. For example, you could text her: “Just got a new haircut! Thoughts? 🙏” “Check it out! I’m at that coffee shop you love. ☕️” “Trying on new clothes right now. What do you think of this look? 😊” Your Leo lady will love showing you off to her friends and going places in public together when she can see that you take care of your appearance as much as she does."

[4] X Research source “Saw this hilarious video and thought of you immediately! It seems right up your alley. 😆” “You’re a big Marvel fan, right? Found a few memes on Tumblr that you might enjoy!” “We may not be socks…but I think we make a great pair! 😘” Make sure that your texts have a point to them.

      "content": "Leo women are intelligent and happy to share their wisdom. Text your Leo for recommendations or advice on dealing with a problem. Thank her for helping you, and let her know later that you followed her advice. This is a great way to give your Leo attention while also showing her that you trust and value her judgment. “Hey! 😚 I’ve been craving sushi lately and I want to try someplace new. Any suggestions?” “I’ve been having some drama with one of my co-workers. Since you’re always so great with people, I was hoping you could give me advice? 🙏” “My favorite TV show just ended and I have no idea what to watch now. 🥺 What shows are you into?”"

      "content": "Leos may be playful, but they’re also one of the most driven signs. Your Leo lady will take a special interest if you show her that you have dreams and encourage hers—because you can bet she’ll have them! Set goals for your professional life or your hobbies, and share them with your Leo while the two of you are texting. [5] X Research source Leos look for a partner who will help them realize their ambitions. Make a point to encourage her when she talks about her goals and offer help if she ever needs it. For example, you could text her, “I think it’s so cool that you’re a musician. I’ll be in the front row cheering at your next gig if you’d like me to be there!” “I’ve been really into painting since college, and my goal for the next couple of months is to start submitting pieces to local galleries!”"

      "title": "Leo women expect complete honesty, and their trust is hard to win back.",
      "content": "Leo women expect complete honesty, and their trust is hard to win back. Pretending to be someone you’re not will only lead to problems down the road. Be honest with her and let her see the real you! She has no problem with different opinions so long as hers are respected, and she’ll appreciate your honesty and openness. For example, if she raves about a movie you didn’t like and then asks for your thoughts, say: “Honestly, I wasn’t a fan of the film. I enjoyed hearing your take on it, though! 😊” Another example could be: \"To be honest, I made a mistake at work today and I'm feeling pretty upset. Maybe we could talk about it?\" Even a small lie is a betrayal to Leos. If you lie early on in the relationship and get discovered later, you could be in big trouble."

      "content": "Leo women prefer attentive partners who will communicate often. Sometimes life gets in the way, and that’s fine—make a point to text her back as soon as you get the chance. Texting back right away is ideal, and if you can’t, text her when you’re free and offer a quick apology for the delay. When you respond right away, you could add “Amazing timing—I was just thinking about you! 😉” to your message. If there’s a delay before your response, you could text: “Hey, so sorry for the late reply! Work was crazy today. 🤯”"
