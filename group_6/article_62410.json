      "content": "You might be bathing your cat too often. Beneficial bacteria naturally live on your kitty’s skin, and they eat the bacteria when they groom themselves. That might sound gross, but your cat actually needs the bacteria to properly digest their food. When you bathe your cat too often, the bacteria die, and your cat needs a way to replenish them. Since these bacteria live in dirt, your cat feels an innate urge to roll around in the dirt. [1] X Research source Later, your cat will ingest some of the bacteria from the dirt as they groom themselves."

      "title": "Your cat might be itchy.",
      "content": "Your cat might be itchy. Dry skin and pests—such as fleas—can make your kitty super itchy. If they can’t reach their back, they might roll around to relieve the itch. Since dirt is gritty, it gives your cat added relief. [2] X Research source Check your cat for fleas by combing your cat with a flea comb to see if you recover any fleas. Additionally, look for patches of missing fur from scratching."

      "content": "Your cat could be playing. Kitties love to play and have fun, and sometimes there’s nothing more fun than rolling around in the dirt. They can dig, flip, flop, and make a huge mess. It checks all the boxes for a good time. [3] X Research source Your cat doesn’t care that it bothers you. If this is the case for your cat, you’re in luck!

      "content": "Your cat may be trying to cool down. If it’s hot out, your cat might be feeling overheated. Cats run hot and are covered in a fur coat, so they can get really toasty on steamy days. While the top layer of dirt is also warm, rolling around reveals a cool layer of ground for your cat to comfortably lay on. [4] X Research source If your cat wants to cool off, you’ll probably see them lounging on the spot once they’ve shifted the dirt around a bit."

      "title": "Your cat might roll around to mark their territory.",
      "content": "Your cat might roll around to mark their territory. Since cats are very territorial, they love to rub their scent everywhere—especially if there are other critters around. When your kitty rolls around, they leave their scent behind for other animals to find. Since cats often rub their scent on the same items over-and-over, your furbaby will probably insist on rolling in that same spot every time they go out. [5] X Research source If there are a lot of other cats around, expect your kitty to do some territory marking. They need to send a message to all the interlopers."

      "content": "Your cat could be covering up their own smell. On the flip side, rolling around in the dirt also allows your cat to pick up the scent in the soil. They might want to smell like dirt because they’ve gotten an unpleasant scent on their fur. Alternatively, they may be worried about predators and want to feel incognito. Either way, your cat sees a romp in the dirt as a solution to their problems. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Your cat might have munched on some catnip. Since fresh catnip is a common herb, your kitty can get into a stash even if you’re not their supplier. After getting their paws on the good stuff, your cat might find themselves rolling around in the dirt. [8] X Research source Rolling around and flopping on the ground is actually a common reaction to catnip, and your cat will probably do it for around 10 minutes before they start staring off into space.

      "content": "Cut back on how often you bathe your cat. Since cats groom themselves, you don’t really have to bathe them.

Only bathe your cat if they're very dirty or smelly. [12] X Research source Cats are typically clean animals, so you don’t need to worry about your kitty being dirty without baths."
