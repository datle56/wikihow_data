      "content": "Medications Stimulants, some prescription sleep aids, antidepressants, and blood pressure medications have all been linked with an increase in vivid dreams, and particularly nightmares, in some patients.

      "title": "Dreams that feel emotionally intense and real are \"vivid dreams.\"",
      "content": "Dreams that feel emotionally intense and real are \"vivid dreams.\" Dreams happen during the REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep. When you dream, the parts of your brain that process sensory information are active, but the rational, reasoning parts of your brain aren't. That's why the weird parts of your dream only seem weird when you recall your dream after you wake up. Vivid dreams are just like any other dream, except that they seem more real and you can recall more details from them. You're most likely to remember a vivid dream if you're awoken in the middle of REM sleep, such as by an alarm clock. International intuitive counselor and happiness coach Kari Samuels recommends that you \"pay attention to your dreams because your dreams are always telling you something that your conscious mind doesn't want to pick up on.\""

Keep your bedroom cool and completely dark at night. Take a warm bath or shower 20-30 minutes before bed. Avoid caffeine for at least 6 hours before you plan to go to bed."
