If the temperature gauge or overheating indicator on your dash doesn't work you can replace the radiator cap with an aftermarket cap that has a built in temperature gauge. Also be sure to check the wiring on the fan."

      "content": "Is the thermostat opening when it should? A typical thermostat will open around 195 degrees. One indication of a failed thermostat is when your heater doesn't put out much heat. Be sure your engine cooling system is properly filled with the proper coolant/water mix when diagnosing the thermostat this way. Whenever you add coolant mix be sure to check it with a tester that can be bought for just a few dollars at any parts store."

      "title": "Check to make sure you are using the proper fuel.",
      "content": "Check to make sure you are using the proper fuel. In order for the fuel to ignite at the proper time during the combustion cycle, you have to use at least the recommended minimum octane level. In the US this, is usually 87, but there are some higher end performance cars that require higher. [1] X Research source Check your owner’s manual if you are unsure what octane rating your car uses."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add an octane booster.",
      "content": "Add an octane booster. If you discover that you have been using the wrong fuel, you can add an octane booster to your tank. It doesn’t matter much which brand you choose as they are designed to simply increase the octane level of your fuel, allowing you to use the gas in your tank. [2] X Research source Adding the booster is quite simple ― you just pour it into your gas tank."
    },
    {
      "title": "Buy the right gas.",
      "content": "Buy the right gas. Using an octane booster to get through your last tank of low octane fuel is fine, but from now, on you want to buy the right kind of fuel. You should also keep in mind that whatever low octane fuel is left in your tank when you fill up will mix with your new fuel, so if knocking continues, go ahead and use the octane booster for another fill-up or two until most of the low octane fuel is gone. It is also thought that using a \"top-tier\" gasoline such as Shell or Chevron will decrease engine deposits that can cause knocking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider cleaning your cylinders.",
      "content": "Consider cleaning your cylinders. Again, using the wrong fuel can be an issue. Not only can it cause knocking by igniting at the wrong time, it can also leave excess contaminants in your cylinders as a result of poor combustion. If you are now using the proper fuel, you may need to clean out the contaminants left by past fuels."

    {
      "title": "Use a fuel additive.",
      "content": "Use a fuel additive. While most fuels have a specified amount of detergent in them (at least in the US), this may not always be enough to keep your combustion chamber clean. Using top tier gasoline brands will provide more detergents that help keep your engine clean. Another way to clean your cylinders is to add a detergent to your fuel. This is as easy as buying a fuel additive at your local parts store and pouring it into your gas tank at your next fill up. [3] X Research source This step is very simple. Just choose an additive and follow the directions on the bottle for putting it in your gas tank."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flush your engine.",
      "content": "Flush your engine. If detergent hasn't gotten your engine running right, you can try an engine flush such as Seafoam. The flush reacts with the carbon deposits to remove them from your intake system, including the combustion chamber. Be aware that, when starting your engine for the first time after the flush, there will be a lot of smoke."

A faulty spark plug OR wire can be the cause of engine knocking, and is bad for your engine overall. Check for corroded spark plug ends. If a plug wire is left disconnected it has the potential to collect moisture. Did the previous owner let this happen and now months later corrosion has taken its toll?

      "content": "Check your spark plugs. You want to be sure that replacing the spark plugs will help. You can usually tell if there is a problem just by the residue left on your spark plug. A normal plug should have only brownish grey residue on the side electrode. If this is the only residue and the plug is otherwise intact, you should just clean it with a wire brush and fuel injector cleaner rather than replace it. [6] X Research source"

Some plugs take just the right size of ratchet to fit into tight spots. Take photos to remember how parts of the engine go back on if they need removed to make the job easier. [7] X Research source If you have never changed spark plugs before you should consult How to Change Spark Plugs in a Car Always replace spark plugs one at a time to avoid backfiring."

The marks will be numbered to eight or twelve, with zero in the middle. The word “Before” and “After” may also be stamped into the metal near the gap. Sometimes the gap is covered with a plastic or rubber cap. This keeps dirt out of the bellhousing."

What this means, is that the mark indicates how far from the top the piston is when the spark ignites the fuel. If your numbers are in the range specified in your owner’s manual or service manual, your timing does not need adjusted. [9] X Research source If not, you will need to adjust your timing to fix the knocking."
