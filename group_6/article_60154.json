      "content": "Coat your hair with pomade . Use your fingers to apply a liberal amount of strong-hold pomade to your hair, focusing on the top and sides. Pomade is the classic product used to create this sleek and shiny look, and it’ll help keep your hair slicked back until you wash it out. [1] X Research source Pomade was classically oil-based. Oil-based pomade creates the classic sheen and holds that made the slicked look popular. [2] X Research source However, oil is difficult to wash out, so you may want to look for a strong-hold pomade that does not list oil as a main ingredient. Gel is a good alternative if your hair isn't too thick. Gel typically results in a dryer hold and may take on a slightly crunchy texture. This works best with finer, lighter hair types since it may not be strong enough to hold heavier hair in place."

The classic slick does not include a part, so just run the comb straight back. Do this several times so the top of your hair lies flat from front to back. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Continue to comb your hair back to create the shape you want. In most cases, 6 or 7 comb-throughs (or “slicks”) should be enough to create this quick style. Aim to style your hair in as few slicks as possible to evenly distribute the pomade. If you handle it too much, it may begin to look messy."

For this style, you want the roots to maintain some volume rather than lying completely flat. With the modern slick, you can choose not to slick back the sides. This works particularly well if you have a faded haircut, with much shorter hair on the sides than on top. If you have long hair on the sides, slick it from your temples to the back of your head."

      "content": "Use your fingers to add volume. Hair stylist Martin Nepton recommends using your fingers to add volume and height to your hair, especially if you’re going for a modern, tousled look. After initially combing your hair back, put the comb down and use your fingers to achieve the look you want. Run your fingers through your hair and gently lift it at the roots so it doesn't lie flat. Use a hair dryer set to low to help add volume while finger combing. Point the blow dryer away from your forehead toward your crown so your hair dries in a slicked-back position. [6] X Research source Use more pomade as necessary to create the look you want. Then, finish with a little hairspray to help your hair keep its shape. If you prefer a traditional slick back that’s flat against your head, no problem! Just skip this step."

Nepton suggests avoiding adding product to the ends of your hair, as it could weigh it down or make it look greasy. Consider using a wide-toothed comb to help diffuse the product over the length of your hair. This will keep you from having a defined product line by creating a slow transition between the parts with product and those without."
