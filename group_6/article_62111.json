      "title": "Holding your face is almost always a good sign.",
      "content": "Holding your face is almost always a good sign. If you and your partner are making out and they suddenly reach their hands up to cup your face, they’re probably having a good time. You can take it as a compliment and return the favor. [1] X Research source They also might stroke your cheek or grab the back of your head. These are all good signs!"

      "title": "Cupping someone’s face is pretty intimate.",
      "content": "Cupping someone’s face is pretty intimate. Most people don’t do this while kissing unless they really like someone. If you 2 are still getting to know each other, them holding your face is a good sign that things are progressing. [2] X Research source It also shows that they feel more comfortable around you."
    },
    {
      "title": "They could be gauging your reaction as they hold your face.",
      "content": "They could be gauging your reaction as they hold your face. If you lean into their hand and kiss them back passionately, they’ll most likely get the message that you like them a lot. If you stay stiff and pull away quickly, they might think that you aren’t really feeling it. [3] X Research source You could even rub your partner’s body with your hands to really show them that you like them ."

    {
      "title": "Maybe they break away after kissing just to hold eye contact.",
      "content": "Maybe they break away after kissing just to hold eye contact. If they still have their hand on your face, they might want to share a connection with you. Follow their lead and respond with passion (if you want to, of course). [4] X Research source Your partner also might grab your face and look you in the eyes right before a passionate kiss ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have you ever been kissed and the whole world just melts away?",
      "content": "Have you ever been kissed and the whole world just melts away? A gentle hand on your cheek can help the kiss transport you there. If you’re feeling stressed or you’ve had a bad week, your partner might hold your face while kissing to get you to focus on the kiss and nothing else. [5] X Research source They also might do this if you 2 are kissing in public ."
    },
    {
      "title": "It’s like they’re checking to make sure you’re really real.",
      "content": "It’s like they’re checking to make sure you’re really real. If someone strokes your face while you 2 are kissing, they might be giving you a compliment. A gentle touch or a light flutter probably means you’ve shocked them by being so gorgeous. [6] X Research source Of course, they might just tell you how pretty you are, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "They might be switching it up to woo you.",
      "content": "They might be switching it up to woo you. Kissing is fun, but the same old thing can get boring after a while. If your partner starts holding your face while kissing and they never used to, it might be a way to make you feel special. Again, this is a good sign: anything your partner does to try and make you feel good is a step in the right direction."

    {
      "title": "Maybe you’ve been away for a while and couldn’t see each other.",
      "content": "Maybe you’ve been away for a while and couldn’t see each other. If the first kiss after you get back together involves them holding your face, they’re probably trying to say that they’re glad you’re back. They might also break away and look into your eyes with a big smile on their face. [7] X Research source They might hold your face with both hands, signaling that they don’t want to let you go."
    },
    {
      "title": "A hand on the face is a gentle way of getting you to focus.",
      "content": "A hand on the face is a gentle way of getting you to focus. Between kids, jobs, and responsibilities, it can be easy to ignore the passion in our relationships. If you and your partner haven’t been intimate for a while, they could be signaling that they’re trying to reconnect with you. [8] X Research source You shouldn’t take this as an attack—your partner switching up their kissing style is a way to draw you back in, not push you away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Holding your face could mean they want to progress physically.",
      "content": "Holding your face could mean they want to progress physically. If you 2 are getting hot and heavy and they all of the sudden hold your face, it’s another way of feeling close and intimate. While you should always get your partner’s consent before anything physical, a hand on the face while kissing is a good sign that things are headed that way. [9] X Research source Some people consider a hand on the face to be more intimate than a hand on your body."
