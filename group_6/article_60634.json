In order to save space, many laptops come with attached graphics processing units (GPUs) that are hardwired into your processor and motherboard. That means that in order to get a new video card for you computer you'd need to get a new processor, which is expensive enough that a new laptop is often the better buy. You need a PCI or MXM slot to upgrade your video card. [1] X Research source"

To do so, go to your Control Panel → Hardware and Sound → Device Manager, or search for it in the Windows search bar. Click \"Display Adapters\" and see what comes up. If you see an Intel Chip, or the words \"Integrated Graphics,\" then you have an attached GPU and you cannot swap your video card. If there are two options, such as Intel graphics and an ATI or nVidia card, you have a discrete graphics card that may be possible to swap out. Note, however, that many laptop manufacturers solder the GPU to the motherboard, so they may not be easily replaceable. If your only option under \"Display Adapters\" is the same make as the chip in the \"Processors\" section, you have an integrated GPU that cannot be upgraded. [2] X Research source"

So HP users should check with HP, Dell with Dell, etc. Unless you have a dedicated, removable video card, you cannot just buy the newest video card online and plug it in. In your user manual there will be a list of acceptable chip upgrades, and you must choose one that works with your computer. Unfortunately, due to speed, software challenges, and even physical size, you will be very limited in the number of video cards you can purchase for your laptop, and your manufacturer will list them all.

Every laptop is different, but the odds are good that you need to go all the way into the guts of the computer to get your old video card out and the new one in.

HP's popular Pavilion dv series, for example, requires that you remove the battery, optical drive, WLAN, hard drive, keyboard, system board, top cover, and fan in order to adjust the processor and video card. This means you need to know your computer from top to bottom before beginning, as you'll have your work cut out for you.

This will help you work backward when you need to put the computer back together. Use cups or bowls to organize screws, keeping a cup of the appropriate connections next to the corresponding part to avoid losing anything. [10] X Research source"

Don't bend, jiggle, or yank on either card -- they should slide in and out relatively easily once you undo the safety latches on the sides. If it does not, check for any forgotten screws or safety latches, use some compressed air to clean out the port, and try again. [11] X Research source"
