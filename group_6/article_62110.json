      "content": "Guys send good morning texts when they like you. Great news: if you’re getting good morning texts almost every day, it probably means the guy you’re texting is into you! Typically, guys won’t send good morning texts to someone unless they really like them. If you two aren’t in a relationship just yet, there’s a good chance that you will be soon. [1] X Research source If you're getting a \"good morning\" text, you already have built a level of rapport that is deeper than just meeting each other right away."

      "title": "A guy might text you first thing to let you know you’re on his mind.",
      "content": "A guy might text you first thing to let you know you’re on his mind. He wants you to know that you’re the first thing that pops into his head when he wakes up. If he dreams about you or he just can’t stop thinking about you, there’s a good chance he’ll send you a good morning text to say hello. [2] X Research source The same thing goes for good night texts—if your guy texts you good night a lot, it means you’re the last thing on his mind before he falls asleep."

    {
      "title": "He texts you first.",
      "content": "He texts you first. When someone reaches out to you first, it means they were itching to chat with you. If the guy you’re talking to is almost always the one texting first, there’s a pretty high chance that he really likes you. [3] X Research source Try to make an effort to text him first sometimes, too! That way, he knows you like him back."
    },
    {
      "title": "He responds quickly.",
      "content": "He responds quickly. Super fast response times typically mean that this guy really likes talking to you. If he always texts you back within just a few minutes, there’s a good chance that he’s into you. If he doesn’t reply super quickly, think about his daily schedule. Maybe he’s not texting back quickly because he’s at work or in class."

    {
      "title": "He brings up new things to talk about.",
      "content": "He brings up new things to talk about. When someone wants to talk to you, they’ll be willing to talk about anything under the sun. You might notice that the guy you’re chatting with always brings up new topics when your conversation starts to die out. This is a great sign, because it means he’s looking for a way to keep texting you. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "He tries to get to know you.",
      "content": "He tries to get to know you. You might notice that he asks you lots of questions, like, “Who’s your best friend?” or, “What’s your favorite food?” Questions like these let him know who you are as a person, and they show that he wants to learn more about you. Guys typically don’t put in this much effort unless they like you, so it’s a great sign!"

    {
      "title": "He makes plans to see you.",
      "content": "He makes plans to see you. Texting is nice, but hanging out in person is nicer. If your guy constantly tries to take you out on a date or meet up, it means he’s super serious about taking you out. This is an awesome sign, since it shows he’s serious about you and getting to know you IRL."

      "title": "Yes, because texting every day makes your connection stronger.",
      "content": "Yes, because texting every day makes your connection stronger. Even when you aren’t chatting in-person, you’re still getting to know each other through text. When you text every day, you’re building a strong bond that you can continue to build when you meet up IRL.

For instance, if your guy always texts you “good morning” at 6 AM, he’s probably an early bird. Or, if he texts you good morning and tells you that he’s got a busy day ahead, you’ll know that you probably won’t hear from him much later on."

      "title": "Tell him how happy you are to hear from him.",
      "content": "Tell him how happy you are to hear from him. When you respond to a good morning text , make sure he knows you appreciate it. The more he hears that you like it, the more he’ll keep doing it! You could say something like: “Morning! I love waking up to your text every day.” “Good morning! It makes me so happy to see a message from you when I wake up.” Feel free to share something exciting about your upcoming day in your message, too."

    {
      "title": "Tell him you hope he has a great day.",
      "content": "Tell him you hope he has a great day. If you aren’t able to text a ton throughout the day, leave him with a sweet message. Wish him luck on anything important coming up, and tell him that you’ll talk to him later. “Good luck on your meeting! I know you’re gonna be great. Text me after?” “Have a great day! I’ll talk to you later this afternoon.” You can also ask him what he's looking forward to that day."
