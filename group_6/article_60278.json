      "content": "Before starting the spiritual cleansing process, there are several important steps that must not be skipped: [1] X Research source Thoroughly clean out the junk and unnecessary items from your house (physically). Give what you don't need to others who do, or have a garage sale and give what remains to others (as long as it is in good condition, of course). Many times, spiritual unrest follows a disorganized venue. Thoroughly clean your house, top to bottom: literally, ceilings and attic to floor and basement. wash the walls (dilute vinegar or lemon water are quickest and easiest), dust, vacuum, clean carpets... and don't forget those sundry storage places like garages and sheds. Air out the house for several days if you can. With all the windows and screens now clean and fresh, the fans and ducts without dust and mold, you can literally say out with the old and in with the new air in your house. So if the weather is going to be nasty for a few days, use that time to clean out..then let the house air out during the lovely fresh-aired days following. turn off the HVAC unit and open everything you can open. This is a good idea to do twice a year (spring and fall) anyway."

An example of a Universalist prayer: \"May the blending the elements of pure salt to preserve the sanctity and pure water cleanse this space, in the Name of .........\" (here add your own prayer or finish the invocation to whichever deity you have belief in). Do this in a sacred and meaningful way, in the knowledge that you are creating a powerful medicine to cleanse and heal your home."
