      "content": "Intelligent Gemini is an air sign, which means Gemini guys tend to favor reason and intellect. If you're a smart, well-read woman with a good head on your shoulders, you're already halfway into that Gemini guy's heart. Find a way to make him laugh with your cleverness and he'll definitely be interested in seeing more of you. To attract him: If you're standing near him, drop a joking observation about something going on around you—even better if it includes a pun or some clever wordplay. Divina notes that Geminis are very \"mental and so you could be playful with words, for example, creative with words, that would work really well for someone who's a very strong Gemini.\""

To attract him: Don't shy away from telling him all the different things you have on your plate. Let him know that you've got a lot going on and are living a perfectly fulfilling life on your own.

To attract him: Go ahead and wear that yellow bodycon dress, since yellow is the best color for Gemini . Throw a comfy cardigan over it and don't forget those heels!"

      "title": "He prefers to talk it out.",
      "content": "He prefers to talk it out. Gemini guys are super-analytical, thanks in part to their ruling planet Mercury, which represents the intellect and the mind. Whenever he and his partner get in a spat, he's not one to let his emotions take over. On the contrary, he wants to sit down and reason everything out until both of you have hammered out all the issues and found solutions you can both deal with. [2] X Research source What to do: Be open and honest with him. There's never a problem that he can't find a solution to if he has all the necessary facts in front of him. This also makes him a good partner because he's happy to sacrifice if it's rational to do so."

    {
      "title": "He changes his mind frequently.",
      "content": "He changes his mind frequently. A Gemini guy can see the benefits of doing almost anything and doesn't want to miss out—so he can have a hard time choosing one thing when that means rejecting another. You might find this annoying if you're someone who's incredibly resolute and confident in your decisions. [3] X Research source What to do: Narrow his options so that it's easier to choose. For example, if you're trying to decide on a restaurant, you might list 2 specific places rather than just saying you feel like Mexican food."

      "title": "He's playful and spontaneous.",
      "content": "He's playful and spontaneous. A Gemini guy often feels like a young boy trapped in a man's body. He bounds through life in a light-hearted way with a carefree attitude that can be contagious. In a relationship, he prefers if things stay light. It's not that he's afraid to work on serious issues—he just isn't likely to stick in a relationship that has serious issues coming up constantly. What to do: Create space in your lives for play and spontaneity. Be willing to have fun and be silly with him from time to time. If your Gemini guy is playful with you, that's how you can tell he really loves you. Divina agrees that if you wanted to flirt with a Gemini, \"you would want to be playful.\""

      "title": "He can seem inconsistent.",
      "content": "He can seem inconsistent. It may just be because he tends to change his mind a lot, but a Gemini guy can seem somewhat hard to depend on sometimes. It's not that he doesn't care, it's just that he'll decide to do something else and then go and do that—forgetting all about what he previously said he was going to do. What to do: If something bothers you, say something—don't bury your feelings. Figure out how the two of you can work together to keep it from happening again. For example, you might say, \"I was upset when you didn't show up at my nephew's game. I was really excited for you to meet my family. Could you make it a priority next time?\""

      "title": "He gets bored easily.",
      "content": "He gets bored easily. It's not that he has a wandering eye—once he commits to a relationship, he's more than capable of being loyal. Getting him to commit might be the biggest challenge because as soon as he starts to feel bored, he's likely to want to move on to something else that will be new and exciting again. What to do: Suggest spontaneous outings. Change up the routine or ask him to meet you up at different times of the day. Get involved in new hobbies and try new activities that show up on your radar. Divina agrees, noting that \"Geminis are also dual-minded about things. And so showing them both sides of a coin, 'Hey do you prefer this or that?' Would be a very entertaining conversation for a Gemini, they probably prefer both of everything.\""

      "content": "Gemini gets along best with fellow air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius ). Gemini is driven by reason and the mind, so it stands to reason that he gets along with other analytical signs. These signs have an innate understanding of each other and feel warmth where other signs would likely feel a chill. [4] X Research source Of the air signs, Libra is probably best-suited to Gemini if you're looking for something long-term. With a fellow Gemini, they often end up reinforcing each other's worst qualities, get bored, and quickly move on. While a Gemini guy still has a strong shot with an Aquarius lady, it's important that their goals in life and overall outlooks are compatible. Otherwise, he'll see more challenges with her than he would with other air signs."

      "content": "Gemini has a lot in common with fire signs ( Aries , Leo , Sagittarius ). Fire signs tend to be pretty active and that works well for Gemini since he also tends to be pretty spontaneous. Fire signs are also friendly and social, which makes them likely to cross paths frequently with Gemini guys. Gemini guys probably get along best with Aries ladies. They're both pretty active and on the go, so they lead similar lifestyles. As long as he can understand that sometimes she just doesn't want to discuss everything, they'll get along just fine. The toughest fire sign for Gemini is probably Sagittarius. This is a case of opposites attract, which means they'll find each other fascinating but likely also frustrating. If they want to make it work, they have to learn to overcome their differences."

      "title": "Gemini has a hard time understanding water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces).",
      "content": "Gemini has a hard time understanding water signs ( Cancer , Scorpio , Pisces ). Water signs are the most emotional in the zodiac, and Gemini guys are logical and analytical. They're just not going to understand where a Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces lady is coming from, most of the time. This makes it really difficult for them to connect. A Gemini guy has his best shot with a Cancer woman. She's attracted to Gemini's rational nature and he's attracted to her sensitivity and emotional depth. Plus, Gemini guys like to talk and Cancer ladies tend to be very good listeners. Pisces ladies spell trouble for Gemini fellas. That's not to say they can't live happily ever after, but dreamy, intuitive Pisces makes no sense to rational, analytical Gemini. To make it work, they have to learn to appreciate each other's perspectives."

      "title": "Gemini tends to clash with earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn).",
      "content": "Gemini tends to clash with earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn ). At best, Gemini guys and earth sign ladies don't really understand each other. Because they have vastly different values and emotional styles, it can be hard for them to communicate well—although they can always make it work if they're willing to make some adjustments. Taurus is probably Gemini's best chance for happiness with an earth sign. Taurus ladies are stable and grounded, which balances out Gemini's flighty nature. They can go far as long as they can learn to respect each other's different ways of handling things. A Gemini guy is probably going to have the most challenges with a Virgo woman. He's spontaneous and often a risk-taker, while Virgo is more cautious and prefers to play it safe. They are both very rational, though, so it's possible for them to have a strong mental connection."
