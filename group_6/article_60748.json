      "content": "Craft a Lead. While you can't technically tame a Polar Bear in Minecraft , you can use a Lead on Polar Bear mobs to bring them back to your base. You can craft a Lead with four Strings and a Slimeball. Place the Slimeball in the middle of the 3x3 crafting grid. Then place one String in the top left corner of the grid, one in the bottom right corner of the grid, one directly to the left of the Slimeball, and the final String directly above the Slimeball.

      "content": "Find a Polar Bear. Lone Polar Bears are easier to get, because Polar Bears with cubs will be hostile, though you can still leash them (and their cubs). In Bedrock edition, Polar Bears are always hostile if approached. You'll need one Lead per Polar Bear you're trying to obtain. If you want to get more than one Polar Bear, bring a few Leads along with you."
