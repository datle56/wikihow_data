      "content": "Wear tops that show off your cleavage. While this may seem like a given, the right top is absolutely essential when showing cleavage. You can't show something that's covered up. While a turtleneck sweater may make your bust look fantastic, it will hide your cleavage. Make sure what you're wearing is cut for visible cleavage. Some classic examples are: V-neck sweaters, t-shirts, and tank tops. [1] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 25 September 2020. Button-up blouses.

      "content": "Leave your top buttons undone. This is a trick you can use to instantly go from modest to sexy and back again. If you're wearing a button-up blouse, simply unbutton the top few buttons. You can create a plunging neckline by leaving many undone or show just a classy hint of cleavage by buttoning a little higher. This versatility will let you wear the same thing to the office and to a party without needing to stop at home to change."

      "content": "Wear tops with eye-catching designs. When you're showing off your assets, you're likely to want some attention drawn their way. A good way to draw the eye towards your cleavage is to wear a top with not only a low neckline but also an interesting design. If your blouse is plain or a solid color, wear an eye-grabbing pin or brooch near your cleavage.

      "content": "Make sure a strapless outfit has enough support . This can come from within the outfit itself if it has built-in boning. Otherwise, you will need to find the right strapless bra for the job. Find one with enough support to keep your cleavage looking great while keeping everything in place. Keep in mind that a strapless bra can push your breasts up too far. Make sure your cleavage looks natural. Before heading out for a night on the town, try jumping in front of a mirror while wearing your outfit. If you find your breasts jiggling too much, your top sliding off, or your bra peaking out, reevaluate your outfit. You don't want anything to pop out unexpectedly on the dance floor. For formal events, such as a wedding, consider being fitted for a bodice. A bodice will both keep your cleavage in place and make you look a little trimmer."

      "title": "Keep the dress code in mind.",
      "content": "Keep the dress code in mind. Every type of job and work environment will have its own rules when it comes to cleavage. Many offices are fine with a hint of cleavage, while others are more strict. Some professions may even be fine with a plunging neckline. If you aren't sure what your work's dress code is, try asking your supervisor or checking the employee handbook. When you're starting a new job, try to remember how people dressed during your interview. When in doubt, it's best to err on the side of caution and keep the cleavage to a minimum."

      "content": "Make sure your bras fit correctly . When showing cleavage, you want your breasts looking their best, and an ill-fitting bra won't be able to do that. Your breasts should fit perfectly inside the cups without any bulging at the top, bottom, or sides. Your bra should sit firmly and horizontally across your back without riding up as the day goes on. If your bra has an underwire, make sure it fits against your chest without gaps or pinching. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider sporting a push-up bra. Push-up bras are essential for creating the sexiest cleavage possible, especially for women who may be less well-endowed. These bras are specifically designed to increase the appearance of cleavage. Push-up bras work to push your breasts both upward and together, giving you a fuller, perkier look. If the pushup isn't enough for you, tie it in the back"

      "title": "Give silicone bra inserts a try.",
      "content": "Give silicone bra inserts a try. Also called \"cutlets,\" inserts can both enhance cleavage and add volume to your breasts. Position an insert low on the exterior side of each breast. This will push your breasts inward, creating better cleavage. When wearing inserts, you may need to wear a bra that's at least one cup size larger than what you'd wear with unenhanced breasts."

      "content": "Wear makeup. If you want the focus to be on your breasts, make sure to take the time to make them look their best. Pat on some powder and bronzer before going out. Try to make the color of your cleavage match your face. Don't go so far as to pile on foundation, however. If you want to hide blemishes, stick with a light concealer."

      "title": "Use double-sided tape.",
      "content": "Use double-sided tape. Celebrities seem to get away with extreme plunging necklines while experiencing relatively few wardrobe malfunctions. If you're curious as to how this is accomplished, the secret is simple: double-sided tape. Double-sided sticky tape mounted along the inside of their tops keeps their clothing stuck perfectly in place. This is vital when you're sporting a plunging neckline without a bra if you don't want to flash your nipples. Breast lift tape, designed especially for holding up breasts, will also work well for keeping them in place. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Know what to wear underneath. You have a few different options for how to handle your undergarments when wearing a plunging neckline. The easiest and usually best-looking option is to simply go braless. However, this can be difficult to pull off and may not feel comfortable for everyone. If you're going braless, consider wearing nipple covers, also called \"pasties\" or \"petals,\" in case of slippage. A thin, understated bralette or triangle bra can give you support while keeping your cleavage in full view. A bandeau covers up some cleavage but works well in more casual settings. Because plunging necklines are trendy, deep plunge bras made especially for this look are becoming more common. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Layer with sheer fabric. Do you want to wear a plunging neckline but still feel a little self-conscious? Consider sheer layering. Pair a sheer, high-cut top over a solid one with a plunging neckline. This combination will put your cleavage on full display while masking any minor skin imperfections in that area."
