The is essentially a snapshot of your computer before the change was made (program installation or uninstallation, driver update, etc.). If something goes wrong because of the change you made, you can use the System Restore point to roll your system back without losing your files. System Restore can't help you recover lost text documents, but it could be helpful if a driver or software update isn't working on your computer. While a system restore shouldn't affect your personal files, it never hurts to have a recent backup in case something goes wrong. Click here for tips on quickly backing up your important files .
