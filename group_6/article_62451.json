      "content": "A low battery can randomly disconnect your PS4 controller. A low battery is the most common reason a PS4 controller keeps disconnecting from a console. You can check your battery life by pressing the PS button to open the Quick Menu and look for the battery icon on the far left side of your screen. If it's low (like 1 bar is left), plug it in and let it charge for a while to see if that solves your issue. If not, continue to the following troubleshooting steps."

Not everyone can access another PS4, but this step can help you identify if your controller or console is to blame. If you can, use a friend's PS4 to connect your controller and see if your controller keeps disconnecting. If your controller doesn't stay connected to your friend's PS4, then you know the problem is with your controller. If your controller stays connected, you'll know the issue is your console."
