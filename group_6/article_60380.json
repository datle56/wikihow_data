      "content": "Think of a name. [1] X Research source When thinking of a brand name, it's usually best to get a notepad ready for a list that will help you remember all the name and make the process of elimination easier. Try to think of something that emphasises your persona or brand message."

      "title": "Practice makes perfect.",
      "content": "Practice makes perfect. Go on the Internet to try to find some accessory-making courses/classes. This will help make your brand more original, creative and will also make your days a bit easier."

    {
      "title": "Choose your brand's theme.",
      "content": "Choose your brand's theme. [2] X Research source Consider how you want to represent yourself and your brand. If you're a happy person, opt for light colours and fun designs. If you're a serious, practical person, design the whole brand to how it suits you! This is one of the most important parts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get inspired.",
      "content": "Get inspired. [3] X Research source Before you actually start making anything or finalising your brand, go to craft fairs and look at some of the homemade jewelry they have created. Take a note down of the properties and design features of the ones that you like so you can mix them up and add to yours when you do start making!"

      "content": "Make the jewelry! If you couldn't find much inspiration, go on YouTube and see how they make the jewelry in different ways to give effect."

    {
      "title": "Tell and show people.",
      "content": "Tell and show people. After making all your fabulous pieces, it's time to spread the word and put on a jewelry party! Get a few friends to come round, have a few drinks, mingle but most importantly, ask for feedback and try to sell the bracelets! Obviously, you shouldn't have high prices as they are not part of a big brand yet, but hopefully soon will be!"

    {
      "title": "Advertise your products.",
      "content": "Advertise your products. [5] X Research source Put flyers up around town and posting business cards on bulletin boards really help improve business. Also, setting up your own website is another really helpful way to get people to buy your jewelry and try to get 'founded' by shops and big accessory brands."

    {
      "title": "Meet the managers.",
      "content": "Meet the managers. If the jewelry is selling, it's time to talk to some high street store managers that could maybe give you a brand funded by that shop. Making an appointment with a lower end fashion store is a good way to start. Keep on trying until you finally get accepted."

    {
      "title": "Help out.",
      "content": "Help out. As you went to craft fairs earlier on, do the same and sell some of your accessories there, maybe to help someone in the same position as you were! Make multiple of the same design just in case some are more popular than others."

    {
      "title": "Have a grand opening.",
      "content": "Have a grand opening. [6] X Research source if you think you have enough money, and the accessories will do well enough, maybe it's time to open up your own shop! Look around town and the high street to see if there are any places to let, or set up your own stall in the middle of a shopping centre. You could maybe think about getting a ground floor apartment close to where you live and use that as the shop, with the landlord's permission."

      "content": "Get some staff and your own shop! As the job market is rapidly getting lower, you could help a non-working friend out by giving them a job. Even though you have your own business, it never hurts to carry the store on and try to set up a brand in another shop. [7] X Research source Choose an employee of the month. [8] X Research source"
