      "title": "Have a place to put the wrappers, bottles, etc.",
      "content": "Have a place to put the wrappers, bottles, etc. You don't want to put them in the trashcan (unless it's in your room) because then your parents will notice. If there's already trash in the trashcan, stick the wrappers and bottles under something else."

      "content": "Wait until your parents are asleep. Even if they are dozing off, it will help a lot! Waiting until your parents are asleep will minimize the likelihood that you get caught."

      "title": "Quietly get out of bed.",
      "content": "Quietly get out of bed. Roll over to the edge slowly (beds creak a lot) and sit up. Then take an empty glass/bottle to fill with water. This will give you an excuse in case they catch you."

    {
      "title": "Walk to your kitchen quietly by crouching low to the ground.",
      "content": "Walk to your kitchen quietly by crouching low to the ground. Step softly on the ground. You can do this by stepping using the balls of your feet. It can help to keep your steps in rhythm, because sudden noises are more likely to draw attention. Try counting 1-2-3-4 steadily in your head, and placing your foot down only on the count of 4. Walk slowly and try not to make the floor creak. Walking close to walls will make less noise, as there will be less strain on the floorboards."

      "title": "Learn to listen and feel.",
      "content": "Learn to listen and feel. Stay quiet for a few seconds and try to feel the ground and listen to everything. Paying attention to your surroundings can make sure you know if your parents are around!"

    {
      "title": "Open things slowly.",
      "content": "Open things slowly. Being gentle when opening cabinets, drawers, the fridge, or doors will help make sure they open quietly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Carefully take the food out.",
      "content": "Carefully take the food out. Don't mess with food wrappers because they will make noise! If you can, try sneaking out quieter foods, such as chewy candy, chewy granola bars, or soft cookies, instead of louder foods like chips, crackers, or foods with crinkly wrappers. If you choose foods that have wrappers or make a lot of noise when you eat them, you'll be more likely to get caught."

      "title": "Have somewhere to put the food.",
      "content": "Have somewhere to put the food. If you have a large pocket it would work, or stuff it down your shirt or pants!"

      "title": "Go back to your bedroom.",
      "content": "Go back to your bedroom. With your food hidden, quietly go back to your room. Remember to make sure your steps are quiet and remind yourself of the 1, 2, 3, 4 count step!"

      "title": "Enjoy the food!",
      "content": "Enjoy the food! But be quiet eating it, as you could still get caught if youâ€™re not quiet."
