      "content": "Excessive data usage. One of the biggest signs you might have spyware on your iPhone is if you notice higher-than-usual data or internet usage.

      "content": "Phishing. Spyware attacks tend to be very targeted. Phishing is when an attacker sends a malicious email disguised as a legitimate email. The goal is to trick you into giving away your private credentials, such as your login information. Phishing emails may also contain links that download spyware. If you receive an email requesting your login information, don't provide it. If you get an email claiming there is a problem with any of your accounts, contact the company or service directly instead of responding to the email. Do not click any links in the email. Instead, log in to their official website or official app."

Malicious websites may disguise themselves as legitimate websites to trick you into giving your credentials or installing tracking cookies that track your browsing habits. Only visit official websites that are well known. Be careful about websites that request access to your phone's features, such as your camera, microphone, or contacts. Don't fall for scare tactics. If you see a website warning you that your iPhone may be infected with malware, the site is trying to trick you into downloading malware. Apple does not ever display messages about your iPhone being infected with spyware, viruses, or other malwareâ€”this is always a scam."

They can set up a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot that appears similar to a legitimate public Wi-Fi hotspot. Once users connect, the attacker has access to their system. Avoid connecting to public Wi-Fi to prevent Wi-Fi spoofing. Use 4G or 5G data instead. If you need to connect to a public Wi-Fi hotspot, check with the establishment to ensure you have the correct one. If you must connect to public Wi-Fi, never do so without first connecting to a VPN ."

Not only does this put you at greater risk, but it can also void your iPhone warranty. Only download official apps from the App Store."
