      "content": "Mix in unflavored yogurt. A thick yogurt, like Greek yogurt, works best. Simply add a small amount of yogurt, like a spoonful, at a time. Stir your yogurt into the curry and keep adding a little more at a time until it reaches your desired thickness. [1] X Research source This is great for Indian-style curries as a cream substitute. It can also come in handy if your curry is a little spicier than you would like, as it can cool your curry down."

    {
      "title": "Try tomato paste or puree.",
      "content": "Try tomato paste or puree. This works best for curries that are already tomato-based, as it won't affect the flavor too much. Tomato puree is usually thicker than paste and has a slightly stronger flavor. Mix in a small amount of tomato puree or paste into the curry. Add a little at a time until the curry gets as thick as you want. [2] X Research source If you don't have puree or paste, you can try diced tomatoes. For best results, add tomatoes or tomato puree during the cooking process rather than after."

It may reduce in a few minutes or it may need 10 to 20 minutes to thicken."

      "content": "Add water if your curry gets too thick. Sometimes, curry can reduce too much when simmering. This may result in a curry that's too thick. Simply add a little bit of water at a time in this case until your curry gets to the right consistency."
