      "content": "Ponte pants are a blend between skinny jeans and leggings. Ponte pants are made of ponte fabric, which is a thick, double-knit fabric with a 2-way stretch. This gives ponte pants the structure and put-together look of jeans and the flexibility and comfort of leggings. The thick, fitted fabric smoothes and supports your body while the tailored fit ensures you look stylish at work, at home, and out on the town. [1] X Research source Ponte fabric is typically made out of polyester, rayon, and elastic. This gives the pants a thick, durable feel while remaining soft and stretchy. While most ponte pants fit like skinny jeans, they also come in straight-leg, wide-leg, bootcut, and flare fits. Many popular retailers sell ponte pants, like Nordstrom, Macy’s, Target, Chicos, Loft, J.Crew, Madewell, and more. Ponte pants are most commonly black or navy. However, they do come in different colors and patterns. While ponte pants are made out of a thick material, the fabric is very breathable. So, they’re perfect to wear during each season, including the summer."
