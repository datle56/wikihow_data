      "content": "Scrying is a form of divination using a reflective or illuminated surface. Divination is the art of trying to see into the future, and the word “scry” comes from the Old English word “descry,” which means “to see” and “to discover something concealed.” [1] X Research source When scrying, you stare into a surface, like a mirror, and wait for images to appear. Afterward, you can interpret these images to get a message. In folk magic, scrying is often used for fortune-telling and prophecy. Some people believe that scrying lets you tap into your unconscious. Because of this, it’s also a way to self-reflect and learn more about yourself."

      "title": "Mirror",
      "content": "Mirror Since they’re reflective, mirrors make an excellent scrying medium. Any size mirror will work, ranging from a handheld mirror up to a floor-to-ceiling mirror. The trick to using a mirror is to sit off to the side so that you’re not staring at your reflection. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Black Mirror",
      "content": "Black Mirror Black mirrors , often made from obsidian, have been a tool of divination since the Aztec and Mayan civilizations in ancient Mexico. [3] X Research source Black mirrors are reflective, but the color makes them a bit murky, which helps you see images in them. In modern witchcraft, some witches make black mirrors with paint instead of using obsidian. To make a black mirror, get a regular mirror or a pane of glass from a picture frame. Paint the mirror or glass with black matte spray paint. If you use glass, put it back into the frame with the painted side facing the wall. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Crystals You’ve probably seen depictions of a fortune teller staring into a crystal ball. That’s scrying! Crystal balls are a super common medium for scrying, but you can also use regular polished crystals if that’s all you have. [5] X Research source Many crystal balls are clear, but you can also use balls of rose quartz, obsidian, amethyst, or any other crystal."

      "title": "Glass",
      "content": "Glass While it’s not as reflective as a mirror, glass will reflect light—so you can use it to scry. Literally any glass will work, whether it’s a window, a cup, or the glass from a picture frame. [6] X Research source Since crystals are expensive, some modern “crystal” balls are actually made of glass. Luckily, you can still use glass crystal balls for scrying."

      "content": "Water Water is a traditional scrying medium that’s widely available and easy to use. At home, simply fill a glass or bowl with water. However, you can also use a body of water for scrying. [7] X Research source Look for images in both the reflective surface of the water and ripples in the water."

    {
      "title": "Fire",
      "content": "Fire Although fire isn’t reflective, it is illuminated. The flickering flame and the smoke that wafts up into the air can both be a medium for scrying. [8] X Research source A candle works perfectly for this, but you can also use a bonfire or hearth fire. Some people use the smoke from incense for scrying ."

      "title": "Wait until nightfall.",
      "content": "Wait until nightfall. Scrying is traditionally associated with moonlight, and it’s easier to receive the images in the dark. The best time to scry is after 10:00 p.m. because the moon is high, but anytime after sunset is fine. [9] X Research source If you can’t wait, turn off all the lights to get the room dark."

[10] X Research source Place your scrying medium on a stable surface or hold it in your hand, depending on what works best for you. If you’re using a reflective surface, like a mirror or crystal, position it so that you can’t see your reflection directly. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Light a candle and set it off to the side of your medium.",
      "content": "Light a candle and set it off to the side of your medium. Any kind of candle will work, but taper candles are more traditional. Place your candle so that it’s not directly reflected in the surface of your medium. The flickering light from the candle will give just enough light for you to see dim images on a reflective surface. [12] X Research source If you’re using fire as a medium, you don’t need to use an extra candle. If it’s a full moon, try using moonlight instead of a candle. Some people like to burn incense to help them get in the right mindset for scrying. You can use any incense, but frankincense incense is a great option because it helps with divination."

      "content": "Meditate to clear your mind. When you meditate, it’s like going into a trance. Sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Then, focus on your breath. Simply count your breaths as you inhale and exhale, letting your mind go blank. After a few minutes, you’ll be ready to start scrying. [13] X Research source If you’re new to meditation, it’s okay to use a guided meditation from YouTube or a free app like Calm , Insight Timer , or Headspace ."

      "content": "Ask a question if you have one. If there’s something specific you want to know about, state it as a question either aloud or in your mind. [14] X Research source It’s also okay to just see what images come to you. There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to scrying. “What should I do next to reach my goals?” “Should I take an art class or a writing workshop?” “How can I improve my life?” “Who lived here before me?”"

Interpret the message using your intuition as your guide. [17] X Research source Maybe you saw images of yourself or your friends. Letters might signify a name, place, or alternative option that you’re considering. You might see a place. Perhaps you saw symbols of a hobby you want to try, like paint for art or dishes for culinary arts."
