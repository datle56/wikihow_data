If you have an Android, press and hold the side button and then drag the slider to power off your phone. Press the side button again to turn it back on. If you have an iPhone, press and hold the side button and a volume button, drag the slider to power off your phone, and then press the side button again to turn your phone on. For iPhones with a Home button, press and hold the side button, drag the slider to power off, and then press the side button again to turn it back on. [1] X Research source"

You'll find the Wi-Fi icon and Bluetooth icons in the Quick Settings panel on Android and in Control Center on iPhone. Tap the icons to turn those features off."

Open your Phone app, click the History tab, and delete calls that have the RTT symbol next to them (it looks like a phone receiver over a grid of squares). Here are more detailed steps to do this in Android and here's how to delete calls from call history on iPhone. The RTT settings should be erased and no longer activate in calls."
