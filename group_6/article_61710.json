Some rifles require manual loading by placing the round behind the breech and SLIDING the round forward into it, until it is secure. Some rifles also have a built in magazine, that requires either a stripper clip or manual loading of each round. These rifles typically take 5-10 rounds. To load bullets manually in these rifles, push bullets down into magazine, they fit with the follower plate. Don't try to fit an extra round in the breech, just fill the magazine to it's capacity.
