      "content": "Mix 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of water and 1 tbsp (7.5 g) of cornstarch in a bowl. Measure out equal amounts of cool water and cornstarch and pour them into a bowl. Stir the cornstarch and water together in the bowl with a spoon. [1] X Research source This recipe uses 1 cup (240 ml) of fruit juice, but you can alter the measurements so the ratio stays the same. For example, if your recipe called for 2 cups (470 ml) of fruit juice, you'd mix together {{convert|2|tbsp|ml|abbr=on} each of water and cornstarch. If another liquid is used in the recipe you're using besides fruit juice, it’s okay to use this liquid instead of water."

Stir all 3 ingredients together so they’re mixed well. Avoid adding cornstarch to hot fruit juice so it doesn't clump."

      "content": "Cook the fruit juice on the stove top over medium heat until it’s thick and bubbly. Pour the fruit juice mixture into a pan or pot and bring the heat to medium. Stir the fruit juice as it heats up and watch for bubbles to start forming in the juice. These bubbles mean that the juice is thickening. [2] X Research source It shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes for the liquid to bubble."

      "title": "Cook the fruit juice for 2 more minutes to cook the cornstarch.",
      "content": "Cook the fruit juice for 2 more minutes to cook the cornstarch. While you can remove the fruit juice from the heat once it starts bubbling, you might be left with a cornstarch flavor. To get rid of the cornstarch taste, let the fruit juice mixture keeping cooking for 2 more minutes before calling it done. [3] X Research source If your fruit juice is heated or stirred for too long, it can start to lose its thickness. Use your thickened fruit juice in a pie or other yummy recipe."

Once the cornstarch is added to your fruit juice, follow the regular recipe and do whatever it says to do with the fruit juice. For example, if your recipe says to heat fruit juice and pour it into a pie crust, you can add your heated cornstarch and fruit juice mixture to the crust normally. It's okay if the recipe doesn't mention anything about adding cornstarch to thicken the juice."

Use a measuring spoon to measure out the cornstarch you'll need for your amount of fruit juice, but don't add the cornstarch to the fruit just yet.

If your recipe includes another dry ingredient like sugar, add the cornstarch to this ingredient before adding it to the fruit juice. Stir the cornstarch in with the sugar to help separate the cornstarch granules so they don’t clump together. [5] X Research source Sugar is the most common ingredient to mix in with cornstarch. Adding the cornstarch in with another ingredient first will make it easier for the cornstarch to mix evenly with the fruit juice."
