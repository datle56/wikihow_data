      "content": "Honey contains glucose. If you are someone who needs to keep a close eye on their blood sugar, then you need to be careful about eating honey. While honey does contain a variety of healthy minerals and vitamins that sugar does not, it is sweeter than sugar and will still cause your blood sugar levels to increase. [12] X Research source Check with your doctor before taking honey if you have blood sugar concerns or are diabetic. Honey is sweeter than regular sugar because it contains more of a sweeter simple sugar, fructose, than regular sugar does. This means that it takes less honey to sweeten things than it does regular sugar. In general, using 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of honey will produce the same amount of sweetness as 1 teaspoon (4 g) of sugar would."
