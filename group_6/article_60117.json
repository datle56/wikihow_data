      "content": "Clock Solitaire is an easy game that’s perfect for younger kids. The goal of Clock Solitaire (also called Clock Patience ) is to make 4-of-a-kind piles at each of the spaces on the clock’s “face” before all 4 Kings are face up. Deal the cards face down into 13 piles. Arrange 12 of the piles in a circle, with each pile corresponding to a number on the clock’s face. Position the thirteenth pile in the middle of the circle and flip the top card face up. Place the face-up card on the bottom of the pile at the number on the clock’s face that corresponds with the number on the card. For example, the 3 of Hearts belongs at the bottom of the 3 o’clock pile. Treat Jacks as 11, Queens as 12, and Kings as 13. Flip the top card of the pile you just placed the card under. In the above example, with the 3 of Hearts, you would flip the top card of the 3 o’clock pile. Continue to flip and move cards. If you flip a card that belongs in the same pile, place it face up at the bottom of the pile and then flip the next card. You win Clock Solitaire when you’ve flipped all the cards and sorted them into piles of 4-of-a-kind. If, at any point in the game, all 4 kings are face up, you lose."

The goal is to remove all of the cards from the pyramid or draw pile. Shuffle the cards thoroughly, and then deal them face up in the shape of a pyramid Start with 1 at the top, 2 in the next row, etc., until you get to a row of 7 cards, overlapping so the row of 7 cards is available for play. Place the leftover cards face down in a pile. This is your draw pile. Remove any 2 exposed cards that add up to 13. Treat Jacks as 11, Queens as 12, and Kings as 13. You don’t need to pair Kings with another card to remove them from the pyramid. Set pairs off to the side. When no two cards add up to 13, draw 1 card from the draw pile. If you can’t play that card, draw the next until you have 2 cards that add up to 13. Alternately, you can draw 3 cards from the draw pile at a time, only playing the top card. When you have flipped all the cards in the draw pile, you can turn them face down and start over again. If you haven’t cleared the pyramid after the third pass through the draw pile, you lose. To win, clear all the cards in the pyramid or the draw pile. [1] X Research source"

If there are no available plays, move the top card from any row to any other row with an available card that’s 1 rank higher in any suit. For example, a 9 of Hearts at the end of 1 row can be moved to any 10 at the ends of the other rows. You may only move 1 card at a time. Once you move cards to the foundation Aces, you can’t move them back to the stacks. If you clear a row, you can move any card to the empty space.

The goal of the game is to build the 5 best Poker hands with the available cards. Deal out 5 cards face up in a row in front of you. Each of these cards represents a Poker hand. The rest of the cards make up the draw pile. Take the top card from the draw pile and place it face up. Decide which hand you want to add it to, and then place it on top of that pile overlapping the card below it. If you draw a card you can’t play with any hand, add it to a discard pile. Continue drawing cards and placing them in the hands until you have 5 cards in each. Remember, once a card is added to a hand, you can’t move it to another hand. When you have 5 hands of 5 cards each, tally up your score using the following points totals: Royal Flush - 10 points Straight Flush - 9 points 4 of a Kind - 8 points Full House - 7 points Flush - 6 points Straight - 5 points 3 of a Kind - 4 points 2 Pairs - 3 points Pair - 2 points High Card - 1 point"

When you play Freecell , the goal is to make stacks of cards that descend sequentially from King to Ace for each of the 4 suits.

Leave space above the cards for 4 foundations and 4 free cells. Place any available Aces in the foundation spaces. Only play cards at the bottom of each stack. Once you place a card on a foundation pile, you can’t move it back into play. Move cards from one column to another to free up cards by creating numerical runs with alternating colors. You must place cards in descending order by suit. For example, you can only place Hearts on the Ace of Hearts foundation. You may only move 1 card at a time. If you have open free cells, you can move a sequence of cards equal to the number of open free cells plus 1. For example, if you have a sequence of 4 cards in 1 row, you must have at least 3 open free cells to move that sequence to another column. If you clear a column, you can treat that space the same as a free cell."

These are the only cards you need to play. Draw a bowling scorecard on a piece of paper consisting of a long horizontal rectangle divided into 10 smaller boxes. Use this sheet to keep your bowling score . Shuffle and then deal 10 cards face up in the shape of an inverted triangle with 4 cards in the top row and 1 card for the final row. These are the pins. To the side, deal 3 more piles face down. The first pile should have 5 cards, the second 3, and the last 2. Flip the top card from each pile. If one of the ball cards in the first pile has the same rank as a pin, it knocks that pin down. If the numbers on 2 pins add up to the number on the ball card, the ball knocks them both down. Once you knock down a pin, clear its card and the ball card from the game. Flip the next ball card in the first pile and check for eligible pins. You may not knock down a pin in the back row with the first ball. You can only knock down the middle pin after an adjacent pin has been knocked down. If you can’t knock pins down with any of your face-up ball cards, record the number of pins knocked down. Discard a face-up ball card from the first available pile. Continue to clear pins and discard ball cards. As long as you knock down a pin with a ball card, you’re on the same ball. Do not record your score until you discard a ball card.
