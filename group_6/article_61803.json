      "content": "Use \"i.e.\" in place of “that is” or “in other words.” Use the abbreviation \"i.e.” when you want to clarify something you’ve just said by adding more information or restating it in a different way. For example, “I am a vegan, i.e., I do not eat any animal-based products.” The information you add after “i.e.” should explain the first part of the sentence in more detail, so the reader understands it better.

Keep in mind that “i.e.” is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase id est, which means “that is” or “in other words.” If you’re using either of these phrases in a sentence, you should be able to easily replace it with “i.e.” instead.

      "content": "“i.e.” means “in other words,” and “e.g.” means “for example.” If you want to restate information from the first part of your sentence in more specific terms, “i.e.” is the correct choice (“There are two different types of carbohydrates, i.e., simple and complex”). On the other hand, if you want to provide a few examples of something, but not an exhaustive list, “e.g.” is the correct choice (“There are several rides at Disneyland, e.g., Space Mountain, The Haunted Mansion, and Peter Pan’s Flight”).

      "title": "Use “e.g.” in place of “for example” or “for instance.”",
      "content": "Use “e.g.” in place of “for example” or “for instance.” The abbreviation e.g. stands for the Latin phrase “ exempli gratia ,” which means “for the sake of example.” [5] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source Use this term when you want to provide a few examples (but not all possible examples) of something: “I’m a huge fan of Japanese food, e.g., sushi, tempura, and ramen.” In this sentence, you haven’t named all types of Japanese food. You’ve simply listed some key examples, which makes “e.g.” the correct choice. Here are a few more examples: “Victorian literature (e.g., Jane Eyre , Middlemarch , and The Picture of Dorian Gray ) is my favorite genre to study.” “There are tons of delicious toppings you can put on oatmeal, e.g., bananas, fresh berries, chopped walnuts, or honey. “I now like green vegetables (e.g., broccoli, brussels sprouts, and kale), a lot more than I did when I was a kid.” [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Use lowercase letters, and place a period after each letter. The abbreviations “i.e.” and “e.g.” should always appear in lowercase letters, with a period after each letter. These abbreviations should not be used at the beginning of sentences, so there's no need to capitalize the first letter.

      "content": "Do not italicize or bold “i.e.” or “e.g.” Even though “i.e.” and “e.g” are technically abbreviations of Latin phrases, you do not need to italicize them or format them any differently from the rest of your sentence.

      "title": "Place commas before and after “i.e.” and “e.g.”",
      "content": "Place commas before and after “i.e.” and “e.g.” This will help the abbreviation stand out from the rest of the sentence, and it will let the reader know that you’ll be providing additional information. You can also put the whole phrase in parentheses to make it stand out even more.

      "content": "Put \"i.e.\" in the middle of a sentence, never at the beginning or end. The abbreviation \"i.e.\" indicates that the next clause of your sentence will explain or rephrase the first part of the sentence. [10] X Research source As a result, it should always appear toward the middle of your sentence, rather than at the beginning or end. For example, the sentence, “I.e. he likes superheroes” or the sentence, “He likes superheroes, i.e.” would be incorrect. The correct sentence would be, “He likes superheroes, i.e., social misfits who save the world.”"
