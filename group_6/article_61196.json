      "title": "Ask your doctor about using topical steroids.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor about using topical steroids. Steroid creams are prescribed by dermatologists for a range of skin conditions, and are often a first-line treatment for IGH. Your doctor will prescribe a specific topical steroid and explain how and how often to apply the cream to your IGH spots. [1] X Research source You'll usually apply the topical steroid once a day for at least 2 weeks, and probably longer before seeing results. Side effects from steroid creams are uncommon, but can include redness, thinning of the skin, or even permanent pigmentation changes. If you have IGH on your face or other areas where your skin is thinner, you'll need to use a lower concentration of topical steroid to reduce the risk of skin inflammation."

      "title": "Discuss using retinoids such as tretinoin.",
      "content": "Discuss using retinoids such as tretinoin. If topical steroids cause unwanted side effects or you'd prefer to avoid them for other reasons, your doctor might recommend retinoids instead. The retinoid tretinoin is often prescribed for IGH as a topical cream because it is easy to apply and has mild side effects. [2] X Research source Retinoids are applied once daily, usually at night. It will take several weeks or possibly months to achieve noticeable results. If you experience any side effects, they will usually be limited to itching, redness, or dryness at the application site. Retinoids are chemically derived from Vitamin A and are useful for a range of skin conditions."

      "title": "Consider trying a topical NSAID like pimecrolimus.",
      "content": "Consider trying a topical NSAID like pimecrolimus. If topical steroids are the typical first treatment for IGH, topical NSAIDs share second place with retinoids. Your doctor will start you on one of them and evaluate your results. NSAID creams such as pimecrolimus reduce inflammation and can help reduce the appearance of IGH spots over time. Pimecrolimus 1% cream may cause localized burning or stinging, but these issues typically vanish after a few applications. It can also cause acne flares in the application area in some cases, but this side effect usually goes away fairly quickly with regular use. You'll often apply this medication twice per day for at least 2 weeks, and probably longer, in order to achieve results."

      "content": "Try weekly laser therapy treatments for about a month. If your dermatologist offers laser treatments, you’ll likely need to make quick visits each week for about a month. Spot treatments with the laser are usually painless, although you may experience some burning or redness in the treated areas. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Like cryotherapy, dermabrasion, and chemical peels, laser treatments intentionally cause minor damage to the skin. As the skin repairs and regenerates, the IGH spots should be minimized or disappear completely. All of these therapeutic skin damage options seem to produce roughly the same rate of success, although there isn't much detailed research on them when it comes to treating IGH. Your doctor will probably first recommend topical creams (like steroids or retinoids), then if necessary move on to trying one therapeutic skin damage method at a time until you see the desired results."

      "title": "Consider spot cryotherapy treatments with liquid nitrogen.",
      "content": "Consider spot cryotherapy treatments with liquid nitrogen. When treating IGH with cryotherapy, your dermatologist will essentially dip a small tool akin to a cotton swab into liquid nitrogen and hold it to an IGH spot for 5-10 seconds. At most, you may experience a minor and short-lived burning sensation where the treatment occurs. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source One study showed cryotherapy is effective at removing IGH spots (within a month or so) in roughly 80% of all cases, which is in the same range as other therapeutic skin damage methods."

      "content": "Undergo a chemical peel with 88% phenol or a similar product. If you undergo a phenol (or similar) chemical peel at your doctor’s office, you may expect your IGH spots to disappear within several weeks roughly two-thirds of the time. In some cases, though, you may experience scabbing over your IGH spots, or even (in rare cases) ulceration of these spots. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You may also experience hyperpigmentation in rare cases, which means the IGH spots will go from being much lighter than your surrounding skin to noticeably darker."

      "content": "Look into Intense Pulse Light (IPL) treatments. Intense Pulse Light treatments may help to even out your skin tone. The treatment uses pulses of bright light to improve the appearance of the skin. It can cause some stinging, so you will need an application of a topical anesthetic before your treatment. You will also need to wear dark glasses to protect your eyes. IPL treatments take about 20 to 30 minutes per session, and you will need 3 to 6 treatments performed 1 month apart. You may experience some redness and peeling of your skin after treatment."

      "content": "Wear sunscreen every day. The exact causes of IGH are still not fully known, but dermatological experts agree that long-term sun exposure is a major factor in practically every case. To reduce your exposure to the sun’s UV rays, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen to your exposed skin every time you go outside, even on cloudy days. [6] X Trustworthy Source DermNet NZ Online clinical resource website written and run by dermatologists providing evidence-based information about dermatology and skin health Go to source IGH spots nearly always occur in areas that are regularly exposed to the sun’s UV rays, such as the lower legs and arms, the face, and the back of the neck."
