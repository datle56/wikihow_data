      "content": "Read the care tag on your polyester garments before washing them. Polyester is machine washable, but it’s sometimes blended with other fabrics (like silk, cotton, or rayon) that require specific care instructions. Check the care label for any special directions you’ll need to follow to keep your garments looking good as new. [1] X Expert Source Safir Ali Professional Dry Cleaner Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. For example, the care label may indicate that your garment should only be washed in cold water, or that it should be washed on a delicate cycle. Items that indicate \"Dry Clean Only\" should be taken to a professional dry cleaner instead of washed at home."

      "content": "Pre-treat any stains on your garment with stain remover. This helps target and lift stubborn stains more than washing alone. Just apply a bit of the stain treatment of your choice (such as Shout or Oxiclean ) directly to the stain, and let it sit for a few minutes before washing. If you don’t have a specific stain treatment product, you can also use a bit of your regular detergent, or a bit of white vinegar. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Sort your polyester garments by fabric type, and turn them inside out. A polyester-knit blend fabric can easily snag on clasps, buttons, and chunkier fabrics. To avoid any pilling or damage, only wash polyester with other polyester items. Make sure to fasten any zippers, buttons, or hooks on your garments, then turn them inside-out before washing. [3] X Research source You’ll also want to separate your garments by color so your dark colored items don’t bleed onto your light colored items."

      "content": "Choose a gentle wash cycle. Because polyester snags and pills easily, avoid heavy duty cycles. Instead, opt for the “gentle” or “delicate” cycle options on your washing machine. [4] X Research source This helps prevent any damage to your garments."

      "content": "Set the water temperature to cool or warm. Most polyester items can be washed in warm or cool water, but you should avoid using hot water. [5] X Research source Hot temperatures can break down the fibers in polyester clothing, causing damage over time. Double check the care labels before choosing the water temperature. Some polyester items can only be washed in cold water because they're blended with other fabrics, like silk or rayon. If you can’t find a care label on your garment, it’s best to wash them with cool water, just to be safe."

      "content": "Add your regular detergent and fabric softener, then start the cycle. Most standard laundry detergents will work well on polyester, but try to avoid heavy duty detergents that are advertised as being “tough on stains.” They might fade the color of your fabric. [6] X Research source Polyester is also very susceptible to static cling, so add fabric softener to reduce static electricity. [7] X Research source And that’s it! Let the washing machine do its job, then promptly remove your clothing when the cycle is done. From there, you can tumble dry or air dry your items as needed. [8] X Research source"

If you’re only washing one small item, you can use a large bowl instead of the sink or tub."

Your clothes are now ready to air dry or tumble dry in the dryer."

However, if polyester is blended with other shrinkable fabrics, such as cotton, it may shrink when exposed to higher temperatures. This is why it’s very important to check the care labels on your clothing for instructions. [18] X Research source"

You’ll likely also need to use a low heat setting or a steam iron to ensure there’s no damage to your clothes. [19] X Research source If your clothing item can be ironed, you’ll see a small iron icon on the care label. There should also be dots inside to alert you to the proper temperature setting. One dot means low heat, two dots means medium heat, and three dots means high heat. If you see an iron icon with an X through it, this means it is not safe to iron the garment.
