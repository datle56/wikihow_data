      "content": "A carbuncle is a skin infection that involves multiple hair follicles. Skin infections can form pockets in your skin that are filled with pus, which is the white fluid you may recognize as whiteheads on pimples. Pus is made of dead skin cells, bacteria, and your own white blood cells fighting the infection. If the pocket of pus is large and involves multiple hair follicles in a single location on your skin, then it’s called a carbuncle. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If the infection involves a single hair follicle, it’s called a furuncle, which is the medical term for a boil. When a person has multiple carbuncles, it’s a condition known as Carbunculosis."

S. aureus can enter your skin through a bunch of different ways such as a cut or through close contact with someone who has the bacteria. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Carbuncles can actually be spread from person to person or from 1 area of your body to another because the S. aureus bacteria is super contagious."
