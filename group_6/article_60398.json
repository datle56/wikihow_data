      "title": "Heat a pot of boiling water on the stove.",
      "content": "Heat a pot of boiling water on the stove. Fill the pot about half full with water and turn the burner to high. Place a lid on the pot so the water begins to boil faster. You'll see steam escape from under the lid once the water boils. [1] X Research source The bamboo steamer should fit snugly on the top of the pot. Ensure that the bottom of the steamer doesn't touch the water."

    {
      "title": "Sprinkle both sides of the fillets with salt and pepper.",
      "content": "Sprinkle both sides of the fillets with salt and pepper. Lay two 3 ⁄ 4 pound (340 g) fish fillets on a cutting board and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Turn the fillets over and season them with more salt and pepper according to your taste. [2] X Research source Use any type of fish. Try basa, cod, halibut, branzino, or flounder, for instance. You can steam a whole fish in the bamboo steamer as long as it fits."

    {
      "title": "Put the fillets on a plate and lay the lemon, chili, and ginger over them.",
      "content": "Put the fillets on a plate and lay the lemon, chili, and ginger over them. Get out a heatproof plate that will fit inside your bamboo steamer. Lay the fillets on it and arrange 1/2 of a sliced lemon and 1/2 of a sliced red chili over each fillet. Then, spread 1/2 tablespoon (3 g) of grated ginger across each fillet. Feel free to season the fillets any way you like. You could use a ginger-soy sauce, for instance."

      "title": "Place the plate into the steamer basket and set it on the pot of water.",
      "content": "Place the plate into the steamer basket and set it on the pot of water. Put the plate with the seasoned fish in the basket and put the tight-fitting lid on the steamer basket. Set the entire steamer basket on top of the pot of boiling water. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Steam the fish over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Steam the fish over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the burner down so the water simmers under the steamer basket. Heat the fish until it's opaque and cooked throughout. To test if the fish is done, drag the tines of a fork over the center of a fillet. It should flake easily. If it doesn't, steam the fish for another minute and check it again."

      "title": "Microwave the rice vinegar and hoisin sauce for 10 seconds.",
      "content": "Microwave the rice vinegar and hoisin sauce for 10 seconds. If you'd like to make a flavorful sauce to pour over the fish, put 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of rice vinegar and 2 tablespoons (32 g) of hoisin sauce into a microwave-safe bowl. Heat the mixture for about 10 seconds so it's steaming hot. If you don't want to serve the fish with the sauce, skip this step."

      "title": "Transfer the fish to a serving platter and pour the hot mixture over it.",
      "content": "Transfer the fish to a serving platter and pour the hot mixture over it. Carefully remove the lid from the steamer and move the steamed fish fillets to a serving platter. Pour the hot vinegar sauce over the fish and serve it immediately. [4] X Research source Refrigerate leftover steamed fish in an airtight container. Use the fish within 4 days."

    {
      "title": "Fill the electric steamer with water and plug it in.",
      "content": "Fill the electric steamer with water and plug it in. Fill a pitcher with water and slowly pour it into the base of your electric steamer until the water reaches the maximum fill line. Then, place the drip tray on the water tank and plug in the machine. Depending on the type of steamer you have, it will probably turn on when you plug it in. If it doesn't, switch it on. [5] X Research source Always follow the manufacturer's instructions when you operate the steamer. Avoid overfilling the steamer or the machine might not work properly."

      "title": "Season the fish with salt and pepper and cut diagonal slashes across the fish.",
      "content": "Season the fish with salt and pepper and cut diagonal slashes across the fish. Lay a 1 1 ⁄ 2 lb (0.68 kg) whole white fish on your cutting board and sprinkle salt and pepper over it. Then, take a sharp knife and carefully score both sides of the fish. Make 3 diagonal slits that are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. [6] X Research source Use any white fish, such as sea bass, branzino, or flounder. Scoring the fish helps it steam evenly and allows the flavor to penetrate the fish."

      "title": "Lay the fish in a steamer tray and season it with ginger.",
      "content": "Lay the fish in a steamer tray and season it with ginger. Get out the steamer tray that came with your electric steamer and place the fish in it. Take 1/2 of the 1 in (2.5 cm) piece of julienned ginger and put it inside the fish. Arrange the rest of it on top of the fish. [7] X Research source If you have a stackable electric steamer, ensure that you're using the bottom steamer tray."

      "content": "Cover the steamer tray and set the timer for 8 to 9 minutes. Steam the fish until it flakes easily when you drag the tines of a fork over the center. Look at the flesh that's close to the center bones to see if they're opaque. If the fish isn't done, let it steam for another minute before checking again. [8] X Research source Stop steaming the fish before it dries out or your fish won't be tender. If you're steaming additional trays of food, stack them on top of the salmon before you cover it."
