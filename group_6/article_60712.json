      "content": "Lay a towel down on the table to cushion your phone. If you accidentally drop your phone or it falls out of the case when you’re not expecting it, you could damage your screen. Put down a soft towel or a pillowcase before you remove the case for extra protection. [1] X Research source Make sure you are working with a table underneath your phone so it doesn’t accidentally fall on the floor. This method applies to snap-on style phone cases, which are a single piece that fits around your phone’s edges. You can use the second method of this article, Using a Prying Tool , for 2-piece cases. For phone cases with multiple components and clips, you may need to refer to the case’s manual for specific instructions."

      "content": "Start with the side that has the fewest number of buttons on it. Take a look at your phone and determine which side will be the easiest to take off. Usually, it’s the side that doesn’t have the volume buttons on it. [2] X Research source The side without the buttons will be easier to take off since there is less bulk to work around."

      "content": "Push the bottom corner of the case down and away from the phone. The case should be flexible enough that the corner starts coming away from the phone. If the corner of the case is difficult to remove from the corner of the phone, you can put your thumbnail under the case in the bottom corner. Carefully poke your nail in between your case and your phone, trying not to bend your case too much. Wiggle your nail back and forth if you’re having trouble fitting it in between the case and your phone. If you don’t have long nails, try using a credit card instead."

Try not to bend your case at all so that you don’t damage your phone.

Look for the seam in the outer edges of your phone case so you know where to start taking your case apart. [7] X Research source If you had to put your phone case on in 2 pieces, it most likely has a seam on the sides."

Use the tool to separate the case all the way down one side. [9] X Research source Try not to force the tool down too hard, or you could break your case. Go slowly and gently all the way down. You may hear some slight popping or cracking as the case separates."
