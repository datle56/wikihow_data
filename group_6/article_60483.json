If you add a new payment method (that can cover the cost of the outstanding balance) and remove your old payment method, the new payment method will be charged immediately and your account will be out of the red. Use a gift card to pay the balance. First, purchase an Apple Gift Card or App Store & iTunes Gift Card in an amount that will cover the balance, then redeem it with your Apple ID (either in the App Store or by going to Settings > your name Payment & Shipping > Apple ID > Redeem ). [2] X Research source Once you do this, return to the Purchase History menu ( Settings > your name > Media & Purchases > Your Account > Purchase History ) and tap on the purchase highlighted with red text. Tap Pay with Apple ID Credit to immediately resolve your outstanding balance. Add money from your Apple Wallet to cover the balance. To start, tap < Back on the Purchase History screen to go back to your account settings. Tap the Other option, unless you want to add a flat amount to your account. You can add more money to your Apple account then what is needed, if you want to use the leftover balance to purchase apps, music, and more. Enter the amount you want to pay, then tap Next . You can enter the exact amount that you owe, or more. This money will be taken from your primary payment method connected to your Apple ID (Apple Cash, a credit/debit card, or PayPal.) Confirm the transfer. You may need to double-click the side button, enter your password, or do Face ID verification (depending on your settings). Once the payment goes through, the money will be added to your Apple ID. Return to the Purchase History menu ( Settings > your name > Media & Purchases > Your Account > Purchase History ), tap your outstanding balance and select Pay with Apple ID Credit ."

If you don't have any active subscriptions, you aren't in a Family Sharing group, and you don't have an unpaid balance, you can select None as a payment option. This will make it so you can download free apps without having to add any payment information. [3] X Research source If you can't select None and you don't have any subscriptions, Family Sharing groups, or unpaid balance, you'll need to contact Apple Support for further help. Add a valid payment method for your country to your Apple ID. You can use this Apple support page to see what payment methods are valid where you live. Apple won't charge you for anything unless you give explicit permission, so you don't have to worry about random charges showing up on your bill from Apple if you add a payment method. Add a gift card to your Apple ID balance. You can buy Apple gift cards from a variety of retailers for as little as $5. Buying a gift card and redeeming it with your Apple ID counts as a payment method, and if you only get free apps you can leave the balance there indefinitely. To redeem a gift card, tap the < Back button from the payment screen and select Apple ID > Redeem . Make sure you purchase a gift card that can be used with the Apple Store. The only Apple gift card that you can't redeem on your device is an Apple Store Gift Card, which is either silver, gray, white, or gold with a shiny Apple logo on the front.
