      "content": "Follow the guide for day one and two. If you do decide to complete this diet, its proponents claim you have to stick to it very closely. It features a dramatic drop of in calories, which may leave you feeling weak and fatigued. On day one you are instructed to have just a coffee with one teaspoon of sugar for breakfast. Lunch is two hard boiled eggs together with 400 grams (14 oz) of boiled spinach and a tomato. Dinner is 200 grams (7.1 oz) of beef served with 150 g (2 cups) of lettuce drizzled with lemon juice and a little olive oil. On day two you are again instructed to skip breakfast, just drinking a cup of coffee with one sugar like the previous day. For lunch the diet requires 250 grams (8.8 oz) of ham and one serving of fat-free yoghurt. The dinner is the same as day one: 200 grams (7.1 oz) of beef, with 150 g (2 cups) of lettuce as a side. You can add a little oil or lemon juice to dress the lettuce. This diet provides around 600 calories/day and will lead to malnutrition. You can not get all of the nutrients you need on 600 cal/day. Your metabolism will shift; your body will think you are starving. It is recommended that if you are consuming under 800 cal/day you should be supervised by a medical professional. If you begin to feel overly tired or weary from the sudden drop in calories consider whether or not to continue."

Day eight is a little easier, but you still go without breakfast and only drink a coffee with one sugar.

      "title": "Monitor yourself during the diet.",
      "content": "Monitor yourself during the diet. The Copenhagen Diet involves a dramatic drop in the nutrients as well as the calories you consume and that are essential to your health. It also involves skipping meals on many days, which can be very dangerous and damage your overall health. If you do undertake this diet it is important to closely monitor how you feel. People undertaking an extremely restrictive, low-calorie diet should be monitored by their doctor throughout the process. If you begin to feel especially lethargic or light-headed, then you should re-consider completing the diet and opt for a more balanced approach. There is little available medical advice for those using this diet, most likely because no health professional would recommend you to do it."

      "content": "Be wary of exercise. The severity of diet means that it is unlikely that you will have the energy required for even moderate exercise during the two weeks. It's important to try to keep up some physical activity but don't push yourself while on the diet. Gentle exercise such as walking or stretching can be one way to keep up some activity. The fact that you will probably not be able to exercise during the diet highlights how extreme it is, and it's short-term nature. Doing a diet that involves exercise instead will help to maintain lean muscle mass while you burn fat. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Understand this is not a long-term solution. The nature of this diet means that most of the weight you lose will be water weight, rather than fat. As a result, you can find that you rapidly re-gain the weight lost during the course of the diet once you start eating normally again. This can be a very demoralizing experience but it does reflect the short-term nature of severe diets such as the Copenhagen Diet. Understanding that this is a short-term option will help you understand the changes to your body that you experience. You can use the diet to kick start a new healthier lifestyle. The self-control and discipline you learn sticking to the diet could help you push on to more healthy lifestyle. Quickly losing then gaining weight is known as \"yo-yo dieting\" and has been linked to a higher risk of sudden cardiac death and coronary heart disease death for women. [3] X Research source"
