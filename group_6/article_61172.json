Since these masks aren’t a standard acne treatment recommended by dermatologists, there’s not a lot of information out there about the best treatment schedule. Some natural skincare enthusiasts report great results from using honey on their faces twice a day. [7] X Research source However, adding cinnamon to the mix could make it more drying or irritating, in which case you might need to use it less often. For instance, if once a day seems like too much, try doing it every other day or just a couple times a week. Keep an eye on your skin to see if your acne seems to be improving. It might take a week or more of regular treatments before you see results. [8] X Research source"
