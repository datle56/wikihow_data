[1] X Research source Joint compound, also called drywall mud, is typically used to seal joints between sheets of drywall. However, it’s also the perfect consistency to make a nice texture on your ceiling. Joint compound is the most common product used to texture a ceiling. However, you can also use textured paint for a more subtle finish."

      "content": "Roll a thin layer of joint compound onto the ceiling with a roller. Grab a normal paint roller and dip it into your bucket of joint compound. Spread the joint compound onto the ceiling, working in roughly a 3 by 3 ft (0.91 by 0.91 m) section. [2] X Research source Don’t worry about spreading the joint compound smoothly. Since you’ll be texturing it in just a moment, it doesn’t matter whether or not the compound goes on smoothly."

      "title": "Pat the stomp brush onto the ceiling.",
      "content": "Pat the stomp brush onto the ceiling. Grab your stomp brush and point it up at the ceiling. Gently pat it on top of the joint compound that you just applied, making small texture marks in the wet compound. Go over the entire area multiple times to set the texture in place. [3] X Research source If the layer of joint compound on the ceiling isn’t thick enough, dip your stomp brush into the bucket of joint compound to add a little more. Stomp brushes add a subtle, muted texture to the ceiling. It won’t be super noticeable, but it does a great job of covering imperfections."

Work your way through the room, spreading joint compound on with a paint roller and then texturizing it with your stomp brush. When you’re finished, you can go back over any areas that you need to with your stomp brush to remove any flat or untextured spots."

Once the textured ceiling is dry, dip a paint roller into latex primer and smooth it over the ceiling. Wait for the primer to dry before painting. [5] X Research source"

Scoop up some joint compound and place it on the hawk, being careful to hold the hawk flat so it doesn’t spill.

Grab your skip trowel and pick up a small amount of joint compound, just on the edges of the trowel. Start from one edge of the ceiling and gently brush the compound onto the ceiling. [8] X Research source The joint compound won’t spread on smoothly, and that’s okay. The goal here is to create a textured look, so there will be some bare patches within the joint compound. Skip trowels create a more dramatic textured look."
