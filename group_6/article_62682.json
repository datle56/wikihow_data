[19] X Research source In addition, try to keep your article to 50,000 characters of text or less. Articles that exceed this length generally need to be split into smaller articles to keep them easily readable.

In most cases, successful Wikipedia articles use both a summary article style and an inverted pyramid style at the same time. A summary-style article arranges a broad topic into a main article and side articles. An inverted pyramid style article is an article that prioritizes the most important information at the top, which is then followed by supporting information and additional details. [21] X Research source The key feature of both summary-style and pyramid style articles used in most Wikipedia articles is a lead section at the beginning that summarizes the article and provides an overview of the most important information."

Unlike standard articles written in a word processor, you’ll need to use text codes called wiki tags to create headings, subheadings, and bold and italicized words. In addition, using wiki tags will allow you to insert internal and external links, images, and footnotes. To code your article and format it as needed, visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial/Formatting . For example, to bold a word or phrase in your article, surround the word or phrase with three apostrophes. To create a heading, for example, add 2 ‘=’ signs before and after the heading title. For a subheading, include 3 ‘=’ signs before and after the subheading title."

In such cases, it may be helpful for you to do an internet search on the resource itself to better grasp how reliable people tend to believe it is.

[25] X Research source It may be helpful for you to copy and paste your article into a word processor so you can run it through a spelling and grammar check before submitting it. Be aware, however, that your word processor will likely read wiki text as incorrect."
