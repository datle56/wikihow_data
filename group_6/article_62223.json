      "content": "“Punching” is a British slang term to say someone’s out of your league. In the United Kingdom, people use the term “punching” to describe and compare the attractiveness of a couple. The slang term originally came from the boxing phrase “punching above your weight,” which means a boxer is trying to fight someone above their weight class. Today, the term refers to dating someone who’s more attractive than you. [1] X Research source More often than not, the term is used in the phrase “Who’s punching?” This is typically said amongst friends asking which partner is the best-looking or biggest catch. This phrase is also used widely on TikTok with #whospunching and a picture of the couple. Say a friend comments, “Jack's punching.” This means that your buddy Jack is dating someone who’s more attractive than he is. Those outside of the UK may have come across the term watching the hit reality TV show Love Island U.K. , where contestants are isolated in a villa with the hope of finding love.
