When you're annoyed at someone for being too needy, demanding, or financially draining, it's totally reasonable to discuss those frustrations with another person. Message a trustworthy friend about your troubles over Snapchat, text, or another app. You : \"Ugh, my date last night was a bust! 😫 They were so HM, it was ridiculous.\" Them : \"Oh no! I'm sorry. I'm here if you need to vent about it.\""

Do your best to sympathize with them, and ask for more details if they don't explain the situation right away.

If your friend can't think of any response other than \"Hm\" (in the context of \"I'm thinking\"), it might be time to talk about something else.
