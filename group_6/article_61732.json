Gently push the teeth of the comb against your pet’s skin and brush in the same direction that their fur grows. [3] X Research source Pay particular attention to the base of their tail, their groin, and the back of their neck since those are the most common problem areas when it comes to fleas. Occasionally brush in the opposite direction of your pet’s hair to catch any fleas that tried to run away from the comb. If your dog or cat has long hair, use a long-toothed flea comb so you can brush through their entire coat. If you have multiple pets, be sure to brush all of them with the flea comb since fleas easily spread from one animal to another."
