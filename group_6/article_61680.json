For example, you'd enter \" /timeout badtwitchperson 30 \" to prevent badtwitchperson from being able to send chat messages for 30 seconds. If that was a mistake, you can undo your action by entering \" /timeout [username] 1 \", which will change their timeout to last for one second instead of 30. [1] X Research source To undo this action, you can alternatively type \"/unban [username]\". Mods and Broadcasters can do this. If you don't enter the number or [seconds] code, the default is 10 minutes. Even if you're moderating a Twitch stream from your phone, you can still use code to time them out."

These can be things like spammy posts (repeated over and over and over again) or posts that suggest violence. Anything that you'd use to promote your Twitch stream is a good idea to include in a list of rules ."
