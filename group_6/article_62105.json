      "title": "“IK” stands for “I know.”",
      "content": "“IK” stands for “I know.” When texting or messaging, someone may abbreviate the phrase “I know” with “ik,” “IK,” or “ikkkkk” to shorten their message—they’re saying that they’re already aware of something. The more ks the acronym has, the longer the “know” is being drawn out (like you're saying \"I knoooooow\"). [1] X Research source “IK” can be used in response to a statement or question or within a sentence: You: “Did you see that Taylor Swift is coming to Florida?!” Them: “IK!!! I’m freaking out 🤪” You: “What do you want to do on Saturday?” Them: “It’d be nice to go outside. IK it’s supposed to rain, but we can always hike with an umbrella!”"

      "content": "Use “IK” to tell someone you already know something. Simply type “IK” or “ik” when you want to say “I know.” Not only is it shorter to type, but it can also be used to convey different emotions. For instance: When you’re annoyed or upset, send a message that only says “ik” to be blunt (if you include a period, it will seem even more abrupt). Them: “Tommy is dating Sally!” You: “ik.” When you’re happy or excited, use “IK” and expressive emojis like 😁 and 😆. Them: “We graduate tomorrow!!” You: “IK! 😆 How is this actually happening?”"
