It’s the house that reflects your outer world and how others see you, making it the opposite of the Fourth House, which governs your private inner life. [1] X Research source The Tenth House also speaks to your relationship with society. For instance, the Tenth House is thought to determine the influence of authority figures in your life, your career, reputation, destiny, and legacy. The cusp of the Tenth House is called the Midheaven. As you get older, the planets in your house become more influential since you begin to identify more with the Midheaven. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "The Tenth House is an Earth House.",
      "content": "The Tenth House is an Earth House. The Earth Houses, or Work Houses, relate to the way you engage with material aspects of the world, like money and possessions. However, out of all the Earth Houses, the Tenth House arguably has the greatest long-term effect, since it guides your ultimate destiny and legacy. Think of the Tenth House as a highly philosophical Earth House. It invites you to ask, “How will I deal with success? Will I use my status to help others or will I only go after material things?” The Second and Sixth Houses are also Earth Houses. The Second House deals with your monetary and material possessions, while the Sixth House guides health and your daily routines (like your job). To reflect the Tenth House's large and important scope, astrologers also call the Tenth House the House of World Leaders, the House of Social Status, and the House of Ambition."
