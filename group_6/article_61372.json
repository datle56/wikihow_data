      "title": "The unalome is a sacred Buddhist symbol for transcendence.",
      "content": "The unalome is a sacred Buddhist symbol for transcendence. Buddhism is full of artworks and symbols that are often used as shorthands for the teachings of the Buddha, or Buddhism’s primary religious figure. The unalome (oon-uh-loam) is one such symbol, often used to represent transcendence, or a person’s path toward enlightenment. [1] X Research source The unalome is likely derived from the “urna,” a Buddhist symbol that depicts a swirl of hair between the Buddha’s eyebrows. [2] X Research source The unalome is also present in the Hindu religion, where it has very similar meanings. Some also say that in Hindu spirituality, it represents the third eye of the god Shiva, which often symbolizes wisdom and things unseen."

      "title": "The unalome often represents the path you take through life.",
      "content": "The unalome often represents the path you take through life. Like the symbol itself, our life paths are often winding, curving, and maze-like. This reflects our fears, anxieties, victories, and successes, all in one symbol. [3] X Research source The unalome reminds us that, while things may seem complicated and inscrutable, we’re each following and forging our own roads through life in order to reach enlightenment."

    {
      "title": "The unalome may also represent spiritual balance.",
      "content": "The unalome may also represent spiritual balance. While the unalome twists and turns, it ends at the top with a straight line that leads to understanding, enlightenment, and balance. [4] X Research source And even as the symbol tangles, it remains elegant and purposeful, reminding us to seek balance in our spiritual and mental lives, despite the chaos around us."

    {
      "title": "In Hinduism, unalome represents the removal of obstacles on a life path.",
      "content": "In Hinduism, unalome represents the removal of obstacles on a life path. The spiral at the bottom of the unalome represents the third eye of the deity Shiva, the destroyer. Shiva’s role as the destroyer is not a negative one—his role is to make way for new things. [5] X Research source As we walk our life path without guidance, Shiva clears a way for us."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spiral",
      "content": "Spiral The spiral at the bottom of the unalome represents the numerous emotions that get in the way of enlightenment. It also represents the cyclical nature of our human mistakes. [6] X Research source It rests at the bottom, or the beginning, of the unalome to symbolism our starting point on the road to balance and enlightenment."
    },
    {
      "title": "Loops",
      "content": "Loops The loops above the spiral represent our steps toward enlightenment. [7] X Research source This is when you recognize the journey you must take and start moving toward your end goal. As you progress, the loops become tighter and shorter, as you find life easier to navigate and your understanding grows. Looping represents going backwards, as well. As we understand more and more about ourselves and the world, we’ll often fall back on preconceived notions and bad habits on our journey towards leaving them behind."

    {
      "title": "Straight line",
      "content": "Straight line The straight line represents the moment when you finally do achieve enlightenment. [8] X Research source Your path no longer spirals or loops. Rather, it’s disentangled. The road is straight and navigating it is easy. You see clearly and are in harmony with your surroundings. Some say that this line also represents the opening of your third eye chakra, which lets you see the truth clearly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dots",
      "content": "Dots Some say that the dot, or 3 dots, at the end of the straight line represent your end goal: enlightenment. They sit at the end of the road and remind you of your goal. Others say that the dots represent moments of difficulty you encounter along the way. [9] X Research source The dots are separated from the line because enlightenment is separated from our individual lives and egos."

    {
      "title": "Lotus",
      "content": "Lotus Sometimes, the unalome ends with a lotus flower at the top, above the straight line or around the dots. The lotus is a classic Buddhist and Hindu symbol for obtaining enlightenment. [10] X Research source Lotuses are strong and vibrant, and grow up through deep mud and muck. In the unalome, it reminds us of our end goal in the path of life."

      "content": "The unalome tattoo is common in sacred Thai tattooing. “Sak Yant” is a traditional method of tattooing found in Thailand that often depicts sacred Buddhist designs. [11] X Research source Most Sak Yant designs are incredibly intricate, done in a stick-and-poke style, and almost all of them feature the unalome symbol, often as a repeating feature of the tattoo. [12] X Research source The term “Sak Yant” comes from “sak,” or the Thai word for tattoo, and “yantra,” which are mystical Sanskrit diagrams often used during meditation. Sak Yant tattoos are blessings bestowed upon you by spiritual masters. If you want to get a real Sak Yant tattoo from a master, bring a Thai speaker with you. It’s very easy to commit cultural taboos if you don’t speak Thai, since it’s such a sacred practice. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "The unalome is a common modern tattoo. Today, many Buddhist practitioners, or even those simply seeking enlightenment, receive a unalome tattoo as a reminder of their spiritual journey. The tattoo doesn’t need to be stick and poke, and it’s generally not considered offensive as long as the recipient has an earnest belief in enlightenment. [14] X Research source Unalome tattoos are often positioned with the spiral at the bottom and straight line at the top, to represent upward growth toward enlightenment. Some say that when the unalome spiral faces right, or outward, it represents masculine energy. If it faces left, or inward, it represents feminine energy. If you want to get an unalome tattoo, consider researching Sak Yant and Theravada Buddhism to be sure you’re being as respectful of the symbol as possible."

      "title": "Unalome tattoos should be placed above your waist.",
      "content": "Unalome tattoos should be placed above your waist. Never place it on the legs or the feet, which are closer to the ground and can cause it to become “earthbound.” Some people advise aligning it with a chakra, but other people warn that the ribs, heart, and sternum are spiritually sensitive areas, so it’s best to not get any tattoos there. [15] X Research source The most disrespectful place to get an unalome tattoo is the foot."
