      "title": "“Mascara” is a code word to talk about sex, relationships, and assault.",
      "content": "“Mascara” is a code word to talk about sex, relationships, and assault. “Mascara” started as a way for users to get around TikTok’s censoring algorithm and talk about their past and present romantic relationships with men. However, some users also use the word to talk about their experiences with cheating and sexual assault. Often, TikTok creators use this coded language to talk about relationships and sex with men in a tongue-in-cheek way. For example, @andimitchellll says, “My mascara accidentally stuck its wand in another tube after living in my makeup bag for three months.” They're really talking about a partner who cheated on them. @mel_lloyd admits, “I quite like this new mascara I’ve got, but I don’t know if I own this mascara or if it’s still dipping into other tubes. But it’s the only mascara I want”. Again, this is a reference to a partner who may be sleeping with other people. However, @shadowheretic talks about sexual assault: “When I was 20 & pregnant, I was forced to wear mascara for three hours straight. Now I get vivid flashbacks when I see similar brands.”"

      "content": "The “mascara” trend may allow young people to talk openly about sex. Talking about sexuality can help people better understand their bodies, generate dialogue about sexual wellness, and destigmatize human sexuality. [1] X Research source Some people argue that these code words allow young people to discuss sex freely using language that’s specific to them. While codes allow young people to talk about genitals or other “taboo” body parts freely, others worry that using these codes instead can make those taboos worse."

      "title": "Others worry that codes downplay the significance of sexual assault.",
      "content": "Others worry that codes downplay the significance of sexual assault. When the word “mascara” is used to talk about sexual assault, some are concerned that the jokiness of the trend and the vagueness of the code can minimize the seriousness of sexual assault. [2] X Research source However, some argue that code words like “mascara” can help sexual assault survivors deal with their emotions and reach out for support."

      "content": "Codes can also confuse people who don’t know what they mean. For example, actress Julia Fox made an insensitive comment under TikTok creator @big_whip13’s “mascara” video about sexual assault, assuming that he was using the word “mascara” literally. [3] X Research source @big_whip13’s video said, “I gave this one girl mascara one time and it must’ve been so good that she decided her friend should both try it without my consent.” Julia Fox, assuming he was talking about makeup products, commented “idk why but I don’t feel bad for u lol.” She later made a public apology for her response.

      "content": "The “mascara” trend is part of an ongoing conversation about censorship. In the past, TikTok and other algorithmic platforms have been criticized for being unnecessarily harsh toward content about gender, sexuality, and race. For some users, words like “mascara” represent a need for better moderation on social media platforms. [5] X Research source Some creators have also criticized TikTok moderation filters for disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ+ community and people of color. [6] X Research source Some argue that heavy censorship can generate false or misguided information because accurate terms (like “penis” or “vagina”) are banned from moderation systems.

      "content": "Using code words to avoid content moderation filters isn’t new. Since social media began using AI to detect sensitive or harmful content, code words (sometimes called “algospeak,” short for algorithm-speak) have been used by creators to bypass content censorship that can get their posts removed or down-ranked. [8] X Research source Slang code words for sex (like the 4 bases in dating ) have been used for years and are often a way for young people to discuss sex in an accessible, inclusive way. [9] X Research source This specific form of internet-driven language became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. [10] X Research source Other code words include corn (porn), camping (abortion), le$bean or le dollar bean (lesbian), lip gloss (women), ouid (marijuana), S.A. (sexual assault), seggs (sex), and unalive (suicide). [11] X Research source"

      "content": "TikTok’s moderation systems can age-restrict or ban videos by mistake. While much of TikTok’s content is removed due to violence or nudity, language tends to be a gray area. TikTok’s guidelines don’t list which words are prohibited, but some creators have learned through trial and error which words trigger the system. [12] X Research source TikTok doesn’t allow allusions to sexual activity by young people. Any content with allusions to sexual activity made by adults are restricted and can't be seen by those under 18 years old. [13] X Research source TikTok’s algorithm might mistake words as violating guidelines if they’re often used in posts that spread misinformation or if they’re placed too closely together (like “soldier” and “killed”). [14] X Research source After Roe v. Wade was overturned, users talked about getting an abortion as “camping” or “knitting” so the moderation system wouldn’t mistake their videos as spreading misinformation. [15] X Research source"
