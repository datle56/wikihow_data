      "content": "Recognize the signs. The signs of a trojan horse can be similar to other types of viruses and malware. You may have a trojan horse if you are experiencing any of the following: Is your computer running more slowly than usual? Trojans run software in the background that can use a lot of precious computing power. A \"zombifying\" trojan can even make it impossible for you to use your computer at all while the hacker is using it to attack a network. [1] X Research source Are you seeing programs that you don't recognize, or are programs opening automatically that weren't before? Trojans install software on your computer that can be used to harvest your information or use your computer to attack others. You may not see these programs in your Start menu or Apps folder, but sometimes you'll see them running in the background. Have you noticed a lot of pop-up windows or spam? Trojans may install programs that cause pop-up windows to appear on the screen, sometimes asking for login or banking information. If you see a pop-up asking you for personal information, don't enter that information unless you specifically visited the website or opened the app first."

      "content": "Install and/or update your antivirus software. Both Windows and macOS come with built-in security software designed to keep you safe from trojan horses and other threats. However, if your computer and antivirus software are not up to date, newer trojans may creep through. If you're using Windows 10, Windows Security is always running in the background, doing frequent scans for trojan horses and other threats. [2] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source To make sure it's up to date, press Win + i to open your Settings, click Update & security , and then click Check for updates . Install any updates that are found. If you have a Mac, virus and malware protection is built in to your computer already. [3] X Research source Apple recommends keeping your system up to date to ensure the best protection. Click the Apple menu, select System Preferences , click Software Update , and then click Update Now if any updates are found."

      "content": "Scan your computer. Any reputable antivirus/antimalware software can check your computer thoroughly for trojan horses. If your software detects a trojan horse, it will let you know, and then help you remove it from your computer. Windows Security is great at tracking down and removing most threats on its own, but for a deeper scan, you can run an offline scan . In the Windows search bar, type virus , click Virus & threat protection in the search results, and then click Scan Options . Select Microsoft Defender Offline Scan and click Scan Now . Although you have antivirus protection, you can't run a scan on a Mac without installing non-Apple antivirus/antimalware software. One of the most well-known available is Malwarebytes for Mac , and you can use it to scan your Mac for free. Download Malwarebytes from https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac-download , and then double-click the downloaded file to install the software. Once installed, open Malwarebytes and click Scan Now to start the scan. There are many other antimalware programs you can use on both Windows and macOS. Malwarebytes , Avast , and AVG are all available for both operating systems, and they all have free scanning options. Each of these programs also offers you the option to pay for an upgrade that will always run in the background so it can catch trojan horses and other malware in real-time."

      "content": "Protect yourself from trojan horses in the future. Whether your antivirus scanner found a trojan horse or not, you'll still want to do everything you can to make sure you stay protected from threats in the future. Keep all of your software up to date. When Windows or macOS prompts you to update to the latest version of the operating system, do it as soon as possible. While these update notices don't always pop up at the most convenient times, they are timely—updates usually contain security updates that fix issues that hackers can exploit. The longer you wait, the more vulnerable you are to attack. Never install applications from sources you don't know and trust. Although it's not fail-proof, you'll have a better chance of avoiding trojan horses if you stick to installing software through the App Store app on your Mac or the Microsoft Store app on your PC. Never open attachments in email messages unless you're expecting the attachment. Trojan horses may infect your computer through a program file sent by someone else—even if the email message is from someone you trust, there's a chance a virus infected their computer and is now trying to install trojan horses on other peoples' computers. Avoid visiting risky websites. If your browser warns you that your connection is not secure, or you're being inundated with pop-ups or fake virus notices (these can look convincing!), close your browser tab, open a new one, and browse to a different website."
