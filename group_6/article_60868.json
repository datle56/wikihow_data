      "content": "Recognize characteristic symptoms (Criterion A). In order to diagnose schizophrenia, a mental health clinician will first look for symptoms in five “domains”: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and thinking, grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior (including catatonia), and negative symptoms (symptoms that reflect a reduction in behavior). [1] X Research source Tandon, R., Gaebel, W., Barch, D. M., Bustillo, J., Gur, R. E., Heckers, S., … Carpenter, W. (2013). Definition and description of schizophrenia in the DSM-5. Schizophrenia Research, 150(1), 3–10 You must have at least 2 (or more) of these symptoms. Each must be present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (less if the symptoms have been treated). At least 1 of the minimum 2 symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech."

      "content": "Consider whether you could be having delusions. Delusions are irrational beliefs that often emerge as a response to a perceived threat that is largely or entirely unconfirmed by other people. Delusions are maintained despite evidence that they are not true. [2] X Research source Miyazono, K. (2015). Delusions as harmful malfunctioning beliefs. Consciousness and Cognition, 33, 561–573. There’s a difference between delusions and suspicions. Many people will occasionally have irrational suspicions, such as believing a co-worker is “out to get them” or that they’re having an “unlucky streak.” The difference is whether these beliefs cause you distress or make it hard to function. For example, if you are so convinced that the government is spying on you that you refuse to leave your house to go to work or school, that is a sign that your belief is causing dysfunction in your life. [3] X Research source Seeman, M. V. (2015). On Delusion Formation. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 60(2), 87–90. Delusions may sometimes be bizarre, such as believing you’re an animal or a supernatural being. If you find yourself convinced of something beyond the usual realms of possibility, this could be a sign of delusions (but is certainly not the only possibility)."

C., Caplan, J. P., &amp; Stern, T. A. (2009). Visual Hallucinations: Differential Diagnosis and Treatment. Primary Care Companion to The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 11(1), 26–32. Common hallucinations may be auditory (things you hear), visual (things you see), olfactory (things you smell), or tactile (things you feel, such as the creepy-crawlies on your skin). Hallucinations may affect any of your senses. [5] X Research source For example, consider whether you frequently experience the sensation of things crawling over your body. Do you hear voices when no one is around? Do you see things that “shouldn’t” be there, or that no one else sees?"

      "content": "Think about your religious beliefs and cultural norms. Having a belief that others may see as “strange” does not mean you’re having delusions. Similarly, seeing things that others may not is not always a dangerous hallucination. Beliefs can only be judged as “delusional” or dangerous in accordance with local cultural and religious norms. Beliefs and visions are usually only considered signs of psychosis or schizophrenia if they create unwanted or dysfunctional obstacles in your daily life. For example, a belief that wicked actions will be punished by “fate” or “karma” might seem delusional to some cultures but not to others. [6] X Research source Bhugra, D., &amp; Kalra, G. (2010, July). Cross-Cultural Psychiatry: Context and Issues. Journal of Pakistan Psychiatric Society, pp. 51–54. What count as hallucinations are also related to cultural norms. For example, children in many cultures can experience auditory or visual hallucinations -- such as hearing the voice of a deceased relative -- without being considered psychotic, and without developing psychosis later in life.

High emotional arousal and failures in reality monitoring: Pathways to auditory hallucinations in non-psychotic children? Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 54(2), 102–106. Highly religious people may be more likely to see or hear some things, such as hearing the voice of their deity or seeing an angel. Many belief systems accept these experiences as genuine and productive, even something to be sought after. Unless the experience distresses or endangers the person or others, these visions are not generally a cause for concern. [9] X Research source Reed, P., &amp; Clarke, N. (2014).

      "content": "Consider whether your speech and thinking are disorganized. Disorganized speech and thinking are basically what they sound like. It may be difficult for you to answer questions effectively or fully. Answers may be tangential, fragmented, or incomplete. In many cases, disorganized speech is accompanied by the inability or unwillingness to sustain eye contact or use non-verbal communication, such as gestures or other body language.

Communicating with patients with schizophrenia: characteristics of well functioning and poorly functioning communication. Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3(2), 121–146. You may need the help of others to know whether this is happening.

[12] X Research source Scull, A. (2014). Cultural Sociology of Mental Illness: An A-to-Z Guide. SAGE Publications For example, some religious beliefs hold that individuals will speak in strange or unintelligible language when in contact with a religious figure. Furthermore, narratives are structured very differently across cultures, so stories told by people in one culture may appear “weird” or “disorganized” to an outsider who is unfamiliar with those cultural norms and traditions. [13] X Research source American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. American Psychiatric Association, p. 103. Your language is likely to be “disorganized” only if others who are familiar with your religious and cultural norms cannot understand or interpret it (or it occurs in situations in which your language “should” be understandable)."

For example, a decrease in emotional range or expression would be a “negative symptom.” So would a loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, or a lack of motivation to do things.

The second criterion for a schizophrenia diagnosis is “social/occupational dysfunction.” This dysfunction must be present for a significant portion of the time since you began displaying symptoms. Many conditions can cause dysfunction in your work and social life, so even if you’re experiencing trouble in one or more of these areas, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have schizophrenia.

However, if you’ve noticed your behaviors and motivations change to things that aren’t “normal” for you, this could be something to speak with a mental health professional about. Do you enjoy the same relationships you used to? Do you enjoy socializing in the way you used to? Do you feel like talking with others significantly less than you used to?

The following behaviors are also signs of lapsed self-care: You have started or increased abusing substances such as alcohol or drugs You don’t sleep well, or your sleep cycle varies widely (e.g., 2 hours one night, 14 hours the next, etc.) You don’t “feel” as much, or you feel “flat” Your hygiene has gotten worse You don’t take care of your living space"

Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features can cause symptoms very similar to some of those in schizophrenia. Other illnesses or physical traumas, such as strokes and tumors, can cause psychotic symptoms. [21] X Research source This is why it is crucial to seek help from a trained mental health clinician. You cannot make these distinctions on your own. [22] X Research source Tandon, R., Gaebel, W., Barch, D. M., Bustillo, J., Gur, R. E., Heckers, S., … Carpenter, W. (2013). Definition and description of schizophrenia in the DSM-5. Schizophrenia Research, 150(1), 3–10 Your clinician will ask if you have had major depressive or manic episodes at the same time as your “active-phase” symptoms. A major depressive episode involves at least one of the following for a period of at least 2 weeks: depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy. It will also include other regular or near-constant symptoms in that time frame, such as significant weight changes, disruption in sleeping patterns, fatigue, agitation or slowing down, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, trouble concentrating and thinking, or recurrent thoughts about death. A trained mental health professional will help you determine whether you have experienced a major depressive episode. A manic episode is a distinct period of time (usually at least 1 week) when you experience an abnormally elevated, irritated, or expansive mood. You will also display at least three other symptoms, such as decreased need for sleep, inflated ideas of yourself, flighty or scattered thoughts, distractibility, increased involvement in goal-directed activities, or an excessive involvement in pleasurable activities, especially those with a high risk or potential for negative consequences. A trained mental health professional will help you determine whether you have experienced a manic episode. You will also be asked how long these mood episodes lasted during your “active-phase” symptoms. If your mood episodes were brief in comparison to how long the active and residual periods lasted, this may be a sign of schizophrenia."
