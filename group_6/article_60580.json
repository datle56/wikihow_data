Using a hotter setting on your hair dryer will result in shiny, straight hair. A lower setting will leave your bangs with more texture. As you dry your bangs, comb them in the direction you want them to go. For example, you could comb them to the side or to the front. Apply a heat protectant to your hair before you use heat to style it. For best results, use a hair dryer with an attachment that focuses the air onto a specific spot. That way you can dry just your bangs."
