      "content": "Think of a good topic. No poem is considered brilliant if the topic is not good. It could be the simplest of topics like, save the world, a poetry on love, betrayal, sadness, etc. Make sure that the topic you choose is something that people could connect to in one or the other way. You might write a poem on a personal issue but it should also be something that people could relate to as it's a fact that the readers generally appreciate the things they can relate to.

      "content": "Make the content interesting. Hindi poems are usually filled with emotions. In fact, most of the famous Hindi poems are so because they are very emotional and touching. To catch any reader's attention, you need to make your poem emotional.

      "title": "Be original.",
      "content": "Be original. Never try to imitate the styles of other poets. You can refer to the way they write their poems but never do it the same way as them. Experiment and keep it simple. Form a unique way of writing but don't hesitate from referring to the work of other poets for guidance. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Don't get lost.",
      "content": "Don't get lost. While writing your poem, stay focused so that you don't forget the points you need to write. It's better if you first make a note in points about what you want to write or what your content is going to be & then with a calm and focused mind write your poem as your refer to your points. Sometimes you might have a mind block (you don't know what to write further), at those times take a break and refresh yourself maybe with a fruit or by going out in some open place like a park.
