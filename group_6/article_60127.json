While there are many stylish options to choose from, taking the look into consideration when deciding on a size of ceiling fan is important. If you are concerned about a fan standing out in a space, and you are determined to get a certain size, try getting your ceiling fan in a color that matches the ceiling. It will stand out less than one in a bright or shiny color. Remember that ultimately, the diameter of your ceiling fan blades have to be compatible with the area of your ceiling."

The manual that comes with your fan should have recommendations for ceiling supports. If you are unsure if you have enough support for the ceiling fan you choose, you might consider hiring an electrician to check and add any additional supports in the ceiling that are necessary. The weight of your ceiling fan will be dramatically different depending on its size. The weight is particularly determined by the size of the motor. A larger, stronger motor will weight a lot more than a weaker, smaller motor."
