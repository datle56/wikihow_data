      "content": "Date someone with a lucrative career. To be a stay-at-home girlfriend, you need to have a partner who’s financially successful enough to support themselves and you. Look for potential mates who work at jobs with high-paying salaries, and be on the lookout for red flags that someone can’t support a stay-at-home partner. Doctors, lawyers, dentists, and business managers (IT, marketing manager, financial officers) at well-established companies usually get paid at least six figures a year. [12] X Research source You can usually spot red flags financially on the first date. If they ask you for coffee or drinks instead of dinner and split the bill instead of paying in full, they may be a lovely partner, but they probably don’t have the finances to support a SAHGF lifestyle. If someone grew up with a stay-at-home parent, they’re more likely to be on board with the idea of you staying at home. Assess your priorities before deciding to be a SAHGF. Are you willing to walk away from great matches with meaningful jobs (teachers, non-profit workers, artists), just because they’re less affluent?"

You’ll need a partner who’s fully onboard with the idea of being the sole breadwinner while you take care of the more domestic tasks. While you probably won’t become a SAHGF until you move in together, try to have an open discussion about you wanting to be one early on in your relationship. The quicker you can get on the same page, the better. People who grew up with stay-at-home parents may be more receptive to this concept."

      "content": "Some people believe the lifestyle promotes subservience to men. A lot of critics have voiced concern that the stay-at-home girlfriend lifestyle is anti-feminist. Since most SAHGFs are heterosexual and live with a boyfriend, their life becomes focused on keeping their man happy. Some people see this as a societal step backward for women since it limits them to domesticity and prevents them from having fulfilling careers of their own. However, true feminism is about women being allowed to make whatever lifestyle decisions they want. As long as they make a conscious choice to be stay-at-home girlfriends, the lifestyle isn’t regressive at all. In fact, many stay-at-home girlfriends are proud and vocal feminists.

Because of this, people believe the SAHGF trend glamourizes upper-middle-class women opting out of work that’s most often delegated to poorer people of color. Not everybody has access to this lavish lifestyle, so the trend may have an undercurrent of inequality. [16] X Research source In addition, white women don’t have to deal with the same stereotypes for sharing their stay-at-home girlfriend lifestyle. They may be praised for not working, while women of color are labeled as ‘lazy’ or ‘welfare queens.’ [17] X Research source"
