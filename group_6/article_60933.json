The low-voltage outlet and USB ports will still have power, so you can use them if necessary. Camp Mode on a Tesla isn't like running the AC, lights, or other electronics in a gas-powered car. In that case, the battery will drain quickly. However, the Tesla has a huge battery and can give you multiple days of electricity."

      "content": "1% of battery life per hour. But that varies depending on the climate outside or whether the car has to work harder to keep the temperature steady inside the cabin. Basically, within an 8-hour period, Camp Mode uses about 10% of the battery. If your Tesla has a heat pump, like the Tesla Model Y or the 2021 Model 3, it'll use less battery. These numbers will change depending on the temperature outside and your personal settings. You cannot use Camp Mode if your car battery is 20% or lower. This is so you have enough charge to find a charging station and aren't stranded."

      "content": "Camp Mode is one of three climate control modes, but they all have slightly different uses. In Camp Mode and Dog Mode, Sentry Mode is deactivated. However, the doors remain locked in Dog Mode and unlocked in Camp Mode. Dog Mode also locks the windows so no accidental button presses from the inside will roll the windows down. The screen also doesn't work in Dog Mode, while it works for you in Camp Mode. Keep Climate On does just that â€“ it keeps the climate set to what you like so you can leave the car and return to a comfortable temperature. It will stay on until you turn it off or until your battery dips to 20%."
