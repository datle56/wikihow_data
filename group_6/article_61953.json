      "content": "There are many free anime streaming sites that are very similar. That's because these streaming sites don't host the videos themselves but source them from the same video-sharing hosts. Of all the sites we tested, they all appeared to offer the same titles to watch."

      "content": "Choosing a site comes down to preference. These sites all have similar layouts and features (such as new release schedules, \"watch2gether\", toggles to display an anime's English or Japanese name, and offering both subs and dubs). Below are some free anime streaming sites that we found to be easy and safe to use: 9Anime (9animetv.to) Anicrush (anicrush.to) Animeflix (animeflix.gg) AnimeSuge (animesuge.to) HiAnime (hianime.to) Kaguya (kaguya.app) KissAnime (kissanime.com.ru)"

      "content": "Always use an adblocker when using a free streaming site. When we tested each of the above sites, only 9Anime gave us pop-up ads. However, you should always have an adblocker extension installed if you use free streaming sites to avoid getting ads that could be malicious. While it's not as crucial as using an ad blocker, you might also want to use a VPN as an extra layer of security."

      "title": "Tubi TV.",
      "content": "Tubi TV. Tubi TV is a legit free streaming service—that is, the content on the site isn't pirated. And while the main focus of this site isn't anime, it does have an extensive anime selection. However, you won't find any new or obscure Tubi series. You also don't have a choice in watching subs or dubs—most content is subtitled with Japanese audio unless it says \"dubbed\" in the title. Tubi doesn't require you to make an account to start watching."

    {
      "title": "Pluto TV.",
      "content": "Pluto TV. Pluto TV is another free streaming service with some anime in its catalog. However, like Tubi, the selection isn't incredibly diverse, and you won't find any new and trending titles to watch. You also don't get to choose between dubs and subs, with most content being subtitled. Like Tubi, you can start watching Pluto without an account."
