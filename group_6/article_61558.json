      "content": "Mix 1 oz (30 mL) of a carrier oil with 10 drops of an essential oil. Carrier oils make up the base of your body oil. To make your own body oil , choose an oil like sweet almond oil , sunflower oil , or olive oil. Pour about 1 oz (30 mL) into a bowl. Then, mix in 10 drops of your favorite essential oil, like lavender essential oil , rosehip essential oil , lemon essential oil , sandalwood essential oil , or vanilla essential oil . [14] X Research source It’s important to dilute your essential oils in a carrier oil before applying them to your body. Using undiluted essential oils on your skin can cause redness and irritation. Pour your body oil into a dark, semi-opaque glass jar with a lid. Since sunlight breaks down oil over time, it’s important to store your body oil in a cool, dark place, like your bathroom cabinet. [15] X Research source Typically, body oils will stay good for about 1 year. If your body oil smells off or changes in texture, throw it away."
