      "content": "Learn the rules. Like checkers , the point of the game is to jump pegs and remove them from the game. The rules are simple: [1] X Research source To jump a peg, it must have an empty space next to it. You can use any peg as a jumper, as long as the peg you jump is directly adjacent to it and has an open space next to it. Every peg you jump must be removed. You win when there is only one peg left."

      "content": "Understand the board. Each space on the board has a number from 1 to 15. The top point of the triangle is position 1, and the bottom right is position 15. [2] X Research source This list will use this numbering scheme when describing moves, so keep it in mind."

This isn't all necessary to win the game, but there are some highlights to keep in mind that will help you solve the puzzle . [4] X Research source Mathematically, you can mess the game up with two bad moves. That means that after just two bad moves, the puzzle becomes impossible to solve. Make your moves count! Plan your moves carefully. If you move randomly there is a 50% chance you'll end up with an unsolvable puzzle within two moves. [5] X Research source There are 6,816 solutions to the puzzle. All those solutions, however, are just modifications of two main solution patterns. [6] X Research source"

[7] X Research source In the following videos, grey circles indicate empty holes, red circles indicate pegs you will be moving, and blue holes indicate pegs that are not in play."

      "content": "Make the diamond shape. This basic pattern can be repeated throughout the board, helping you win the game. [8] X Research source Take the peg in position 4 and jump it over the peg in position 2. It will then be in position 1. Use the peg in position 6 to jump position 5. It will now be in position 4. Use the peg in position 1 to jump position 3. It will now be in position 6. These moves will give you the diamond base."

      "content": "Make two groups of pegs. As you'll see, the next set of moves will divide the pegs into two groups, one on each side of the triangle. Move the peg in position 7 to position 2, jumping position 4. Move peg 13 to position 4. Next, move peg 10 to position 8. You should now have two groups of pegs, with 5 pegs on the left side and 3 on the right."
