      "title": "Rip four pieces of tape.",
      "content": "Rip four pieces of tape. The best kind of tape to use is medical tape. Sports strapping tape or cloth tape are good choices as well. Duct tape is used often, but is risky if you have sensitive skin. You want these pieces of tape to be a little bit smaller than the full width of your chest. You might only use three, but rip four pieces just in case. You can also use tape that's specifically designed for your breasts. It's adhesive without being sticky, and it won't hurt when you rip it off."

    {
      "title": "Lay your first piece of tape.",
      "content": "Lay your first piece of tape. Start your first piece of tape on the outer bottom of your left breast. Use your right hand to lay this tape. Tape half of it down. Make sure it is securely stuck by using both hands to rub the tape on."

      "title": "Pull the tape across.",
      "content": "Pull the tape across. Hold onto the end of the tape that’s stuck to your body with your left hand. Pull the tape as tight as you can, and hold it, with your right hand. Release your left hand. Use your left hand to pull your right breast as close to your left breast as you can. Lay the rest of the tape under your right breast to hold it here."

      "title": "Grab your second piece of tape.",
      "content": "Grab your second piece of tape. This time, start with your right breast. Follow the same process. You want your tape to be half on the first piece of tape and half above it.

      "title": "Use your third piece of tape.",
      "content": "Use your third piece of tape. This piece of tape is simply going to be used to secure your tape. Start on the left side of the tape you already have, anchor ½” onto your skin.

      "title": "Add a small strip of tape in the middle.",
      "content": "Add a small strip of tape in the middle. For added cleavage, use a small piece of tape. Rip a piece of tape, no more than two inches long.

      "title": "Rip six pieces of tape no wider than your chest.",
      "content": "Rip six pieces of tape no wider than your chest. In order to tape your breasts in this fashion, you are going to be creating a shape similar to a bra. You’ll need four pieces of tape for the base and two pieces as straps to help give you some lift. This is a great option for extra support and for an open back top. Also, it sits lower than the previous method if you have a lower top."
    },
    {
      "title": "Anchor your first piece of tape.",
      "content": "Anchor your first piece of tape. Take your tape and stick it on the bottom corner of your left breast. It should be anchored at the top of your ribs. Anchor it well, by sticking it down with both hands. Hold this part of the tape firmly with your left hand."

      "title": "Pull the tape across your chest.",

      "title": "Place the second piece of tape over the first.",
      "content": "Place the second piece of tape over the first. Grab your second piece of tape and anchor it on the bottom of your right breast.

    {
      "title": "Use tape to hold your breasts up.",
      "content": "Use tape to hold your breasts up. Now you’re going to create straps. These straps, however, will reach just below your collarbone, rather than over your shoulder. Take a piece of tape and anchor it below your left breast. Pulling upwards, lay your tape from here to your collarbone. Do the same on the right side. This adds lift and makes your breasts look bigger."

      "title": "Secure the whole thing using the remaining tape.",
      "content": "Secure the whole thing using the remaining tape. Use you final pieces of tape to secure everything. Make sure you tape over your straps, and close any gaps in the tape. Pull them tightly to give added support."

    {
      "title": "Soak the tape in warm water.",
      "content": "Soak the tape in warm water. Taking a warm bath or shower will help slacken the tape. If you don’t have a tub available or don’t wish to shower, you can use a wet towel. Simply use warm water to dampen it and lay it over the tape as you lay on your back. This will make is significantly easier to take the tape off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the tape slowly.",
      "content": "Remove the tape slowly. When it comes time to take the tape off, make sure you do so slowly and carefully. If you rip the tape off too quickly, you risk tearing your skin. Even if you used tape that is made for your skin (medical or sports tape), you still need to pull it off slowly. Pluck out the tape as you hold the nearby skin still. Be careful not to pull your skin."
