[1] X Research source In a standard place setting, the knife will be placed on the right side. This is because most people are right-handed."

Hold it with the points facing downward towards your food and your index finger on the back of the handle. [2] X Research source For example, if you are right-handed, then pick the fork up with your left hand. Flip it so the pointy parts, called the tines, are facing the table and place the tip of your index finger on the back of the handle around the part where the handle is curved."

      "content": "Cut a bite of your food with the knife while using the fork to stabilize it.. Place the tines of the fork against the food you want to cut and slice off a piece with the knife. Only cut a bite at a time and eat it before you cut the next piece. [3] X Research source You should never place your cutlery down on the table after cutting your food and starting to eat. Cutting up all your food at once and then placing your knife down is also considered an etiquette no-no. In some cases, it is acceptable to eat using only a fork. For example, when you are eating just a salad or a bowl of spaghetti, it is not necessary to use a knife."

It is, of course, acceptable to use your fork to scoop certain types of foods that naturally can’t be speared. [4] X Research source You can use the knife to help push food that can’t be speared, like rice, onto your fork."

      "content": "Put your cutlery on the plate side-by-side, angled to the right, after you finish. This is the only time it is considered polite to place your fork and knife down during dining. Place all cutlery meant for that course, even if you didn’t use a particular utensil, onto the plate when you are finished. [5] X Research source For example, if the main course was spaghetti and you only used a fork to eat it, you should still place the knife on the plate when you are finished eating. Make sure to place the fork tines-down to indicate that you are finished. For example, this is especially important if you are in a European restaurant and you want the waiter to see that you are done."

Place the knife at about a 45-degree angle on the top right edge of your plate, with the blade facing in, when you are done cutting. [7] X Research source Placing the knife on the edge of the plate is known as the resting position. Do not place the knife on the table in this method to avoid getting the table dirty. You can cut about 4-5 small pieces if you'd like, but do not cut the whole plate at one time. [8] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020."

      "content": "Switch the fork to your dominant hand and flip it so the points face up. Transfer the fork from one hand to the other and reverse the position so you are holding it like a spoon. The index finger of your dominant hand will now be below the handle and your thumb will be on top. [9] X Research source For example, if you are right-handed then you started with the fork in your left hand facing down towards the table. You should now have the fork in your right hand with the tines facing up towards the ceiling. This method of switching the fork and knife back and forth is where the United States style of using cutlery gets it’s zig-zag name. If you are eating something that doesn’t require a knife, then you would just keep your fork in your dominant hand, face up, the whole course."

Hold the fork at a slight angle to the plate, rather than completely vertical. [11] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020."

Angle the handles down and to the right of the plate. [12] X Research source Remember to put any unused cutlery that was meant for that course on the plate as well. If you’re at a restaurant and you don’t do this, the waiter will still do it for you and bring you new cutlery for the next course. It’s proper etiquette to do this yourself."
