      "title": "Understand what other drugs affect it.",
      "content": "Understand what other drugs affect it. While it has not been studied much, it is theorized that certain drugs will make Plan B Step-One less effective. Certain anti-seizure drugs are in this category, including Dilantin, Felbatol, Mesantoin, Peganone, Phenobarbital, and Tegretol. Another drug that can mess with its effectiveness is Rifampin, a drug for tuberculosis. [4] X Research source Talk to your doctor if you are on one of these drugs and need to use emergency contraceptive. Though antibiotics can affect your regular birth control, it has not been shown to affect Plan B One-Step."

      "content": "Watch for your period. Plan B can make your period late. Usually, it will only be a week or so. Nonetheless, Plan B can cause other problems, such as spotting. If you spot for a week after taking the pill, talk to your doctor. [6] X Research source Similarly, if you have abnormal cramps or pain a month or so after taking the pill, you should also talk to your doctor. These symptoms are problematic because they could be a sign that you miscarried a pregnancy. On the other hand, they can indicate an ectopic pregnancy, where an egg implants but not in the uterus."

Additionally, try talking to a pharmacist or cashier who's the same sex as you, if that will help you feel less embarrassed."
