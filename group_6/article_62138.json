      "content": "On all social media platforms, “ONG” means “On God.” Typically, “ONG” is used to emphasize the truth of a statement. It's interchangeable with phrases like “I swear to God” and “hand to God.” [1] X Research source \"ONG I didn't take your shirt! 😭😭 I wouldn't borrow your stuff without asking.\" \"The only reason I go to those meetings is for the free donuts 😂🍩 ONG.\" This meaning applies on all social media platforms, including Snapchat, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok."

      "content": "On TikTok, \"ONG\" can also show approval. The phrase still means “On God,” but it’s used to emphasize how much someone agrees with what another TikTok user says.

      "content": "Over text, “ONG” also means “On God.” In this case, \"ONG\" is almost always used to emphasize honesty or the truth of a statement. It's very informal and interchangeable with the phrase, “I swear to God.” [3] X Research source Sometimes, “On God” can mean something that’s beyond a person’s control, as in “that’s on God” or “that’s God’s responsibility.” [4] X Research source For example: “I can’t help you, that’s ONG to answer your prayers 😓”"

      "content": "Swear that you're being honest or truthful. When you’re chatting informally with friends, you can use “ONG” in a serious way to show honesty, or in a more dramatic way for humorous effect. If you're being serious: “ONG 😧 I didn’t tell anyone that you have a crush on Alex. I would never betray your trust like that.” If you're being funny or dramatic: “I’ve never felt that awkward in my life. Like, peak awkward, ONG 😂😂😂”"

If another TikTok user says something that you completely identify with, let them know by responding with “ONG.” For example: TikTok User: “I don’t care what y’all say, I’m not cancelling skinny jeans.” You: “ONG. I’m wearing a pair now and they look 🔥” TikTok User: \"Drake is literally the GOAT.\" You: \"ONG 💯💯💯\""

Basically, you’re saying that it’s “on God” to take care of. Just keep in mind that this isn't a super common way to use \"ONG.\" For example: \"I can help you study for the test, but the rest is on you & ONG 😂”"
