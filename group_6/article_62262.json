[10] X Research source Graduate school isn’t for everyone, and that’s okay! Do a bit of research or talk to an advisor to see if earning a master’s degree would benefit you and/or your career path. For a degree like an MBA, it's better to wait until you have some relevant experience under your belt before you start applying. Check your college’s website to see if they have any graduate degree programs. Search online for your degree or career path with the words “graduate programs” to find programs all over the world. For example, if you want a master’s degree in publishing, you’d search “publishing graduate programs.”"
