      "title": "Wait 2 to 4 weeks for the ducklings to mature.",
      "content": "Wait 2 to 4 weeks for the ducklings to mature. Both male and female ducklings make similar peeping noises when they first hatch. Once they’re at least 2 weeks old, their voices start to sound different. So, wait at least 2 weeks before you start examining their calls. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Listen for stereotypical quacks to identify female ducklings. Female ducklings are the ones that make the characteristic “quack” sound. They typically make 2 to 10 sharp, short quacks at a time. Their quacks grow louder and brasher as the female ducklings grow older. [2] X Trustworthy Source The Cornell Lab of Ornithology Research lab of Cornell University dedicated to interpreting and conserving the Earth's biological diversity through research and education about birds Go to source It may take some female ducklings as long as 8 weeks to start quacking properly."

      "title": "Check for raspy, monotone noises from male ducks.",
      "content": "Check for raspy, monotone noises from male ducks. Male duckling voices are quite different from the quintessential female duck’s quack. Most species of male ducklings make quiet, scratchy calls that slowly develop to a monotone grumble as they grow older. [3] X Trustworthy Source The Cornell Lab of Ornithology Research lab of Cornell University dedicated to interpreting and conserving the Earth's biological diversity through research and education about birds Go to source Unlike their female counterparts, male ducks actually grow quieter as they grow older, which can sometimes make them harder to distinguish from females. Male Muscovy ducks may hiss too, unlike female Muscovy ducks. So, listen for hissing noises as well. To find out what other noises your particular species of ducklings can make , search for their calls online. For instance, check out the Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s list of duck calls ."

      "title": "Determine if your breed of ducks has a difference in coloring between sexes.",
      "content": "Determine if your breed of ducks has a difference in coloring between sexes. Although it is said that the easiest way to tell the difference between a male and a female duckling is their coloring and patterning, some species of male and female ducks have similarly colored feathers and bills. Research your breed of ducks online to see if there is a visual difference between the males and females. [4] X Research source For instance, Mallard ducks are well known for the differences in plumage between males and females. On the other hand, male and female Mottled ducks look very similar.

      "title": "Male ducklings often have black markings while females are brown.",
      "content": "Male ducklings often have black markings while females are brown. Some species of ducklings have black and brown markings along with their characteristic yellow feathers. Male ducklings typically have some black feathering on their head or back while female ducklings usually have brown markings on their head and back. [6] X Research source Ducklings typically develop their yellow downy feathers when they’re around 3 weeks old. [7] X Research source Note : This method of sexing ducklings isn’t as accurate as inspecting their plumage when they start to mature and grow into adults, as male and female ducklings typically look very similar."

      "title": "Identify male ducklings by their more colorful plumage.",
      "content": "Identify male ducklings by their more colorful plumage. Ornithologist Dr. Roger Lederer says that in general, male ducks are “more brightly colored than females.” They typically have more vibrant heads, chests, and patterning compared to their female counterparts. Ducklings typically develop their adult feathers when they’re around 3 to 4 months old, which is when you can typically see differences between the sexes. [8] X Research source For instance, a male Mallard duck has a rich, chocolate-colored chest, a white collar around his neck, and an emerald green head. The male duck’s colorful feathers are purposeful—they use their feathers to attract a mate during mating season. The more flashy the duck, the more likely they'll find a mate!"

      "title": "Look for duller coloring in females.",
      "content": "Look for duller coloring in females. Unlike their male counterparts, female ducks tend to be more subdued and reserved in their coloring. Most species of female ducks have plumage that’s a mixture of brown and gray. Their bills are typically similar in color, though they sometimes have a splash of orange. [9] X Trustworthy Source The Cornell Lab of Ornithology Research lab of Cornell University dedicated to interpreting and conserving the Earth's biological diversity through research and education about birds Go to source For instance, a female Mallard duck is chestnut brown all over with a gray and orange bill. Note : There is a great amount of variation in duck coloration. Dr. Lederer says it is “best to look the characteristics up in a field guide for specific differences.”"

      "title": "Search for the drake tail feather to identify a male duck.",
      "content": "Search for the drake tail feather to identify a male duck. Another difference between male and female ducks is how their feathers present themselves. At around 3 months old, the tail feathers on some species of male ducks start to curl upwards while the female ducks’ tail feathers stay completely flat. [10] X Research source For instance, the drake tail feather is noticeable in Mallard ducks. The drake feather resembles several of the duck's normal feathers that have curled up and back towards the duck."

      "content": "Look for increased feather growth in female ducks. Generally, a female duck will grow in her feathers a lot quicker than a male, especially around the wings and the tail. Watch your ducklings as they grow and make a note of which ducklings exhibit feather growth first. These are likely the female ducklings. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Consult a vet if you are not experienced in venting ducks. Venting a duckling or duck can potentially harm them, so be extremely careful if you intend to do this process yourself. If you're not experienced in venting ducks, it's best to visit a vet who will do it for you. [12] X Research source Get the vet or someone experienced in venting to physically show you how to vent a duck. This is not a process that you should guess at."

      "content": "Grab the duckling and hold them upside down. Pick up the duckling with one hand. Then, use your other hand to flip them upside down, keeping them in a firm but gentle grip so they don’t fall. You want the duckling’s feet to fall into their belly. [13] X Research source Note : Work as quickly as possible. Don’t keep the duckling upside down for more than 20 seconds, as this can potentially hurt them. Use your thumb to tuck in the duckling’s feet and keep them away from their bottom Alternatively, work on a table to be more steady if you think the duckling will sit still."

      "title": "Apply gentle pressure just below the vent.",
      "content": "Apply gentle pressure just below the vent. The vent (also known as the cloaca) is a small pink slit under the duckling's tail feathers that holds their genitals. Use your thumb to apply gentle pressure about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) below the duck's vent. [14] X Research source The duck may accidentally excrete at this point. Just wipe it off and reapply the pressure."

      "title": "Push back the tail and then apply pressure on each side of the vent.",
      "content": "Push back the tail and then apply pressure on each side of the vent. Use your index finger to gently tuck the duck's tail towards their back. Then, use your thumb and your other index finger to gently apply pressure on both sides of the vent. This inverts the vent and reveals the duck’s genitals. [15] X Research source If you feel any pushback, let go for a few seconds. Then, press in once more. If the cloaca doesn't invert, try applying pressure again until it does."

      "content": "Identify a penis or a vagina to tell the duckling’s sex. If the duckling is male, a corkscrew-shaped penis will come out of the vent (cloaca). It can be pink, white, or even dark gray. If the duckling is female, you will only see a pair of vaginal lips. [16] X Research source Male ducklings can hide their genitals in their vent, so they can be mistaken for females. You can always vent the ducks when they’re a little bigger to determine their sex."

      "title": "Release pressure on the vent and gently put down the duckling.",
      "content": "Release pressure on the vent and gently put down the duckling. Let go of the duckling's vent and let the cloaca reorient. If it doesn't immediately go back to normal, gently rub near it to ease it back inwards. Then, put down the duckling. [17] X Research source"
