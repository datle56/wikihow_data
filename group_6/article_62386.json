      "content": "Cool temperatures limit bacteria growth and the spread of viruses. Hospitals need to stay as sterile as possible to prevent patients, staff, and visitors from contracting illnesses and diseases. Bacteria and viruses typically thrive in warm temperatures, so keeping the hospital cold helps slow their growth on surfaces and medical supplies. [1] X Research source The CDC recommends keeping operating rooms and clean workrooms cooler at around 68-73°F (20-23°C), as these rooms need to stay germ-free.

      "title": "Low temperatures reduce the risk of overheating and drowsiness.",
      "content": "Low temperatures reduce the risk of overheating and drowsiness. Doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff are constantly moving between rooms while wearing scrubs, masks, and other personal protective equipment (PPE) to help their patients. This can cause them to overheat and sweat, so the hospital’s cold temperatures ensure they stay comfortable and clean. The cold also helps staff stay alert and composed, especially if they’re working in an operating room. [4] X Research source Most operating rooms have lots of bright lights and machines that generate heat. So, they’re kept cooler to keep surgeons and staff comfortable. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Condensation and humidity lead to bacteria and fungal growth. Keeping the hospital’s air conditioning running helps cycle out warm, damp air and prevents condensation from forming on walls, surfaces, and medical equipment. [6] X Research source This helps prevent bacteria and mold from growing to keep the hospital as clean and sterile as possible. [7] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Cool air also holds less moisture than warm air, which helps reduce humidity and condensation in the hospital.

      "content": "Cold air helps patients get cozy and sleep better. It’s much easier for hospital staff to warm up their patients and keep them comfortable in cold temperatures than trying to cool them down in the heat. Plus, temperatures around 60-67° F (15-19° C) are ideal for a good night’s rest, which helps patients relax and heal. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Most hospitals keep lots of blankets, socks, and gloves on hand because they know hospitals run cold. If you’re staying in the hospital, just ask your nurse for some extra layers."

      "title": "Cool temperatures prevent important medical supplies from spoiling.",
      "content": "Cool temperatures prevent important medical supplies from spoiling. Most medications, vaccines, and other prescriptions are stored in cool temperatures, as heat can cause the ingredients to degrade and lose their effectiveness. So, hospitals stay cold to ensure their life-saving supplies aren’t harmed. [10] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source The cold is also important for preserving blood and tissues for transfusions and transplants."

      "content": "Cool air helps patients with fevers and burns find relief. Some illnesses and injuries make patients feel hot, so a hospital keeps their rooms at a cool temperature to soothe and relax their patients as much as possible. For instance, patients with a fever or burn typically feel more comfortable staying in a cool room.

Staying in a nice, air-conditioned room keeps them from sweating and getting their wound dirty, which lowers their risk of infection.

      "content": "Cool temperatures ensure machines stay functional. Medical tools, equipment, and machines, like MRI machines, generate a lot of heat when used. Maintaining a cold temperature in the hospital helps offset the heat the equipment generates so they don’t malfunction and stay in tip-top shape. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Cooling a building uses less energy than heating it. Hospitals keep their temperatures lower to reduce their energy use and thus cut down on their energy bill. This lowers their expenses so they have more money to invest in their patients’ care and staff’s well-being. [15] X Research source"
