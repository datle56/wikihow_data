Hot water helps prevent white clothes from fading and is more effective at killing germs and bacteria than cool water. Just check your clothes’ care label to see what temperature water is recommended for washing them, as hot water is safe for some fabrics but can shrink or damage others. [2] X Research source In general, delicate garments require cooler water while sturdier items like jeans, cotton clothes, towels, and linens can handle hotter water. Hot water is generally not recommended for nylon, spandex, lycra, and certain cotton blends, as it can cause them to shrink or become misshapen. It’s best to wash heavily used and soiled items, like linens and towels, in hot water."

Put all of your sturdy fabrics, towels, jeans, cottons, linens, and clothes containing manmade fibers into one pile.

You typically wash delicate fabrics in cool to warm water and sturdy fabrics in warm to hot water. [11] X Research source Sorting your fabrics this way allows you to wash your clothes at the hottest temperature they can tolerate without being damaged. Some delicate items are labeled as hand-wash only. Hand washing your white items is an effective way to get them clean and keep them white. Fabric type also determines what laundry setting to wash your clothes on. You generally wash sturdy fabrics on Normal, Quick Wash, or Heavy (if they’re heavily soiled) and delicate fabrics on Delicate or Hand Wash."
