These three numbers can be added or subtracted in different ways. For example, 10, 3, and 7 form a fact family. You can use these three numbers to create two addition number sentences and two subtraction number sentences: 10-3=7 10-7=3 7+3=10 3+7=10 [8] X Research source"

To demonstrate this to your students, draw a number line ranging from 0 to 10 on the board as a visual. Provide your students with a basic subtraction problem: 9-4=?. Locate the number 4 on your number line. This is your starting point. Locate the number 9 on your number line. This is your final destination. Measure, or count the distance between the two points: “5, 6, 7, 8, 9.” The distance is five. Therefore, 9-4=5. [11] X Research source"
