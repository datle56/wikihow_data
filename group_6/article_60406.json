      "content": "Arrange the vegetables on a grate or steaming pan. If you have a steaming pan like you’d use on a stovetop, then use this. Otherwise, any kind of metal cooking grate will work as well. Lay the vegetables out on the grate. It’s okay if they touch each other. [2] X Research source Chop up large vegetables like peppers and onions. Make sure the pieces aren't small enough to fall through the grate. Smaller vegetables like baby carrots or Brussels sprouts don't have to be chopped, but you can if you prefer to. You don't have to peel vegetables to steam them. Unless you don't like skin on your vegetables, leave the skin on, because it usually contains some essential nutrients. If you chop the vegetables, make each piece the same size so they cook uniformly."

Cover the bottom of a pot, pan, or skillet with 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of boiling water. [4] X Research source Pour carefully so the water doesn’t splash up and burn you. Make sure the pan is oven-safe.

Then, take a sheet of aluminum foil and wrap it over the top of the pot, covering the vegetables. Make sure there are no openings for the steam to escape through.

      "content": "Steam the vegetables for 3-8 minutes, depending on the type. Different vegetables require a different steaming time. In general, steaming them for less time keeps them firm and crunchy. Steaming them longer makes them more tender. Adjust the time based on your preferences. [7] X Research source Cauliflower, broccoli, asparagus, and spinach need 5-6 minutes. Carrots need 6-8 minutes and brussels sprouts need 8-10. Beans and peas only need 3-5 minutes. Adjust your steaming time based on what you’re cooking."

Let them cool for 3-5 minutes before serving them. [8] X Research source Keep your face away from the pot when you take the foil off. Steam will come out and could burn you. Steamed vegetables make an excellent side dish. Sprinkle some salt, pepper, or garlic powder on for extra flavor."

Then cover the bottom of a cast iron skillet with the rocks. [9] X Research source Lava rocks are available at hardware and grilling stores. You can also order them online. Alternative: You can just use a squirt bottle and spritz water on the bottom of the oven and shut the door immediately for the steam effect."
