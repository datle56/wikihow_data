Most importantly, however, this converter still works with music. Many converters detect and block the conversion of music videos to M4A files. Apple and other popular music streamers are constantly working with these sites to prevent the conversion of music into M4A. UKC.com's converter supports music-to-M4A as of this writing, but always test these services before continuing."
