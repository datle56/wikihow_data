It means the same thing on Instagram and other social media, as well. “What’s good?” is sort of like, “What’s going on?” or, “What's up?” It’s a way to casually ask how someone is doing. There’s also no difference between wsg, Wsg, and WSG. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use WSG to ask how somebody is doing. This is the most common way to use WSG. Send “WSG” on its own with a question mark and see how the other person replies. Alternatively, you can send a little introductory note alongside a WSG to ask a question or make your intentions clear. For example, you might send someone: “WSG? How was your shift at work?” “Hey! WSG! I hope you’re doing well.” “WSG Jason?! Long time no talk.”"

      "content": "Send WSG as a smooth, flirty way to reach out or try to meet up. You could send a slick “WSG?” to see if you crush is open to hanging out. This is also a good way to “take their temperature” when it comes to figuring out how interested they are. You could say: “WSG cutie? How was your day?” “Hey!!! WSG? You going to Lonnie’s thing tonight?” “WSG? You trying to link up tonight?”"

      "content": "Try using WSG in a kind of boastful, confrontational way. You can use WSG in a kind of chest-banging, show off way. With this use, WSG is kind of rhetorical question. It’s a bit of a challenge to step up or shut up. In rare instances, you might use it unironically as a threat. For example: “WSG? You trying to get beat down in Smash Bros tonight?” “I heard you were trash talking my jump shot. WSG 😂?? You trying to play after school?” “Were you seriously gossiping about me again? WSG? I thought we got past this?”"

If someone sends you “WSG?” on its own or it seems like they’re just seeing how you’re doing, start off by answering their question . You could tell them what you’re doing, how you are, or both. You could reply to “WSG?” and say: “Nothing, really. Just got home from school. About to make some food.” “Oh, man. I’m exhausted. It’s been a long day. How you doing?” “Not a whole lot. What are you up to?”"

If you like them, lean into it and play along, answering with another acronym of adding a wink emoji to your text. If you don’t like them, brush them off, give them an excuse about why you can’t talk, or just ignore them. You might respond to a flirty WSG message by saying: “Nothing. Just relaxing at home. You trying to hang out, handsome?” “WSG? Ngl, I thought you’d have something slicker than that 😏.” “I’m busy tonight. Sorry.”"

If someone sends you a WSG message where they’re puffing their chest out or playfully scrapping with you, play along by throwing some playful banter back their way. If it seems like they’re seriously trying to fight, your best bet may be to try calming things down before it gets out of hand. For example: “Oh, you think you’re the man, huh? Bet I’d beat you 1 on 1 any time 😏.” “I’d ask you to put your money where your mouth is, but I don’t think you have any money 🤣” “Hey, I’m not trying to start any trouble. I’m sorry if I offended you.”"

In some cities, the water department, sewage department, and gas utilities are bundled together in a single office and they may be abbreviated as “WSG.” You may also see “WSG” in classified ads for apartments, since who pays for these services is a crucial part of any tenant-landlord contract. For example: “Scottsboro’s WSG department recently rolled out a new paperless billing program.” “For rent: Studio apartment in Cass Corridor neighborhood. Landlord pays WSG.” “I’m looking for a roommate. We split WSG. Let me know if you know anybody!”"
