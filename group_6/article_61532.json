The objective (front lens) focuses the target image on the reticle (cross-hairs); the eyepiece (rear lens) focuses the eye on the reticle.

Screw the eyepiece in/out until the reticle is in sharp focus. This may take several tries with removing your eye from the eyepiece between tries to give it a rest."

      "content": "Adjust the objective. Now that we have a clear image of the reticle, the distant target image can be focused on the reticle. In practice, you will think that you are focusing the image on your eye, but what is actually happening is that the image is being focused on the reticle. Most objectives focus by turning the front lens. Some focus by turning a knob on the side of the scope. In any case, the idea is to get a sharp image of the target. It will be easier to focus if you choose a target area with some contrasting texture such as wood grain - you will see the image \"pop\" into focus better on patterns than on large areas."

[6] X Research source This means you have eliminated parallax from your scope system for this target. If the distance to the target changes, you only refocus the front objective (or side focus). You never touch the eyepiece adjustment unless your prescription changes, basically."
