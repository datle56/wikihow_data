      "content": "Birthdays can stir up complicated and unpleasant emotions. In fact, many people experience feelings of sadness, anxiety, or dread on their birthday and the days leading up to it. This phenomenon is called birthday depression or the birthday blues, and it can make someone dislike their birthday or avoid celebrating it. [1] X Research source It’s important to note that birthday depression is not an official medical diagnosis—it’s a term used to describe the temporary negative feelings one may experience in the days surrounding their birthday. If your negative feelings pass after few days, you’re likely just dealing with the birthday blues. This is very different from clinical depression, which is a serious mental health condition involving longer-lasting symptoms. If your symptoms persist longer or become more severe, make an appointment with a mental health professional."
