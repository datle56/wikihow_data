      "content": "Find better cell service. Since SOS Mode is a feature intended to make your phone still able to call emergency services when you're out of your network's range, it may mean you are in a spot with bad reception or outside your coverage area. You can check your network's coverage area online and if you're in a covered area, you should contact them to figure out why you're not getting data (maybe their tower is down temporarily). Even if you're within your network's range, some places get better reception than others. For instance, fixing the error may be as simple as going upstairs if you're in the lower levels of a building where the reception is poor."

Note that having this enabled will accrue extra charges, but will allow you to use your data when you're not in range of your network.
