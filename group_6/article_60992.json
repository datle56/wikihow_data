      "content": "TFTI means “thanks for the invite.” TFTI is typically used in a sarcastic or passive-aggressive way when someone hasn’t been invited to a social gathering. [1] X Research source People do use the acronym to genuinely express thanks sometimes, but this is a bit less common. Here are some examples of how it's used: Example 1: If you post a picture of a fun night out with friends on Instagram, a friend who wasn’t invited may comment, “Wow, looks fun! TFTI 🥺” In this context, TFTI is being used in a sarcastic way. Your friend may be playfully poking fun at you, or they could be a little upset that they weren’t invited to the gathering. Example 2: When texting a friend about a party you went to last weekend, they could respond, “Wait, you went to a party? TFTI 😒” TFTI is also being used in a sarcastic, passive-aggressive way in this situation. Your friend is likely trying to express subtle annoyance at not being invited to something. Example 3: If you invite a friend to a housewarming party, they may respond: “Hey! TFTI, but unfortunately I’ll be out of town next weekend. I hope you have a great time and I can’t wait to see the new place soon!” In this context, your friend is using TFTI to genuinely express gratitude for your invitation. The upbeat tone of the rest of their text shows that they didn’t mean TFTI in a sarcastic or negative way."

      "title": "Using TFTI Sarcastically",
      "content": "Using TFTI Sarcastically If you’re genuinely hurt about not receiving an invitation, it’s better to talk things out with the person , rather than sending them TFTI in a passive aggressive message. [2] X Research source However, it is usually fine to send TFTI to someone if you want to call them out in a lighthearted, joke-y way. Here’s an example of how to use TFTI in a sarcastic (but playful!) context. Person 1: Grace and I met for breakfast the other day, and we found the cutest coffee shop ever. You would love it—they have that brand of oat milk you like! Person 2: Wow, TFTI 😠🤣 You guys have to let me know the next time you go! I’ve been craving a vanilla latte"

      "title": "Using TFTI to Show Appreciation",
      "content": "Using TFTI to Show Appreciation If you want to thank someone for an invitation in a sincere way, it’s acceptable to use TFTI—just make sure the rest of your text is upbeat and positive, so they know you’re not using the acronym in a sarcastic way. Here’s an example: Person 1: I’m throwing a little dinner party at my place next Sunday to show off my skills since I started taking that cooking class. Are you free? Person 2: Hey! TFTI, that sounds so fun. I’m scheduled for a shift at work next Sunday, but I think I can get a friend to cover. I’ll let you know asap!"

      "title": "If someone uses TFTI in a playful context, respond in a lighthearted way.",
      "content": "If someone uses TFTI in a playful context, respond in a lighthearted way. Yes, this person may be subtly calling you out for not including them in a plan or inviting them to a party, but they aren’t actually mad at you. They’re just trying to poke fun at you a little. If the text you’ve received has a joke-y tone, go ahead and match this energy. For example: Them: Okay, just saw the pics of you posted from brunch this morning. TFTI 😠Those waffles look so insanely good 😩 You: Not gonna lie, they were to die for 🤣 We all have to go again soon. Those waffles are worth a second trip! 🧇"

      "content": "If the person seems genuinely upset, respond in a sensitive way. When someone sends TFTI in a very passive-aggressive or emotional text, it’s likely because they feel hurt about being left out. It’s super painful to feel left out, even if your intentions weren’t to exclude this person. [3] X Research source Try to respond with empathy and understanding, rather than reacting defensively. Here’s an example: Them: Audrey just told me you guys went out last weekend, and you know I’ve been frustrated that we don’t hang as much as we used to. TFTI I guess. You: Hey, I’m really sorry I didn’t invite you. Audrey asked me to hang out because she was sad about her breakup, and I didn’t feel like I could invite anyone because she was the one who made the plan. I miss you and would love to hang this weekend if you’re free 🩷"

      "content": "Less commonly, TFTI can stand for “thanks for the info.” This usage of the term was more popular in the 1990s, but it does still occur sometimes. [4] X Research source For example, if you text a friend background information on your parents before they meet them for the first time, your friend might reply, “TFTI! I’m gonna study up so the convo goes smoothly. Gotta make a good first impression!”"
