[1] X Research source What you can do: Get to a safe place where you can collect yourself. Try a breathing exercise to calm yourself down or do a body scan meditation to release tension in your body. Bosch notes that for crying from stress or anxiety, \"a lot of times, if we can come back to the present moment and remind ourselves that we're safe right now, this can help us to settle down.\""

You might find that you're really just trying to keep yourself from thinking about your loneliness.

When your responsibilities and workload gradually increase, you might not even realize how much you're taking on until it becomes too much and overwhelms you. When you don't take enough time for yourself, you're likely to end up burnt out.

If you've lost someone close to you, it's possible you'll find you suddenly burst into tears seemingly for no reason, weeks or even months after you thought you'd already processed the loss . This is just a normal part of grieving and isn't anything to worry about. [6] X Research source What you can do: Take a moment to think about the person you've lost or what might have triggered your grief to bubble to the surface. Sit with your feelings and allow them to come out. Bosch agrees that \"if you have gone through a difficult time, you need to allow yourself to feel the emotions that made you cry.\""

But often you can only push your feelings down for so long before they force their way out. If you've been repressing your emotions for so long that you don't even realize you're doing it, you could easily feel as though you had just suddenly started crying for no reason. [7] X Research source Repressed emotions might also be related to the norms of your culture. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, men might have more repressed emotions in a culture that values stoicism in men. What you can do: Talk to a therapist if possible. They can help you unpack and process emotions that you've repressed as well as work through complex emotions that might be overwhelming you."

People are less likely to be taken off-guard (and perhaps say something insensitive as a result) if they know that you're prone to uncontrollable crying. It's up to you who you talk to, just let them know that you've had sudden crying jags lately and you would appreciate their support as you cope with this issue. [11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Bosch agrees that \"fears are easier to fight when you have support from people who love you,\" so try not to be embarrassed and allow others to help. Talking to others is especially helpful if there's a neurological cause for your crying, which can cause you to cry at completely inappropriate times. If people close to you know about your condition they won't be surprised or weirded out and will understand how to support you."

[12] X Research source For example, if you've been repressing a lot of difficult emotions or holding back a lot of tension, a good cry can help you feel a lot better and more relaxed about your situation.

Even reading a random wikipedia article can be sufficiently distracting that your body \"forgets\" all about that crying it was going to do.

This is the reason uncontrollable crying can be so scary—you've lost control that you normally have. If you find that you can't hold back the tears, especially when they seem to come for no reason, there might be something else going on. [17] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This also relates to times when your crying has nothing to do with what's going on around you. For example, you might be walking across a parking lot and suddenly burst into tears, completely unprovoked. If this only happens to you once it might not be that big of a deal, but if it happens frequently and there's no emotional connection to the crying, there might be a neurological reason."

If your crying jags are increasing in frequency regardless of what you do, that's likely cause for concern.

      "content": "Yes, crying can help ease physical and emotional pain. There are different types of tears—but the kind that are triggered by your emotions can actually be very healing. That's because crying triggers the release of endorphins in your brain, leading to a sense of relief. You might even experience physically pleasurable sensations. [22] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Figuring out what's causing you to cry uncontrollably can help you actually realize these benefits. While crying can serve as a release, it doesn't accomplish much if you don't know what you're releasing. It's important to remember that even though you might think you're crying for no reason, your body always has a reason. Crying is a natural reaction and not something to be embarrassed or ashamed about. [23] X Research source"
