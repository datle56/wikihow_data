      "content": "Using private browser mode, go to a bitcoin paper wallet creation site. As of July 2016, the most popular, open source paper wallet creation site is bitaddress.org and these instructions will use that site. Verify that you are on the correct bitaddress.org site by checking the https certificates by clicking to the left of your browser URL as seen in the photo. Advanced users can be even more secure by downloading a copy of BitAddress from GitHub, verifying the software using the PGP signature, and moving it to a fully offline computer via USB key. You can then run the BitAddress code offline by clicking the HTML file."

      "content": "Once bitaddress.org loads, turn off the internet on your computer. You can do this by turning off your wifi router and or unplugging your ethernet cable. Killing the web connection reduces odds that your private keys will not be leaked over the internet without you knowing it. Bitadress.org was designed to run just fine without an internet connection."

Congrats, you just created a basic, low security paper wallet! On the left is a your Bitcoin address. In the example in the photo the address is \"15TfQt6RyNrqjJknd3b3CRkbwfXJ3i3BNC\". Think of this as your email address. It's OK to share it in public so people (or yourself) can send Bitcoin to the address. On the right is your private key. In this example it's \"L4vfUiBm9XGeaXk8HWPkQfiTogQoZC6kzNnyPnqGEoBQaRXoAYkT\" Think of this as the password to your email address. Never, ever share your private key with anyone or store it on a computer or the web. Anyone who can access your private key can immediately and irretrievably empty your wallet. If you are storing a small amount of Bitcoin and are OK with low security you can print out this wallet and stop now. If you need higher security continue following the steps in Part 2 of this article."

Note that this process is the exact same process you will use to spend or move bitcoins from your paper wallet.
