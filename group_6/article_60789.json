The Flippy Flopper is a soft fabric disc available at most pet stores. The Kong Flyer is also a good choice."

Rub hot dog on the disc and praise your dog for going after it. Play tug gently with the disc. [2] X Expert Source Jennifer Damon Professional Dog Trainer Expert Interview. 18 August 2021. Always let your dog win. Don't rip the disc out of your dog's mouth. Reward any behavior that shows \"drive\" to get the disc. This means that even if your dog jumps up and grabs the disc out of your hand without waiting for you to offer it to her, this is positive! Never tell your dog to 'DROP' the disc. Always use a second disc to entice your dog to drop the one in his mouth, on his own. Remember, always encourage your dog's drive to have and get the disc."

Eventually your dog will get used to the flying disc, learn how to track it in the air, and eventually will want the disc so badly (\"DRIVE!\") that she won't want to wait for it to drop to the ground and will instead grab it out of the air. This is the moment you've been waiting for! Congratulations, you now have a Disc Dog!
