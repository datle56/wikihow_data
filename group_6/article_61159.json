While Square indicates it accepts Visa gift cards, there are mixed reports that Square will reject a Visa gift card if it believes you are using the service once to transfer a balance.

As a payment service provider, Square's services are not limited to merchants. There is no actual penalty for appearing as a merchant when you are not one. You can skip this part and try to make the gift card transfer following the steps in the next part . Just be aware that it may fail."
