[1] X Research source When someone says they're “shooketh,” something has rattled, unsettled, or completely astonished them. The term can be used in a positive or negative context. [2] X Research source Here are some examples: “I’m so shooketh right now. I’m at the grocery store, and I just ran into the two people I didn’t want to see—my ex and his new girlfriend.” “I had no idea you guys were planning this surprise party! I thought I was coming home to my two cats, but I opened the door to find 20 of my best friends instead. I’m literally shooketh.” “Everyone was expecting her to win the gold medal, but she fell on her beam routine. The whole stadium was shooketh.”"

      "content": "The term “shooketh” was coined by comedian Christine Sydelko. In 2017, she posted a YouTube video of herself saying “I’m shooketh” in response to being recognized at Boston Market, a local establishment in Boston, MA. [3] X Research source The suffix “-eth” was common in Early Modern English, the English spoken during Shakespeare’s time, so you’ve likely heard it in some of his works. [4] X Research source For example, “Love comforteth like sunshine after rain.”— Venus and Adonis , Line 799 [5] X Research source Adding a Shakesperean-sounding suffix like “-eth” to a modern slang term like “shook” creates a humorous juxtaposition, which may have been Sydelko’s aim when she said “I’m shooketh.”"

Here are some examples: “I just heard my friend is having a baby, and I’m shooketh. I know we’re grown adults with degrees and full-time jobs, but in my head we’re still kids!” “The night started out normal, but then she had a few too many drinks and picked a huge fight with me in the middle of the bar. I was shooketh.” “My friend just introduced me to her new boyfriend, and it’s this guy that I went on a terrible blind date with a few months ago. I’m shooketh.” “I was just minding my business at the farmer’s market, and I turned around and saw the lead singer of my favorite band. I was literally so shooketh that I couldn’t speak.” “It was only our six month anniversary so I wasn’t expecting anything special, but she surprised me with a bouquet of flowers and matching necklaces. I was so shooketh.”"

      "content": "“Shooketh” is one of many slang terms popularized on social media. Some of these words and phrases got their start with viral videos (like Christine Sydelko’s video saying “I’m shooketh,”) and others simply began spreading in various posts on TikTok, Instagram, or X (formerly Twitter). Here are a few other terms to look out for if you’re hoping to brush up on your Gen Z lingo: It’s giving : Used when something is giving off a certain energy or vibe. For example, “This dinner is amazing! It’s giving gourmet chef.” Cap: Used to accuse someone of lying (“that’s cap” or “you’re capping”). It can also be used to assure someone that you’re telling the truth (“no cap”). Rizz: “Rizz” is short for “charisma,” and it essentially refers to someone’s ability to charm or flirt with someone. Ick: An “ick” is a turn off or unattractive trait in romance or dating. For example, someone might say, “When he ignored me and played video games on our date, it gave me the ick .” Beige flag: A “beige flag” is something that is neither a red flag or a green flag in romance or dating. In other words, it’s a little quirk that isn’t a big deal, but it is unique or unusual. [8] X Research source"
