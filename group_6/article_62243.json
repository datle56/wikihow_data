      "content": "A “stem girl” is a lesbian with a mix of masculine and feminine qualities. This word is reserved for Black and Latina lesbians, and is a combination of 2 other queer terms: stud + femme. A lesbian who calls themself a “stem” has both masculine and feminine qualities in their gender expression—For example, they might wear lots of feminine makeup but dress in masculine clothing, have traditionally masculine interests, or take a more masculine role in relationships. [1] X Research source Stem lesbians often use the pronouns she/her , but may use other pronouns like she/him . Stems don’t currently have an official flag, but they may feel represented by the futch horizon flag, which is used by lesbians who identify as both “femme” and “butch.”"

      "content": "“Stem” is a more recent term that uses the older slang term “stud.” “Stud” became a popular term among Black lesbians in the 1960s, at the height of the civil rights movement, and is similar to the term “butch.” [2] X Research source “Butch” is a term for masculine lesbians, and has been used since the 1940s. [3] X Research source “Stem” has recently become popular on social media, especially TikTok, as a way for users to describe their identity as both masculine and feminine. “Femme,” the other half of “stem,” has also been in use since the 1940s, and describes a lesbian who’s more traditionally feminine."

      "content": "Stud A stud is a masculine Black lesbian. “Masculine” typically means they dress in menswear and adopt traditionally masculine behaviors and roles in relationships. As a term, it’s been around since at least the 60s. [4] X Research source While many Black masculine lesbians use the term “stud,” not all of them do, and some prefer the term “butch,” if they use these sorts of terms at all. Latina lesbians also sometimes use the term “stud,” but otherwise the term refers exclusively to Black lesbians."

      "title": "Use “stem” if you’re a Black or Latina lesbian who’s both femme and butch.",
      "content": "Use “stem” if you’re a Black or Latina lesbian who’s both femme and butch. The only “requirements” for calling yourself “stem” are that you’re Black or Latina, are a lesbian , and like to play fast and loose with gender roles and presentation. Labels are just labels, and you’ll always be more than just a slang word, but it’s a handy way to describe your identity to yourself and others. “Stem” and “stud are terms reserved for Black and Latina lesbians partly because stems and studs draw lots of inspiration from specifically Black, and sometimes Latino, men. It’s a little awkward for a white lesbian to call themselves “stud” or “stem,” since these terms draw so heavily from Black and Latino culture."

Or, you might dress feminine but pursue other lesbians like a more masculine woman. There’s no right or wrong way to be stem—it’s a very personal word that means different things to different people! [9] X Research source Instead of thinking about stem as a box that you check, think about it more like a word that generically describes you, but doesn’t limit you to any rigid behaviors or aesthetics."

You might have a full face of makeup with bright red lipstick and flashy eyeshadow, then wear a flannel and jeans to stem it up. Or, you might combine a cute dress with a close-cropped haircut to go femme in the clothing department but masc in the hair department. The possibilities truly are endless, and there are no rules, so have fun!"

In relationships, you might take a more butch role and pursue your partner, or you might encourage your partner to pursue you if you’re feeling femme. Gender roles and presentation are always in flux, so play around!"

For example, many butches go be “he,” while many femmes stick to “she.” This varies by person, so if a stem girl tells you their pronouns, be sure to stick to them. [10] X Research source If they use multiple pronouns, like “she/him,” make sure to mix it up and use both. Sticking to just one can make it seem like you don’t acknowledge or accept the other half of their identity."

If you know or meet a stem girl, compliment their wardrobe or appearance to let them know you appreciate the effort they take to live the life they choose. For example, you might say, “I love your eyeliner today,” or, “That’s a handsome suit you’re wearing.”"
