      "title": "\"Isk\" usually means \"I don’t know.\"",
      "content": "\"Isk\" usually means \"I don’t know.\" Originally, people were trying to say “idk,” which is short for \"I don't know.\" Since “s” is right next to “d” on the keyboard, they'd end up typing “isk” by mistake and just didn't bother changing it. Today, people either write it as a joke or they’re making the exact same mistake. “Isk how to answer that. 🥱 I’m too tired to think.” \"Maybe I should bake a cake. Isk how to even whisk batter though. 🤦‍♂️\""
    },
    {
      "title": "It can also mean \"I should know.\"",
      "content": "It can also mean \"I should know.\" You're announcing that you should know what to say but actually don't. “Isk” is a just placeholder because you’re speechless, even if you wish you could offer more to the conversation. \"You lost $300 at the casino?! 😨 Isk.\" “You handed someone your raffle ticket to grab a soda and they stole it, then passed it off as theirs?! 🤯 Isk.”"

Isk. 😎 I'm a zoologist.\" “The patch for CoD will come out tomorrow. 😉 Isk. I’m the game dev.”"
    },
