The takers typically have an excessive need for control of the attention, love, sexual relations, and approval they get and give. They will often get these things through expressions of violence, blame, anger, irritation, criticism, neediness, righteousness, incessant talking, invasive touching, or emotional drama. The taker individuals will often express these behaviors outside of the codependent relationship, which will affect their children, work relationships, and familial relationships."

When you left this family environment, you may have continued this pattern within your own romantic and other relationships, which may then get passed on to your children. [9] X Research source"
