      "content": "Talking about yourself When sending a thank-you message, focus on the person you’re writing to rather than yourself. Discuss why you appreciate them, and avoid returning the compliment to yourself. For instance, instead of saying, “You’re such an asset to my team. You and I are a force to be reckoned with,” try, “You’re such a powerful worker! You’re such an asset to this team and are truly a force to be reckoned with.”"

      "title": "Giving out superlatives",
      "content": "Giving out superlatives As etiquette coach Tami Claytor reiterates, it’s very important to make your thank-you note specific. While calling someone the “best coworker ever” may be tempting, avoid doing so. Giving out superlatives may make one peer feel good, but it can also make others feel bad, even if that’s not your intention. Instead, focus on being a team player and thanking a colleague for specific work they’ve done. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For instance, instead of, “You’re the best coworker I’ve ever had,” go with, “You never back down from a challenge, and it’s an honor to have you on my team.”"

[6] X Research source Feeling like you’re appreciated can make a huge difference, especially in the workplace.

      "title": "Say “thank you” to a group of coworkers in an email.",
      "content": "Say “thank you” to a group of coworkers in an email. It can be difficult to get everyone on your team or in the office together. So, give your thanks in the form of an email to show everyone how much you appreciate them. This can be especially helpful if you all work from different locations or have different hours. Make a thank-you email or handwritten note more personal by sending a separate email to each coworker or colleague. While this may take extra effort, it won’t go unnoticed."
