      "title": "Take a cold shower",
      "content": "Take a cold shower the moment that you realize you have a chigger bite. A cold shower may sound unpleasant, but it can help reduce the inflammation caused by chigger bites. This helps relieve itching! Scrub your body with soap to remove any additional chiggers, as well as any digestive enzymes from a bite that may linger on the surface of your skin. [1] X Research source Repeat your lathering and rinsing routine a few times. This will help kill most of the attached chiggers. If you don't want to take a shower, you could instead take a cold bath or apply a cold compress , though this is not as effective for removing chiggers or digestive enzymes. If you take a bath, you can add a few scoops of colloidal oatmeal to help ease your itching."
