      "title": "Write the name and birthdate of the person you want to affect.",
      "content": "Write the name and birthdate of the person you want to affect. Every jar needs a “tag” to be linked to a specific person. [1] X Research source By identifying them to the best of your ability, the energy from the spell will be directed towards them and them alone. This is a spell that uses black magick and negative energy, so be careful to not let it affect anyone else."

    {
      "title": "Write a petition on the back of the paper and fold it up.",
      "content": "Write a petition on the back of the paper and fold it up. You don’t have to write anything if you just want the person’s life to be soured, but if you have a specific goal in mind write it down to make the energy more directed. When you’re finished, fold the paper up into a small packet, always facing the folds away from you. [2] X Research source If you’re trying to banish someone from your life, write something like “[Name] will be filled with strife whenever they think of me and never approach me again.” Whenever you’re doing magick with negative energy, keep the energy directed away from your body. This is why you fold away from yourself. Did this person ever give anything to you? If so, adding it to the packet of paper will increase the potency of the spell. Just don’t use things that include other people, like a group photo."

    {
      "title": "Find a medium-sized lemon and cut a slit into it lengthwise.",
      "content": "Find a medium-sized lemon and cut a slit into it lengthwise. Lemons are used in magick for their high energy and cleansing properties, but in this case, you need them for their sourness and acidity. [3] X Research source Cut the slit deep enough to fit the packet of paper in entirely, but be careful to not cut the lemon in half. The lemon is one of the prime “souring” ingredients of the spell. It causes the targeted person’s life to become unpleasant and sour."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the packet in the lemon and put the whole thing in a jar.",
      "content": "Put the packet in the lemon and put the whole thing in a jar. Put in the packet so it won’t slip out under any circumstances, and use a wide-necked jar that you can fit the lemon through easily. If you need to tighten the lemon more securely, wrap it in twine five times. This is thought to bind the person to the spell and cause extra strife in their life (five is the number of struggle and conflict). Good jars to use are mason jars, pickle jars, and pasta sauce jars. If you don’t have a jar big enough to fit the lemon, use a coffee or drink mix can. Keeping the spell items in the jar stops the person’s actions from affecting you further, essentially energetically cutting them off."

    {
      "title": "Cover the lemon with a mix of spices.",
      "content": "Cover the lemon with a mix of spices. If you don’t want to just sour the person’s life, but to burn them and cause them discomfort, make a spice mix from the following ingredients (that you probably have in your pantry already), and sprinkle it over the lemon. Shake up the jar lightly so everything is totally covered. You will need: Black pepper Cayenne Red pepper flakes Black mustard seed Salt"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the jar halfway with vinegar.",
      "content": "Fill the jar halfway with vinegar. The vinegar is the second “souring” ingredient of this spell and will act similarly to the lemon. Fill the jar at least as high as the top of the lemon. If you’re using a glass jar, don’t fill it entirely to the top with vinegar, or it could burst. Fill it at most three quarters of the way full. Need an especially strong spell? Swap out the vinegar for urine to make everything more potent."
    },
    {
      "title": "Close the jar and seal it with wax.",
      "content": "Close the jar and seal it with wax. Using a candle, drip wax over the top and rim of the jar. While the candle is still lit, place it on top of the jar and let it burn all the way down. The wax might pool down around the jar, so do this on a heat-safe surface. Use black wax if you have it for stronger banishment energy. Burning the candle is part of the spell, so don’t blow it out before it’s done. If you need to put it out for safety reasons, use a metal candle snuffer or put a glass over it to starve the flame. If you’re using a coffee can or something with a plastic lid, use heavy-duty tape to seal it instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shake the jar vigorously and repeat your intentions when the wax is dry.",
      "content": "Shake the jar vigorously and repeat your intentions when the wax is dry. By shaking the jar you are adding energy into the system and imbuing it with magick. Repeat this step over the next seven days or until you start seeing results. Between shakings, store the jar in a dark place. This is thought to fill the person’s life with darkness and cause confusion."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dispose of the jar when the spell is complete.",
      "content": "Dispose of the jar when the spell is complete. Now that the spell has been finished, remove the energy from your home. You can throw the jar in the trash (outside of your home), bury it at a crossroads or the base of a tree, or throw it into a body of fresh water. If everything goes according to plan, you should have sufficiently soured someone’s life and fulfilled your desires. If at any point you wish to undo the curse, you can disassemble the jar and the lemon and say “The curse is broken, it will no longer affect [person]”. [4] X Research source It is thought that burying the jar or throwing it into the water will put continued power into the spell."

    {
      "title": "Write the person’s name on a piece of parchment paper.",
      "content": "Write the person’s name on a piece of parchment paper. On the back of the paper, write your intentions for the spell, then roll it up, facing away from yourself. [5] X Research source If you’re trying to end a relationship with someone, write something like “make [person] not approach me anymore, or [person] will be plagued by trouble”. Remember, this is a black magick curse, so keep your requests ethical. Don’t ask for someone to be harmed physically."

    {
      "title": "Find any size jar, and stick the scroll to the bottom.",
      "content": "Find any size jar, and stick the scroll to the bottom. You can do this by making the scroll longer than the base of the jar. When you push it to the bottom, the ends of the scroll will go up alongside the edges of the jar and will keep it in place. If you’re having trouble getting the scroll to stick, fix it with a small loop of tape. Alternatively, you can burn the scroll and pour the ashes into the jar."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place pennies in the jar.",
      "content": "Place pennies in the jar. You’re asking the spirits to help you with this spell, so give them an offering of coins. Pennies are best because the copper in them is thought to act as a conductor for psychic energies. To add even more bitterness to the jar, use dirty, crusty pennies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sprinkle ground coffee and dried chili pepper into the jar.",
      "content": "Sprinkle ground coffee and dried chili pepper into the jar. The peppers are thought to add an unpleasant spiciness to your target’s life, and the coffee grounds add bitterness and act as another offering. Completely cover the scroll with the mixture. Coffee is also considered an accelerant in spell casting. It can help you speed up the whole process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the jar with white vinegar.",
      "content": "Fill the jar with white vinegar. This will saturate the scroll with sourness, spice, and bitterness and allow everything to evenly mix. Vinegar jars can expand and break when they're overfilled. Always leave air at the top of your jar, and if you have any reservations about using vinegar, you can sub it out for lemon juice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the top of the jar with wax.",
      "content": "Cover the top of the jar with wax. Sealing the jar keeps the negative energy of the spell inside and keeps it watertight. You can use wax melts or a candle for this step. For melts, heat them up in a saucepan and dip the top of the jar in the liquid wax, then take the jar out and pour the rest over the top. To use a candle, light it and let the wax drip over the sides, then place it on top and let it burn down entirely. Always work on a heat-safe surface when using hot wax, and be careful to not get any on your skin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shake the jar while thinking about your intentions.",
      "content": "Shake the jar while thinking about your intentions. Think about what behaviors you want them to change, what you would like to happen to them, and how you want them out of your life. It’s good practice to think of a mirror reflecting their actions back upon them so you aren’t affected any longer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find an appropriate area to put the jar.",
      "content": "Find an appropriate area to put the jar. You don’t want this jar to be opened, so make sure it is hidden when you leave it out in the world. Find an unpleasant area to leave the jar, like by a dump or a container in a park for dog waste. When you see the spell beginning to work, dispose of the jar by burying it or throwing it into the waste receptacle you’ve chosen."

      "title": "Make a paper packet with the name and birthday of who you want to affect.",
      "content": "Make a paper packet with the name and birthday of who you want to affect. This will direct the energy of the spell towards the correct person. Write on a small piece of paper, and fold it facing away from you. Facing the fold away from you sends the energy out into the universe and away from yourself. [6] X Research source Add any paper items you’ve received from this person into the packet for added effect, like a photograph. Make sure they’re the only person in it, though."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare a lemon for the jar.",
      "content": "Prepare a lemon for the jar. The lemon is the heart of your jar and binds your person to the spell. The ingredients listed below are commonly used, but feel free to put in anything you feel drawn to. Making a jar more personalized will only strengthen the spell. Cut the lemon down the middle, being careful to not cut all the way through. Push your packet into the lemon entirely, and sprinkle the whole thing with cayenne pepper or chili flakes (or both, if you’re feeling extra spicey). Poke the lemon full of cloves, nails, and pins. For extra security, use long nails to close the top of the lemon. Wrap the entire lemon in twine five times, and say “I bind [name] from acting against me” or “from coming near me”."

      "title": "Assemble your jar.",
      "content": "Assemble your jar. Now that your lemon is complete, put it in the jar and cover it with white vinegar. You can add crystals like black onyx and white quartz to make the spell more powerful. [7] X Research source Adding shards of mirror to the jar is thought to reflect the person’s actions back on themselves."

      "title": "Seal the jar with more twine and wax.",
      "content": "Seal the jar with more twine and wax. Light a candle and drip the wax along the edges of the lid. This will seal the spell into the jar and keep it watertight. Place the candle on top of the jar and let it melt entirely down the sides."

      "content": "Shake the jar while repeating your intentions. and then store it in a dark place. Take the jar out once a day and shake it to recharge the energy. Do this every day until you see your intention has been fulfilled, then throw the jar away or bury it. In between shakings store the jar in a dark place. This represents the darkness you want to cause in the life of the affected person."
