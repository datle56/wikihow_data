The Pink Stuff can’t be used on carpets, fabric, or anything that can be easily scratched, like car paint or leather. However, it can be used to remove stains on most hard surfaces and clean ovens inside and out. On every surface you clean, do a spot test first. Use a little bit of The Pink Stuff to clean a corner of your surface. If the spot you clean is undamaged after you finish, then you can use The Pink Stuff on the rest of the surface. Make sure not to apply too much pressure to avoid scratching your surfaces. Be especially careful on glass, highly polished steel surfaces, and ceramic cooktops."
