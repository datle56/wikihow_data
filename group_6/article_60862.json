      "content": "Skull Theory: Some people believe that male and female babies have different skull shapes. The basic idea of this theory is that male babies tend to have bigger, squarish heads, while female babies have curvier, rounded heads. Unfortunately, there’s really no scientific evidence to support this theory—but it can still be a fun way to “guess” your baby’s sex ahead of time. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Baby Heart Rate:",
      "content": "Baby Heart Rate: An old wives’ tale claims that a baby’s heart rate in the womb can indicate their sex. According to the myth, babies with a heart rate lower than 140 are more likely to be male, and babies with a heart rate higher than 140 are more likely to be female. The medical community has long since debunked this “method.” Still, there’s no harm in jotting down your little one’s heart rate and making a guess, anyway. [2] X Research source A baby’s heart rate stays in a consistent range as they grow and develop in the womb. This range doesn’t depend on the baby’s sex."

      "title": "Baby Bump Shape:",
      "content": "Baby Bump Shape: A common pregnancy myth is that male and female babies create different “bumps.” As the old wives’ tale goes, a high, protruding bump means you’re having a boy, while a low, well-distributed bump means you’re having a girl. Truthfully, a baby’s sex or gender doesn’t really change the size of the bump —it just depends on how the baby is lying in the womb. [3] X Research source There’s no harm in seeing how you’re carrying, though! Just don’t use the size or shape of your bump as conclusive proof that you’re having a boy or a girl."

      "content": "Linea Nigra Position: Some believe that the pigmentation on your stomach can predict your baby’s sex. Most pregnant people develop a linea nigra, or a pigmented, vertical line that runs over their stomach. According to myth, a line that stops at the belly button means you’re having a girl, while a long line that goes up toward your chest signifies a boy. Naturally, there’s no scientific proof to back this up, but it still can be fun to check out. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Nipple Color:",
      "content": "Nipple Color: Certain pregnancy myths associate darker nipples with having a boy. This actually isn’t true, as most people develop darker nipples during pregnancy because of hormonal changes. [5] X Research source Still, if you’d like to buy into this myth just for fun, more power to you! The same hormones that make your nipples look darker also create the linea nigra on your stomach. They also tend to darken the shade of your moles and beauty marks."

      "content": "Breast Size: A bigger left breast allegedly means you’re having a girl. Feel your chest and see if one of your breasts feels larger than the other. According to a wives’ tale, a larger left breast points to having a baby girl, while a larger right breast points to having a baby boy. Naturally, there’s no actual proof that this is true, but there’s no harm in checking yourself just for fun. [6] X Research source Developing larger breasts is a super common side effect of pregnancy, but the size of your chest has nothing to do with the sex of your baby."

[8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source There’s no harm in playfully guessing that you’re having a girl based on your acne, as long as you know that there’s no medical evidence to back that claim up."

      "content": "Food Cravings: Carrying a boy allegedly makes you crave salt, and carrying a girl makes you crave sweets. As fun as this myth is, there’s no real truth to it. Food cravings are a really typical pregnancy symptom, but they’re usually linked to nutrients that your body needs. Craving potato chips over ice cream doesn’t play a role in your baby’s sex. [9] X Research source There’s nothing wrong with playfully blaming your sweet or salty snack habits on your little one, as long as you’re not seriously believing in the myth."

[10] X Research source This is totally false—mood swings are just a normal part of pregnancy and don’t carry any evidence about the sex of your baby.

By cross-referencing the age and time of your child’s conception with either of these charts, you can “figure out” what your baby’s sex is. Naturally, there’s no conclusive proof that either of these charts work, but they still could be fun to try out. [12] X Research source You can find both Chinese and Mayan gender predictors online."

A fizzing reaction means that you’re having a boy, while a non-fizzing reaction means that you’re having a girl.

As the legend goes, grabbing the key by the curved upper part means that you’re carrying a girl, while grabbing it by the narrow, notched part means you’re having a boy. There’s absolutely no truth to this method whatsoever, but it’s perfectly harmless to try if you’re still curious. [14] X Research source According to this same myth, picking up the key in the very center means that you’re having twins."

If you eat a piece of garlic and don’t reek afterward, you’re apparently having a girl. There’s definitely no evidence that this method can help determine your baby’s sex, but there’s no harm in trying it if you really want. [15] X Research source Garlic is really potent, which is why you might smell garlicky yourself after eating a clove. It has nothing to do with the sex of your baby."

If the ring moves in a line, you’re apparently having a boy; if it moves in a circle, you’re having a girl. There’s absolutely no evidence that this test proves anything, but it can still be something fun and silly to try at home. [16] X Research source"

[18] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source At 20 weeks, your doctor looks for signs of either male or female genitalia on the ultrasound, which helps them conclusively figure out your baby’s sex.

Once you’re at least 9 weeks pregnant, you’ll get a small amount of blood drawn and tested for the presence of a Y-chromosome. If the blood test confirms a Y-chromosome, it’s safe to assume that you’re having a boy. If no Y chromosome shows up on the test, you’re most likely having a girl. Medical experts agree that this procedure is totally safe and doesn’t pose a risk to you or your baby. Fetal DNA tests are around 98% accurate, so you can be confident in whatever results your doctor gives you."

According to “nub theory,” flat or down-pointing genitalia belongs to a girl, while pointed up genitalia belongs to a boy. [20] X Research source Research suggests that nub theory is around 87% accurate, which makes it a fairly safe way to tell if you’re having a boy or a girl."

Keep in mind that morning sickness is a super common symptom, especially when your pregnancy is first starting out. [22] X Research source The severity of nausea and vomiting really depend on the person, and don’t guarantee whether you’ll have a boy or a girl. Plenty of mothers have had terrible morning sickness while carrying sons, after all! Some people think that feeling nauseous is a sign of an unhealthy pregnancy, but this isn't true at all."

Overall, women carrying boys got better scores on these tests than women carrying girls. [23] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source So, if your memory seems to less than its best, there’s a chance that you could be pregnant with a baby girl. The research on memory and a baby’s sex isn’t always conclusive and consistent. Plus, some people naturally have better memories than others—the sex of your baby could have nothing to do with it."

In one particular study, researchers groups of pregnant women experiencing physical or psychological stress. These women ended up giving birth to more baby girls than boys. [24] X Research source So, if you’re feeling extra stressed during your pregnancy, you could possibly be having a baby girl. At a 21:20 ratio, baby boys (on average) are slightly more common than baby girls. In this limited study, the psychologically stressed women ended up having baby girls and boys at a 3:2 ratio.

According to Dr. Saam Ramzi Ismali, a left-positioned placenta means the baby will be a girl, while a right-positioned placenta means the baby will be a boy. This method lets parents identify the baby’s sex at around 6 weeks, but there isn’t a lot of research to back it up so far. [30] X Research source A baby’s genitalia doesn’t distinctly form until at least 9 weeks of pregnancy, which makes some OB/GYN doctors hesitant to support the Ramzi Theory."
