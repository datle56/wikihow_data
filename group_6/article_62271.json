      "title": "Airy Aquarius is independent, preferring sex with no strings attached.",
      "content": "Airy Aquarius is independent, preferring sex with no strings attached. Since Sagittarius is fairly free-spirited and doesn’t like to be tied down, the casual nature of this relationship is very appealing. You might find this couple in a friends-with-benefits situation with clearly defined boundaries attached. Sagittarius tends to get a little turned off when talking about the parameters of a relationship, which is what Aquarius needs before they can feel comfortable. However, the couple can make it work if they’re both open to discussing boundaries before they jump into bed."

      "title": "As a fellow fire sign, Aries and Sag are bound to have a ton of fun together.",
      "content": "As a fellow fire sign, Aries and Sag are bound to have a ton of fun together. Aries isn’t shy about getting someone into bed—when they like you, they’ll be sure to let you know. Sagittarius loves Aries’ straightforward nature, which can lead to a great casual fling. A little role play isn’t uncommon in this relationship, especially if the pair is together long-term. [3] X Research source Aries is a very physical person—it’s how they express their love."

      "title": "Two Sagittariuses understand each other like no one else can.",
      "content": "Two Sagittariuses understand each other like no one else can. Both are upfront and honest, and won’t be offended when the other one tells it like it is. Sagittarius signs are known for their skills in the bedroom, so the two will have endless amounts of fun together. [4] X Research source Two Sags in the bedroom will love to experiment with each other’s bodies. They both know a thing or two about great sex, and they aren’t afraid to show it."

      "title": "Libras are passionate and fun-loving, just like Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Libras are passionate and fun-loving, just like Sagittarius. While a Libra might seem too delicate to pair with the fiery Sag at first, they’ll reveal themselves to be flirtatious and seductive in time. In the bedroom, Libra is more of a “taker” than a “giver,” which can be a little tough for the Sagittarius to deal with. In this pairing, Sag needs to watch out for unfair dynamics. Libra might always want to be the one taken care of, but Sagittariuses deserve a little pampering, too!"

      "title": "Pisces is more emotional, while Sagittarius just wants to have fun.",
      "content": "Pisces is more emotional, while Sagittarius just wants to have fun. In a sexual relationship, a Pisces tends to form deep, emotional bonds, which can be a strange concept to the more casual Sagittarius. However, a Pisces is also willing to do almost anything in the bedroom, as long as you ask nicely. Sagittarius is one of the least committed signs out there. If the Pisces is looking for something serious, this pairing might not work out. Sagittariuses are also infamous social butterflies, which can be frustrating to the more committed Pisces. The Pisces may not appreciate the Sagittarius’ desire to talk to and form connections with everyone they meet. Reader Poll: We asked 708 wikiHow readers who are Pisces, and only 4% said their biggest deal breaker is their partner being less social than them . [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Scorpio is the one sign that can teach Sagittarius a thing or two in bed.",
      "content": "Scorpio is the one sign that can teach Sagittarius a thing or two in bed. Sagittarius will welcome Scorpio’s sexy, passionate energy, as long as it’s not too much for them to handle. This pairing can work out in the short-term, but in the long-run, they tend to clash a little too much. Scorpio’s power of seduction might just take over the more mutable Sagittarius. In this relationship, Sag needs to be careful not to get too obsessed over their partner, especially with all the great sex they’ll be having."

      "content": "Capricorns appreciate the straightforward nature of the Sagittarius. All you need to do to win a Capricorn’s heart is to tell them honestly that you have feelings for them. Once in the bedroom, a Capricorn’s personality changes—they shed that aloof, cold nature along with their clothing for a fun romp between the sheets. [5] X Research source If the Sag can work up the nerve to approach the Capricorn, they have the potential for a fun, flirty romance."

      "title": "Virgor’s prim and proper nature doesn’t mesh well with Sag’s free spirit.",
      "content": "Virgor’s prim and proper nature doesn’t mesh well with Sag’s free spirit. In bed, Virgos are open to experimentation, and they’re often willing to try anything once. However, they can be tough to please, and they often have high expectations for their sexual partners. It’s important for the Sag to keep the Virgo’s needs at the forefront of their mind. Sagittarius tends to bring out the wild side in Virgo, especially when it comes to sex. However, that’s not always what the Virgo wants, so they may be resistant to Sagittarius’s charm."

      "content": "Cancers tend to assume too much about Sag’s actions in the bedroom. While Cancers can be great lovers, they’re also prone to intense mood swings that can turn a Sagittarius off. If a Cancer believes that the Sag isn’t paying them enough attention (or they aren’t getting turned on enough), they might take it personally. In bed, the Cancer needs a lot of reassurance and loving care, while the Sagittarius is just looking to have fun. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Taurus tends to be calm and cool, not passionate and fiery.",
      "content": "Taurus tends to be calm and cool, not passionate and fiery. The chill, earthy Taurus has trouble matching Sagittarius’s energy when it comes to sex. This isn’t to say that the couple can’t have fun in bed, but they might find it a little awkward. Communication is key in this relationship if the couple wants to make it work. Taurus can sometimes ignore their partner’s needs, so it’s important for the Sagittarius to speak up when it comes to their own pleasure."
