      "content": "Use tea tree oil to kill the fungus. Tea tree oil is a well-known natural antimicrobial and shows success in killing Candida fungus. It could be effective in concentrations from 0.25% to 1% if you apply it regularly. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Not all essential oils come diluted, so check to make sure the oil is diluted before applying it to your skin. If the oil isn’t diluted, mix it with a carrier oil like jojoba. Add 1 drop of tea tree oil to each teaspoon (5 ml) of carrier oil for a 1% concentration. [2] X Research source The rash may still take some time to clear up, so continue using the oil for 1-2 weeks to see if there is any improvement."

      "content": "Try coconut oil. Pure coconut oil also shows some promise for killing Candida fungus and is a potential treatment for strains resistant to conventional antifungal medication. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For use on your skin, take a small amount on your fingertip and massage it into the rash. Repeat this treatment once a day. [4] X Research source Good-quality coconut oil is solid and waxy. If it’s liquid, then it usually has some additives or it’s too hot.

      "title": "Keep the rash clean and dry.",
      "content": "Keep the rash clean and dry. Keeping the rash and surrounding area clean and dry is a good way to stop the fungus from spreading. Wash the rash normally with a gentle soap, then pat it dry with a towel. [6] X Research source Don’t use the towel that you dried yourself with again before washing it. You could spread the fungus to other parts of your body. Make sure your skin is dry before you get dressed, because fungus grows in moist environments."

      "title": "Rub the area with absorbent powder to keep it dry.",
      "content": "Rub the area with absorbent powder to keep it dry. A bit of powder can soak up any leftover moisture and keep the rash dry. This helps prevent the fungus from spreading.

      "title": "Keep the rash exposed to air if you can.",
      "content": "Keep the rash exposed to air if you can. The fungus can’t reproduce as well if it’s exposed to air.

      "content": "Wear loose-fitting clothing if the rash is in a private spot. You can’t always keep the rash uncovered, especially if it’s on certain parts of your body. In these cases, wear loose-fitting clothing as much as possible until the rash clears up. This prevents moisture and heat from building up and allowing the fungus to reproduce. [9] X Research source If you’re prone to these infections, then wearing loose-fitting clothing regularly is a good preventative measure."

      "title": "Apply an over-the-counter antifungal cream to clear the rash.",
      "content": "Apply an over-the-counter antifungal cream to clear the rash. A much more effective treatment for a yeast infection is an antifungal cream, which you can purchase from any pharmacy. The application instructions may vary depending on the type that you get, but in most cases you have to apply the cream daily for 1-2 weeks. The rash should start improving within 1 week of this treatment. [12] X Research source Common antifungal creams are miconazole and clotrimazole. If you aren’t sure which one to get, ask the pharmacist for guidance. Always read and follow the application instructions on the cream that you use."

Within a week or 2, the rash should clear up. [13] X Research source Always follow your dermatologist’s instructions and use the cream exactly as directed. Don’t stop using it too early or the rash could come back. Keep your dermatologist informed and go in for a follow-up visit if the rash doesn’t get better."

      "title": "Take antifungal medication for persistent infections.",
      "content": "Take antifungal medication for persistent infections. In less common cases, the yeast infection may not respond to topical treatments. In this case, your dermatologist will probably prescribe an oral antifungal medication instead, usually in tablet form. Take this medication exactly as your dermatologist tells you to and finish the entire course to fight the infection. [14] X Research source Never stop taking the medication too early. The fungus might not be completely gone and the rash could come back. You may need oral medication if you have a compromised immune system and can’t fight the infection yourself."
