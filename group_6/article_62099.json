      "content": "GG stands for “good game.” In professional sports leagues, many teams line up at the end of a match to shake hands and politely acknowledge their opponents. In the world of video games, sending GG is essentially the equivalent of this—you’re letting your opponents know that you enjoyed the match, all while acknowledging the final result of the game. GG is often sent on its own without anything else added to the message. GG is commonly used in online multiplayer gaming communities, like League of Legends , Rocket League , Roblox , Fortnite , and so on."

      "content": "Send GG after poor gameplay or a bad fight to be sarcastic. In some instances, people have sent GG in a disparaging way to comment on a poorly played part of the game, like a bad team fight. Using GG in this way is pretty unsportsmanlike and won’t score you any points or credibility with your teammates. For instance, you might send a salty GG while playing a round of “Murder Mystery 2” in Roblox when you’re eliminated from the game for being suspected as the killer."
