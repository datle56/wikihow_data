      "title": "Open your mouth.",
      "content": "Open your mouth. You'll want to open your mouth as wide as is comfortable, but not so wide that it causes discomfort. This makes your tongue more accessible and increases the ease of scraping."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stick out your tongue.",
      "content": "Stick out your tongue. The goal here is to comfortably increase access to your tongue, so stick your tongue outside your mouth as far as you are able to. Avoid pointing your tongue, as this decreases surface area and makes scraping less effective."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick up the scraper.",
      "content": "Pick up the scraper. Holding the handle of the tongue scraper, place it as far back on your tongue as you comfortably can. The farther back it is placed, the more surface area you’ll be able to scrape. If you feel a tickle or a gagging sensation, however, you’ve likely placed the scraper too far back. After many scraping sessions, you may be able to place the scraper further back into your mouth than you could in your initial session."
    },
    {
      "title": "Begin scraping.",
      "content": "Begin scraping. Apply firm pressure to the tongue scraper. In one slow, smooth motion, pull the scraper from the back of your tongue to the front. The rough edge of the scraper will rub against the tongue surface and remove any coating or residue. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Scraping should involve firm pressure, but never discomfort or abrasion to the skin. When you begin scraping, it is best to err on the side of caution and start with lighter pressure, rather than heavy strokes. From there, gently increase pressure until the right amount is achieved. A maximum number of four to eight scraping movements should be enough for the day. Never move the scraper in a backwards direction. Instead, move your scraper from the back of your tongue to the tip. Going backwards spreads the scrapings back over your tongue and requires you to repeat the scraping process."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the scraper after each stroke.",
      "content": "Rinse the scraper after each stroke. With every stroke, the scraper removes the coating on your tongue and pushes it to the tip. To avoid spreading these scrapings back over your tongue, rinse the scraper and your mouth after each stroke.

      "title": "Consider tongue size.",
      "content": "Consider tongue size. If you have a large tongue, a wide profile, u-shaped scraper is the most efficient way to clean your tongue. Children or people with smaller tongues may want to choose a y-shaped scraper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about your comfort.",
      "content": "Think about your comfort. If you have a very sensitive gag reflex, consider this when choosing your scraper. Some people opt for a tongue brush, which combines elements of a toothbrush and a scraper. This type of tongue scraper is narrower than the u-shaped scraper but does have a taller profile, which may also trigger discomfort. A good rule of thumb is to consider how comfortable you'd be placing your toothbrush near the back of your mouth. If that's problematic, opt for a y-shaped tongue scraper. These are smaller and usually have bent sides to accommodate sensitivity."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for efficiency.",
      "content": "Look for efficiency. If sensitivity is less of a concern, get a scraper with multiple blades. Multiple blades expedite the removal of debris. These can be y-shaped, usually with dual blades; however, there are narrower versions with four to five blades that have a similar size-profile to a toothbrush."

    {
      "title": "Consider material.",
      "content": "Consider material. Tongue scrapers are typically made of stainless steel, copper, or plastic. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A metal scraper can be kept long-term and periodically disinfected by boiling in water. Plastic scrapers are cheaper; however, they are intended to be disposable and must be replaced every three to four months."

By itself, tongue scraping cannot ensure good oral hygiene; however, as part of a regimen including brushing and flossing, it has proven benefits.

These bacteria release volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), which produce a bad smell.
