  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "“Happy New Year, made any resolutions yet?”",
      "content": "“Happy New Year, made any resolutions yet?” Send this text if you don’t want to risk the awkwardness of a flirty text not working. It’s pretty vanilla, but it gets the conversation going! If you want, you can show more interest later once you’ve gotten talking."
    },
    {
      "title": "“I just got a notification from my photo app with this picture and it made me think of you! How are you?”",
      "content": "“I just got a notification from my photo app with this picture and it made me think of you! How are you?” This kind of thing happens all the time! You see an old photo that gets you all gooey-hearted about your crush and you just have to see them again. Use that photo to connect with them–it’s the perfect excuse to reach out to someone, since everyone sends that kind of ‘remember this?’ text to their friends, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "“I’m really excited about my New Year’s resolution this year…” “...Seeing more of you.”",
      "content": "“I’m really excited about my New Year’s resolution this year…” “...Seeing more of you.” Send this cute pickup line to make your crush curious about you, and then make them blush with your sweet talk. Send the first text, and then wait for their response of what the resolution is. Once they’ve responded, flatter them with the cutesy second text."
    },
    {
      "title": "“They just played a BTS song at the party I’m at, I couldn’t help thinking of you! What are you up to tonight?”",
      "content": "“They just played a BTS song at the party I’m at, I couldn’t help thinking of you! What are you up to tonight?” By referencing a song they love, you get to show that you pay attention to their favorite things and that you have good taste in music. It’s a win-win. Who knows, the next time you hear the song you could be dancing to it together!"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Thinking about this past year I couldn’t help remembering our trip to the beach in July. It was such a highlight of the year. Want to go out sometime next week?”",
      "content": "“Thinking about this past year I couldn’t help remembering our trip to the beach in July. It was such a highlight of the year. Want to go out sometime next week?” Ah, memories! This text will have your crush reliving the good times they’ve had with you, and from there it’s easy to transition to seeing them again."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Happy New Year! Want to make plans for next year (meaning next week haha)?”",
      "content": "“Happy New Year! Want to make plans for next year (meaning next week haha)?” It’s a New Year’s tradition to make jokes about how next year is already tomorrow. Use that old punchline to make plans with your crush!"
    },
    {
      "title": "“What are you up to tonight, want to ring in the new year together?”",
      "content": "“What are you up to tonight, want to ring in the new year together?” Oh, we see you slyly asking if they want a New Year’s kiss! Because it’s indirectly flirty, this is a low-risk way to know if they’re interested in you. And if they say yes, hooray! Just make sure to ask more directly later before kissing them."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Got any plans for a midnight kiss tonight?”",
      "content": "“Got any plans for a midnight kiss tonight?” This is some no-nonsense flirtation, especially if you pair it with the right emoji , like 👀 or 😈, but it still leaves room for your crush to opt out if they’re not interested."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Where will you be when the ball drops tonight? I’ve got a glass of champagne with your name on it.”",
      "content": "“Where will you be when the ball drops tonight? I’ve got a glass of champagne with your name on it.” You can imagine an expert flirt saying this exact line in a movie, right? As a text, it strikes the right balance of confidence and cuteness."
    },
    {
      "title": "“New Year’s Eve kisses are so overrated. I’m a much bigger fan of the January 2nd kiss, what do you think 😏”",
      "content": "“New Year’s Eve kisses are so overrated. I’m a much bigger fan of the January 2nd kiss, what do you think 😏” This is the text for that panicked moment when you realize it’s too late to see your crush at midnight, but you still really want to see them. It puts you out there in a big way, but the joke makes it land a little softer. If they’re already interested in you, this text will make them super excited, but if not, it might make them feel awkward. So only do this if you’re willing to take a risk!"
    },
    {
      "title": "“New year, new us?”",
      "content": "“New year, new us?” Send this new spin on the classic “New Year, new me” saying to show your crush that you want to start with a new slate or define your relationship in the coming year."
    },
    {
      "title": "“I don’t think I can wait until next year to see you again 😂 wanna meet up tonight?”",
      "content": "“I don’t think I can wait until next year to see you again 😂 wanna meet up tonight?” A clever variation on the New Year’s punchline of how soon next year is–one that makes it clear how badly you want to see them tonight!"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Remembering this past year I can’t stop thinking about you. I really want to see you again this year.”",
      "content": "“Remembering this past year I can’t stop thinking about you. I really want to see you again this year.” This is a really direct way to show interest, and directness can be attractive! It makes it clear that you’re really into them, which will be a huge thrill if your crush feels the same way about you."
    },
    {
      "title": "“What do you think about more late-night bagel runs in the next year?”",
      "content": "“What do you think about more late-night bagel runs in the next year?” Remind your crush of all the fun dates you’ve been on–it could make them feel just as sentimental as you!"
    },
    {
      "title": "“I’m thinking about next year and the one thing I know is that I want you to be a part of it.”",
      "content": "“I’m thinking about next year and the one thing I know is that I want you to be a part of it.” For a lot of people, nothing is more attractive than sincere interest. This text isn’t too cheesy and it expresses your emotions in a serious, mature way."
    },
    {
      "title": "“You up?”",
      "content": "“You up?” It’s a classic late-night text, and it works just as well on New Year’s Eve as it does the rest of the year. Even if it’s long past midnight, send this line to see if they’re interested in a hook-up. Just be ready to backpedal or laugh at yourself, since it is such a cliché."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Who cares about midnight, want to wake up next to me on New Year’s Day?”",
      "content": "“Who cares about midnight, want to wake up next to me on New Year’s Day?” Send this flirty text to invite them over to your place on New Year’s Eve. It’s a big swing, but if you’re getting the right vibes from your crush, go ahead and shoot your shot."
    },
    {
      "title": "“This photo just came up on my phone and it took me way back. I’d love to see you again tonight, are you in?”",
      "content": "“This photo just came up on my phone and it took me way back. I’d love to see you again tonight, are you in?” Old photos bring back such a rush of nostalgia about a fling. Send a photo of you two to show your crush that you want to relive the glory days, and maybe it’ll remind them of how good you were together."
    },
    {
      "title": "“The time we spent together was perfect. Want to bring it back in the New Year?”",
      "content": "“The time we spent together was perfect. Want to bring it back in the New Year?” If you want to bring an old relationship back, there’s no time like the New Year for an excuse to start it back again. If you messed up and need to apologize for how it all ended, do that too ."
    },
    {
      "title": "“I’d give anything to be with you tonight at midnight.”",
      "content": "“I’d give anything to be with you tonight at midnight.” This one is pretty steamy, and it’s almost pleading to see them again. It might just be the text to reignite an old relationship–but make sure you’re both ready for it first."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Want to make one last impulsive decision of the year with me?”",
      "content": "“Want to make one last impulsive decision of the year with me?” Keep things fun and flirty! There’s nothing like this kind of ‘make a bad decision with me’ message that makes an old flame want to drop everything and see you."
    },
    {
      "title": "”No matter what that New Year’s song says, I think old acquaintances shouldn’t be forgot–what do you say? Wanna meet up tonight?”",
      "content": "”No matter what that New Year’s song says, I think old acquaintances shouldn’t be forgot–what do you say? Wanna meet up tonight?” The New Year’s song “Auld Lang Syne” goes, “should old acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind,” but that’s not very flirty, is it? If you think they’ll get the reference, send this clever text to reunite with a crush you haven’t seen in a while."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Want to make up for lost time tonight?”",
      "content": "“Want to make up for lost time tonight?” Is your ex-lover in town for the holidays? Pretend like no time has passed and you’re hopelessly in love again! Send this text if it’s been a while since you’ve seen them, and you both want to catch up–and hook up."
