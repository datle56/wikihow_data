      "title": "Relax and think through your feelings as they come to you.",
      "content": "Relax and think through your feelings as they come to you. Whenever you feel something, take a second to sit with what you’re feeling. Think about how you feel and let the emotion wash over you naturally. It will be a lot easier to show how you feel if you take a moment to analyze what you’re feeling. [1] X Research source This will make you more aware of how your feelings influence the way you think. For example, if you notice that you often get frustrated at other people when you’re not in control, you can stop yourself from lashing out in an unproductive way in the future."

      "title": "Giving your feeling a name makes it easier to understand.",
      "content": "Giving your feeling a name makes it easier to understand. Once you’re comfortable with a feeling, give the emotion a name. Is that pit in your stomach excitement, or are you anxious about something? If you don’t feel anything particularly moving, are you bored, apathetic, or content? This process will make you more self-aware. It will also help you express what you’re feeling. Try to avoid over-exaggerating. Did you really “hate” that business meeting, or are you concerned about the company’s direction? Did you “love” your dinner, or did you just enjoy it? Even when emotions feel really powerful, naming them accurately can reinforce your sense of self-control."

      "title": "Self-reflecting by writing will help you build your emotional intelligence.",
      "content": "Self-reflecting by writing will help you build your emotional intelligence. One way to build on your ability to open up emotionally to others is to keep a daily journal. Treat it as a special space for you to open up and be honest. Every day, jot down a paragraph or two about your day and how it makes you feel. This will help you track your feelings over time and put you more in tune with yourself. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Writing about your feelings every day is also therapeutic. Taking time to write through your frustrations and joys is a great way to keep your mind from running all over the place at night. For example, you may write, “Today, I went to class and then grabbed lunch with Jamie. I was completely bored by class, but that’s okay. We’re covering more interesting material next week. I really like hanging out with Jamie, and we had a great meal…”"

      "title": "Demonstrating how you feel is easy if you’re mindful of your expression!",
      "content": "Demonstrating how you feel is easy if you’re mindful of your expression! Smiling, grimacing, or frowning is a great way to communicate how you’re feeling without saying anything. If you tend to mask your facial expressions or try to hold them in, just let it go. Smile when you’re happy, laugh when something is funny, and frown if you’re upset. [3] X Research source Facial expressions are totally natural, so try not to be self-conscious about it."

      "title": "Your nonverbal behavior is a large part of how you express yourself.",
      "content": "Your nonverbal behavior is a large part of how you express yourself. Face the person and make eye contact to appear comfortable and open. If you face the person you’re talking to and make eye contact, you will appear natural and convey a sense of calm. [4] X Expert Source Dan Klein Storytelling Teacher Expert Interview. 22 March 2019. This can also make you seem receptive, friendly, and open to conversation. [5] X Research source If you aren’t feeling great and you want to be left alone, keep your head down and hide your hands. This is really important when you’re interviewing for a job, trying to network, or going on a first date. If you seem closed off and you aren’t making eye contact, it can make you appear squeamish or nervous."

      "title": "Communicate intensity by controlling the volume of your voice.",
      "content": "Communicate intensity by controlling the volume of your voice. If you’re trying to convey anger or excitement, raise the volume of your voice a little bit. If you’re trying to communicate fear, nervousness, or submission, lower the volume of your voice. Practice controlling the volume of your voice when you’re talking with people to get better at accurately conveying the way you feel. [6] X Research source This is one of those things that people rarely think about, but the volume of your voice plays a big role in how people understand the way you’re feeling."

      "title": "Talk about your daily experiences with your loved ones.",
      "content": "Talk about your daily experiences with your loved ones. If you see your spouse, partner, or family every day, have a quick chat about your day went. These little check-ins are a great way to open up and get used to sharing how you feel. [7] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 6 September 2018. By openly discussing your daily experiences, you’ll find it much easier to navigate difficult times and much more rewarding to celebrate the good times. [8] X Research source Communication is a two-way street. Make sure that you actively listen to others when they’re telling you how they feel as well. [9] X Research source For example, instead of coming home from work and just turning the TV on, take 5-10 minutes to talk to your partner or roommate. You may say, “Wow, I had a really exhausting day at work. I was really productive, but I am totally wiped. How was your day?”"

      "title": "Respond honestly when close friends ask, “How are you doing?”",
      "content": "Respond honestly when close friends ask, “How are you doing?” If you’re one of those folks that always says, “I’m fine” when a good friend or family member asks you how you’re doing, stop! Instead of ignoring this little question, treat it as an opportunity to open up and share how you’re feeling. Even if you think they don’t really want to know how you feel, people do care about you and they’ll be happy to see you opening up. [10] X Research source For example, if your mother asks you, “How are you doing?” you may say, “You know, I’m kind of frustrated with work lately,” or, “I’m actually really great. I’m looking forward to this road trip next week.” These little interactions are a great way to open up to your loved ones. If a stranger or acquaintance asks you how you’re doing, it may not be appropriate to start sharing everything on your mind. It’s a good thing to be honest with close friends and family, though!"

      "content": "Being appreciative is one of the best ways to show emotion. It’s also a key part of strengthening your relationships while spreading positivity. If you’re trying to show emotion more often, a lot of that communication is going to be focused on your experiences and feelings. Spreading the love is a great way to share how you feel while improving the lives of those around you! [11] X Research source If verbal communication isn’t your thing, say it with gifts! Buy your partner some flowers or chocolates. Offer to take your best friend out to eat. Giving gifts—even when they aren’t expensive—is a great way to show people you care. For example, if a coworker performs gives a really good presentation, pull them aside and tell them how great they did after the meeting is over. If your spouse cooks a great dinner, really go into detail and tell them how much you loved the recipe. Say “thank you” and emphasize how much you appreciate them cooking for you."

      "title": "Assert yourself politely if someone upsets you or crosses a line.",
      "content": "Assert yourself politely if someone upsets you or crosses a line. Some people let negative emotions build up until they reach a boiling point. To avoid this, assert yourself in the kindest way possible when you’re angry or irritated. Not only will you feel better, but you’ll solve potential conflicts without things getting out of hand. [12] X Research source For example, If a coworker snaps at you during a meeting, say, “I don’t appreciate you talking to me this way. I’m willing to discuss this calmly, but this isn’t called for.” If a close friend keeps blowing off your dinner plans, say, “It frustrates me when you call off at the last minute and it makes me feel like you don’t value our friendship.”"

      "content": "Allow yourself to be vulnerable by sharing unpleasant feelings. When you discuss your anxieties, fears, and concerns, you show people that you trust them. If something is bothering you, tell your partner, best friend, or family. It can be tempting to compartmentalize negative feelings, but this can make it hard to discuss painful topics in the future. It may also give the impression that you’re hiding something. [13] X Research source If someone you’re close to notices something is on your mind and they ask, “What’s wrong?” tell them. You may say, “Honestly, I’m really upset about the way the conversation with my brother went today. Do you mind if we talk about it for a bit?” Never feel bad about telling people how you feel. This may be embarrassing or scary at first, but it’ll get much easier over time!

Take a cooking class with your partner, or go on a 20-minute walk every day. Being emotionally available and sharing how you feel is a lot easier when you have fun with the people you care about, and tough conversations are a lot easier to put into perspective when you’ve developed a positive bond.
