      "content": "Clarify your daily expectations and job responsibilities. In scenarios in which your boss is asking you to do things outside of your required responsibilities, it can be hard to figure out how to professionally say, \"That's not my job.\" In a situation like this, refer to your documented job description to support your denial and clarify your key responsibilities. [1] X Research source When tasks outside of your job responsibility are dumped on you, it can make you feel underappreciated, undervalued, and overworked. If you need access to your job description, refer to your workplace's Career Portal or contact HR for written documentation of the requirements for your role."

      "content": "Adapt to your boss's communication style. Everyone has a different way of communicating—some more effective than others. If your boss is a micromanager, the best way to handle this situation is by anticipating what they'll expect or ask of you. If you know they're going to want to see detailed reports, for example, have them ready to go. [2] X Research source It may feel frustrating that they don't trust you, but by regularly anticipating their needs, your boss will be able to see you're someone they don't need to be on top of."

      "title": "Address issues directly in a calm, respectful manner.",
      "content": "Address issues directly in a calm, respectful manner. If you feel your boss is mistreating you, don't be afraid to bring it to their attention calmly and respectfully. As you would address your feelings to a romantic partner, do the same with your boss. Use \"I\" or \"me\" statements to express your feelings without placing the blame on them. You could say, \"Lately, I've been feeling a little overwhelmed by my workload,\" which sounds better than, \"You've been giving me too much work.\" Certified Career, Leadership, and Happiness Coach Manuela Pauer says, “The key to approaching difficult conversations with your boss is to make it collaborative. You can start by simply envisioning both of you working as a team to find a solution to the problem.” This way, it shows you both have a common goal."

      "title": "Find common ground or interests to lessen the tension.",
      "content": "Find common ground or interests to lessen the tension. You're not expected to like everyone you work with, but you are expected to be professional in the workplace. If you feel your boss doesn't like you, try to engage in friendly conversation to learn more about their interests outside of work. If your boss is a big baseball fan, you could say, \"Hey, did you see the game tonight?\" You could also ask about how their weekend was, how their family is doing, or if they're watching any new shows they'd recommend. Keep it light and casual. In a work environment, it can feel like your boss forgets you’re a human being—not a machine. Engaging in friendly conversation will remind your boss that you have a life outside of work and may help your workplace relationship."

      "title": "Continue to deliver and celebrate your hard work.",
      "content": "Continue to deliver and celebrate your hard work. It can be disheartening to see other coworkers getting praise or compliments from a boss who only seems to provide negative feedback or criticism. If your boss plays favorites, try not to let that get to you. Do your best work and write down all the successful projects, goals, and achievements you made throughout the work year. Reflect on all the actions you took, the skills and abilities used, and the results you achieved in work-related situations. You can use this list and add it to your growing resume. [3] X Research source Your boss may not see all the hard work you put in at first, but by compiling all of your accomplishments and relaying them during your next performance review, you may see some improvements."

      "content": "Identify their motivations for making you feel incompetent. While whatever happens externally in your boss's life doesn't excuse their behavior, it helps put things in perspective. Try putting yourself in their shoes to understand what they may be experiencing. [4] X Research source Let's say there's a big deadline coming up. Your boss may be more on edge than normal. Try to picture their workload or consider all the moving parts they need to manage to ensure successful projects. By understanding where they're coming from, you can identify potential triggers that may set them off and learn how to avoid them. For instance, they may not have time for an in-person meeting if they're running around a lot. Try emailing any questions or concerns you may have so they can address them independently."

      "title": "Seek support from colleagues and friends.",
      "content": "Seek support from colleagues and friends. When dealing with a boss that makes you feel incompetent, turn to the people you trust for validation and advice. They can give you insights you weren't privy to and offer advice on approaching your boss and the situation best. It also helps to hear other people's experiences, which can help you feel less alone. If you're nervous about addressing an issue to your boss, Clinical Psychologist Julia Yacoob suggests, “If anything specific is bothering a person, I always encourage them to talk it out with a friend[,] spouse, or therapist in advance and roleplay how to communicate [with] the desired outcome [in mind.]”"

      "content": "Set a meeting with human resources. If your boss makes your workplace feel unsafe or unwelcome, schedule a meeting with your company’s HR office. “I would recommend preparing [a list],” Life and Career Coach Shannon O’Brien says, “[Include the] top five things you’re not happy with.” If possible, have an additional list of remedies and solutions to resolve the issue. If you feel comfortable having a one-on-one session with your boss, you can approach them with the same list to find solutions together. However, in the case of a hostile boss, stick with your HR department to handle the issue."

      "content": "Create an exit strategy if needed. If you're unable to resolve your relationship with your boss, it's time to look for new opportunities. Avoid jumping ship until another opportunity is on its way. Do your research into other companies.

Although external circumstances don't excuse their behavior, in many cases, bosses don't realize they're being ineffective or rude to their team members. They may be so overwhelmed by their own requirements that they can't support you in the way you expect a good manager to do. There's a hierarchy in the workplace, and often, these hierarchies within teams can significantly impact the performance, enjoyment, and time spent on specific projects. For instance, if your manager's boss is putting pressure on them, they do the same to you. [6] X Research source"

They might have difficulty delegating tasks to employees they feel they need to control more closely, which can come off as condescending or like they don’t trust you. When they give you a task, they might always ping you or pull you into the office for updates. [7] X Research source To build trust with your boss, give them regular updates about your work.

While this can be frustrating, the decision might just come down to an experience and qualifications mismatch; the other candidates may have the specific training or experience your company is looking for. This can be your sign to seek out opportunities to get more experience and develop your skills, like asking to work on certain projects, taking training courses, networking, and attending workshops."

This shows your boss that you care about your job and are taking the initiative to be the best worker you can be.

Identify tasks or triggers that make you feel stressed or overwhelmed and brainstorm solutions to help you feel less anxious at work. When your boss is on the same page as you, they can better help and support you. In this scenario, you could say, \"I have been carrying a hefty workload and working overtime for over 3 months.

In fact, this helps show your boss that you're driven to improve yourself and produce high-quality work. In a situation where you weren't able to do something effectively and your boss scolds you for it, instead of saying, \"You never trained me,\" try saying, \"I'm sorry that didn't meet your standards; this is something new for me, and I'd love to get your insight on how I can improve from my mistakes going forward.\""

If you’re more productive in the morning, save more intense tasks for then and leisurely tasks—like answering emails—for the later part of your day. Improve your arrangement skills by utilizing a calendar app to record tasks and appointments or to schedule what tasks you need to accomplish throughout the day and by when. Adaptation can be improved by working in short intervals to help avoid procrastination. For instance, use the Pomodoro method, which consists of working in 25-minute intervals with a 5-minute break between sessions to stay productive and motivated. [10] X Research source"
