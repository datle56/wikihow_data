      "content": "Tell your ex they're on your mind for a casual, low-pressure opener. Sometimes, you just want to see how your ex is doing—but beyond that, you might not be sure of what you're after. Write a short, straightforward, and honest message that explains to your ex that you've been thinking of them. Finish up with a question that can help keep the conversation rolling. “I’m planning a trip back to Poughkeepsie next summer—and of course that made me think of you. How have you been?” “I just watched Sing Street again. It's SO good. Made me think of you. How are things on your end?” “You popped into my head on my walk this morning. And I thought: I wonder how Elodie is doing. Then I realized I could just ask you, haha.”"

      "content": "Show an interest in your ex's life to start off on a positive note. Follow up on their house hunt, job search, or even pet adoption process. If you're on decent terms, then there's no reason that you can't simply reach out and check in. Write in a friendly tone to help show you how thoughtful you are while you kick off an open-ended conversation. “This is so out of the blue, but I was just thinking about your job hunt. Did you end up getting that teaching position you really wanted?” “Hey! I can't wait in suspense any longer. I have to know: did you get to adopt that kitten? She was ridiculously cute.” “You probably heard back about those scholarships, right? How’d that go? I’d love the chance to congratulate you :).”"

      "content": "Socials can give you plenty of fun material to talk about with your ex. If you want an excuse to check in that feels personal and can lead to an open-ended catch-up session, go through your ex's social media. Be on the lookout for new hairstyles, cool trips, and general life updates. Use a kind, upbeat tone to open up conversation without making your ex feel pressured. “Saw the new nose piercing—very chic. I remember you’d wanted to get one for a long time!” “Excuse me, did you seriously just get back from Cape Town!? That’s so dope. I’d love to hear more about it.” “Saw your post about moving out of your King Street apartment. It’s the end of an era! Are you staying in Newtown?”"

Whether they got a promotion, a scholarship, or an athletic title, send kudos that can open the floor to more conversation. This text doesn't pressure your ex or load on any expectations. You may even make their day! “Hello Kat! Or should I call you Ms. VP of Marketing now? What an insanely cool accomplishment. I’m so thrilled for you!” “Just saw the fellowship announcement…I couldn’t be more stoked for you. Huge, huge congratulations, Santiago. You deserve this!” “Wow, 1st place in the district!

Explain to your ex that you saw a mutual connection's doppelgänger (and between us, you can totally make this up!). Go for a casual, offhand tone to create the perfect low-pressure opener. Through the conversation that follows, you two can get a better sense of what you want from each other. “Your dog's long-lost twin is sitting across from me at Urth Cafe. It's making me miss her! Could you give her a little pat for me, please?\" “There’s a guy at my gym right now who looks exactly like Ray. I would send you a pic if that weren't a totally creepy thing to do. He’s not in Boston, is he?” “I swear I thought I saw your sister in Central Park today. It was such an uncanny similarity, seriously.\""

Seek out information that you know they have, like a forgotten password, a mutual connection's number, or a hiking spot. He may try to keep the conversation going himself, but if not, respond with a question about his wellbeing to keep the texts flowing. Write out a simple message in a friendly tone. [2] X Research source “This is so lame to ask, but I forgot my crypto login. You still have mine written down with yours, right? Could you send it?” “Sorry to bother you, but what was the name of that travel agent we both really loved? Lucy? Lindy?\" \"Do you still have the coordinates for that camping spot in Big Sur?

Look for new TV seasons, songs, books getting released. Use this to start up a conversation. If you're not sure of what you want from your ex beyond a simple check-in, this can open the door—and even better, it gives you lots to talk about. “Okay, we have to talk. Ozark season 4?! Thoughts? I feel like I have a million things to say.” “Did you see that John Green is writing again? It’s like he read our minds. Looks like the book comes out in April. What do you think it’ll be about?” “What do you think of Julia Jacklin’s new single? I know you must've listened to it at least one hundred times already.\""

Go for a flirty vibe, keep it subtle, or just outright ask them if they'd look to hook up. “I saw your IG post yesterday. Not gonna lie, you look amazing.” “I definitely still think about you…or think about us together...at night.” “I’m watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall rn (your favorite) and definitely would be up for a little Netflix and chill...\""

      "content": "In-person meetups can help you decide what you want from each other. Choose coffee, lunch, or brunch invitations over dinner-and-drinks hangouts—because meeting in the evening might give romantic vibes, which you may not be sure you want yet. Leave specifics out of your invitation. Instead, let your ex offer an ideal time and place. This way, the meetup is happening on both of your terms. “Hey, I’d love to get together sometime. Maybe we could do coffee at some point? Let me know what you think.” “No pressure whatsoever, but would you want to get breakfast sometime? I’d love to see you and talk.” “Is there any chance you'd maybe want to grab lunch? It can be whenever. Just let me know.”"

But I wanted to say sorry for what I said during our breakup.\" “Hey there. You don't have to say anything back if you don't want to. I just wanted to say I’m genuinely so sorry.”"
