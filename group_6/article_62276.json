      "content": "Taurus: It’s hard to go wrong with this romantic duo. Both Taurus and Pisces enjoy the finer things in life—more importantly, they love enjoying them together . Overall, Taurus is a very sensual, touchy-feely type of sign. This is perfect for the romantic Pisces, who according to astrologer Angel Idealism is \"a very compassionate and sensitive sign.\" Compatibility Tip: Steadfast Taurus isn’t quite as flexible as Pisces, which may lead to some miscommunication. Astrologer Angel Eyedealism cautions, \"if you're very rigid with a Pisces, they're going to want to escape.\" Chat about your long-term goals and priorities to make sure that both of you are on the same page."

      "content": "Cancer: Water signs tend to get along swimmingly, and this watery match-up is no exception.

      "title": "Scorpio:",
      "content": "Scorpio: Ah, yes—another aquatic match made in heaven. Scorpio and Pisces tend to feel their feelings a little more than the average zodiac sign, and appreciate the comfort, understanding, and support they can find in one another. The romantic Pisces and passionate Scorpio both crave intimacy, and they won’t have any trouble getting it with each other! Compatibility Tip: Take time to share and be open about your feelings rather than keeping them bottled up. Hiding emotions doesn’t work so well in a Scorpio-Pisces relationship. It’s especially important that Pisces demonstrate their trustworthiness and honesty in this relationship, since Scorpios are so slow to trust others and value the truth above all else. Reader Poll: We asked 640 wikiHow readers with the Scorpio zodiac sign, and 66% of them agreed that their biggest deal breaker is someone who lies . [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Capricorn:",
      "content": "Capricorn: The focused goat and the flexible fish make a pretty effective match. Both signs approach the relationship from a unique perspective—Capricorn seeks structure, while Pisces is happy to just go with the flow. They both play off each other well, which can lead to a successful, long-lasting relationship. Compatibility Tip: Meet in the middle when planning a date together. Create a timetable to satisfy the regimented Capricorn, and let the creative Pisces choose the venue."

      "title": "Virgo:",
      "content": "Virgo: Virgo and Pisces fall directly opposite of each other on the zodiac wheel, making them a pretty compatible match-up. As Astrologer Angel Eyedealism notes, \"Virgo is a very fluid sign. They can also be very micromanaging and controlling, but, for a Pisces, all the little bards and criticisms of Virgo just kind of roll off their back.\" Compatibility Tip: Make yourself as open and available as possible if you’re interested in a Virgo."

      "title": "Leo:",
      "content": "Leo: Self-assured Leo and passive Pisces can go well together; after all, Leo is happy to take charge, and Pisces is thrilled to be taken care of. Still, keep a close eye on this power dynamic—if it gets unbalanced, Pisces could feel insecure in the long run. Compatibility Tip: Give both signs plenty of opportunities to call the shots, even if Pisces doesn’t mind being led around."

      "content": "Pisces: Pisces see the world in the exact same way, which can be both good and bad for a long-term relationship. This dual-fish combo has the potential for lots of emotional support and empathy, but this watery duo might have trouble navigating conflict. Pisces are known for being non-confrontational and passive-aggressive, which isn’t a very productive conflict-resolution strategy. Compatibility Tip: Use I-statements to directly share what you’re feeling, rather than relying on passive-aggressive techniques. I-statements let you express yourself without shifting the blame to the other person. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Aquarius:",
      "content": "Aquarius: It’s not too hard to find a sense of balance between these neighboring signs. The intellectual Aquarius helps keep Pisces’s head above water when they’re too caught up in their feelings, while Pisces can add a splash of color to Aquarius’s black-and-white view of the world. The real key is striking a balance between transparency and mystery—if the relationship is too murky, Aquarius may not want to stick around. Compatibility Tip: Give Aquarius plenty of space and time to open up instead of expecting immediate intimacy. Aquarians warm up to people on their own time, and need plenty of space to do so."

      "title": "Aries:",
      "content": "Aries: Aries and Pisces can complement each other well in the right circumstances. Aries loves to get plenty of attention in a relationship. Pisces loves to give people attention. The main hiccup in this match-up is the wildly different communication styles of the ram and fish. Aries approaches conflict head-on, while Pisces isn’t quite so direct. Compatibility Tip: If you get in an argument, both partners need to sit down and clearly share their perspectives. This doesn’t leave as much room for miscommunication or hurt feelings."

      "title": "Sagittarius:",
      "content": "Sagittarius: Clear communication is essential for this water-fire duo. Pisces tends to be subtle, while Sagittarius isn’t afraid to say it like it is. There’s a lot of room for miscommunication—sensitive Pisces tends to approach conflict in a passive-aggressive way, which means nothing to the straightforward Sag. Still, this relationship can work out if both signs are willing to find some common ground. Compatibility Tip: Sagittarius can practice hedging their words so they don’t sound so argumentative. Meanwhile, Pisces can practice listening without internalizing statements as personal attacks."

      "title": "Libra:",
      "content": "Libra: A relationship with the Libra, the scale of the zodiac, can often end up unbalanced. On one hand, this air-water duo has no trouble getting lost in the clouds together. The imaginations of a Libra and a Pisces are definitely compatible—the main challenge is getting that compatibility to translate into the real world. It’s easy for both signs to get a bit off-kilter and take their very real struggles and stressors out on each other. Compatibility Tip: Find some extra balance in your lives by spending time with other friends and family members. Strong social roots and emotional support can go a long way in this relationship!"

      "title": "Gemini:",
      "content": "Gemini: Free-spirited Gemini and emotionally-rooted Pisces often have different expectations for a relationship. Geminis aren’t great with commitment, and change their minds super often. Meanwhile, Pisces gets really invested in their relationships, and desires more intimacy and closeness. Both signs really need to get on the same page for this type of partnership to work out. Compatibility Tip: Figure out where both signs stand from the very beginning. Are you looking for a casual relationship, or something more serious? Make sure you both want the same things before investing too much time into a relationship."

      "content": "Turn the romance up to 110%. Few signs appreciate romantic gestures more than Pisces, whether it’s a bouquet of flowers or a candlelit dinner.
