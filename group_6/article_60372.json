Also note whether after you have put a few drops of gas in the cylinder, and replaced the spark plug, it fires up for a little but does not run. If so, this could mean the carb is blocked, because gas is not getting from the carb to the cylinder, and the only thing that's making it run for a bit, is the little gas you put in the cylinder. If it does not run at all, it is usually because the spark plug is either spent or dirty."
