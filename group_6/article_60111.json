      "content": "Solve all of the terms in parentheses. In math, parentheses indicate that the terms inside should be calculated separately from the surrounding expression. Tackle the terms in parentheses before doing anything else. Note that the order of operations still applies inside of each pair of parentheses. For instance, within parentheses, you should multiply before you add, subtract, etc. [2] X Research source As an example, let's try to simplify the expression 2x + 4(5 + 2) + 3 2 - (3 + 4/2) . In this expression, we would solve the terms in parentheses, 5 + 2 and 3 + 4/2, first. 5 + 2 = 7 . 3 + 4/2 = 3 + 2 = 5 . The second parenthetical term simplifies to 5 because, owing to the order of operations, we divide 4/2 as our first act inside the parentheses. If we simply went from left to right, we might instead add 3 and 4 first, then divide by 2, giving the incorrect answer of 7/2. Note on multiple parentheses: if there are multiple parentheses inside one another, solve the innermost terms first, then the second-innermost, and so on."

Exponents are the little numbers located right next to the normal sized number (called base numbers). Find the answer to each exponent problem by multiplying, then substitute the answers back into your equation in place of the exponents themselves. [3] X Research source After dealing with the parentheses, our example expression is now 2x + 4(7) + 3 2 - 5 . The only exponent in our example is 3 2 , so we multiply 3 by itself (i.e. 3 x 3), which equals 9 . Add this back into the equation in the place of 3 2 to get 2x + 4(7) + 9 - 5 ."

A times symbol (×), a dot (⋅), or an asterisk (*) are all ways to show multiplication. A number hugging parentheses or a variable (like 4(x) ) also means you multiply. [4] X Research source There are two instances of multiplication in our problem: 2x (2x is 2 × x) and 4(7). We don't know the value of x, so we'll solve for 4(7) = 4 × 7 = 28 . We can rewrite our equation as 2x + 28 + 9 - 5 ."

The simple ÷ symbol is one, but also remember that slashes and bars in a fraction (like 3/4 , for instance) indicate you need to divide. [5] X Research source Because we already solved a division problem (4/2) when we tackled the terms in parentheses, our example no longer has any division in it, so we will skip this step. This brings up an important point—you don't have to perform every operation in the PEMDAS acronym when simplifying an expression. You only need to complete the steps that are present in your problem."

For instance, in the expression 49 + 29 + 51 +71, it's easier to add 49 + 51 = 100, 29 + 71 = 100, and 100 + 100 = 200, rather than 49 + 29 = 78, 78 + 51 = 129, and 129 + 71 = 200. [6] X Research source Our example expression has been partially simplified to \"2x + 28 + 9 - 5\". Now, we must add what we can, so let's look at each addition problem from left to right. We can't add 2x and 28 because we don't know the value of x, so we move on to 28 + 9 = 37 . Then, we can rewrite our expression as \"2x + 37 - 5\"."

However, if your expression contains one or more variables, the variable terms will remain largely untouched. Simplifying variable expressions requires you to find the values of your variables or to use specialized techniques to simplify the expression (see below). Our final answer is \"2x + 32\". We can't address this final addition problem until we know the value of x, but when we do, this expression will be much easier to solve than our initial lengthy expression. A note on combining terms: If you have an equation where there are like terms, now is when you combine them . Say we were left with \"2x + 32 + 4x + 12 = y\". We could combine 32 and 12 and 2x and 4x to get \"6x + 44 = y\" as our final simplified expression."

When dealing with variable expressions, it's important to remember that terms with the same variable and exponent (aka like terms ) can be added and subtracted like normal numbers. The terms must not only have the same variable, but also the same exponent. For example, 7x and 5x can be added to each other, but 7x and 5x 2 can not. [8] X Research source This rule also extends to terms with multiple variables. For instance, 2xy 2 can be added to -3xy 2 , but not -3x 2 y or -3y 2 . Let's look at the expression x 2 + 3x + 6 - 8x. In this expression, we can add the 3x and -8x terms because they are like terms. Simplified, our expression is x 2 - 5x + 6 ."

      "title": "Simplify numerical fractions",
      "content": "Simplify numerical fractions by dividing or \"canceling out\" factors . Fractions that have only numbers (and no variables) in both the numerator and denominator can be simplified in several ways. The easiest way to simplify here is to simply treat the fraction as a division problem and divide the numerator by the denominator. In addition, any multiplicative factors that appear both in the numerator and denominator can be \"canceled out\" because they divide to give the number 1. In other words, if both the numerator and denominator share a factor, this factor can be removed from the fraction , leaving a simplified answer. [9] X Research source For example, let's consider the fraction 36/60. If we have a calculator handy, we can divide to get an answer of .6 . If we don't, however, we can still simplify by removing common factors. Picture 36/60 as (6 × 6)/(6 × 10). This can be rewritten as 6/6 × 6/10. 6/6 = 1, so our expression is actually 1 × 6/10 = 6/10. However, we're not done yet—both 6 and 10 share the factor 2. Repeating the above procedure, we are left with 3/5 . You have to divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (which in the example above is 12: (12 × 3)/(12 × 5))."

      "title": "In variable fractions, cancel out any variable factors.",
      "content": "In variable fractions, cancel out any variable factors. Variable expressions in the form of fractions offer unique opportunities for simplification. Like normal fractions, variable fractions allow you to remove factors that are shared by both the numerator and denominator. However, in variable fractions, these factors can be both numbers and actual variable expressions. [10] X Research source Let's consider the expression (3x 2 + 3x)/(-3x 2 + 15x). This fraction can be rewritten as (x + 1)(3x)/(3x)(5 - x), because 3x appears both in the numerator and in the denominator. Removing these factors from the equation leaves (x + 1)/(5 - x) . Similarly, in the expression (2x 2 + 4x + 6)/2, every term is divisible by 2, so we can write the expression as (2(x 2 + 2x + 3))/2 and thus simplify to x 2 + 2x + 3 . Note that you can't cancel just any term—you can only cancel multiplicative factors that appear both in the numerator and denominator. For instance, in the expression (x(x + 2))/x, the \"x\" cancels from both the numerator and denominator, leaving (x + 2)/1 = (x + 2). However, (x + 2)/x does not cancel to 2/1 = 2."

      "title": "Multiply parenthetical terms by their constants.",
      "content": "Multiply parenthetical terms by their constants. When dealing with variable terms in parentheses with an adjacent constant, sometimes, multiplying each term in the parentheses by the constant can result in a simpler expression. This holds true for purely numeric constants and for constants that include variables. [11] X Research source For instance, the expression 3(x 2 + 8) can be simplified to 3x 2 + 24 , while 3x(x 2 + 8) can be simplified to 3x 3 + 24x . Note that, in some cases, such as in variable fractions, the constant adjacent to the parentheses gives an opportunity for cancellation and thus shouldn't be multiplied through the parentheses. In the fraction (3(x 2 + 8))/3x, the factor 3 appears both in the numerator and the denominator, so we can cancel it and simplify the expression to (x 2 + 8)/x. This is simpler and easier to work with than (3x 3 + 24x)/3x, which would be the answer we would get if we had multiplied through."

      "title": "Simplify by factoring.",
      "content": "Simplify by factoring . Factoring is a technique by which some variable expressions, including polynomials, can be simplified. Think of factoring as the opposite of the \"multiplying through parentheses\" step above—sometimes, an expression can be rendered more simply as two terms multiplied by each other, rather than as one unified expression. This is especially true if factoring an expression allows you to cancel part of it (as you would in a fraction). In special cases (often with quadratic equations), factoring even allows you to find answers to the equation. [12] X Research source Let's consider the expression x 2 - 5x + 6 once more. This expression can factor to (x - 3)(x - 2). So, if x 2 - 5x + 6 is the numerator of a certain expression with one of these factor terms in the denominator, like is the case with the expression (x 2 - 5x + 6)/(2(x - 2)), we may want to write it in factored form so that we can cancel it with the denominator. In other words, with (x - 3)(x - 2)/(2(x - 2)), the (x - 2) terms cancel, leaving us with (x - 3)/2 . Another reason you may want to factor your expression has to do with the fact that factoring can reveal answers to certain equations. Let's consider the equation x 2 - 5x + 6 = 0. Factoring gets us (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0. Since any number times zero equals zero, we know that if we can get either of the terms of parentheses to equal zero, the whole expression on the left side of the equals sign will equal zero as well. Thus, 3 and 2 are two answers to the equation."
