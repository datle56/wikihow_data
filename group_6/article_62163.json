      "title": "You’re classic, self-assured, and strong.",
      "content": "You’re classic, self-assured, and strong. A black iPhone suggests understated strength—you’re not trying to be noticed, but you’re a connoisseur of the finer things in life and enjoy a practical, functional phone. Black also suggests you're sophisticated and professional, and may not have a huge interest in expressing yourself through your phone color. [1] X Research source For a long time, black was one of the very few options for iPhones. Nowadays, a black phone might be seen as a choice to remain classic and simple. Different shades of black include the Space Black and Midnight colors. Graphite (a dark, matte gray that’s nearly black) projects similar qualities as black—it’s the original iPhone color and shows you’re practical, understated, and not dying to enter the limelight with your phone.

      "title": "You’re polished, extroverted, and like things pure and simple.",
      "content": "You’re polished, extroverted, and like things pure and simple. You may have to clean your iPhone now and then to keep it dazzling, but you’ve got no problem putting in some effort to keep your belongings in order. White symbolizes purity, so you may have high standards for yourself (and your accessories) and be a bit of a perfectionist. You prefer things on the sophisticated, simpler side without all the bells and whistles, but that doesn’t mean you’re not open to new possibilities. [3] X Research source White is a classic color that grabs more attention than black or gray, and it hints that you’re on the extroverted side. Starlight is a warmer, more pearl or cream-colored shade of white with a hint of gold in the edges."

      "title": "You’re successful, extroverted, and luxurious.",
      "content": "You’re successful, extroverted, and luxurious. A gold iPhone is a bold choice and signals that you enjoy wealth, status, and material opulence. You’re living your best life and you want people to know it! While gold might seem like a self-obsessed choice to others, it represents generosity, too. Gold iPhone owners love knowledge and enjoy offering advice and helping people when they can. Who says you can’t enjoy luxury and meaningful connections? [4] X Research source The shimmery quality of metallic gold makes your iPhone seem lighter and less utilitarian than more matte shades of gray or black."

      "title": "You’re classic, clean, and stylish.",
      "content": "You’re classic, clean, and stylish. A bright silver iPhone looks nearly white in some lighting and draws attention to your simple but refined taste. You also appreciate some practicality—it’s almost impossible to notice scratches on a silver phone since the metal underneath is nearly the exact same color. [5] X Research source You’re technology-minded and might even own other Apple products in silver to have a sleek, matching set. Like white, silver also needs some occasional cleaning to keep its sheen. It projects maturity and shows you’re willing to take care of your nicer belongings. Similarly, Space Gray (a darker, more subdued version of silver) says you’re professional and on top of the latest tech trends. Many tech and business employees choose Space Gray Macbooks and other Apple products for a neutral, reliable look. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "You’re confident, opinionated, and love getting attention.",
      "content": "You’re confident, opinionated, and love getting attention. A red iPhone is the boldest, loudest choice you can make—it shows you think and exist outside the box and know how to empower yourself . You’re playful, creative, adventurous, and tend to make decisions from your gut . People often perceive you as friendly and approachable, and why not? A bright red phone makes for a great conversation starter! [7] X Research source Apple’s PRODUCT(RED) iPhones and other devices are part of their collaboration with (RED) , an organization that partners with brands to raise money and awareness to fight global health crises like AIDS and other diseases. So far, Apple has raised about $270 million dollars as a (RED) partner. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "You’re optimistic, sunny, and uplifting.",
      "content": "You’re optimistic, sunny, and uplifting. A pop of bright yellow is sure to brighten up someone’s day, and you’re happy to be that person! A yellow iPhone is bold like red and reflects confidence and charm, but it has a warm, sunshine-y, happy-go-lucky quality to it that makes you seem bubbly and friendly. You’re playful, active, fun, and approachable—just like your phone! [9] X Research source The gold iPhone has a richer, deeper, more luxurious color to it than the yellow iPhone, which is more matte and vibrant."

      "title": "You’re dependable, quirky, and calm.",
      "content": "You’re dependable, quirky, and calm. There are several shades of blue iPhone, but they all convey a sense of clear thinking, creativity, serenity, and just a bit of reservation. Blue is rarer than white or black, so even this slightly subdued color says you’re unique and enjoy expressing yourself (especially if it’s a lighter shade that grabs more attention, like Sierra Blue ). You enjoy daydreaming , and your mind is open to exploring a whole host of new ideas. [10] X Research source Darker shades of blue indicate less of a desire to be noticed, but still shows you have some creative talents or tendencies."

      "title": "You’re intelligent, empathetic, and diplomatic.",
      "content": "You’re intelligent, empathetic, and diplomatic. There are a few different shades of green iPhone. The lighter, minty green shade of the iPhone 11 and 12 is an attention grabber that says “My Instagram aesthetic is flawless.” However, it’s soft and pastel enough to fly under the radar when you don’t want attention. [11] X Research source The darker, more forest-y Alpine Green of the iPhone 13 and 14 is bold and fun, but practical and a little understated (similar to Graphite or black). [12] X Research source Dark green looks less intense in person than the lighter, more pastel-looking shade. Since green isn’t a common choice, a clear iPhone case is a great way to show off your style while protecting your device."

      "title": "You’re delicate, sophisticated, and a little bit whimsical.",
      "content": "You’re delicate, sophisticated, and a little bit whimsical. Apple’s purple option is more of a pastel lavender. It’s cute, attention-grabbing, and bold without being quite as strident as the red or yellow iPhones. You appreciate life’s complexity and want to approach each day your own way, no matter who’s watching (although, you don’t mind a few eyes on you and your striking phone). [13] X Research source Like silver or white, the purple iPhone needs protection against dirt and scratches or else it may not look as whimsical as you like. The iPhone 14 Pro also comes in a Deep Purple shade. It’s a darker, almost Graphite-like shade of purple that exudes greatness and power. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "You’re friendly, outgoing, and affectionate.",
      "content": "You’re friendly, outgoing, and affectionate. You get energy and positivity from bright colors and probably have artistic or creative skills. Pink is a rare choice, so your desire to express yourself is strong. You’re likely intuitive, idealistic, and caring, but may not always be the most practical person at the party (pink scuffs easily, unfortunately). [15] X Research source Currently, pink is only available for the iPhone 13, making this color option even rarer."
