Lift your right leg to you, supporting the back of it with your hands. As you reach a 90-degree angle, stop. Make sure your knee is straight, as that is what will stretch your hamstring. [5] X Research source Another option is to use a towel. Perform the stretch with your leg straight, but as you bring your leg up, loop a towel over the bottom of your foot. Keep your leg at a 90-degree angle to your body. Pull lightly on the towel to bend your foot slightly towards you, stretching your hamstring. Hold for 30 seconds.
