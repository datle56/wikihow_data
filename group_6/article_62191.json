      "title": "The 🔌 often refers to all things electrical.",
      "content": "The 🔌 often refers to all things electrical. The 🔌 depicts the end of an electrical cord with a two-pronged plug. You can use it to discuss anything pertaining to electricity, electronics, outlets, or voltage. [1] X Research source For example: “Is the 🔌 at our new place all hooked up?” “Did you move the electrical bill over to my name? I don’t want you to keep covering my 🔌.” “Do we have a power strip in the basement? I need a few more outlets 🔌.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "The 🔌 can also mean “connected” or “plugged in.”",
      "content": "The 🔌 can also mean “connected” or “plugged in.” You use cords to connect things to a power source, which can provide an elegant metaphor when it comes to demonstrating that you’re on the same page as someone. You might see this emoji used like: “We’re on the same page 🔌🔗 ❤️.” “Jim and I are tight. I’ll connect all of us so we can talk about it further 🔌.” “I’m 🔌 into this news story. I can’t stop checking for updates. It’s wild, isn’t it?”"

      "title": "A 🔌 emoji often refers to a “plug,” which is slang for “drug dealer.”",
      "content": "A 🔌 emoji often refers to a “plug,” which is slang for “drug dealer.” On social media platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, the 🔌 emoji usually refers to “the plug”—a slang term for a drug dealer. The logic here is that a drug dealer connects you to a source of drugs, so a 🔌 typically stands in for “drug dealer.” [2] X Research source Someone might say: “Do you have a 🔌?” “I know a 🔌 who can get you that.” “I’m new to the area. Anyone have a 🔌 for 🌿?”"

      "title": "The 🔌 can also generally refer to anyone with hard-to-find goods.",
      "content": "The 🔌 can also generally refer to anyone with hard-to-find goods. While “the plug” is usually a drug dealer, the term can also be used more loosely to refer to anyone with a hookup for something people want. Whether it’s expensive sneakers or delicious gluten-free cookies, anyone who knows how to get things people want can be a “plug.” For example: “Do you still know someone who works at a computer store? Lemme get that 🔌.” “Hey! I’ve got a 🔌 who can get us into that club for free tomorrow.” “I need a 🔌 to sell my old vinyl records. You know anyone who really knows how to appraise vinyl?”"

      "title": "Throw a 🔌 in your text to make it clear you’re referring to electricity.",
      "content": "Throw a 🔌 in your text to make it clear you’re referring to electricity. The 🔌 emoji is helpful if you want to avoid confusion about anything electrical, or to dress up an otherwise-uninteresting text message about power. For example, you might say: “We go to Europe next week, don’t forget to bring the 🔌 converter.” “We got the 🔌⚡ for tomorrow! Bring that extra amp to the sound check.” “You got money for the 🔌 bill? It’s due tomorrow.”"

      "content": "Use a 🔌 to tell someone you’re on the same page, or aware. If you want to emphasize that you’re in agreement or connected to someone, you could throw in a 🔌 emoji. Alternatively, you might use the 🔌 to imply that you’re “plugged in” to a conversation. You could say: “Don’t worry. I’m 🔌 in! I’ll give you a heads up if I hear anything.” “It’s no big deal. We’re solid 🔌✊. I got you covered.” “You always know what to say. We’re so tuned in together 🔌❤️.”"

      "content": "Include a 🔌 if you want to slyly reference a connection you have. Want to mention you might know someone who can import Cuban cigars? Do you “know a guy” who might be able to get your friend paid before rent is due? Throw a 🔌 in your message to play it close to the vest. You could say: “You were trying to get your hands on a new PS5, right? I got a 🔌.” “I might have a 🔌 if you’re still looking for a job.” “Looking for exotic 🍺? I got the 🔌.”"

      "content": "Drop a 🔌 to express the desire for a hard-to-find item. If you’re seeking a unique or especially rare item, you might use a 🔌 to ask around without being too explicit or forward. The emoji just makes the inquiry a little more fun. For example, you might say: “Hey, do you happen to have a 🔌? I’m looking for some fancy 🍾.” “You’re a GPU 🔌, right? I’m trying to build a new computer, but GPUs are so expensive.” “I need a 🔌. You know anyone who can get me the new Jordans for cheap?”"

      "content": "No, so long as there no other signs of drug abuse . Kids use the 🔌 emoji to seek out all kinds of rare items—Fortnite skins, rare sneakers, cheat sheets for tests, etc.—so it’s not automatic that your child is looking for drugs if they’ve used the 🔌 emoji. If their messages seem like they could be referencing regular goods, don’t assume they’re in danger. Behavioral signs of drug/alcohol abuse include: excessive risk taking, neglecting responsibilities, drop in academic performance, and secretive behavior. [3] X Research source Physical signs of drug/alcohol abuse include: bloodshot eyes, poor appetite, sleep issues, unusual smells on one’s breath or clothing, and sudden weight change. [4] X Research source The “plug” is also a popular trope in hip hop music. If it looks like they’re quoting something, they’re probably just expressing their love for a song. You can always talk to your child about it. Ask them what their 🔌 message meant. There’s likely a perfectly reasonable explanation."

      "content": "You may want to address the issue if they’re actively seeking out drugs. If you’re checking your child’s messages or looking at their social media and you’re reasonably suspicious that they are actively seeking drugs or alcohol, talk to them. Ask them for honesty, take them to a professional, and do your best to help guide them without judgement. [5] X Research source Pay attention to the other emojis your child uses. There are marijuana emojis (🌿, 🌳, 🍁), cocaine emojis (❄️, ⛄, 🏔️, and 🎱), and other drug emojis (🍄, 💊, 🍬). [6] X Research source"
