      "content": "Social awkwardness It’s a broad umbrella, but it’s the most common culprit of what qualifies as “weird.” Introversion, shyness, fumbling conversations—it can all have the undesired effect of throwing other people off their own grooves and pushing them away. [1] X Research source The good news is, these are all things you can work on and improve—if you want to, that is. This is one cause of “weirdness” that we’ll tell you right now not to worry too much about. Everyone clicks with different people, and social awkwardness is often just a matter of personal taste. That said, if you want to “improve” your social skills, focus on more individual entries in this list. Social awkwardness isn’t always something to “cure,” but tweaking certain behaviors can help make you more approachable."

      "content": "Awkward body language Examples of “weird” body language include shifting eyes or lack of eye contact, hunching, crossed arms, restless legs, or letting your face reveal emotions you meant to hide. These are sometimes signs that other people read as distress or discomfort, even if you only do them out of habit, or because they feel natural. [2] X Research source Try maintaining eye contact , using your hands to gesture, standing with your shoulders facing the person you’re talking to, and breathing deep, steady breaths to keep your body language open and friendly. If it helps, practice doing just one of these at a time, and add the others individually as you get the hang of them."

      "content": "Having an unconventional appearance It’s not always pretty, but humans are aesthetic creatures. We value looks and appearances, often to our detriment. If you have an unconventional appearance—wacky hair, uncommon facial features, peculiar taste in fashion—the hard truth is that some people will write you off as “weird until proven normal.” While you ought to take care of your hygiene and respect those around you, your natural features or fashion choices are part of what make you, you, and you should never feel ashamed for them."

[3] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source But if you have an alternative sense of humor—whether it’s overly dark, dry, deadpan, or anything else—others may have trouble connecting with you, and put their guards up instead. Ask yourself or a friend if your humor is insulting or puts others on edge in any way. Do you often reference taboo topics that others might not be comfortable with? If your humor is offensive, it might be best to hedge it in; you won’t win any comedy contests with people who feel hurt by your jokes. Otherwise, it’s a matter of finding your audience. You might save your humor for people who “get it,” and fall back on things like questions or active listening in conversation with those who don’t."

      "title": "Believing in unconventional things",
      "content": "Believing in unconventional things Sometimes a person’s philosophies, religion, or even their perspective brands them as “weird” in other people’s eyes. Maybe you practice a niche spirituality other people find alarming, or believe certain things about how the world works that make you a “downer.” Whatever the case, our personal beliefs are too often walls, not bridges. While you should never hide who you are, it can help to wait for these beliefs to come out naturally in conversation. Once a person knows you better, they may be more receptive to learning how you see the world. For example, you probably shouldn’t try to convert someone to your spirituality on your first, second, or even third meeting. But once you’ve known them a while, you might have an open conversation about both your beliefs."

      "content": "Having trouble expressing yourself verbally Often, “weirdness” is just a matter of failure to communicate effectively .

People have been struggling to express themselves since before language was invented—and you can imagine how hard it was then. Practice finding your words by writing in a journal each day.

While your lesser-known interests are what adds color to your personal tapestry, close-minded people may find them distasteful. But if we’re being honest, so long as you’re not hurting anyone, that’s their problem. That said, it’s important to connect with people on common ground. If you’re always talking about plate tectonics, for example, people may have trouble finding other ways to connect with you. Foster a healthy curiosity in more common interests—popular music, movies, games, even politics—to help understand others, and find accessible things to talk about."

      "content": "Overlooking other people’s boundaries Some of us are bad at reading body language and respecting things like personal space or emotional boundaries. Everyone has different off-limits behaviors and topics, and sometimes respecting all of them is a job in and of itself, but it’s important to keep trying.

Go to source When in doubt, ask someone what sort of touching or what conversation topics they might not be comfortable with, so you know to steer clear of them. In most cases, a simple apology is enough to brush it off and continue with your interaction. Say something like, “Oh, sorry, I won’t do that again,” then turn the conversation to safer territory."

[6] X Research source Forgetting to shower one morning is no biggie, but neglecting to shower for a week straight (outside of things like camping) could be a sign to pay closer attention to your body. Practice better hygiene by aiming to shower or bathe with soap and warm water at least once every couple of days. Also, brush your teeth twice a day, and wear deodorant or antiperspirant if you’re concerned with personal body odor. [7] X Research source That said, the presence of body hair, crooked or yellow teeth, acne, or other “imperfections” are actually totally natural.

Like many things on this list, these aren’t anything to be ashamed of, and if someone finds them “weird,” that’s a personal matter that they need to work through on their own time."

One person’s ick is another person’s treasure, but it can be hard to see that when you’re worried you’re the ick. Get some third-party advice by asking a close, trusted friend or family member if there’s something about you they think might hold you back from forming personal connections. Be prepared for their honest answer, since you’re asking an honest question. Growth isn’t always comfortable, but it’s often necessary."

Ask yourself: Does my behavior cause physical harm to the people around me? Does it cause emotional hurt to the people around me?
