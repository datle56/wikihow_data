      "content": "Recognize the difference between a guard dog and an attack dog. A guard dog is trained to alert its owner of the presence of a stranger or intruder through barking or growling. Guard dogs are not typically trained to attack on command or to act overly aggressive towards a stranger. Therefore, guard dogs generally do not make very good attack dogs. Attack dogs are often used by police and law enforcement. They are trained to attack on command and respond aggressively to potential threats or intruders. Most attack dogs are well trained and will not act in an aggressive way unless they are commanded to by their owner. Attack dogs that are not well trained, however, can attack without warning and pose a serious danger to humans and other animals. The average owner is unlikely to need an attack dog."

      "content": "Determine if your dog’s breed is a typical guard dog breed. Though most dogs can be trained to be guard dogs, certain dog breeds are known to make good guard dogs. For example, smaller breeds such as Chow Chows, pugs, and Shar Pei’s have been known to be good guard dogs. Larger breeds, such as Doberman Pinschers, German Shepherd, and Akita also make excellent guard dogs. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Certain breeds, such as German Shepherds and Doberman Pinschers, can be trained to be guard dogs as well as attack dogs. If you have a pure-bred dog that is not a typical guard dog breed, or if you have a mutt, it is still possible for you to train him to be an excellent guard dog. If he has the behavioral characteristics of a guard dog and is properly trained and socialized, then you could train him to guard and protect you."

      "content": "Learn about the personality traits of an ideal guard dog. Contrary to popular belief, a good guard dog should not react out of fear or pure aggression. Generally, a good guard dog should be territorial and protective of his owner and his owner’s property, yet remain obedient to his owner’s commands. A good guard dog must be confident in himself and his surroundings. A confident dog is curious about a new person or a new area, and is not shy or timid around new people. [2] X Research source Your dog may already have this trait inherently, but proper socialization can also instill confidence in a dog. A good guard dog is also assertive. This does not necessarily mean that he is overly aggressive or pushy. Rather, it means that he is comfortable with putting himself in a position that will allow him to get what he wants. It also means that he will be confident in approaching a new situation or person, rather than backing away. [3] X Research source Sociability is another important characteristic of a good guard dog. A well-socialized guard dog will be able to recognize and be wary of a stranger in his owner’s presence, but will not attack or become overly aggressive towards that stranger. [4] X Research source Good guard dogs must also be easily trainable. Chow chows can make good guard dogs because they are naturally suspicious of strangers, but tend to be very independent and not easy to train. [5] X Research source Loyal dogs make great guard dogs. The more loyal your dog is to you, the more likely he will want to defend and protect you. German shepherds are known to be a very loyal breed. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Socialize your dog as a puppy. Proper socialization is essential to training your dog to be a good guard dog. When your dog is well socialized, he will be comfortable in his normal environment. He will also be less fearful and more relaxed—important characteristics of a good guard dog—but will still retain a healthy dose of suspicion of unfamiliar and potentially dangerous situations. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source The best time to socialize a puppy is when he is between three and twelve weeks of age. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Beyond twelve weeks of age, puppies become increasingly more cautious of new situations and therefore become much more difficult to socialize. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source During the socialization period, you should get your puppy comfortable with meeting new people and interacting in new environments. It can be a huge task to socialize your puppy, so it may be easier to break socialization into small parts and expose him to situations over time at his comfort level. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Reward your puppy with plenty of positive reinforcement (e.g., petting, treats, extra play time) each time that he has a good socialization experience. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Puppy classes are an excellent way to socialize your puppy. Keep in mind that your puppy should be up-to-date on his vaccinations and deworming treatment to keep him healthy and free of disease during the entirety of the training program.

      "content": "Ensure your dog can follow basic obedience commands. Before you begin guard dog training, your dog should already be able to obey basic commands like “stay,” “sit” and “down.” Having these basic obedience skills will ensure your dog can build up to learning defensive techniques like alert barking and standing guard. You can teach these commands to your dog on your own. Alternatively, you can sign your dog up for an obedience training class."

      "title": "Choose a trigger word.",
      "content": "Choose a trigger word. To train your dog to alert you when a stranger is at the door or on your property, you first need to establish a trigger word to act as a command. You can use “bark” as a command. Some owners prefer using a word other than “bark” (e.g., “speak”) so that the command is not so obvious to others around you. [13] X Research source Once you choose your “bark” trigger word, say it with the same level of enthusiasm each time you give your dog this command. Use the same trigger word every time you command your dog to bark."

      "title": "Practice the command.",
      "content": "Practice the command. Most dogs are natural barkers and do not need a command to bark at the sound of someone approaching or a sudden noise. The key here is to get your dog to bark on command. To begin, tie your dog up on his leash to a kitchen table leg or on a spot on your fence in your backyard. Hold a treat out to your dog as you back away from him, and then move out of his field of vision. [14] X Research source As soon as your dog makes a sound, like a whine or a bark, run back to him and praise him with “good bark” or “good [trigger word].” Give him his treat immediately. After repeating this several times, your dog should start to connect your praise of his bark with a reward. Once your dog gets comfortable with the bark command while in the same area or spot, move him to different areas in your yard and in your house. You should also test his response to the command when you are walking him or playing together in a public place."

      "content": "Be firm and clear with the command. Consistency and practice are key to getting this command to stick. If you want to test his response during a walk, stop walking him and look him directly in the eye. Then, say an enthusiastic “bark” command. If he looks confused or hesitates at your command, hold out the treat and repeat the command. [15] X Research source Ideally, your dog should bark only once when you give him the command. [16] X Research source However, your dog may want to continue to barking once you’ve gotten him started. Do not reward him if he barks continuously. Wait for him to quiet down before giving him the command again."

      "content": "Create a mock scenario. To challenge your dog’s understanding of the “bark” command, keep your dog inside your home and step outside your front door. Once you are outside, ring the doorbell and give your dog the “bark” command. Reward him with a treat when he barks once at your command. Next, knock on the front door and give the “bark” command. Reward him with a treat if he responds correctly to your command. [17] X Research source If possible, run through this scenario in the evening when it is dark outside. You will likely want your dog to warn you of someone at the door at night, so it will be important for him to understand that he should respond to the “bark” command during day as well as at night. [18] X Research source Practice the “bark” command in short intervals. After three to four repetitions, give your dog a break and let him do something else for about 45 minutes. After this break, practice the “bark” command several more times. The goal is to avoid overtraining so that your dog does not become bored or frustrated during his training sessions.

Have a family member step outside and knock or ring the bell. Stay inside and give your dog the bark command. Reward each bark with a treat. [20] X Research source This will reinforce his protective instinct to bark at someone (or something) unfamiliar. Continue to practice the “bark” command with a family member, rewarding your dog each time he barks at the sound of the bell or a knock at the door. He should eventually start to associate the doorbell or a knock with a bark and bark once at the sound. Over time, you want to try to train your dog to bark at the sound of the doorbell or a knock at the door, rather than at your command."

As soon as your dog stops barking to sniff the treat, say “thank you” or “hush.” Immediately follow your verbal command with a treat. [22] X Research source Do not yell or use a loud voice when you give your verbal command. Your loud voice may add to your dog feeling alarmed and may encourage him to bark even more. [23] X Research source Do not use “shut up” or “no” as verbal commands to get your dog to be quiet, since they can have a negative connotation."

Your dog will probably see this as a game, which could make the training session much more enjoyable for the both of you."
