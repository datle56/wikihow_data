Stand around in a big circle and keep a couple of beers (or drinks of your choice) close by. Since you’ll be chugging, choose beer, seltzers, or any other beverages with low alcohol content makes the game a bit easier and safer. If you don’t want to have alcohol, crack open some soda, sparkling water, or any other drink you want to enjoy."

The first time the word “thunder” is said during the song, the player starts chugging their drink and doesn’t stop.

      "content": "The next person in the circle drinks every time they hear “thunder.” Whenever the word “thunder” or “thunderstruck” is sung during the song, the current player stops drinking and the next person in the circle starts. The length of time between the words varies throughout the song, so some people may have longer turns than others. If someone feels like they’ve had enough to drink and wants to stop, the next player can start drinking right away or wait until they hear “thunder” again."

      "title": "Keep playing until the end of the song.",
      "content": "Keep playing until the end of the song. “Thunderstruck” is about 5 minutes long, so it’s the perfect drinking game if you don’t have a lot of time to pre-game. Once the song is over, everyone will have had at least a drink or two."

      "content": "You’ll hear the word “thunder” 34 times during the song. AC/DC says the word “thunder” 15 times and “thunderstruck” 19 times. The words are said the most in the song’s intro and chorus. The verses and guitar solo have the longest breaks between the words, so it can be a little challenging to be the person drinking at that part of the song. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose which player has to drink after each “thunder.” Instead of going around in a circle, pause the song after hearing the word “thunder.” Whoever was just drinking gets to pick whoever they want to drink when the song starts again. Try playing the game as an endurance challenge. Put the song on repeat, and keep going until players decide they’ve had enough to drink. The last person standing is the winner!"
