If you find yourself working with VTT files often, investing in a specialized VTT program may be more efficient than using a basic text editor. We've listed a few captioning program options below: Ooona Create+Translate : Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux (web-based). Access to the program is subscription-based. A 1-month subscription to the Standard version is $30, and a 1-month subscription to the Pro version is $60. Annotation Edit : Available for Mac. A license costs around $300, but a free demo with limited features is available for download. VEED : Web-based app. It offers a free plan and paid plans that range from $25/month to $70/month (monthly). VTT Creator : Web-based app. It is free to use and doesn't require you to create an account to get started."

      "content": "SRT and VTT are similar file formats with a few key differences. SRT (which stands for SubRip Subtitle) was created before VTT and is another file format for storing video subtitles. The big difference between the two is how much information each format can hold. As you learned above, VTT files can include information on how to adjust the font, color, and position of your subtitles or captions. VTT files can also include metadata, and they're supported by YouTube and Vimeo. VTT files work best when you want a lot of control over the style of your subtitles, or if you need to include metadata. SRT files, on the other hand, cannot include metadata and only allow for basic subtitle/caption formatting. However, SRT files are supported by YouTube and Vimeo. SRT files are good for high-volume projects. They are also simpler than VTT files, making them a little more user-friendly."
