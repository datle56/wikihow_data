      "content": "Protection braids are a simple protection spell that you can wear with you. Since your hair is on your head, it holds a lot of your mental and spiritual energy. Creating a small braid that’s been influenced by your own positive vibes protects this sacred energy. The protection braid is a symbol of positivity that guards you from negative frequencies. [1] X Research source You can also use the good energy your hair holds to manifest other positive intentions like love, money, or wisdom as you braid your hair. Did you know? Your hair is an extension of your nervous system and has tiny antennas that collect and channel larger quantities of universal \"source\" energy. This creates an equilibrium of your body's electromagnetic field. The antennas also absorb the sun's energy in the daytime and the moon's energy at night."

      "content": "Set your intentions. Before you begin braiding, decide what you want to manifest with your protection spell. Set aside a few minutes in a clean, quiet space to clear your thoughts and choose what you’d like to achieve with this particular braid. Use action verbs and the present tense when setting your intention. Instead of “I will attract joy today,” say “I attract joy.” Instead of “I want to be more positive,” try “I reflect positive energy and kindness onto those around me.\" [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Put some enchanting oil in your braiding hand. Decide which hand you’ll be braiding with and cover it in a few drops of an essential oil that matches your intention. For extra energy, draw the oil onto your hand in the shape of a spiritual symbol like a rune (if you’re seeking solace) or an evil eye (if you wish to protect yourself from judgment). [3] X Research source Different oils have different spiritual meanings. Cedarwood and juniper purify. Lavender and clary sage calm while cypress and peppermint uplift. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Braid a small section of hair near the nape of your neck. Once you’ve set your intention, begin your spell by braiding your hair . To braid, divide your hair into 3 sections. Cross the right section over the middle section. Then, cross the left section over the middle section. Continue the process until you have one small braid of hair near the nape of your neck, with the rest of your hair loose. [5] X Research source You can make your braid as long as you want (or even create multiple braids), but a tiny braid close to your face is enough for a successful protection spell. If you want to attract productivity and motivation, grab a larger section of your hair and create a tight French braid or box braid . If you want to achieve prosperity and tranquility, opt for a looser Dutch braid ."

      "title": "State your intention into your hair as you braid.",
      "content": "State your intention into your hair as you braid. Each time you cross the 3 sections of your hair, vocalize your intention into the part you’re braiding. If your hair is too short to speak into, just say your intention in your head. [6] X Research source Eliminate distractions as you voice your intention. While a good set of tunes can bring positive vibes, too much background noise can cloud your judgment as you braid."

      "content": "Seal the spell by tying your braid. Protection spells are sealed with a knot to symbolize purpose and completion. So to properly finish off your protection braid, tie your hair with a hair tie and state your intention as forcefully as you can one last time. [7] X Research source Every color has its own spiritual meaning, so choose a hair tie color that compliments your intention. Red shows courage. White embraces the unknown, while orange boosts wisdom. When in doubt, choose a clear hair tie that you can mark with your own energy. [8] X Research source"

Cleanse your crystal beforehand by rinsing it with water and leaving it in a bright, clean space so it can attract good frequencies. Then, grip it as you braid, rubbing it slightly each time you voice your intention. [9] X Research source Each crystal holds a different energy. Citrine stands for abundance. Smoky quartz is good for getting stuff done, while amethyst clears the head. [10] X Research source"

Take some deep breaths as you brush, visualizing the stresses you’ve absorbed throughout the day falling off your head. Some people recommend using a wood brush or comb to help prevent static electricity and keep your hair from absorbing new frequencies. [11] X Research source"

Look for sulfate-free and paraben-free shampoos and conditioners and use gels without petroleum jelly or sodium hydroxide.
