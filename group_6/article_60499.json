      "content": "Scoop the litter box daily and change it once a week. Some cats are very picky about the state of their litter. To keep the litter box as appealing as possible, scoop it every day. Empty all the litter and clean out the box thoroughly at least once a week, or every few days if you have multiple cats. [1] X Research source When deep cleaning a litter box , animal behavior expert Carrie Seay recommends avoiding harsh or strong-smelling chemicals, since the fragrance might bother your cat. She says, “Scrape out all the litter that might be left in there, then wash it with a little bit of dish soap and warm water and scrub it out. Let it air dry before refilling it with litter.” If your litter box has picked up a lot of set-in, lingering odors that don’t come out easily when you clean it, it might be time to replace it. Cats prefer to go in shallow litter. To make sure your cat feels as comfortable as possible, pour about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of litter into the box. If it’s any deeper, your cat might be tempted to skip the litter box and go elsewhere.

      "content": "Try moving the litter box to a new location. Pick a spot that’s quiet and private. Just like humans, cats like peace and quiet when they do their business. Put the litter box in a location that doesn’t get a lot of noise and foot traffic, away from your cat’s food and water dishes. [3] X Research source Wherever you put the litter box, make sure your cat is always able to access it. If your cat can’t get to its bathroom, it’s more likely to go where it isn’t supposed to. Choose a spot that feels quiet and safe, but not too restrictive or closed in. Your cat shouldn’t feel cornered or claustrophobic while going to the bathroom.

      "content": "Set up at least one extra litter box. This is especially important if you have multiple cats. Your cat may be more likely to use the litter box if it has more than one box to choose from. Aim to have at least one litter box per cat, plus one extra. If you have several cats, try to keep the litter boxes in separate areas of your home, especially if your cats are territorial or don’t get along well. [5] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source This will help take some of the pressure off if your cat is territorial and doesn’t like to share a bathroom area with other cats."

      "content": "Clean up any soiled spots with an enzymatic cleaner. If there’s a lingering smell, your cat may be tempted to go there again. Dispose of the poop as soon as you notice it, then use an odor-eliminating cleanser to thoroughly wash the area. Try an enzyme-based cleaner designed to break down pet odors. [6] X Research source Don’t use strong-smelling chemicals like ammonia. Not only could they irritate your cat’s airways and skin, but the strong odors might encourage your cat to keep using the area as a toilet. Follow the directions on the cleanser to make sure you’re using it correctly. For instance, you may need to let it sit on the stain for several minutes before wiping or rinsing it away."

      "title": "Experiment with different kinds of litter boxes.",
      "content": "Experiment with different kinds of litter boxes. Look for a box that your cat can use comfortably. For instance, your cat might prefer a box without a lid, or a larger box rather than a more compact one. Try setting up several different types of boxes, then observe your cat’s bathroom habits to figure out which kind it likes best. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Some cats like having lots of space to do their business. Try using a large, shallow plastic storage bin instead of a regular litter box if your pet needs extra room. If you have an older cat or a cat with mobility issues, go for a litter box with low sides so it’s easier for your kitty to climb in and out. You can also get a litter box ramp or steps for easier accessibility. Seay says to make sure your litter box is big enough. “Pet stores sell these really, really tiny litter boxes, which don’t give our cats a lot of space to be able to turn around. They need to find that perfect spot, go to the bathroom, and then have enough space to not step in it when they are getting out.”"

      "content": "Switch to a new type of kitty litter. Your cat may be sensitive to certain smells and textures. Experiment with different types of litter until you find one that your cat seems to prefer. Most cats like unscented, clumping litters best. They may be irritated by litters with strong odors or a coarse texture. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source One easy way to tell what kind of litter your cat likes best is to set up 2 or more litter boxes side by side. Put different types of litter in each box, then pay attention to which box your cat prefers to use."

Mix equal amounts of vinegar and water in a spray bottle, and spray the area where your cat has been pooping. Cats also dislike citrus, cayenne pepper, lavender, and peppermint. [9] X Research source Or, put down aluminum foil, double-sided tape, or sandpaper to keep your cat from pooping on the floor. Most cats dislike these textures and will avoid the area."

      "content": "Restrict your cat’s access to areas where it likes to poop. If nothing else is working, try closing off the area where your cat likes to poop. You may also need to restrict your cat to a smaller space for a while, such as a single room where it has never pooped in any inappropriate areas before. Make sure your cat has access to everything it needs, such as food, water, toys, and a comfortable place to sleep. [10] X Research source In rare cases, you might need to confine your cat to a really small space for 1-4 weeks, such as a large cat or dog cage with a litter pan and a sleeping ledge. Your cat likely won’t need to be totally confined for the entire time. Let your cat out as long as you’re around to supervise it, then put it back in the enclosed area when you’re not there (for example, at night or when you have to go to work)."

      "content": "Reward your cat for using the litter box. Offer them a treat right after they use the box. This might encourage your cat to keep using the litter instead of going on the floor. Be consistent with the reward and offer it as soon as you see your cat come out of the litter box. This way, it will be more likely to associate the reward with good behavior. [11] X Research source Most cats respond best to food rewards. Offer a favorite treat or a little bit of wet food. Try speaking to your cat in a quiet, encouraging voice whenever you see it go where it’s supposed to. On the other hand, if you catch your cat in the act of soiling the floor, squirt it with a water gun or rattle a jar of coins. This will startle the cat and interrupt it from doing its business, but it shouldn’t scare or stress it too much. Try to do this as soon as you notice your cat getting ready to go (e.g., if you see it scratching or squatting) rather than after it’s already started or finished. [12] X Research source"

Some common health problems that could cause your cat to go outside the litter box include constipation, colitis, or a problem with the anal glands. Set up an appointment with your vet. With the right medical treatment, the problem behavior may go away.

      "content": "Stress Cats sometimes go outside the box when they’re anxious. Think about anything that might have happened recently to trigger the new behavior. For example, have you brought a new cat into the home , or has there been a change in your daily routine? Did you switch to a new brand of cat food or litter? If you notice that anything in particular seems to be bothering your feline friend, look for ways to minimize the source of stress as much as possible. [14] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source For instance, if your cat has been getting into fights with another pet, try to keep them separate when you’re not around to supervise their interactions. Keep your cat’s routine as consistent as possible. For instance, try to feed and groom it at the same times and in the same locations each day. If you can’t eliminate causes of stress, try a calming aid such as a pheromone diffuser , spray , or collar . Get these products at most pet supply stores or vets’ offices. If other approaches aren’t working, your vet might be able to prescribe calming medications. They’ll probably recommend using medications in combination with other methods, like adjusting your litter cleaning routine or providing more litter boxes. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Smelly litter box If the litter box isn’t up to their standards, even cats who have been litter-trained for years may reject the box. In these cases, the cat will then go to the bathroom in an area that is likely to get your attention. This is why it’s important to clean the litter box regularly and ensure your cat likes the type of litter you use. [16] X Research source Consider adding an herbal cat attractant to the litter box. These are typically made with a blend of herbs that smell pleasant to the cat, like lavender, sage, and spearmint. Find them at your local pet supply store and mix them into the litter according to the package’s directions. Seay recommends thinking of the litter box like a toilet: “We don't want to use a dirty toilet; if we see a dirty toilet, we're going to flush it before we use it. Keeping the litter box clean for our cats and kittens will help them to want to use it more because they won't have to go in that dirty litter box and avoid stepping on clumps of pee or poop.”"

      "title": "Wrong litter box location",
      "content": "Wrong litter box location If you moved your litter box before the cat’s bad behavior started, it may not like the new area. Cats want privacy when they use the bathroom, and if the litter box is in a high traffic area, they may choose to go somewhere more secluded. [17] X Research source Even if you think the litter box location might be the issue, it usually isn’t recommended to move it if your cat has dementia. This often leads to more confusion and stress."

Cats get bored easily and need a lot of mental and physical stimulation, especially if they don’t go outside. Give your cat plenty of fun toys to keep it entertained. Set up an interesting environment with scratching posts, perches, and places where it can hide and rest when it feels stressed or overstimulated. [18] X Research source Try playing with your cat near the litter box or leaving toys close to the litter area to make it seem more inviting. [19] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Cats can also get stressed and go outside the box if they’re lonely or not getting enough attention. Spend time petting and playing with your cat every day to keep it entertained and make sure it feels loved."

However, if the problem persists for several days and you’ve tried all other options, call your vet. There’s a chance your cat might have an underlying health or behavioral issue, and your vet will be able to sort things out.
