      "content": "Darty refers to a daytime party. The term “darty” is, very simply, a combination of “day” and “party.” Most often, a darty is a college party that takes place outdoors during the daytime (and typically ends before nightfall). College “darties” usually also feature alcohol, music, and drinking games. [1] X Research source Daytime parties commonly take place during the springtime—when the weather starts getting warmer and days get longer. Darties are also sometimes associated with college fraternities and sororities, although anyone can throw one."

      "content": "The hashtag #dartyszn translates to “darty season.” Since darties are often associated with springtime, “darty season” simply refers to the time (usually during a spring or summer semester) when fraternities and sororities throw lots of daytime parties. When college students want to celebrate the balmy weather and spend time outdoors, a darty is the natural solution! [2] X Research source Even though “darty season” is considered spring and summertime, darties can happen at any time of the year. The hashtag #dartyszn also refers to a time during the spring semester when there aren’t any college football games—so students fill their weekends “dartying” instead."

      "content": "The term “darty” first appeared on Urban Dictionary in 2008. However, the idea of hosting “darties” became popular later on, with HuffPost referring to a darty as a daytime college party that takes place before finals in 2012. As it became more mainstream, American universities (including the Harvard Crimson newspaper) have acknowledged the concept. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Socialize and talk to new people at the party. While some parties are more about hanging out with a specific group of friends or a date, darties take place in broad daylight and wide open spaces where it’s much easier to chat with people you don’t know as well. Consider a darty your opportunity to get to know someone and even make new friends ! [4] X Research source Many college students actually go to darties to make friends (versus nighttime parties when most people already have dates or a clique). Remember to keep an open mind when meeting people—and don’t be afraid to make small talk here and there!"

      "title": "Set up a few games for guests to play.",
      "content": "Set up a few games for guests to play. Daytime parties are ideal for playing games—especially lawn games (since they take place outside) and drinking games. For example, you could play games like cornhole , wiffleball , and spikeball . In terms of drinking games, you could play King’s Cup or an old-fashioned game of beer pong . [5] X Research source Remember: drinking games should only be played by people who are 21 and over in the US (or over the legal drinking age in your country)."

      "content": "Create a party playlist so everyone can jam to some music. A great party is all about the music, and daytime parties are no exception. To make sure you don’t have to skip any tunes, put together a playlist ahead of time—ideally, one filled with upbeat songs to set the tone for the darty. [6] X Research source If you’re the darty’s host, be sure to consider what songs your guests might enjoy (rather than only songs you want to hear)."

      "title": "Consider bringing some food for the other guests.",
      "content": "Consider bringing some food for the other guests. While drinks are a staple of daytime parties, food isn’t necessarily involved—but it’s never a bad idea to bring some (or provide some for your guests). After all, darties take place around midday, so there’s no guarantee that every attendee got a chance to eat before coming. [7] X Research source If you’re hosting, you don’t have to cook a ton of food. Try a potluck-style party instead! Create a Facebook event or chat group and tell everyone to bring food for sharing—even if it’s diced fruit or a couple of bags of chips."

      "title": "Arrange for transportation to and from the party.",
      "content": "Arrange for transportation to and from the party. If you’re legally able to drink and plan to do so, it’s vital to have transportation figured out beforehand since you won’t be able to drive home. Either agree on a designated driver between friends, make arrangements for someone to drop you off and pick you up, or use a rideshare app like Lyft or Uber . [8] X Research source Remember: it’s illegal (and very dangerous) to drink and drive. Don’t drive home yourself or accept a ride from someone who’s been drinking. If you’re the host, make sure everyone who’s drinking has a safe way to get home. And, if any guests don’t have a way home, either help them arrange safe transportation or let them stay with you until they’re completely sober."

      "content": "Bring sunscreen and sunglasses. Daytime parties mean possibly spending hours out in the sun—so take care of yourself! Apply sunscreen beforehand to protect your skin from sunburn and damage. [9] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Then, remember to re-apply periodically while outside (according to your sunscreen’s instructions). To keep the sun out of your eyes, it might help to bring a pair of sunglasses, too. If you’re throwing a darty indoors or in a backyard, try not to leave your doors unlocked once the darty is in full swing, too (to ensure people don’t wander in uninvited). Don’t do anything that might be harmful to yourself or anyone else, even if it’s all in good fun. Remember to use your common sense!"

      "title": "Be considerate of your neighbors throughout the party.",
      "content": "Be considerate of your neighbors throughout the party. Parties can get loud, especially when music is involved. If you have neighbors, try not to blast your playlist so loudly that it disturbs them. Remember: it’s okay to play music, so long as you remember that you’re not the only people around! [10] X Research source It may even help to give your neighbors a heads-up before the darty (if you’re the one throwing it) and tell them to let you know if things get too loud. Try not to let things get too messy if you’re living in a shared space, either. Ask guests not to litter, and be sure to clean up when the party is over."

      "content": "Don’t bring open containers of alcohol onto public property. It’s against the law to have open containers of alcohol on public property—so be very careful when it comes to throwing a daytime party. “Public property” includes any areas that aren’t privately owned, from city streets and sidewalks to parks and even the strips of lawn in front of peoples’ yards. [11] X Research source Ensure your darty takes place on private property where open alcohol containers are allowed. Even if someone leaves the darty and goes into a public place with alcohol, the police may get involved if they’re reported. So, if you’re the host, make sure everyone is aware of the rules and doesn’t head out into public spaces with their drinks."

      "title": "Follow the law and avoid violating any of your campus’s rules.",
      "content": "Follow the law and avoid violating any of your campus’s rules. In the US, the legal drinking age is 21—so if you’re the host, ensure there’s no underage drinking at your darty. If you plan on inviting underaged guests, consider serving only non-alcoholic drinks. Or, if you’re 21+ and want to drink, consider only inviting guests also over the legal drinking age. [12] X Research source Colleges don’t typically care about off-campus parties, but some campuses have strict rules about drinking. Even if you’re legally able to drink, your college may have a ban on alcohol—so make sure you know the campus rules before throwing a darty. If you live on a dry campus, try asking a friend who lives off-campus to host the darty instead!"
