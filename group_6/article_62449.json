Although this feature is meant to prevent using your (could be limited) mobile data when you're not around, it can also be annoying if you've stepped away from your computer for a moment and come back to find that the hotspot is off.

If the chart is completely full, you have used all your data, so hotspot will no longer work until you add more data. You should see a Set mobile data limit option in this menu so you can add more data to the hotspot."
