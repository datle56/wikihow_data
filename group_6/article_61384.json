You'll find the \"Stream output muxer\" setting in \"Preferences,\" which is an option inside the Tools tab at the top of the screen. Once \"Preferences\" is open, click Stream Output\" from the menu on the left side of the window. Next, change the value next to \"Stream output muxer caching (ms)\" to 1500 and click Save. If you don't see these options, select \"All\" at the bottom of the window under \"Show settings.\" You don't need to have the blurry video open.
