      "content": "Greet people by saying namaskārām . This is the formal way to say \"hello\" in Telugu. The word is essentially the Telugu version of the standard Indian greeting \"namaste.\" Telugu-speakers will also understand you if you simply say namaste , although this is considered less formal. [2] X Research source You can also use greetings that reflect the time of the day. For example, in the morning you might say shubhodayam , which means \"good morning.\" The afternoon greeting is shubha madhyanam . There is no specific evening greeting in Telugu. Use namaskārām or namaste ."

(\"I'm fine/doing well, how are you?\") [3] X Research source For a more polite response, say Naenu baagunnaanu, dhanyavaadhamulu, Mari meeru? This means \"I'm fine, thanks, and yourself?\" The phrase mari meeru means \"and you\" or \"and yourself,\" so if the other person asked first, don't include this part of the sentence."

This means \"What is your name?\" You could also simply say mari meeru after your name. For example, naa paeru Divya, mari meeru? means \"My name is Divya, and you?\" Culturally, it is considered more polite to tell the other person your name before asking theirs. After the person tells you their name, you could say mimmalni kalavadam chaalaa saṅthoashaṅgaa uṅdhi , which means \"pleased to meet you.\""

If you've gotten this far into a conversation with a native-speaker of Telugu, you likely want to let them know that you've just started learning the language. [4] X Research source Someone may ask you \"Meeru telugu maatlaadathaaraa?\" They are asking \"Do you speak Telugu?\" You might reply \"avunu koṅcham maatldathanu,\" which means \"yes, only a little.\" If you don't understand what someone is saying, you can simply say \"artham kaaledu,\" which means \"I don't understand.\" You could also say \"dhayachaesi mallee cheppaṅdi\" (\"please say that again\") or \"dhayachaesi nemmadhigaa matlaadaṅdi\" (\"please speak more slowly\")."

If you can't find someone locally to speak Telugu with, use an online site such as WeSpeke or Busuu to find a conversation partner. In many cases, these partnerships are tandem learning opportunities. For example, if you speak English and want to learn Telugu, you would be matched with a native Telugu speaker who wants to learn English. During your sessions, you would converse part of the time in English, the rest of the time in Telugu. With any conversation exchange, you'll get out of it as much as you put in. Take the process seriously. Write down words or phrases that you don't understand and practice them before your next meeting."

To conjugate a verb, drop the u and add the appropriate endings. In some cases the closing consonant will be doubled in the transliteration of the word – this does not affect the pronunciation.

The current writing system was developed in the 20th century, and is based on the modern spoken language. Once you know how to speak Telugu, spelling and writing should come easily to you. After learning the alphabet, turn on Telugu closed-captioning when watching Telugu-language movies. That way you'll be able to see the word written as it is spoken."
