      "title": "Ask your doctor about taking a berberine supplement.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor about taking a berberine supplement. Before you start taking berberine, ask your doctor if the supplement would benefit you or improve your condition. If your doctor is not familiar with berberine, you might want to seek out a different healthcare provider who specializes in holistic, natural, or alternative medicine. If you're seeing specialists for the treatment of a particular condition, make sure they're on board with you taking the supplement as well."

      "title": "Tell your doctor about all drugs and supplements you're currently taking.",
      "content": "Tell your doctor about all drugs and supplements you're currently taking. Berberine has the potential to interact with many different prescription drugs, particularly antibiotics. Before you start taking berberine, make sure that any drugs you're currently taking will continue to achieve their desired effects. If you're only taking a medication temporarily, you might want to wait until you finish taking it before you start taking berberine. For example, if you're taking antibiotics to clear an infection, it's best to wait until after you've finished the round of antibiotics before you start taking berberine. If you're taking any medications that act in the same or a similar way that berberine does, the two might interact with one another. You may experience more significant side effects than you would otherwise because the effects of both the medication and the supplement would be intensified."

      "title": "Choose a quality berberine oral supplement.",
      "content": "Choose a quality berberine oral supplement. Berberine typically comes in a capsule form that you take orally. However, as with any type of supplement, different brands can vary in their dosage, purity, and overall value. Supplements that contain other chemicals or inactive ingredients may cause additional side effects that you wouldn't experience with a purer variety. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to recommend a brand. If a supplement contains other active ingredients, make sure those herbs or chemicals will not interact with any other medications or supplements you're currently taking. For example, you might find a supplement for type 2 diabetes that includes berberine along with other herbs that have shown promise in treating diabetes, such as cinnamon. Search the supplement's brand on the internet and read reviews about their products. This will help you better evaluate the brand's reputation."

      "content": "Take 500 mg of berberine 3 times a day. Berberine typically comes in 500 mg capsules. The most common dosage is 1 capsule taken 3 times a day with meals, for a total of 1500 mg of berberine each day. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Always take berberine with food. This will cut down on stomach pain and discomfort that you might otherwise experience. You may want to start with a lower dosage and gradually increase your dosage to the full 1500 mg. For example, you might start with 500 mg a day for a week, then increase your dosage to 1000 mg taken in 500 mg doses twice a day for the next week, then start the full dosage in the third week. If your doctor tells you a different dosage to take, follow their instructions, even if they differ from the instructions on the supplement bottle."

Gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea, constipation, and bloating or intestinal discomfort, are the most common side effects of taking berberine. However, depending on your general health and other drugs you're taking, you may experience different side effects after taking berberine. Typically, your side effects will go away if you decrease your dosage. If you're taking only 500 mg or less per day and still experiencing bothersome side effects, you might want to stop taking berberine."

      "content": "Stop taking berberine after 6 months. Clinical trials of berberine generally don't last any longer than 6 months and researchers have not evaluated the long-term use of the supplement. For this reason, it's probably safest to stop taking the supplement and monitor your health after 6 months. [7] X Research source If any symptoms return that disappeared when you were taking berberine, you might consider taking it again for another 6-month cycle. However, talk to your doctor again before you do this. If you decide to start another cycle of berberine, wait at least 2 months between cycles."

      "content": "Eat more vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. A healthy diet with fewer processed foods will improve your overall health and help ensure that you get the most benefit from a berberine supplement. Vegetables and fruits also add fiber to your diet, which will make any gastrointestinal problems easier to manage. [9] X Research source For protein, choose lean meats, such as chicken and turkey. For example, you might have a skinless chicken breast with broccoli and whole grain rice for dinner, followed by some fresh fruit for dessert. Grill or steam most of your food, rather than frying it. If you prefer the taste of fried foods, use olive oil or vegetable oil."
