However, doing this will reduce your Lab’s nutrient intake, possibly leading to nutrient deficiencies. [7] X Research source Instead, feed your Lab a specially-formulated weight loss food. Below is some additional information about weight loss foods: [8] X Research source The labels on over-the-counter (OTC) weight loss foods (“less active,” “weight control”) are not associated with specific nutritional standards and can be misleading. Therefore, you should purchase a prescription weight loss food through your vet. Prescription weight loss foods tend to contain more protein, vitamins, and minerals than OTC foods, decreasing the risk of nutrient deficiencies. Some weight loss foods are not very calorie-dense, meaning you can continue feeding about the same volume of food to your Lab without increasing its caloric intake."

It may beg for your children’s food, and succeed in getting it. Also, supervise your children if they feed your Lab; they may feed it too much and not realize it.

Obesity can make exercise very difficult for dogs, since the extra weight makes moving around a challenge. Instead, start with short, low- to moderate-intensity exercises, like a leisurely walk. [19] X Research source To begin the exercise regimen, take your Lab for 5-minute walks a few times a day. When your Lab can handle these walks, gradually increase the time so you can spend 30 to 45 minutes walking with your Lab each day. [20] X Research source High-impact exercises, like playing fetch or going for a run, are great for dogs. However, it will probably be better for you to focus on less intense exercises until your Lab reaches its ideal weight."

Some dogs can continue eating as they did while on the weight loss program. Other dogs, though, may have to eat less after reaching their ideal weight.
