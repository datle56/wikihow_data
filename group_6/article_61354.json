      "content": "You may have an on-again, off-again relationship.

      "content": "Outsiders might not understand your bond. Because twin flames are mirrors of each other, a twin flame relationship also has a dark side. If either of you has trauma or emotional wounds that need healing, a twin flame relationship can look toxic to those on the outside looking in. [14] X Research source Having strong communication while also respecting each other's boundaries can help you and your twin flame develop a more positive and healthy relationship, even if you are working through past trauma. Keep in contact with all of your other friends and family members.
