      "title": "“Heyyy” usually means that she’s super into you.",
      "content": "“Heyyy” usually means that she’s super into you. If a girl texts you “heyyy,” it’s a pretty good sign that she likes you and thinks you’re hot stuff. In fact, “heyyy” is often code for, “Alright, come on now. How many more signs do you need to make a move?” [1] X Research source If you’re into her and the vibes are right, don’t overthink this too hard and go for it."

      "title": "“Heyyy” may not mean she likes you if she’s an especially playful person.",
      "content": "“Heyyy” may not mean she likes you if she’s an especially playful person. Who the message comes from means a lot. If the girl who texted this to you is super bubbly, happy, or goofy, she may just be throwing the three ys out there because it’s her personality. If you don’t have any other signs that she’s interested in you but sending “heyyy” isn’t all that off-brand for her, this might not be her way of flirting. Don’t get us wrong though, “heyyy” is usually a sign she’s into you."

    {
      "title": "“Hey” is just a “hello,” so don’t read too much into it.",
      "content": "“Hey” is just a “hello,” so don’t read too much into it. There isn’t any real subtext here. If a girl texts you “hey,” she’s just starting a conversation. Reply by asking her what’s going on or just say, “Hey” back to her and see what’s on her mind. It’s possible that she may not like you, but rest assured that it’s a good sign if she’s reaching out to talk to you, so keep your spirits high and respond to her “hey!” Who a text comes from matters a lot, so take what you know about this girl into account when you’re trying to decipher her texts."

      "title": "“Heyy” could be a typo, or it could be some subtle playfulness.",
      "content": "“Heyy” could be a typo, or it could be some subtle playfulness. If she’s a crazy fast texter, she may have just fat fingered the “Y” button, so you can’t confirm anything just yet. However, if she did this on purpose, it’s a good sign she may be into you. That second “y” signals that she might be testing the waters by flirting a bit and seeing how you respond. If you want to flirt with, now is a good time to give it a go and see what happens!"

      "title": "“Heyyyy+” either means she’s drunk or really wants you.",
      "content": "“Heyyyy+” either means she’s drunk or really wants you. Is it after 10 pm on a Friday? If so, “Heyyyy” and its variations are likely a straightforward way of saying “I’m drunk, get over here and kiss me right now.” If you get one of these during normal waking hours, she’s probably crazy into you. There are very few sure things in life, but if you get a “Heyyyy” text (or one with more ys) you’re almost certainly good to ask her out if that’s what you want. [2] X Research source This goes for “heyyyy,” “heyyyyy,” “heyyyyyy,” and any other versions with too many ys."

      "title": "Some people open with “heyyy” when they want something from you.",
      "content": "Some people open with “heyyy” when they want something from you. If you don’t normally talk to this girl or she has a habit of reaching out when she wants to ask a favor, this might be her way of opening the convo. People often take things slow and behave super kindly when they want something from you, and “heyyy” could be a sign that this is where things are going."

    {
      "title": "“Heyyy :D”",
      "content": "“Heyyy :D” Return the “heyyy” to play things safe and then throw in a little smiley to let her know you’re happy she’s reaching out. This puts the ball in her court but lets her know she’s got the green light to keep flirting if that’s what’s going on here. If you want more confirmation that she’s into you, this is a good way to go. You might also say: “Heyyy 🤗” “Hello there :)” “Hi 😜”"

    {
      "title": "“What’s up?!”",
      "content": "“What’s up?!” If you don’t want to be outwardly flirty—either because you want more information or you aren’t sure if you like her yet—just respond with a basic follow-up text and ask her what’s going on. She won’t read too much into it, and you can get the convo going and move on from there. Other neutral options include: “Hey! What are you doing?” “Howdy! How are you?” “Hi, what’s up?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“I was just thinking about you!”",
      "content": "“I was just thinking about you!” Let her know that you’re happy she’s texting you with a sweet and flirty response. This is a great way to move the convo in a genuine direction where you can drop some earnest signals that you’re into her. Being a little forward is also a more mature look, which is great if you’re a little on the younger side and you want to impress her. You might prefer: “Hey there cutie! What’s going on?” “Hey, I’m happy you hit me up. How are you?” “Hello there, sweet stuff. What’s up?”"

      "title": "“Hey! You see anything good on Netflix lately? I need a new show.”",
      "content": "“Hey! You see anything good on Netflix lately? I need a new show.” Ask her for a recommendation to get her active and talking. People like to answer questions about their experiences and opinions, and taking an active interest in her will demonstrate that you care. You might also ask: “Hiiii! Settle a debate for me. Is a hot dog a sandwich? What about a taco?” “Hey there! What’s your favorite chip flavor? I’m going to the store but can’t decide what kind of chips to get.” “How are you? I’m curious. Do you listen to albums front to back or random playlists?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Let’s play a game…”",
      "content": "“Let’s play a game…” Challenge her to something playful and competitive. Not only is this more interesting than some straightforward conversation, but it’s also a great way to spark some flirty exchanges since it’s easier to banter if you’re competing over something. You could try: “Hey! Want to do something fun? Let’s trade photos of celebrities we think the other person looks like. Closest photo wins.” “I dare you to tell me your most unpopular opinion, then I’ll share mine and we can see who is more controversial. You down?” “Want to play truth or dare over text? I’m bored and this should be fun 😊”"

    {
      "title": "“Hi! I’m always so happy to get a text from you.”",
      "content": "“Hi! I’m always so happy to get a text from you.” Send her a compliment or gas her up a bit to make her smile and feel good. This will signal that you like and care about her, and it’s a great way to see if she’s interested in you if you still aren’t sure. [3] X Research source You could say something like: “Hey! I really liked that dress you wore yesterday. I never told you, but it was cute and you should know that.” “Hey, I loved that song you sent me yesterday. You really have great taste.” “Hey there. I really liked your presentation yesterday, btw. I learned a lot, seriously.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Hey! What are you up to tomorrow?”",
      "content": "“Hey! What are you up to tomorrow?” This “heyyy” is almost certainly a sign that she’s into you, so if you’re ready to ask her out , there’s no time like now. If you have even a little bit of a feeling that she likes you and you see this “heyyy” text, the odds are very high that she’ll be happy you’re asking her out. You could also go with something like: “Heyyy! Would you want to grab a drink tonight?” “Hey, you! I was just about to text you. Want to catch a movie next weekend?” “Hey, would you be interested in a date tonight? I got two tickets to a show 😊.”"
