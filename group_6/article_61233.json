If you’ve got a super minor burn and you don’t need medical help, honey may be a viable treatment option for you, However, you should only do this at home if your burn is less than 2 inches (5.1 cm) in diameter, the skin isn’t broken, and you aren’t experiencing a level of pain that’s intolerable.

      "content": "While honey can help, you should still perform basic first aid. While you can certainly use honey if you want to soothe the skin and help it heal, it shouldn’t be the first step in burn treatment. First, run the skin under cool water for 10-15 minutes. Then, dry it gently with a clean cloth. [4] X Research source You want to ensure that your skin is clean before you put anything else on it. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Immediately following a burn, the goal is to get the wound clean. Using a bunch of products before cleaning it may accidentally introduce bacteria or contaminants and make the burn worse.

      "content": "Manuka is probably the best, but Gelam, Medihoney, and Tualang will all work. That standard bear-shaped bottle you buy at the supermarket won’t actually help you here. Believe it or not, there are actually dozens of different kinds of honey. The varieties that will help a burn wound heal are: [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Manuka is probably the most well-known honey when it comes to medical care. It’s proven to be anti-inflammatory, and it’s effective for treating superficial wounds. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It tastes pretty good, too! You can find it at most grocery stores. Gelam honey, also known as Malaysian honey, is a potent antibacterial option. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You’ll likely need to order it online. Medihoney is actually sold as a medical-grade wound dressing. It’s even authorized by medical boards in Europe and the FDA in the United States as a topical treatment. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can often find it at pharmacies. Tualang honey also appears to be an anti-inflammatory agent with the ability to kill some bacterial strains that are common with burn wounds.

      "content": "Spread it over your skin gently after you’ve cleaned it. After you’ve washed the burn with cool water and dried it off, you can apply the honey. Pour 3–6 teaspoons (15–30 mL) of honey over the burned skin depending on the size of your wound. Bandage the area gently with a sterile gauze pad. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can also just pour a dollop of honey on a gauze pad if you don’t want to apply it directly to your skin."

      "content": "Change your dressing twice a day to keep it clean. Due to the fact that the honey may attract bugs or go bad, it’s probably a good idea to change your dressings more frequently. [13] X Research source Remove the bandage carefully, rinse the honey off, and either reapply the dressing or let your skin air out. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source There’s no problem using honey more than once if you feel like it’s bringing you relief. If your burn isn’t hurting that much and the skin is starting to heal, feel free to let it air out, though."

      "content": "It’s up to you, but it’s probably best to keep it on for less than 12 hours. The risks are probably very low if you leave it on for too long, but honey is organic and it will go bad eventually. Just to keep your skin clean, aim to replace your bandage every 6-12 hours and rinse the honey off with clean water before you go to sleep. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you can’t change your wounds at least twice a day, at least wash the honey off before you go to bed. This is one of those things that hasn’t been studied all that well, but honey can go bad like any other food product, so you probably shouldn’t leave it on your skin for more than 24 hours."

Many people compare it to a diluted and non-minty version of aloe vera. The pain relief won’t be dramatic, but it should soothe your skin.

Outside of that scenario, there shouldn’t be any risk or downside.
