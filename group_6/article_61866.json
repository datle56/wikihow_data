      "content": "Restart the TikTok app. First start by restarting the TikTok app, especially if you’ve had the app open for a long time without closing it. Sometimes a refresh is all the app needs. If that doesn’t fix the problem, though, try restarting your entire phone . Again, if your phone has been on for a long time without a restart it can start to act up. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "If your app hasn't been updated in a while, you could try updating it. Updates push important fixes to the app, so if you've gone a long time without updating TikTok it could be missing some vital bug fixes."

      "title": "Uploading a video can be an intensive process.",
      "content": "Uploading a video can be an intensive process. If your phone doesn’t have a strong internet connection, you may find that your video processing takes much longer than it does normally. If you’re not connected to Wi-Fi but a network is available, try connecting to it. If you get one or two bars of service, that should be sufficient. You can also try moving to an area that gets a better signal, especially if you’re indoors. For mobile data, being on a 3G network should be sufficient."

      "title": "You might be having trouble with the TikTok app if the servers are down.",
      "content": "You might be having trouble with the TikTok app if the servers are down. While TikTok doesn’t have a dedicated server status page, you can use a website like Downdetector to see if other users are having problems with TikTok. As many users access TikTok on a daily basis, the server that keeps the app running may encounter issues from time to time. Unfortunately, the only solution to this is to wait until the servers recover."

      "content": "A cache is a set of temporary files stored by a website or application that it uses to run. It makes it so data can be retrieved faster, but if the cache gets too full it can actually impact the application’s performance. If your video is uploading slowly, you can always try to clear out the TikTok cache ."

      "content": "You can try checking to see if your account has been blocked or banned. This would make you unable to finish processing your video post. To check if your account has been banned, select your inbox from the bottom menu bar and then select the ‘from TikTok’ option at the top. If you have been banned, there should be a message in your inbox from TikTok detailing the specifics of the ban. [2] X Research source"

If your video is still not uploading, double check your video to see if there is anything in it that could violate Community Guidelines. [3] X Research source One of the most common guideline violations is copyright infringement , so watch your video back to look for any overt logos, songs, or images belonging to another copyright holder. You also may want to check to see if your video includes any dangerous, sensitive, or mature themes."
