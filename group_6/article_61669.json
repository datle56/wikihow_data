If you or another person has a food allergy, this is where you would mention that. Some restaurants let you make modifications to an item directly. When an item gives a \" x items still required\" prompt, this means you will need to specify sides or add-ons. For example, if you're ordering a burger from a fast food restaurant, tapping that item allows you to customize your burger toppings, substitute a salad instead of fries, and choose an iced coffee instead of a soda."
