      "title": "“Snatched” comes from the Black drag community.",
      "content": "“Snatched” comes from the Black drag community. “Snatched” originated in the New York City drag scene in the 1990s as a way to describe things as “fierce” or “on point.” Because Black drag performers typically wear artificial hair in the form of wigs or weaves, they might say that another performer “snatched their wig” off when they did something amazing or flawless. [3] X Research source The slang term “snatched” eventually began to be used on its own, most likely being popularized around 2016 by the reality TV show RuPaul’s Drag Race . Although “snatched” has become popular in the mainstream, the word was (and still is) predominately used in the Black drag community. People in the drag world may also use “snatched” to mean that someone is being extra sassy or witty, but this meaning hasn’t been as popularized in wider communities."
