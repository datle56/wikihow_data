Keep tapping the sieve until all of the sugar dusts into the bowl and it’s completely sifted. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "You can easily stir the powdered sugar to break apart the clumps. Pour the amount of powdered sugar you need for a recipe into a bowl. Gently stir the sugar with a wire whisk or fork to remove the clumps. Stir gently so that the sugar stays in the bowl instead of wafting up into the air. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "A blender keeps your sugar from wafting in the air and making a mess. Scoop out as much powdered sugar as you need and put it into your blender. Press the “Pulse” button on your blender a few times to break the clumps apart so your powdered sugar is light and fluffy. Wait for the sugar to settle to the bottom of the blender before taking off the lid. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Tea strainers work best for dusting powdered sugar on small baked goods. A tea strainer is a small mesh ball normally used for loose-leaf tea, but it works great for dusting powdered sugar without a sifter. Just load a spoonful of powdered sugar into the strainer and seal it shut. Hold the tea strainer over cookies or cake and lightly tap the side to sift the perfect amount of powdered sugar."

      "content": "A dusting wand gives you more control over where you’re sifting the sugar. A sugar dusting wand has a scoop with a mesh lid that lets you easily apply powdered sugar as a finishing touch on desserts. Scoop out some powdered sugar with the dusting wand and twist the handle to close the mesh lid. Flip the wand over and gently tap the side to apply a dusting of sugar onto your baked goods.

      "content": "A flour sifter effectively breaks the clumps apart when you crank it. A flour sifter looks like a metal barrel with a fine mesh inside and a crank on the outside. Hold the sifter over a bowl and load your powdered sugar into the mesh. Turn the crank handle to break down the clumps and push the powdered sugar through the mesh. [5] X Research source Some flour sifters have a lever you squeeze on the handle instead of a crank. That way, you can use it with one hand instead of having to use two hands."
