      "title": "Conduct a sexy chocolate treasure hunt.",
      "content": "Conduct a sexy chocolate treasure hunt . Choose a time when the kids are with friends and create a steamy game of chocolate hide and go seek. Don’t tell your significant other, just allude to an evening of intimacy and to “be ready.” Purchase a large box of pre-wrapped chocolates––preferably your partners’ favorites. Create either a trail of chocolate pieces (and rose petals) leading to the boudoir or devise an interactive treasure hunt. For treasure hunt clues, weave both humor and romance into the text such as, “Find your next treat in the place where I take my evening seat (a favorite sofa).” Leave a small clue with each piece of chocolate until the hunt culminates either in the bedroom or in a cozy area of your home where you have arranged for a romantic dinner for two. The end of the chocolate treasure hunt could involve you smothered in chocolate or at least with chocolates artistically laid out across your body."

      "content": "Take a bath in chocolate. Skip squeezing the Hershey’s syrup into the tub and do a chocolate bath the right way. While the Internet is loaded with plenty of chocolate bath recipes, you may like to try wikiHow's own chocolate bath recipe or a chocolate bubble bath . Although you may be tempted to sample the chocolate while you bathe, resist the urge to imbibe. Think about where your feet have been over the past few hours and your temptation to drink the chocolate will fade away! And as well as soaking in sensual chocolate, you can stimulate the senses with a few added touches: Champagne for two––skip plastic cups or ordinary glasses and go for the real crystal flutes. Scented chocolate candles––fill the room with the aroma of chocolate by lighting several chocolate-scented candles around the bathroom. A plate of chilled, fresh fruit. While strawberries are usually preferable, explore adding mango, berries and cherries."

      "content": "Have chocolate on the menu for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Surprise your honey by having a full chocolate feast instead of the usual fare. For example, dine on chocolate croissants for breakfast or serve nothing but chocolate dessert for lunch. For dinner, it’s possible to infuse main course, appetizers, drinks and dessert with chocolate and finding the right recipe need not pose a huge challenge. Look at Mexican cuisine chocolate main course recipes such as chicken mole (or vegan mole). And beyond that, here’s an example of what you could make: Beef stew with chocolate: combine two pounds of chopped beef stew meat with traditional spices such as salt and pepper. Sear meat in a large saucepan over high heat until all sides are brown and caramelized. Set aside. Combine one cup of sliced carrots, 8 ounces of mushrooms, three cups of diced potatoes, one 14.5 ounce can of tomatoes and the beef in a slow cooker. In a separate bowl, mix two tablespoons of finely grated dark chocolate, one teaspoon grated garlic, one meatloaf packet, one 14 ounce can of beef broth, and one cup of red wine. Pour over the beef mixture in the slow cooker and cook for four to six hours. White knight-tini: Mix two shots of vanilla vodka combined with two shots of white chocolate liqueur and half shot of chocolate liqueur. Stir, strain and serve over ice. For an added touch, dip the glass rims in warmed white chocolate. To know how to eat chocolate in a seductive manner, see How to eat chocolate seductively ."

      "content": "Try body painting with chocolate. Although it may be tempting to try painting with regular brand chocolate, consider going for chocolate that is made especially for body painting. One distinct advantage is that body painting chocolate is ready for fun––no mixing or re-configuring the make-up to find the right consistency. However, if you insist on DIY’ing your chocolate body painting experience, try this recipe: 17.5 ounces of dark chocolate (sweet and/or semi-sweet) chopped, 13.5 ounces of cream, a handful of chopped mint leaves, one finely chopped chili pepper and a double shot of espresso. Divide cream into three different pans, add mint and chili to one pan and the espresso to the third pan. Slowly warm each pan to almost a simmer (for approximately 15 minutes). Melt chocolate in a separate pan either in the microwave or by using the double boiler method. Remove from heat and divide chocolate into the three pans. Return pans to low heat and simmer until fully combined."
