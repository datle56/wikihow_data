      "content": "Slide the shin guards past your ankle and up your shin. This should be the first thing you put on. Shin guards are worn under the socks, so don't put them on yet. [1] X Research source If the guard is too uncomfortable on your bare skin, consider wearing 2 layers of socks: one sock underneath the guard, and the second one over it. Some shin guards are curled on one side to fit on your right or left shin specifically (many can go on either leg, though). If so, align the higher side with the outside of your shin or check to see if they’re labeled “left” and “right.”"

      "content": "Center the guards on your shin between your ankle and knee. Make sure they are centered on your shin, not off to the side. They should protect from your ankle to below your knee. [2] X Research source If your shin guards have ankle pads, they should cover the bony sections on both sides of your ankle. Be sure your shin guards are properly positioned before moving on, or you risk a serious injury. Your shin guard should cover the area from just above your ankle to about 2 inches (5 cm) below your knee. If it’s too small, go up a size to stay protected."

      "title": "Fasten all straps securely.",
      "content": "Fasten all straps securely. Most shin guards have straps at the top to secure the guard to your leg. Make sure that these are snug enough to keep your shin guard in place, but not so tight that they restrict your circulation. [3] X Research source If your foot starts to itch, swell, feel numb or discolor, your shin guards are probably too tight. Loosen them right away to avoid injuring your leg. If you’re wearing a slip-in shin guard (no straps), simply hold the guard in place while you pull up your socks over it."

      "title": "Tape your shin guards to hold them in place if necessary.",
      "content": "Tape your shin guards to hold them in place if necessary. Slip-in shin guards and shin guards without ankle pads usually need extra security to keep them in place. Even some shin guards with good straps fall out of place during intense games. [4] X Research source Slip-in shin guards have no straps and usually have to be taped at both ends. Wrap athletic tape around the top and bottom of your shin guards. Test your them to make sure they don't easily push up or down. If your shin guards have straps, push them around and make sure they are secure on your leg. If they move around, you can tape them up just like slip-in shin guards. Or, wrap the entire guard in pre-wrap (the material layered under athletic tape for injuries) to hold them in place. [5] X Research source Keep extra tape with you during games. You may need to replace your tape during breaks or half-time."

      "content": "Put your socks over the shin guards. Field hockey coach Adam Falla says, “long, knee-high socks will keep [your shin guards] in place.” You'll want a tall sock that is snug on your leg, but also not so tight that it cuts off your circulation. Pull your socks all the way up to make sure they're snug enough. If you have fabric left that stretches above your knee, roll it down to further secure your shin guards. If you’re wearing slip-ins, double check their position and adjust them if they moved while you were putting your socks on."

      "content": "Measure your shin length to determine your shin guard size. An improperly fitting pair of shin guards can impede athletic performance. It can also be dangerous. Shin guards that are too small won't fully cover your leg and leave you open to physical impact, while shin guards that are too big can trip you and cause an injury. Therefore, picking the right size is essential for good performance and safety. Measure from just below the knee (about 2 inches (5 cm)) to just above the bend of your ankle. This is the area that your shin guard should cover. The length of this measurement determines the ideal size for your shin guard. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose between a slip-in or classic strap-on shin guard. There are two primary styles of shin guard. Each offers unique levels of protection and flexibility. [7] X Research source Slip-in shin guards are protective plates inside a compression sleeve. They slip over the shin like a large sock. This style offers a wider range of motion but less protection. It is usually recommended for more advanced players. Ankle shin guards consist of a protective plate that straps around the shin attached to padding that wraps around the ankle. These are usually recommended for younger or less experienced players because they offer more protection. If you’re buying shin guards for a young child, consider using shin socks instead. These shin guards are sewn into tall socks and are easier for young children to take on and off."

      "content": "Visit a sporting goods store and find the size and style you want. Stores like Modell’s, Dick’s, and Sports Authority are general sporting goods stores that have equipment for numerous sports. If you're an advanced player looking for a very specific type of shin guard, you may want to try a store that specializes in the sport you play. Using the measurement you took of your leg, find the right size and style shin guard. Shin guards can vary greatly in price. A general rule is that more expensive shin guards will offer better protection, but this isn't always true. Beginner players usually don't need the most expensive equipment, just adequate protection. A store employee should be able to talk you through your options and find the best pair of shin guards for the right price. Shin guards are also available online, but purchasing them in person is recommended so you can try them on for fit and comfort first."

      "content": "Try the shin guard on to make sure it fits properly. Remember, the right size shin guard should cover from right above your ankle to about 2 inches (5 cm) below your knee. If your initial leg measurement was too big or small, find another pair that fits you better. Walk around with the shin guards on to make sure they're comfortable and don't inhibit your movement. You want good protection that still allows you to play effectively. Try walking and running with the shin guards on. They shouldn't get in the way or slow you down. Do the motions you would do while playing your sport. For example, if you play soccer, try kicking a ball. The shin guards shouldn't impede your kicking at all. Ask a store employee if you have any problems. They can offer you tips and advice on the best pair of shin guards for you."

[11] X Research source Let the baking soda sit on your shin guards (preferably in a bag to prevent a mess) for several hours or overnight. Then, brush or vacuum the baking soda away before wearing them."
