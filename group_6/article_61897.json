      "title": "A low battery prevents your Vuse from fully heating up.",
      "content": "A low battery prevents your Vuse from fully heating up. If the power unit on your Vuse doesn’t have a lot of charge left, you may not pull any vapor from it. Your Vuse may also blink multiple times or flash red to signal that the battery is almost dead. [1] X Research source The Fix: Charge your Vuse power unit until it has a full charge or the light turns green."

      "title": "Your Vuse pod won’t get any power if the connection is loose.",
      "content": "Your Vuse pod won’t get any power if the connection is loose. If your Vuse pod wobbles or doesn’t feel secure, it won’t connect properly to the power unit. It may also mean the battery contacts have dust or debris preventing a strong connection. [2] X Research source The Fix: Take the Vuse pod out from the power unit and wipe the battery contacts with a clean, dry cloth. Place the pod back in tightly. If the pod still doesn’t work or fit securely in the power unit, then try a different pod."

      "title": "A clog can prevent your Vuse pod from pulling.",
      "content": "A clog can prevent your Vuse pod from pulling. Whenever dust or other debris gets lodged inside of the pod’s mouthpiece, it could block the airway and not pull any vapor. [3] X Research source The Fix: Take the Vuse pod out and wipe it with a dry cloth. Then, gently blow into it to dislodge the buildup. If there’s still buildup, use a toothpick or safety pin to scoop it out. Vuse pods come with plastic caps you’re able to put on top to prevent debris from getting inside it."

      "title": "Your Vuse won’t make vapor when the liquid is too low.",
      "content": "Your Vuse won’t make vapor when the liquid is too low. When a Vuse pod is empty, it’ll heat up but you won’t pull any vapor. [4] X Research source Check if the tank is empty or look for a flashing light after taking a puff to determine if the liquid is low. [5] X Research source The Fix: Take out the old Vuse pod and insert a new one. If you pull from your Vuse and it tastes burnt, it’s another sign the tank may be empty. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Chain vaping may make your Vuse automatically turn off.",
      "content": "Chain vaping may make your Vuse automatically turn off. When you pull for longer than 5 seconds on most models of Vuse pens, it immediately shuts down. If you’re taking a lot of puffs right after one another, your vape could stop working so it doesn’t overheat. [7] X Research source The Fix: Take short, slow puffs from your vape and wait a few seconds in between each one. Taking multiple quick pulls from a Vuse may also give the vapor a burnt flavor.

      "title": "Old or broken power units may not heat the vape liquid properly.",
      "content": "Old or broken power units may not heat the vape liquid properly. If you notice that your power unit doesn’t hold a charge, then there’s a problem with the Vuse’s internal components. Cracks, leaks, and other damage to the power unit can also prevent it from working. [9] X Research source The Fix: Get a new power unit that works properly and insert your Vuse pod. If the power unit feels warmer than usual when you try using it, remove the pod or cartridge."

      "title": "A manufacturing defect can prevent a Vuse pod from pulling.",
      "content": "A manufacturing defect can prevent a Vuse pod from pulling. On some rare occasions, Vuse pods come defective out of the box. If no other fixes worked, then there’s most likely a problem with the pod. [10] X Research source The Fix: Use a different Vuse pod on your power unit. Contact 1-877-614-VUSE (8873) and let them know your issue to see if you can get a replacement."
