      "content": "Oil lubricates and moisturizes leather, which makes it softer and more flexible. Leather dries up and cracks when it isn’t well moisturized. Infusing it with oil lubricates all the cracks and makes sure it can move again, lending it a nice softness. [10] X Research source Your leather is also more waterproof with oil. When it’s waterproof, it won’t dry up as quickly. That means it’ll crack less, and you won’t have to treat it as often. Oil fixes any cracks leather already has. If you rub oil into them, you hydrate fibers in the cracks. With that care, cracks will smooth over, making your leather glossier."
