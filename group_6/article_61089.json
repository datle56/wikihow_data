      "content": "Warm the pan. Place the clean, dry pan on a stove top burner set to medium heat. It is important to use a hot pan to toast the oil. Ideally, you should be able to feel heat radiating from the surface of the pan before you pour in the oil. Hold your hand a few inches above the pan. If you can only hold your hand in this position for a few seconds before the temperature becomes too much, the pan is ready for toasting."

      "content": "Pour the cold-pressed sesame oil into the pan. Start by pouring a small amount of the sesame oil into the heated pan. Carefully grip the handle of the pan with your dominant hand, and slowly rotate the pan from side to side. Keep the liquid moving during its entire cooking time to prevent possible burning of the sesame oil. The sesame oil is properly toasted when it acquires a golden brown color. In addition, a rich, nutty scent will begin to develop. When this occurs, remove the pan from the heat source."
