      "content": "Your dog will have to solve small puzzles in order to access its food. Get puzzle toys that have sliding drawers or small compartments where you can hide kibble. Load the food into the toy and give it to your dog to play with. Since your dog has to work to get to the food inside, it won’t be able to eat as fast and will take more time to eat its entire meal. Puzzle toys are great for keeping senior dogs mentally engaged."

Since the ball blocks some of the food, your dog will have to push the ball out of the way and won’t be able to take as big of bites. [8] X Research source If your dog picks the tennis ball out of the bowl, then try putting a large rock in the middle of the bowl instead. Just make sure it’s large enough so that your dog won’t try to eat it. You can also try flipping your dog’s food bowl over and putting the kibble in the ring around the raised center."

      "title": "Drinking water before each bite of food helps your dog slow down.",
      "content": "Drinking water before each bite of food helps your dog slow down. Fill the bottom 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64–1.27 cm) of the food bowl with water after you put in the kibble. When your dog eats, it’ll lap up some of the water and then chew on the food. Since the kibble floats on the surface, it’ll slosh around so your dog won’t get as much with each bite. Putting water in the bowl also softens your dog’s food, which makes it easier to chew and won’t make your pups choke. Softened food is great for puppies that eat too fast."
