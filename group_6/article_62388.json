      "content": "Leos are known for their confidence (or, their overconfidence). Because Leos are ruled by the sun, they're all about the self . Leo believes that they’re truly dazzling company, and they always put their own oxygen mask on first. To some though, their attitude can feel a little off-putting, especially if Leo lets self-love distract them from treating their friends with the care and respect they deserve. But at the end of the day, we wouldn’t have them any other way. Leo has a big heart and, yes, a lot of its energy is directed inward (self-care for days!). But they definitely try to help their friends shine, too—they want you to feel just as confident as they do."

      "content": "More than any other sign, Leo craves the spotlight, 24/7. Sometimes, this fire sign earns a bad rep for constantly grabbing the mic and stealing the show. Most Leos have a hard time playing second fiddle, and when someone else gets all the attention, it can be hard for them to stomach. Even when it's someone they adore! This behavior can get on others' nerves at times, especially if it seems mean-spirited. [1] X Research source Like Scorpio loves mystery and Cap loves success, Leo loves to be at center stage. They can’t help it! And Leo doesn't mean to be competitive about it, If they accidentally steal your moment, they’ll regret it. Talk to Leo about how you feel, and they’ll probably work hard to show you they’re sorry."

      "title": "As a fixed fire sign, Leo is a force to be reckoned with.",
      "content": "As a fixed fire sign, Leo is a force to be reckoned with. That's because fixed signs never doubt themselves and fire signs aren't afraid of a fight. To some people, Leo’s approach to managing conflict is just too much. Leos aren’t ones to compromise, and it’s usually their way or the highway. What’s more, if you go against Leo, you might find that they won’t go down quietly. Leo isn’t afraid to get into a verbal sparring match if they really feel their opponent deserves their fire. And as frustrating as this might be at times, Leo is a great person to have on your side of a fight. This sign is the definition of a ride or die: if you make it into their inner circle, Leo won’t let anyone cross you."

      "title": "Leos feel that they're “theatrical,” but to some, they're a little annoying.",
      "content": "Leos feel that they're “theatrical,” but to some, they're a little annoying. At times, Leo earns a bad reputation for being a bit over-the-top in everyday situations. They love to exaggerate stories, give big reactions, and make life feel more exciting in general. To more down-to-earth, straightedge signs (like Virgo or Capricorn), this might get frustrating at times. This is one main reason Leo gets criticized. [2] X Research source But let’s face it: Leo's energy can be super fun, too! A lot of the time, Leo’s willingness to turn a boring story into an epic saga is actually super entertaining to be around. Plus, if they weren't so theatrical, we'd miss out on amazing work made by famous Leos, like JLo, Viola Davis, and Steve Carrel."

      "title": "Leo loves to lead, which sometimes leads them to be controlling.",
      "content": "Leo loves to lead, which sometimes leads them to be controlling. If you don’t like taking orders, then Leo might not be the friend for you. This is a sign that is happy taking the reins, and for signs that go with the flow (Pisces, Gemini), this is refreshing. But for some people, this might be a little off-putting instead. Whether it’s dinner plans or the Airbnb rental, Leo will probably expect to have the final say. [3] X Research source To lots of people, Leo’s leadership is comforting. Someone’s got to be in charge, and Leo’s happy to comb through tons of logistics to make sure everyone’s happy. In short, they may not give up control, but they’re great at taking the lead!"

      "title": "Leo believes that they’re #1, so if they’re beat, they won’t take it lightly.",
      "content": "Leo believes that they’re #1, so if they’re beat, they won’t take it lightly. Whether in love or in friendship, Leo typically expects to come out on top. So if their crush likes someone else, if their friend prefers another pal, or if someone’s story gets more laughs than Leo’s, they’ll be confused. Worst case scenario, Leo might actually be green with envy. If that happens, it’s bad for everyone! However, Leo doesn’t stay down for long. In general, waves of jealousy roll by quickly, and Leo will be able to get back to being their fabulous, fun self."
