      "content": "Drop some hints that you like him without directly saying it. You can laugh at his jokes, give him a few compliments, or even tell him you think he’s cute. If he’s paying attention, he’ll get the message that you like him. [1] X Research source Other things you can do to be flirtatious include making eye contact, leaning toward him when he's talking, or playing with your hair. [2] X Expert Source Cher Gopman Dating Coach Expert Interview. 17 May 2019. This is a super subtle approach, so he might not get the message (especially if he’s bad at picking up on hints). You can try flirting for a little while, but you may need to switch to a more direct approach eventually."

      "content": "Break the touch boundary to let him know you like him. An unspoken rule in dating is that if someone touches you on the arm or the hand, it means they probably like you. Lean over and pat his arm while you laugh at a joke, or gently touch his hand if he tells you something heartfelt. This is another subtle way to let him know you might be catching feelings. [3] X Expert Source Cher Gopman Dating Coach Expert Interview. 17 May 2019. [4] X Research source Touching him on the arm or the hand isn’t a surefire way to let him know you like him, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction."

You could compliment his laugh, his smile, or even how he looks that day—just stick to one or two per conversation so you don’t overwhelm him. Try something like: [5] X Research source “Your hair looks so good! Did you do something different today?” “Wow, you smell amazing.” “You have the best laugh!”"

The more time you spend together, the more he’ll understand that you like him. [6] X Research source If he returns the favor and plans activities too, it’s a good sign that the feeling is mutual. It’s fine to plan fun activities for the two of you together, but try not to ask him to hang out all the time. If you make yourself available 24/7, it could seem a little clingy.

      "content": "He’ll probably be more comfortable if you two are alone. You don’t have to take him on a romantic beach walk, but try not to approach him if you’re in a crowded area. If you want to tell him that you like him, wait until you two are alone in a private place. [8] X Research source If you want to keep it casual, don’t express your feelings over a candlelit dinner. Instead, tell him as you chow down on takeout or watch a fun movie in his living room. The more casual the setting, the less intense your conversation will feel."

Try something like, “I wouldn’t want you to get a crush on me.” When you two are out together, try inserting this line in if he asks you to sit closer to him or give you a hug. [9] X Research source If he invites you out for dinner, you could say something like, “Watch out—if we do that, people might think we’re dating!” Or, if you two just hung out together alone, you could say, “If we keep seeing each other like this, I might just start to like you.” If you’re trying to keep things super casual, only joke about it once or twice while you’re together. If you keep pressing it, he could get scared off."

When you two hang out, let him know that you feel really good when you’re with him or that he makes you feel good about yourself. This is a subtle yet sweet way to tell him that you’re into him without saying the words exactly.

[12] X Research source Try something like, “I think you’re pretty cool, and I’d love to keep hanging out with you.” Or, “I’d like to see where this goes, if that’s okay with you.” If you know he gets scared off easily, stay away from anything too intense, like “I have feelings for you” or “I think I’m falling in love with you.” Reader Poll: We asked 442 wikiHow readers who've confessed feelings to their crush, and 67% of them agreed that the best way to tell them is by having a face-to-face conversation.

If he doesn’t like you back, try to take it in stride and move onto the next guy. [13] X Research source If he isn’t ready to commit yet, he might tell you that he likes you but he isn’t ready for a relationship. It’s up to you whether you want to wait for him to be ready or just move on. He also might say that he likes you back, which is great! You can ask him out on a date to keep the relationship going."
