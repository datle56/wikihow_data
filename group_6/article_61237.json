      "content": "Talk about what occurred. Make sure you both understand what occurred, and what each other's future intentions are. Be clear and direct with each other, as you don’t want the other person to start making dinner plans for two when you were just looking for a fling. Talking about the situation openly and in depth outside of the workplace will ease uncomfortably ambiguous moments in the office. If you don’t think it’s a good idea to date, say so. If this is someone you work closely with, that might be a good reason to curtail the relationship and you can comfortably do so by saying something like, “I don’t want this to get in the way of our professional relationship.\" If you don’t work closely together, you can be more direct and say that you aren’t really interested in taking things further. If one of you left early, and you didn’t get a chance to talk, try to have a brief private meeting at the office. You should always be respectful when talking to your partner. About half of all women, and 20 percent of all men, will experience negative feelings about themselves after a one night stand, usually shame for what they did or feeling that they’ve been used for sex. Avoid statements that can be misconstrued, like \"I can't believe we did that,\" or \"I've made a huge mistake.\""

You don’t want someone to have forgotten something, and need to go back later to pick it up. It’s going to be awkward enough at work the next day, you don’t want to compound the embarrassment by having to see each other after work again. [1] X Research source This also means not “accidentally” leaving something that you need to pick up later. If you think you want your one night stand to turn into something more, that is not the way to go about it."

      "content": "Don’t tell anyone. What happened between the two of you should stay between the two of you. Avoid broadcasting information about you and your partner, even to people you think you trust. Gossip spreads quickly, and telling one person probably means the rest of the office will know shortly. [2] X Research source The best way to stop gossip is to not talk about things in the first place. That means on social media, too. Businesses keep an eye on the kinds of things you post on social accounts, and it will be hard to keep people from prying if you are suddenly “In a relationship,” or “It’s complicated.” Hold off on announcing anything on those places until your relationship becomes serious.

He doesn’t need to know all the steamy details, but you shouldn’t lie about it. This can cause problems for you and your co-worker, as well as cause your boss to lose trust in you. [3] X Research source Your relationship may or may not be a problem, depending on your office’s rules. If your other co-workers think they’ve figured it out, you don’t want to lie to them. It will only make it worse if last night’s partner isn’t telling the same story. Remember that you don’t have to tell them anything, and feel free to remind them that it’s none of their business."

While it may feel fun or liberating to talk about her interesting birthmark, or his odd bedroom requests, consider how you would want to be treated. Gossiping about your co-worker is unprofessional, and will make it difficult for the two of you to maintain a good working relationship. And, you can be sure, your co-worker will learn it was you who told everyone. [4] X Research source"

Awkwardly trying to prevent talking to the other person will probably draw attention to you, and make it harder to do your job.

That could mean moving within the company, or taking a new job altogether. [10] X Research source"
