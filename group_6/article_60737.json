      "content": "Avoid blame. If there are needs or wants that may stem from a conflict, try not to blame your partner. Instead, use “I” statements and keep things factual and calm. Blaming or being dramatic will not do anything to solve the conflict or get your needs met. For example, if you feel the house is a mess, you may want to say, “You never do anything to help around the house!” Instead, be factual and say, “The house is messy right now” or “Things are not as neat as they could be.” Keep the statements about you instead of your partner. For example, don’t say, “You are being clingy.” Instead, say, “I miss spending time with my friends.”"
