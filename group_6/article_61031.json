      "content": "Stir the paint and pour it into a large container. If your paint is old and hasn’t recently been shaken, solids can settle at the bottom of the can. Mix the paint thoroughly to gauge its true consistency, then remove and discard any dried paint chunks or impurities. [1] X Research source Then, pour the paint into a large container. A 5-gallon bucket (19 l) is a good choice for large painting projects, as it will eliminate the need for multiple mixing sessions. To remove large pieces of dried paint, pull them out with the hook end of a paint can opener. Remove other impurities or smaller pieces with a mesh cone strainer. If you’re unsure if your paint has settled, run a wooden stirring stick through it and see if it drags against the bottom. If it does, the paint needs to be mixed. For best results, make sure your paint is at room temperature, as cold paint will naturally be thicker."

      "content": "Gradually add water, starting with 4 oz (118 ml). The exact amount of water you’ll need depends on the current consistency of your paint and the consistency you want to achieve. The general rule is to add ½ cup (118 ml) of water for every gallon (3.7 l) of paint. Never add all the water at one time, and instead gradually mix it in at a slow pace while you stir. [2] X Research source Most paint manufacturers don’t recommend adding more than 8 oz (236.5 ml). of water per gallon of paint. If you’re unsure how much to add, consult your paint can label or search for your specific paint online. If you want to use the paint as a stain, mix the paint and water in a 1:1 ratio to create a really thin texture. Only use water to thin latex paint , never paint thinners. Paint thinners are made with petroleum, which is incompatible with water-based paints like latex paint."

      "content": "Pour the paint through a funnel to test its viscosity. Hold a funnel over the paint bucket and run some paint through it using a ladle or spoon. The paint should flow freely through the funnel without clogging or backing up. If the funnel becomes clogged, the paint is not ready and needs additional thinning. This is an important step if you are going to use a paint sprayer for your project. [4] X Research source Continue gradually stirring and adding small amounts of water to the paint until it passes the funnel test."

      "content": "Or, brush the paint on a test surface. If you don’t have a funnel and don’t intend on using a paint sprayer, test the paint’s thickness on a surface similar to the one you’re going to paint. Brush or roll the paint onto the surface and examine its consistency. If it isn’t thin enough, gradually add more water until you achieve your desired results. [5] X Research source If you want to eliminate brush strokes or roller marks, add a paint additive like Floetrol instead of water. Use 8 oz (236.5 ml) of Floetrol per gallon of paint."

      "content": "Put on gloves and cover your work surface. Oil paint will permanently stain almost any surface it comes in contact with, so take care not to spill any while you are working. Choose a pair of gloves that you don’t mind getting stained, as the paint will not wash out, and put down a drop cloth , a plastic sheet, or old newspaper to protect your work surface. Work in a well-ventilated area, as well. [6] X Research source"

[7] X Research source Make sure to use a container dedicated to oil paint, as the stains will be irreversible. Using a large container that can hold all of the paint will help reduce the number of times you’ll need to repeat the thinning process."

      "title": "Add 1 part turpentine for every 3 parts of paint you use.",
      "content": "Add 1 part turpentine for every 3 parts of paint you use. A “part” refers to the specific unit of measurement you’re using during this process, like gallons, milliliters, liters, or ounces. For example, if you’re using 3 cups of paint, you’d add 1 cup of turpentine . Mineral spirits will also work in place of the turpentine. [8] X Research source If you’re unsure how to measure in parts, check the measurements of your mixing container and adjust accordingly. Do not use water to try to thin oil paint. Water and oil don’t mix, so it would cause the paint to separate."

Monitor the consistency as you stir, and stop when the paint appears to have a creamy texture. [9] X Research source There may be some trial and error during the mixing phase. Slowly add additional thinner to the paint if you feel it isn’t as thin as you’d prefer."

Allow the paint to dry completely, then add a second coat. Once the second coat has dried, pay attention to how the paint looks. The goal is for the paint to have a smooth, dry texture on the test surface. [10] X Research source"

If your paint still hasn’t reached the right consistency, try stirring in small amounts of water or turpentine depending on the type of paint you’re using. Carefully monitor the texture while you mix so your paint doesn’t become oversaturated. [11] X Research source If you’re unable to achieve your desired results using water, purchase a paint thinning product for latex paint from a hardware store."

Latex paint produces potent fumes that can be dangerous if over-inhaled. Your work area should include windows or vents if working indoors. Outdoor workspaces are usually your best option to avoid fume irritation.

[13] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Products Safety Commission Independent U.S. government agency responsible for protecting consumers by developing safety standards and conducting product research Go to source Depending on which type you use, the steps for thinning will be different. Latex paint is water-based and is typically easier to mix. Thinning oil-based paint requires specific mixing agents that are not usually found around the house.

Use full and deep rotations so the paint molecules are properly combined. Lift the stirrer from the can and allow the paint to drip over a paint tray. As the paint drips off the stirrer, it should have an even flow and a consistency that resembles heavy cream. If it falls off the stick in globs, it needs to be thinned. [15] X Research source Your goal with stirring is to combine the heavier molecules that settle at the bottom of the can with the lighter molecules at the top."
