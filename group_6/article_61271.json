Nowadays, if a man stays at home with the children instead of working to support the family, he might be referred to as a “trophy husband.” [2] X Research source This definition of trophy husband is usually a bit more of a joke, and it’s mostly lighthearted fun.

      "content": "Trophy husband isn’t necessarily offensive, but it can carry a negative connotation. When you call someone a “trophy husband,” you might be assuming that they’re only with their partner for the money, or that all they have to offer is their looks. While everyone has a different relationship dynamic, it’s usually not kind to infer that a man is only with their partner because it supports their expensive lifestyle. “Trophy husband” can also have another negative connotation that implies the man in the relationship is stupid or vapid. The phrase itself is like a half-compliment/half-insult, since it’s praising the man for his looks while also saying that he has nothing else to offer. Similarly, calling a stay-at-home dad a “trophy husband” can be derogatory, because it implies that being a stay-at-home parent isn’t hard work."
