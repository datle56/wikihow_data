      "title": "The most flattering cut won’t overwhelm your small frame.",
      "content": "The most flattering cut won’t overwhelm your small frame. Find a jumpsuit with pant legs that taper gradually towards your ankles. This cut will look good both dressed up and in casual outfits. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "A jumpsuit that ends around your ankles will elongate your legs.",
      "content": "A jumpsuit that ends around your ankles will elongate your legs. If your jumpsuit drags on the floor when you are wearing shoes, it’s too long. Ankle-length cuts will flatter your height and figure best. [2] X Research source If you’re tall or have long legs, you can wear a cropped jumpsuit as well. Find a jumpsuit with a longer inseam to make sure it flatters your body."

      "title": "This style of jumpsuit will really accentuate your long legs.",
      "content": "This style of jumpsuit will really accentuate your long legs. Check that the jumpsuit length almost reaches the floor, whether you’re wearing flat shoes or heels. [3] X Research source If you’re short or petite, you can still style a longer, wide-leg cut. Find a jumpsuit with a shorter inseam and a fitted top section to look casual yet put together."

      "title": "Since a jumpsuit is one piece of fabric, it can be tricky finding one that fits your torso.",
      "content": "Since a jumpsuit is one piece of fabric, it can be tricky finding one that fits your torso. If the torso is too short and tight, walking and sitting will be uncomfortable and look unflattering. Find one that doesn’t pull at your inseam or shoulders. [4] X Research source A jumpsuit with an elastic waist and looser top (called a “blouson top”) has more room in the midsection. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "You want a jumpsuit that drapes over your body and conceals any areas you want hidden.",
      "content": "You want a jumpsuit that drapes over your body and conceals any areas you want hidden. A jumpsuit in a stretchy fabric like jersey won’t hug your figure too tightly or feel uncomfortable. [6] X Research source If you have great arms and want to hide a little belly, wear a sleeveless jumpsuit with an elastic waist. Draw attention to a small waist by choosing a jumpsuit with a fitted top and wide, billowing pant legs."

      "content": "These fabrics are comfortable and relaxed, similar to a T-shirt and jeans outfit. They’ll also keep you cool during warmer weather, but can be layered with a jacket in cooler weather. [7] X Research source A linen or cotton jumpsuit in shades of white or blue will look (and feel) cool when it’s hot outside. Add cognac sandals and a straw purse for a fresh, beachy look. If it’s cold outside, layer a denim jumpsuit under a leather bomber jacket or wool varsity jacket for a chic, menswear-inspired outfit."

      "title": "A denim jacket paired with a monochromatic jumpsuit creates a casual, classic look.",
      "content": "A denim jacket paired with a monochromatic jumpsuit creates a casual, classic look. If your jumpsuit has bold colors or prints, pair it with a neutral-toned cargo jacket.

      "content": "A typical feminine jumpsuit might come in a flowy cut, color, or fabric. A floral or polka dot print can also look feminine.

[9] X Research source Match your jacket to your shoe color, or wear a bold-colored jacket to make it the focal point of your look."

Or stay comfortable by wearing sneakers or low-heeled sandals with a denim jumpsuit. [10] X Research source Choose a pair of flats that flatters your height, legs, and body shape.

      "content": "A fitted jumpsuit is an easy way to look polished. Try finding a jumpsuit in a business-appropriate fabric: twill, rayon, polyester, silk, or wool.

[16] X Research source Check that your white dress shirt fits neatly under the jumpsuit, and doesn’t cause any lumps or pulling at seams, which can look sloppy."

      "content": "Heels are the perfect complement to a formal outfit. Choose heels that you’d normally wear to a formal event with a dress or skirt, such as strappy sandals or platform pumps. Wear heels that match your jumpsuit color for a monochromatic look, or wear heels in a bold color to make your shoes the focal point of your outfit. [17] X Research source If you’re going to be standing at a formal event for most of the time, consider wearing heels that will be as comfortable as possible and won’t cause pain."
