One of the driving forces behind anorexia is an intense fear of gaining weight, and anorexics severely restrict their food intake -- i.e., starve themselves -- in order to avoid gaining weight. However, simply not eating is not the only sign of anorexia. Other potential warning signs include: [4] X Trustworthy Source National Eating Disorders Association Nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting individuals and communities affected by eating disorders Go to source Refusal to eat certain foods or whole categories of foods (e.g., “no carbs,” “no sugars”) Be on high alert if your friend or acquaintance you’re concerned about no longer eats their favorite junk foods or fast food anymore. Of course, this could just mean they are trying to eat healthier. Eating only low calorie foods, such as celery and carrots. They may have a severely restrictive diet of a dangerously low amount of calories, such as they may only eat 800 calories per day at most. Food-related rituals, such as excessive chewing, pushing food around on the plate, cutting it into smaller and smaller pieces Obsession with measuring food, such as constantly counting calories, weighing food, double- or triple-checking nutrition labels Refusal to eat out because it’s hard to measure calories"

Anorexics know that if people don’t see them eating anything, they’ll become suspicious, and people with eating disorders try really hard to hide their behaviors from others, so they may make excuses for why they aren’t eating. For example, if invited to a party where there will be food, they may say they ate before they arrived.

If the person seems very thin but still talks about needing to lose weight, they may have a disturbed view of their own body. One hallmark of anorexia is “distorted body image,” where the person continues to believe they are much heavier than they actually are. People with anorexia will often deny suggestions that they are underweight, even if they have many visible bones. [8] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source People with anorexia may also wear large or baggy clothes to hide their true size. They may dress in layers, or wear pants and jackets even in the hottest weather. Part of this is to hide body size, and part of it is because people with anorexia often cannot regulate their body temperature effectively due to a very low amount of body fat and are thus frequently cold. Don't rule out overweight or obese people automatically. It is possible to be anorexic at a large size. Anorexia, restricted eating, and fast weight loss are very dangerous regardless of the person's BMI, and you shouldn't wait until they become underweight before getting them help.

For example, the person may exercise for many hours each week, even if they are not training for a particular sport or event. People with anorexia may also exercise even when they are fatigued, ill, or injured, because they feel compelled to “burn off” the food they have eaten. Exercise is a particularly common compensating behavior for guys with anorexia. The person may believe they are overweight, or may be unhappy with their body composition. They may be preoccupied with body-building or “toning.” Distorted body image is common with anorexic people, too, who will often be unable to recognize how their body actually appears and will see themselves as “flabby” even if they are fit or underweight.

People suffering from bulimia nervosa do not always restrict calories when they aren’t binge-eating. People suffering from binge-eating/purging type anorexia will severely restrict calories when they are not binge-eating and purging.

Could we talk?” The person may become defensive. They may deny having a problem. They may accuse you of meddling in their life, or harshly judging them. You can reassure them that you care about them and would never judge, but don’t get defensive. For example, avoid saying things like “I’m just trying to help you” or “You need to listen to me.” These statements will make the other person feel attacked and encourage them to stop listening to you.

For example, avoid saying things like “Think about what you’re doing to your family” or “If you really cared about me you’d take care of yourself.” People with anorexia may already feel an intense sense of shame about their behavior, and saying things like this could only make the disorder worse. Don’t threaten the person.

You can frame this as a medical issue, which may help. For example, if your loved one or someone you know had diabetes or cancer, you would encourage them to seek medical help. This is no different; you are simply asking them to seek professional help for an illness. NEDA has a “Find Treatment” feature available on their website. This feature can help you find a counselor or therapist who specializes in anorexia. Particularly if the person is a young person or teenager, family therapy may be helpful. Some studies suggest that family-based therapy is more effective for teens than individual therapy, because it can help address ineffective communication patterns within the family as well as offer ways for everyone to support the sufferer.
