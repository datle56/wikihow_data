When you soft launch a new relationship, you‚Äôre making it clear that you‚Äôre dating someone‚Äîbut keeping the deets to yourself. Your social media followers won‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre dating, how long you‚Äôve been together, or the exact nature of your relationship‚Äîbut they‚Äôll know your dating status has officially gone from ‚Äúsingle‚Äù to‚Ä¶something else. Over time, with more and more hints, your followers will realize you‚Äôre dating without you ever having to make a formal announcement. [1] X Research source Alternatively, to ‚Äúhard launch‚Äù a relationship involves making it explicit that you‚Äôre dating someone, directly naming your partner, and tagging them in your posts."

      "content": "Have the \"what are we?\" conversation before posting. The soft launch is for (subtly) sharing your relationship with the world‚Äînot for declaring your love to your partner. Before posting a photo of you holding your partner's hand and fielding the plethora of \"üëÄ\" comments, talk to your new paramour about the exact nature of your relationship to avoid any potential awkwardness if they don't feel the same way you do. [2] X Research source It can be an awkward conversation to have, but it's important to know where you two stand, so it's totally worth it. In fact, asking your partner what to post could be a good way to have the \"define the relationship\" convo : \"Babe, I was thinking of posting this photo of us, but I wanted to make sure we were on the same page first. Where do you see this thing headed?\""

      "content": "Discuss what you'll post with your partner. Your partner may not particularly care one way or the other how you announce to the world that you're newly involved, or they may prefer you introduce them to your social media audience in a specific manner. Maybe they even want to coordinate posts! Before launching your r-ship, bring up the subject to them casually and ask if they mind you posting or if they have any thoughts about what to post. Often, a person's attachment style will influence how they feel about what they or their partner shares on social media. [3] X Research source If you're dating someone with an anxious attachment style , they may prefer you to make it clear you're in a relationship‚Äîthis might mean soft launching them, but in a way that makes it clear you're \"off the market,\" or it might mean hard launching the relationship completely. If you're dating an avoidantly attached person , they may feel uncomfortable with you posting about them until more time has passed in your relationship. Or they may feel OK with a soft launch, as long as it's super soft‚Äîa-glimpse-of-their-elbow-from-the-edge-of-the-frame soft, even. Talk it over with your partner, but be sure not to completely give in to their preferences at the expense of your own. For example, if it's important to you to share that you're dating, but they don't want to, see if you can come to a compromise, such as posting a few weeks later than you'd like."

      "title": "Post about your relationship‚Äîbut avoid specific details.",
      "content": "Post about your relationship‚Äîbut avoid specific details. Think of the soft launch as a \"teaser\" for your relationship: make it clear you're no longer single, but don't share anything in your post that would allow viewers to identify who the post is about or the exact nature of the relationship. In other words, avoid clear photos of your new paramour, don't tag them in anything, and keep their name out of your posts‚Äîspecific identifiers like those officially turn a soft launch into a hard launch. On Instagram, a soft launch might involve posting a photo of your fingers intertwined with your new partner's, or a pic of them from behind so that their face is concealed. In text posts, such as on Twitter, soft launching might look like vaguely alluding to a new romantic relationship without making it clear who it‚Äôs about. Your soft launch can be as soft as you want: it might be as simple as sharing a photo of two dinner plates side by side, or a selfie in a strange new living room‚Äîanything that might make your friends and anyone following your profile closely say, \" Wait, what's going on?? \""

But just because you can tell all, doesn‚Äôt mean you necessarily want to. You may enjoy sharing certain parts of your daily life with your Instagram or TikTok following, but prefer to keep your new relationship more private. You may also want to respect your new partner‚Äôs privacy : if they‚Äôre not comfortable being on display on your social media, they may prefer you to soft launch your relationship so that they can avoid the spotlight."

You might consider announcing your dating status to the (virtual) world just one of many stages of a developing relationship, somewhere between becoming exclusive and saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù (or wherever feels right to you). It‚Äôs possible announcing the relationship too quickly will put unwanted pressure on you and/or your partner. The early stages of a relationship are for getting to know each other ‚Äîsomething you don‚Äôt want to do under the watchful eye of social media."

You and/or your partner may be slow to commit or simply uncertain if you‚Äôre ready to date, and that‚Äôs totally fine. While you figure out where your relationship is going , though, you don‚Äôt need social media staring you down. Plus, if you or your partner ultimately decides a relationship isn't in the stars, it can be a little awkward to come back from a hard launch. [4] X Research source"

There‚Äôs no ‚Äúright‚Äù way to introduce a new relationship to the world, so whether you‚Äôre soft launching or hard launching your relationship, don‚Äôt feel pressured to do it at a certain time or in a certain way. [5] X Research source Generally, if you've got any doubts about the relationship, hold off on soft launching. There's no rush, and once you've launched the relationship, it can be tricky (but not impossible) to un-launch."
