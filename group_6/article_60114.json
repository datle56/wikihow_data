      "title": "Learn the words of the Happy Birthday song.",
      "content": "Learn the words of the Happy Birthday song. Just like the tune, the words to the “Happy Birthday” song are very simple. There are two common versions people use, one that is personalized for the birthday person and another that is just general, for example if there is more than one birthday person. Depending on which version you choose, it is composed of either four or six total words sung over four lines. The first version’s lyrics are: Happy Birthday to you (slight pause), Happy Birthday to you (slight pause), Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday - Happy Birthday to you.” The second and more personalized version is: Happy Birthday to you (slight pause), Happy Birthday to you (slight pause), Happy Birthday dear (name of the birthday person) - Happy Birthday to you.”"

      "title": "Decide the context of the event.",
      "content": "Decide the context of the event. Are you singing to your ten-year-old daughter at a birthday party with a few other friends? You'll probably want to keep it simple. Are you singing alone to your husband or wife? Maybe you should sing more softly and romantically. Are you singing with a huge group to your father at his 80th birthday party? Maybe you guys should all practice, or at least decide when you are going to sing. It’s important to understand the context of your event so you can figure out what’s appropriate."

      "title": "Figure out the strengths and weaknesses of your voice.",
      "content": "Figure out the strengths and weaknesses of your voice. If you’ve got a deep voice, don’t try singing Happy Birthday in the traditional singsong way. Use your deep voice! Stay within your range and don’t try to hit the high notes. No one is expecting you to be an expert."

    {
      "title": "Practice singing the song alone.",
      "content": "Practice singing the song alone. Practicing often to yourself, for example at home, will allow you to work out any kinks that may be in your voice and also help you to remember the song. It will also allow you to add special flourishes to the song, like a “cha cha cha” after every line."

    {
      "title": "Practice with others.",
      "content": "Practice with others. If you’re performing with a group of other people it’s always a good idea to rehearse. Designate one person to act as the conductor and start on their cue. You don’t want to start at different times or end at different times. Otherwise, everyone should easily fall into line. If you’re singing with a group and you aren’t going to have time to practice before hand, don’t try doing anything special. It’s assumed that everyone knows the song."

    {
      "title": "Choose which version of the song you want to sing.",
      "content": "Choose which version of the song you want to sing. Pick one of the two traditional versions of the song that you want to sing for the person. If you are only singing to one or two people you should use the personalized version. If you’re singing at a school party to a whole group of people who had birthdays over the summer, use the less personalized version. If the person comes from a different country or is interested in languages, you could also use a version of “Happy Birthday” that’s been adapted into another language. For example, Germans sing the same song, but with German lyrics. They are: “Zum Geburtstag viel Glück! Zum Geburtstag viel Glück! Zum Geburtstag liebe ...(add the name of birthday person) Zum Geburtstag viel Glück!” [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine the correct time to sing. Generally you want to start singing happy birthday right before they cut the cake or whatever celebratory dish you are having. It could be before opening presents too. Try to figure out when you’re going to sing happy birthday ahead of time so that everyone is on the same page."

      "title": "Consider using an instrument.",
      "content": "Consider using an instrument. You could start off by playing one note on a piano or another instrument. Cue your listeners in that you’re about to start the song by playing one note on a piano. If you don’t have a piano where you’re singing, you can use another instrument. For example, recorders or harmonicas are great, simple, and easy instruments you can use to start off your song."
