      "content": "Its origins are disputed, but the phrase may come from Las Vegas casinos. In the late 1920s (the Depression Era in the United States), a chicken dinner from a casino cafeteria cost just under $2—and $2 was the standard bet for many gamblers. So, anyone who won a bet was effectively able to buy dinner that day, hence the phrase “Winner winner chicken dinner.” [2] X Research source Keep in mind this is only one of the possible origins of the term, though it’s still one of the most widespread theories."

This is because, supposedly, back-alley gambling rings were an easy way for down-on-their-luck people to win enough money for a chicken dinner. [3] X Research source Regardless of its specific origins, the phrase was most likely first coined in the late 1920s and has close ties to gambling."
