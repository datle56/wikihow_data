      "content": "The catsuit is a drag show staple. Catsuits are common attire among queens—it’s what a queen wears when she needs a complete, low-cost outfit—and will fit right in in the audience. Throw on some stilettos to elevate the look, and big hoop earrings to sparkle it up. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "A corset and leather pants are perfect for a drag show at a club. Most of the drag queens are probably wearing them beneath their outfits, but you can make an open-backed corset the star of your outfit. Wear it with or without a top, and pair it with leather pants and big jewelry for a chic, edgy outfit. [2] X Research source To go the full nine, wear a neon bob wig ."

      "content": "Animal prints are classic and reliable…for drag brunch, at least. They may fall in and out of fashion in the mainstream, but in drag, they’re always en vogue. A loose animal print top and skinny jeans are stylish but comfortable enough for brunch, and black pumps will complete the look and carry you through the day. [3] X Research source Add gold jewelry and a tight ponytail to dot your i’s and cross your t’s."

      "title": "Reel ‘em in with fishnets.",
      "content": "Reel ‘em in with fishnets. It’s just the right amount of sexy for a drag event at a bar or a club. A flirty pair of fishnet tights will go great under denim shorts, or throw a fishnet top under a simple T-shirt to add a bit of edge to an otherwise simple outfit. To really take it up a notch, add some knee-high boots to the ensemble."

      "title": "Opt for comfy-cute with a T-shirt and skinny jeans.",
      "content": "Opt for comfy-cute with a T-shirt and skinny jeans. You don’t have to go hard at every drag show (or any drag show, if you’re not feeling it). For things like drag brunches or drag storytimes, your reliable graphic or white T-shirt plus some skinny jeans sets the perfect, laid-back vibe. A Chelsea boot elevates the look just enough, and your favorite, flashy earrings add the appropriate amount of shine."

    {
      "title": "A button-up shirt and jeans is your go-to.",
      "content": "A button-up shirt and jeans is your go-to. No matter if the drag event is at a club or just a daytime cafe, this simple outfit is sensible and comfortable. Dress it up with some Oxfords if you’re feeling fancy, or dress it down with some white sneakers for a more casual look, for things like drag storytime. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Floral prints scream “drag brunch!” A floral print button-up shirt adds just enough color to fit in with the queens in the crowd, but doesn’t go too far overboard. They’re well-paired with some white chinos and brown Chelsea boots . [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear a blouse and makeup to lean into the drag scene.",
      "content": "Wear a blouse and makeup to lean into the drag scene. A white, women’s blouse (the bigger the sleeves, the better) plus some bold eyeliner walks the line between pirate and drag queen, which is a great line to walk. Black skinny jeans and Dr. Martens boots bring the whole look together, and some gold jewelry is icing on the cake."

      "title": "A T-shirt and jeans will do for a drag storytime.",
      "content": "A T-shirt and jeans will do for a drag storytime. If you’re headed to something a bit more lowkey, you can’t really go wrong with a simple graphic or white T-shirt and slim jeans, plus your go-to sneakers. These sorts of gatherings are less about your look and more about the drag queen doing casual comedy or reading a book, so the eyes are off you and on her. You can still spice it up with a nice watch or some showy earrings."

      "content": "Dress up… or don’t! The drag performers are the stars, but they like to see you shine, as well, whether that means donning that MET-worthy ballgown or throwing on that trusty T-shirt. Whatever will make you feel your fantasy. All that to say: there’s nothing you have to wear, and there’s not much that’s off-limits, either. Wear what you want, and wear what you want other people to see. That’s the spirit of drag. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Tailor your look to the type of drag show you’re going to.",
      "content": "Tailor your look to the type of drag show you’re going to. There are a number of different kinds of drag events: the traditional drag show, drag brunch, drag bingo, drag parades. You probably don’t want to wear that skimpy bralette to a cold outdoor event. On the other hand, the 7-inch heels might be a bit much for a sit-down brunch (but also, you do you). A good rule of thumb is to wear what you’d normally wear to that sort of event even if it wasn’t dragged-out, and then make it a little more fun. Also consider the age demographic of the show. A revealing outfit may not be appropriate for a drag reading at a library with children around, but it’s fair game for an 18+ show at a club or a bar."

      "content": "Check the venue’s dress code. Sometimes the venue will do much of the work for you and post a dress code beforehand for special or themed events. Check the venue’s website or facebook page for pointers. [7] X Research source If they don’t have a dress code for that particular event, they may have a more general dress code for the venue itself, regardless of the event showing that night."

      "title": "Tip the drag queens.",
      "content": "Tip the drag queens. And we’ll say it again: tip the queens (even if you paid a cover charge, and even if you already bought drinks)! Drag isn’t cheap, and the best way you can show your appreciation for a queen who’s giving it her all on-stage is by giving her your dollar bills. [8] X Research source Bring plenty of small bills, tip $1-$5 at a time (or more if you’re living for the queen), and hold ‘em high so the queen can reach ‘em. Never tuck money into a queen’s clothing or approach her on-stage to hand her a tip. Meet her halfway if she can’t reach you, but respect her personal and performance space."

      "title": "Clap, cheer, and make some noise.",
      "content": "Clap, cheer, and make some noise. Drag queens thrive on the audience’s energy, and it’s basic drag show etiquette to let a queen know when she’s serving. Don’t be afraid to hoot or even holler. The performer’s going all out to put on a show for you, so the least you could do is go all out with your applause. [9] X Research source That said, read the room. Drag comes in many forms, and it’s probably not appropriate to cause a ruckus if a drag queen is reading poetry or giving a dramatic monologue. Follow the lead of the other audience members. In addition, don’t boo. If you’re displeased, hold it in and wait for after to talk smack to your friends. This is a space for positivity and hype, and a sour mood can kill the vibe."

      "content": "Don’t touch the performers. It’s the cardinal sin of drag shows. Yes, they’re putting on a show and yes, they may come down into the audience and interact, but do please keep your hands to yourself. A drag performer often spends hours getting their hair, face, and outfit just right. You wouldn’t put your fingers on a Van Gogh, would you? Same for a drag performer. It’s an invasion of personal space, besides. Instead, clap, snap, and hold your dollar bills. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Refer to queens as “she” and drag kings as “he.” There’s a whole lot of gender expression going on, and we get that it can be a little confusing for people who are new to the scene. But as a general rule, someone presenting themselves as a woman or a queen is referred to as “she” (regardless of their gender on any other day), and someone presenting masculine or as a drag queen is “he.” Not sure? “They” will do just fine, at least until you learn which pronouns they prefer.

      "content": "Sit in the back if you don’t want to be involved in the show. Many drag queens interact with the audience or even pull them up on stage to speak. This often includes some light ribbing (or “reading,” as it’s known in the drag scene). If you’re shy or don’t want to be the receiver of some playful digs, position yourself near the back, where the queens are less likely to pick you out of the crowd. [12] X Research source"
