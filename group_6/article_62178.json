      "content": "The 🪑 emoji is usually just a chair. If you aren’t on TikTok, the chair emoji typically doesn’t carry any secondary meanings. It’s a household chair, and that’s how it’s typically used. [1] X Research source For example: “Do you still have that vintage 🪑 I like? I might take it off your hands.” “Where did you find that 🪑 in your living room?” “I’m going 🪑 shopping. Want to come along? I might get a new sofa, too.”"

      "title": "A 🪑 can refer to sitting down or taking it easy.",
      "content": "A 🪑 can refer to sitting down or taking it easy. People use chairs to take a load off of their feet, or sit down to eat, so the emoji can be used this way. You might say: “Let’s have a family dinner tonight. It’s been a while since we all 🪑 together.” “It’s been a long day. I can’t wait to just kick it 😌🌿🪑.” “I just want to 🪑. I’ve been on my feet all day.”"

      "title": "The 🪑 emoji means something is hilarious on TikTok.",
      "content": "The 🪑 emoji means something is hilarious on TikTok. What does a chair have to do with laughing, you ask? It’s a fair question. The chair emoji doesn’t really make sense in this situation (which is basically the joke). A TikTok user had the idea to spam popular Youtuber KSI with the 🪑 emoji instead of using the 😂 (laughing) emoji and it took off! [2] X Research source Think of the “🪑” like “lol” or “haha.” You might say: “I’m dying 🪑 🪑 🪑” or, “Hilarious 🪑 🪑 🪑 🪑.” If this seems confusing, that’s because it’s supposed to be. The goal with the 🪑 is to often troll people who aren’t in on the joke."

      "content": "The 💺 (seat) emoji resembles the seating on trains and airplanes. While the 🪑 just looks like a standard kitchen table chair, the 💺 emoji looks more like the kind of seating you’d find on a train, plane, or bus. [3] X Research source You might see someone say: “Did you check in for our flight? I want a window 💺.” “I can’t wait for our trip! ✈️💺” “Should we fly or catch a train? I want to save on travel, tbh 💺.”"

      "title": "Use the 🪑 to refer to actual furniture.",
      "content": "Use the 🪑 to refer to actual furniture. If you’re referencing actual chairs, go ahead and throw a 🪑 emoji in there to spice your message up a bit. For example, you might say: “I want a new set of 🪑 for the dining room when we move.” “Want to go antiquing? I’m trying to find a cool 🪑.” “Hey, I really like your accent 🪑. Where did you buy it?”"

      "content": "Send a 🪑 when you talk about sitting or seating. If you want to talk about taking a load off of your feet, or you’re sending a message that has anything to do with seating plans or sitting, you can use a 🪑. You could say: “Once we lock down the venue, we can talk about the 🪑 plans.” “I’m trying to just relax tonight. Want to 🪑 and drink some 🍺?” “I can’t wait to get off of my feet and chill 🪑.”"

People may not understand you if they don’t follow KSI or they’ve never seen this meme, but the folks who know will totally get it! [4] X Research source You could use it as a response, like: “Absolutely unbelievable!!! 🪑 🪑 🪑” “I’m losing it over here 🪑 🪑 🪑” “🪑”"

This is a fun way to play up what is often the part of a trip people don’t look forward to! You could say: “I can’t wait for our ✈️! I hope I get a window seat 💺.” “I’m going to have some champagne before we land 💺. I’m so excited!” “You ready to get moving? It’s time to 💺!”"
