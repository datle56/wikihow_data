If you are unsure, you should check with a doctor or nurse. [1] X Research source Signs that it is a problem needing quick attention can include any or a combination of the following: extreme pain, a lot of bleeding, signs of shock (such as cold, sweaty skin, feeling cold, or paleness of skin and appearance). [2] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source You know a cut is through the skin if you can see fat (yellow-tan, lumpy tissue), muscle (deep-red, stringy tissue), or bone (tan-white, hard surface). However, any cut that is more than three centimeters long or 1/2 inch deep requires medical attention. If a cut does not go all the way through the skin, it does not need stitches, and can be cared for at home."

If you believe your cut needs emergency medical attention, there are a few things you can do to care for the wound before traveling to the emergency room. Quickly rinse the wound under water to wash away any loose debris or dirt. Try to wipe any debris or dirt away from the injury site first with sterile gauze to ensure that the water does not wash the debris into the wound. Next, apply pressure with a clean cloth or bandage and continue to hold pressure as you get transported to the emergency room. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source The wound will get cleaned again when you see your doctor to make sure it is thoroughly disinfected. If the wound is large and bleeding a lot, try to wrap the area with a towel or bandage, then continue to apply pressure. As you travel, try to position the wound above the level of the heart to reduce severe bleeding.

If glass or debris is lodged in the wound, you can do more damage by trying to remove it yourself. Also, do not attempt to sew or glue the wound shut, as household products can cause infection and/or prevent healing. Do not use rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine to clean the cut, as it can slow healing.

[16] X Research source Shock can also be a life-threatening issue. If the patient is in shock, keep him or her warm and relaxed as possible. Symptoms of shock include pale, cold, clammy skin, disorientation, and decreased alertness.

If your cut is deep, wide, or jagged, your doctor may decide that you need stitches (a.k.a. sutures) or staples for it to heal well. When a doctor stitches or staples a cut, he or she will first clean the cut and give you numbing medicine by injecting it around the wound. After the doctor completes the stitches, he or she will dress the cut with a bandage or gauze. Stitches use a sterile surgical needle and thread to join the edges of a cut together. They can be absorbable, and dissolve over time, or non-absorbable, and will need to be removed after the wound heals. Staples used on cuts are special surgical staples that perform the same task at stitches and must be removed like non-absorbable stitches."

To do this: [21] X Research source Keep your stitches or staples dry and covered with a bandage for several days. The doctor should tell you how long this should be. It is usually one to three days depending on the type of stitches and the size of the wound. Once you can get them wet, gently wash the wound over the stitches or staples with soap and water when you shower. Do not submerge the wound underwater, like in a bath or when swimming. Too much water can slow down healing and result in infection. After washing the area, pat it dry and apply antibiotic ointment.
