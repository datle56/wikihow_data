      "content": "Sparks fly instantly between Leo and Aries. Their sexual preferences line up almost perfectly; they're both energetic, bold, and adventurous in the bedroom. Leo and Aries can have the most fun when they're together because Aries is direct and non-judgemental, so Leo will feel totally free to be themselves. They both want sex to be passionate and fun, and together they'll get what they want. Zodiac signs form different aspects with each other on the zodiac wheel chart, which can predict their compatibility. Leo and Aries form a trine aspect, so they're 4 signs apart on the zodiac—and a naturally strong match. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Intimacy always feels exciting between Aquarius and Leo. Aquarius is so cerebral that they need a partner who will prioritize getting physical, and Leo—a sign that speaks to the body—can do exactly that. Aquarius's willingness to think outside the box will blend well with Leo's passion and creativity in the bedroom. Aquarius and Leo are opposites on the zodiac wheel, or 6 signs apart. That means there's a powerful attraction between them, although they may also have some tension. Leo tends to love roleplay, and Aquarius is a great partner for Leo to experiment with. Aquarius's liberated attitude will appeal to Leo's fearless nature, so they'll have tons of chemistry."

      "content": "Gemini and Leo will never run out of fun ideas in the bedroom. Leo is friendly, generous, and extremely affectionate, which Gemini will love! Gemini is clever and charming, which Leo will find irresistible. Gemini can use their smooth-talking skills to woo Leo in the bedroom, and Leo's creativity will ensure that curious Gemini never gets bored. Leo and Gemini are a sextile aspect, so they're 2 signs apart on the zodiac wheel and can quickly form an easy, comfortable connection. [2] X Research source A Gemini partner is uniquely qualified to stroke Leo's ego with their evolved conversation skills. When Leo feels appreciated, they're the most loyal and passionate sexual partners!"

      "content": "Few signs match Leo's passion as well as Sagittarius can. They both have vibrant, playful energy; Leo makes the sex feel intense and thrilling, while Sagittarius fires up their shared sex life by coming up with new things to try and places to be intimate. Leo may need more romance than Sagittarius is used to in the bedroom, but easygoing Sagittarius is happy to adjust sometimes. Sagittarius and Leo are 4 signs apart on the zodiac and form a trine, so they have red-hot sexual compatibility with one another. If Leo goes all out in the bedroom (which they're usually inclined to do anyway), they can make sure Sagittarius keeps coming back for more."

      "content": "Libra and Leo both live for romance and drama during intimacy. This pair will pull out all the stops: wine, flowers, candles, and more. Libra's passive energy may put Leo off at first, but once they start getting close, Leo can discover the true warmth and passion of a Libra native. Underneath their detached exterior, Libra is an energetic lover who will love Leo's naturally affectionate nature. Leo and Libra are also sextile signs, so they'll feel a strong and immediate connection to one another. Libra is also ruled by Venus, the planet of love and pleasure. This sign loves to flirt, and Leo is a natural flirt too. Leo will eagerly match Libra's energy and quickly turn up the heat between them."

      "title": "Two Leos may appreciate each other but get competitive in the bedroom.",
      "content": "Two Leos may appreciate each other but get competitive in the bedroom. Because two Leos will generally have the same standards and expectations of their sex life, they'll be able to fulfill one another's needs very well. However, Leo can also be a little selfish during intimacy and wants to be the center of attention—so two Leos might get into a power struggle at times. Two Leos form a conjunct, meaning they're the same sign. In astrology, a conjunct can be good for compatibility, as matching signs will create a powerful bond with one another. Leo partners can enjoy a satisfying sex life if they learn to share the spotlight and give one another the royal treatment they deserve."

      "title": "Leo and Taurus have sexual chemistry despite their different values.",
      "content": "Leo and Taurus have sexual chemistry despite their different values. Taurus wants comfort and stability while Leo wants excitement, leading to some clashes in their intimacy. However, Taurus is ruled by Venus, so this sign has a huge soft spot for all the affection that Leo can give them. They also share a love of the finer things that can make intimacy between these signs feel sensual and luxurious. Leo and Taurus are 3 signs apart on the zodiac wheel, forming a square angle. In astrology, this means there may be tension between the two signs. Slow-moving Taurus often matches best with a partner whose drive and passion can keep the relationship moving. Leo is ideally suited to do just that! Leo and Taurus are incredibly stubborn, which can backfire in the bedroom. Leo wants to be in charge, but Taurus refuses to be bossed around. This couple will need to compromise to find stability! [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Virgo's primal side blends well with Leo's sexual preferences.",
      "content": "Virgo's primal side blends well with Leo's sexual preferences. Virgo is usually more cautious and reserved than passionate Leo but can come out of their shell in the bedroom. Virgo is also supportive and loves to be of service, which is appealing to Leo. Though Virgo can nitpick, Leo's impeccable grooming and hygiene will turn Virgo on and appease their inner perfectionist. [4] X Research source Leo and Virgo are semisextile, or 1 sign apart on the zodiac wheel. Semisextile signs in astrology tend to have very different qualities, leading to friction between them. Leo may not recognize Virgo's desire for emotional support during intimacy and may have to adjust their style to make Virgo more comfortable. Leo should listen to Virgo's needs and make them feel heard."

      "title": "Scorpio and Leo can have an explosive sex life—intense but volatile.",
      "content": "Scorpio and Leo can have an explosive sex life—intense but volatile. While Scorpio has enough sexual passion to match Leo, they have emotional differences that can cause friction. Leo wants to be pampered during intimacy, while Scorpio's wild side makes them a little rough for Leo's taste. At the same time, Leo and Scorpio might be more attracted to one another because of their differences. Leo and Scorpio are 3 signs apart on the zodiac wheel, forming a square aspect. This suggests they may be prone to power struggles during intimacy. Scorpio and Leo are both fixed signs, which works well for them in the bedroom. They're driven and like to finish what they start, so they'll put their best effort into intimacy."

      "title": "Cancer and Leo don't have much raw chemistry, but they can find harmony.",
      "content": "Cancer and Leo don't have much raw chemistry, but they can find harmony. Cancer is loving and considerate but doesn't have the adventurous spirit in the bedroom that Leo tends to admire. However, Leo can help Cancer try new things and explore their sexual side a little more, while Cancer can use their nurturing and attentive nature to make Leo feel adored during intimacy. Cancer and Leo are next to each other on the zodiac and, therefore, semisextile. They won't have much in common, which leads to tension between them. Though they show emotions differently, both Leo and Cancer want sex to be an emotional experience. Their intimacy will be intensely satisfying if Leo is sensitive to Cancer's feelings and if Cancer lets Leo take the lead and be creative."

      "title": "Leo and Pisces may struggle to understand each other.",
      "content": "Leo and Pisces may struggle to understand each other. Both signs love romance, but Pisces may have expectations that Leo finds unrealistic, while Leo's directness can cause an elusive Pisces to retreat. However, sex between a Leo and Pisces can also be sensual and passionate; both have strong imaginations and love to indulge in roleplay. Leo and Pisces form a quincunx aspect, meaning they're 5 signs apart on the zodiac. This awkward aspect predicts discord between the two signs, although they can work together if they both make adjustments. To have a fulfilling sex life, Leo and Pisces may actually need to put off intimacy for a while and work on building emotional trust first. Once they're comfortable with one another, they can have the physical closeness that they crave."

      "content": "Capricorn and Leo must work hard to have a happy sex life. Leo is warm and enthusiastic, whereas Capricorn is practical, and they'll have trouble overcoming their perceived differences. Even though they're loving at heart, Capricorn may not give Leo the constant attention they crave. Still, Leo can appreciate Capricorn's endurance in bed, and Capricorn will enjoy being on the receiving end of Leo's adoration. Leo and Capricorn are also a quincunx aspect, or 5 signs apart on the zodiac. They may find it difficult to be together, but they can also learn a lot from one another if they persevere. The best thing Leo can do is stick around long enough to see past Capricorn's tight-laced persona. It's easy to assume this sign would be boring in bed, but Capricorn can be adventurous and energetic!"
