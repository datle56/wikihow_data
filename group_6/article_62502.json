      "title": "Check the batteries in your Wii Remote.",
      "content": "Check the batteries in your Wii Remote. If the batteries in your Wii Remote have died, the remote won't work properly. The remote also may not work as intended if the batteries are low, but not entirely dead. Remove the backplate on your Wii Remote and remove the old batteries, then insert new ones. You can use rechargeable batteries in your Wii Remote to cut down on battery waste. Just make sure you have at least 2 sets of rechargeable batteries per Wii Remote so you'll always have batteries available."

      "title": "Check your Wii Remote battery contacts.",
      "content": "Check your Wii Remote battery contacts. Make sure your batteries are inserted correctly and look for damage or corrosion on the battery contacts. Corrosion can cause interference with the battery's connection, leading to limited or no power going to the device. If there is corrosion on the battery contacts, you can try to remove it . If your Wii Remote is very corroded, removing the corrosion may not be safe or your Wii Remote might be further damaged. In this case, replacing the remote is a better option."

      "content": "Move closer to your TV so you're in the sensor bar range. You should be about 3 to 8 feet away from the sensor bar for your Wii Remote to work properly. [1] X Research source If you're too far away, your Wii Remote won't work. You also may be too close to your TV. If you're under 3 feet away from your TV, try stepping back a little bit to see if that helps with the remote's connection."

      "title": "Look for bright lights shining on your TV screen or sensor bar.",
      "content": "Look for bright lights shining on your TV screen or sensor bar. Bright lights shining on your TV or on the Wii sensor bar can interfere with your remote's ability to interact with the TV. If your TV is near a window, try blocking out the sunlight with a curtain or window blinds. If the bright light is from a lamp or light, turn off that light until you're done gaming. Infrared light such as heaters, candle or fireplace flames, or stoves can also interfere with your Wii Remote. Turn these off or block the light from shining near your TV or sensor bar if you can."

      "title": "Check out your sensor bar for damage or placement issues.",
      "content": "Check out your sensor bar for damage or placement issues. The sensor bar should be placed either above or below the television. If there are issues with your sensor bar's placement or connection, or the sensor bar (or its cable) are damaged, this can cause your Wii Remote to not work. [2] X Research source Your sensor bar should be aligned with the front of the TV if placed on top of it, or aligned with the edge of the surface the TV is sitting on if placed below it. Make sure the sensor bar is plugged into the sensor bar port on the back of your Wii. Check the sensor bar cable for damage. If it's damaged, you'll need to get a replacement from Nintendo. Use a camera with an LCD screen to check if the sensor bar is working. Look at the sensor bar through the camera, and you should see 5 infrared lights on each side of the bar. If your device has infrared filtering (such as on a phone), you may need to use the front-facing camera. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Delete your Wii Remote syncs on your Wii console, then re-sync the remote. Sometimes, sync connections can stop working properly. Re-syncing your Wii Remote to the console will refresh this connection. Turn on your Wii console and wait until the Health & Safety screen appears, but don't press any buttons to move past this screen. Open the flap on the front of your Wii, then press and hold the red SYNC button for 15 seconds. This will clear all Wii Remote syncs. [4] X Research source Re-sync your Wii Remote by removing the backplate and pressing and releasing the SYNC button on the remote. When the LED light on the front of the remote is blinking, press and release the red SYNC button on the console. When the LED on the remote stops blinking, the sync has been completed. [5] X Research source Some models of the Wii Remote have a hole in the backplate with a tool on the wrist strap to press the SYNC button. You won't need to remove the backplate if you have this model of Wii Remote."

      "content": "Make sure your Wii Remote is a licensed Nintendo product. Off-brand or third-party controllers may not work properly with your Wii. If your Wii Remote suddenly stops working or has never worked properly, check if it's a licensed product and replace it with an official Nintendo Wii Remote if not. To check if your Wii Remote is licensed, look for the model number printed on the bottom where accessories plug in. The original Wii Remote has the model number RVL 003 and the Wii Remote Plus has the model number RVL 036 ."

If your Wii Remote isn't completely dead but isn't working properly, you may need to recalibrate your Wii Remote Plus or Wii Remote with a WiiMotion Plus accessory. Start a game that uses WiiMotion Plus. If a game uses WiiMotion Plus, it'll have an icon on the box of a Wii Remote with a WiiMotion Plus accessory at the bottom. Place your Wii Remote Plus or Wii Remote with a WiiMotion Plus accessory on a flat, horizontal surface with the buttons facing down. After 10 seconds, pick up the remote and try using it again.

If the pointer lens is dirty or covered in residue, it can make your Wii Remote not work properly. Wipe off any dirt with a soft cloth. You can use an electronics cleaning wipe to gently clean sticky or stuck-on residue. If there is sticker residue on the pointer lens, use masking tape to remove it. Wrap some masking tape around your first two fingers with the sticky side facing out, then gently press it against the pointer lens to lift away sticky residue. [7] X Research source"

Take a (new) soft toothbrush and gently brush around the gap between the Wii Remote buttons and the casing. If the buttons are very sticky, you can use warm water and a little mild soap to clean underneath them. Remove the batteries from your Wii Remote, then get the toothbrush slightly damp with warm soapy water, and brush around the buttons. Dry immediately with a paper towel."

If one or no dots appear on the sensitivity screen but you've verified that your sensor bar is working with the camera method, then there is a good chance the issue lies with your Wii Remote."

While this doesn't necessarily fix anything, it can help you determine if the issue is with your Wii Remote or your console itself. If a different Wii Remote doesn't work, then the issue is likely with your console. If a different Wii Remote works and no other troubleshooting methods have fixed the issue, you likely need to replace your Wii Remote. If you are tech savvy, keep reading to learn how you can potentially fix some of these issues yourself."

If you have done some electronics repair in the past, you can likely check this yourself. Remove the batteries from your Wii Remote, then remove the four screws that connect the back of the remote to the front. Using a prying tool, gently apply pressure to the tabs on the left side of the remote. These tabs are breakable, but if they break the remote will still work. Once the tabs are disconnected, open the front of the remote like a book. Using a clean, dry, new toothbrush, gently brush over the contact in the upper-right corner where the power button connects to the motherboard. Put the front cover back on, snapping it gently into place, then replace the screws, batteries, and back cover."

Replacing the motherboard isn't difficult, but it's best done only if you've done electronics repair before.

Using a prying tool, gently apply pressure to the tabs on the left side of the remote. These tabs are breakable, but if they break the remote will still work. Once the tabs are disconnected, open the front of the remote like a book. Using your finger, push up on the connector port at the bottom of the remote and lift the motherboard up slightly. Grasp the sides of the motherboard and pull it out of the casing. Replace the motherboard by setting the new one into the casing. Put the front cover back on, snapping it gently into place, then replace the screws, batteries, and back cover."
