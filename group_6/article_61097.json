      "content": "In this game, players slap each other with tortillas and try not to laugh. The Tortilla Challenge is a viral TikTok video trend that was popularized throughout 2021 and 2022. In the standard version of the game, players hold water in their mouths and play Rock, Paper, Scissors to determine who gets to slap the other person across the face with a tortilla. The first person to spit out their water loses. [1] X Research source The Tortilla Challenge is usually played by two people, though it is possible to play with a larger group. As the standard version of the game became popular, people began creating alternate versions. Another popular version is the Tortilla Question Challenge, in which players take turns asking their opponent questions about themselves. If their opponent gets the question wrong, they get slapped."

      "content": "Grab two flour tortillas. While it’s still possible to play the Tortilla Challenge with corn tortillas, most people prefer to use flour, as they’re sturdier and less likely to break when you slap someone with them. Each player will use one tortilla to slap the other player, though it may be a good idea to have some extra tortillas on hand in case one does break too quickly. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Play Rock, Paper, Scissors to see who gets to slap whom. Unlike a lot of games, you don’t necessarily take turns when playing the Tortilla Challenge. Whoever wins the Rock, Paper, Scissors match gets to slap the other player with a tortilla. Even if they win two, three, or multiple times in a row, they still get to slap the other person. [4] X Research source For example, if you win Rock, Paper, Scissors 3 times in a row, you’d get to slap the other player 3 times. If they win the next round, they get to slap you. Before slapping each other, discuss how hard you’re willing to be hit. While getting hit with a tortilla generally won’t hurt as much as getting slapped by a hand, it still won’t feel good! By discussing boundaries beforehand, you’ll avoid injuries or arguments."

      "content": "Try not to spit out your water to win. The Tortilla Challenge is essentially a more elaborate Try Not to Laugh Challenge. A player may spit out their water when they get slapped with the tortilla or because they’re laughing at the person getting slapped. Either way, your goal is to keep the water in your mouth longer than your opponent to win. [5] X Research source Feel free to play as many rounds as you want. There’s no set “end” to the Tortilla Challenge."

      "content": "Get two tortillas and face your opponent. Like the standard Tortilla Challenge, most players choose to use flour tortillas because they’re sturdier than corn tortillas, though any kind of tortilla will work. Then, either stand or sit facing your opponent, close enough to be able to slap them with the tortilla. [6] X Research source It may be a good idea to have some extra tortillas nearby in case one breaks. This version of the game doesn’t involve water at all, so it’s a good option if you want to play without getting wet!"

      "content": "Take turns asking the other player questions about yourself. Unlike the original Tortilla Challenge, this version is played in turns. Play Rock, Paper, Scissors or use a method of your choosing to decide who goes first. Think of a bunch of trivia questions about yourself to ask your opponent. The goal of the game is to see who knows the other person better. [7] X Research source For example, ask them what your favorite color, movie, or song is. If you want, ask more obscure questions as the game progresses to make it more challenging. For example, ask your opponent what street you grew up on or which episode of a certain TV show is your favorite. To play fair, make sure you’ve actually told your opponent the answer before."

If they get the question wrong, they do not earn a point and you get to slap them across the face with the tortilla. The same rules apply to you. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Whoever gets the most questions correct wins. To determine a winner, it may be helpful to determine a set number of questions each player gets to ask (for example, 10 questions each). Keep a tally of how many points each player scores and count them up at the end to see who wins. Alternatively, play until one of you reaches a certain score. For example, the first person to earn 10 points wins."
