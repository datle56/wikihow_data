      "content": "Send a photo of yourself puckering up. If you don’t want to send a digital avatar to convey a kiss, use the more traditional method of taking a picture of yourself puckering up or making a “kiss face.” Taking a selfie is usually the best way to do this. [3] X Research source Try different poses and angles until you find one you like. Simply make the kiss face or hold your hand out like you’re blowing a kiss. Take several photos so you can choose the best one to send as a kiss. If you’re struggling to take a picture you like, use your phone camera’s timer so that you can properly position yourself for the picture."

      "content": "Send “xoxo” for an old-fashioned kiss. In the days before texting, people commonly used the letters “xo” to represent hugs (o) and kisses (x). Use this simple, traditional, and universally recognized message to send someone a kiss. [5] X Research source Most people use “xoxo” at the end of messages, but use it wherever you want in your text message. If you want to let someone know you’re thinking about them, you can even send “xoxo” as a standalone message. Alternatively, some people use x’s alone at the end of their message to represent kisses. For example, you might say “Miss you x” with the x representing the kiss. Some believe the number of x’s you include in a text mean different things. For example, you might use one x when talking to a friend, 2 x’s when talking to a best friend, and 3 or more x’s when talking to a partner."

      "content": "Send a quote or flirty message about kissing. If you prefer words to pictures, another option is to send your partner or the person you’re flirting with a quote about kissing. This may not always flow as naturally as some of the other options, so make sure it won’t confuse the person you’re texting or make things awkward before sending one. Here are some examples of what you could say: [7] X Research source “Your lips are so irresistible I can’t help but steal a kiss or two.” “Can you feel that tingle? That’s my lips whispering sweet nothings to yours.” “Your lips are my favorite addiction. I’m helplessly addicted to your kisses.” “May my virtual kiss reach your lips and bring you love and happiness.”"
