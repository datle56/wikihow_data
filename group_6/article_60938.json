      "content": "Purchase a tincture of iodine. If you don’t already have an iodine solution at home, you will need to purchase a tincture of iodine. These are available at most pharmacies and drug stores, as well as online. [2] X Research source While most iodine solutions have an orange tint, some are clear. Be sure to buy an orange solution so that it shows up on your skin. You may need to ask for it at the counter since iodine is sometimes kept behind the counter or in a glass case."

      "content": "Apply the iodine in a 2 in (5.1 cm) square on your forearm. Using a cotton swab, create a full square of iodine on your inner forearm. The square doesn’t need to be precise in terms of shape or dimensions, but it should be conspicuous. If you do not want to put the iodine on your forearm, you could also put it on your abdomen or inner thigh. Be sure to let the iodine dry for at least 20 minutes before covering it or letting it touch anything since it will stain."

      "content": "Monitor the iodine for 24 hours to watch for any color fading. Check the patch every 3 or so hours to monitor how long it takes to disappear. If the patch is still fully visible after 24 hours, you likely don’t have a deficiency. If the patch disappears or fades significantly over 24 hours, you may have a minor to moderate iodine deficiency If the patch disappears in under 18 hours, you may have a moderate to severe iodine deficiency."

      "content": "See a doctor for diagnostic testing. The iodine patch test can help indicate if there may be a deficiency, but it’s far from a diagnostic test. If your patch test indicated that you may have a deficiency, see your doctor for a proper diagnostic test and management options. [3] X Research source Depending on the severity of your symptoms, you may want to consult with your doctor even if your test didn't indicate a deficiency. Especially if you notice you have an enlarged thyroid, it’s time to make an appointment with your doctor. Blood or urine tests for iodine are both more accurate."

      "title": "Make a doctor’s appointment.",
      "content": "Make a doctor’s appointment. Your doctor is the one who can order an iodine blood test, so you will need to make an appointment with them. Typically, your doctor will order an iodine test in conjunction with other tests for things like thyroid hormone without you having to ask. If you think you have a need for an iodine test, though, ask your doctor. [4] X Research source Blood tests for iodine are the most accurate, but take longer to get the results. [5] X Research source Before the day of your test, talk to your doctor about any medications you are currently taking. Iodine blood tests typically don’t have a fasting requirement. Your doctor may order multiple tests for one appointment, though, so check with them to see if you need to fast prior to testing."

In most cases, though, you will have to go to the lab at or associated with your doctor’s office to get your blood taken. For an iodine test by itself, you will generally only have one vacutainer tube taken."

Your doctor should call you once they have your test results. Don’t hesitate to ask them any questions you may have regarding your test results once they are in.

Even if you get a blood test, you will still need the assessment of a doctor to determine if you actually have iodine deficiency."

Your doctor will also provide you with information on how to store your samples safely until you drop them off for analysis. If you are collecting one sample, you may only need to pee in one cup. If you are collecting multiple samples, you will generally use sterile cups to collect the urine, then pour it into your collection container. If you are collecting samples for a 24 hour period, be sure to collect the first urine after you wake up the next day, too."

The lab will check the samples to see how much iodine you have excreted over the course of a day. Most people excrete the majority of the iodine they take in during a day. If you have an iodine deficiency, though, you will absorb more. The lower the iodine in your urine, the more of a deficiency you have.

Your doctor will be able to talk to you about your symptoms and how they relate to your results. If you do have an iodine deficiency, they can help you come up with a management plan.
