Deep down, you’re longing to return to a happier time in your life—often a memory from your childhood, teenage, or young adult years. You may also be returning to a familiar place (your childhood home or your old school, for example). This card represents playfulness, goodwill, and protection; you may have children or be taking care of them at the moment. The 6 of Cups encourages you to reconnect to your past and cherish happy memories without living in them entirely.

      "content": "The Reversed 6 of Cups represents maturity and stagnation. If you see the Reversed 6 of Cups, you may be clinging too hard to the past. It’s comforting to relive happy memories and enjoy the security of your childhood home, but this card also cautions that it’s time to follow your own path in life. Use your past as a guide, but learn to recognize when you’re living in the past and refocus on the present. Alternatively, this card may signify that you’re disconnected from your childhood self (and the dreams you had as a child). [2] X Research source Common keywords: Stuck in the past, moving forward, leaving home, independence, maturity, forgiveness, lack of playfulness, boredom, and stagnation. You may feel like you failed to achieve your childhood goals, but the 6 of Cups reminds you that they may have been unrealistic. Growing up allows you to make more realistic goals and take action (rather than simply daydreaming). The Reversed 6 of Cups may indicate that you’re maturing. If you live at your childhood home, it means you’re ready to leave and go your own way . If you’re doing therapy, the 6 of Cups can be a very positive omen, indicating that you’re working through issues and are ready for a new beginning. In some cases, the 6 of Cups may represent overcoming abuse, but this often depends on the other supporting cards that appear in the tarot spread."

      "content": "Reversed In a love tarot spread, the Reversed 6 of Cups is a warning that you may be preoccupied with a past relationship, and it’s preventing you from opening yourself up to love with someone new. You may even feel like you’ll never love anyone else the same way. The 6 of Cups encourages you to reject this line of thinking; it’s unfair to yourself and future partners, and you may only be remembering the happy memories and not the turbulent ones. So, try to let go of this old relationship and explore the future ahead of you! [4] X Research source If you’re single: You’re still looking at an old relationship through rose-tinted glasses, so remind yourself that the relationship ended for a reason. You’re almost ready to put the past behind you and move on , so focus on doing just that. If you’re in a relationship: You may feel like your relationship has stagnated or that there’s no passion left. The relationship feels secure, but a little boring as well. However, it’s possible to rekindle the spark between you and your partner. Let them know that you’d like to shake things up and make an effort to do more spontaneous, exciting things together."

On the other hand, if you feel ready to discard old spiritual traditions and try new ones, go for it. You aren’t obligated to uphold old practices simply because they’re considered traditional. Your spiritual beliefs should appeal to you."
