      "content": "Girls sometimes don't like emojis that are sexually suggestive. According to experts, girls typically don’t like receiving these kinds of texts too early in a relationship. Play it safe by avoiding emojis like the 🍆 or 🍑 that are often associated with sex until you get to know a girl better. Wait until you’re sure she’ll like it. [3] X Research source The 🍆 represents a penis in text speak, and a 🍑 represents a butt. In addition to the 🍆 and 🍑 emojis, avoid combinations like 💦+👅, 👉+👌, 👉+🍩, or 🌭+🌮. All of these combinations are used to represent sex acts. Similarly, the 😈 emoji and 💦 emoji are a bad choice since they’re typically interpreted as “naughty.” [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid emojis when sending an opening message on a dating app. It’s really tricky to get emojis right in an opening message. Unfortunately, women get a ton of messages through dating apps, so they often have a hard time figuring out which guys to message back. In some cases, they may perceive an emoji as low effort or too suggestive. Get the conversation going before you start including emojis. [10] X Research source Try: “Hi, I see we’re both avid readers. What are you reading right now?” “Cool piano pic! How long have you been playing? “Your dog is almost as cute as you! Does he know any tricks?” “Serious question: Does pepperoni belong on a charcuterie plate?”"

However, this is easily misinterpreted as disinterest or lack of attention. Use emojis to enhance what you’re saying not as a full response. [11] X Research source For instance, let’s say your girl texted you, “I can’t wait to see you at the game tonight!” Don’t just text back a thumbs up. Instead, text, “Can’t wait to see you, too! 😀” Similarly, she might have texted, “What did you think about my new top?” Don’t just send a heart eyes emoji. Instead, say, “You looked amazing! 😍”"
