      "content": "Use a funny or cheeky version of the usual \"what's up?\" Shake it up if you just want to check in with your texting partner (but you're tired of the same old conversation starter). [1] X Research source There are plenty of phrases along the lines of \"what's up\" that are still more entertaining. Have fun with it, and try a goofy question like: \"Hey! What's cooking?\" \"Hey, Einstein! Still cracking the old theory?\" \"How's life been sailing lately? ⛵️\" \"What's the word, hummingbird?! 😊\""

Find a meme, video, or funny social media post you think your texting partner would like.

Whether you take a photo of the view outside your window or your pet being particularly cute, you can wordlessly show the other person what you're up to and prompt them to talk about their day. \"Check out this insane coffee art! ☕️ Where's your fave place to get coffee??\" \"Found the coolest little park on my run! Have you ever been here?\" \"OMG, my cat is being too cute this morning. I hope your morning has been just as delightful! 😊\""

      "content": "Share little things that show the other person who you are. Songs and music are a great way to help someone get to know you, but you could also mention a tv show, book, or another fun activity. Ask them what they think of each cool song or movie you text them about, and for a recommendation in return. Over time, you'll learn more about one another's tastes. \"I heard this on the radio, and I thought you might like it. Thoughts?\" \"WHOA. The new BTS music video is 🔥, check it out!!\" \"Just finished watching The Batman , and I feel like it's your kind of movie. Have you checked it out yet?\""

      "content": "Emojis can perk up a boring text message and make it visually interesting. They can also add extra emotion and depth to your message; \"What's up? 😊\" feels much more inviting than \"What's up?\" with the only difference being one simple emoji. Add emojis to your opening text, or take it a step further and send a text with only emojis—giving the other person a fun message to decipher. [2] X Research source \"You'll NEVER guess what happened today! 🍿🤏😯\" \"Good morning, ☀️! What do you have planned today? 😉🧡\" \"❓⬆️\" and \"❓👆\" can both mean \"what's up?\" in emoji-speak."

      "content": "Use a GIF to say hello and entertain your texting buddy. Like emojis, GIFs add color and whimsy to an otherwise plain text message. Rather than texting \"what's up,\" text the other person a GIF to get their attention. Select a GIF you think they'd laugh at or a GIF relating to one of your mutual interests (a TV show or movie, for example.) Alternatively, there are tons of GIFs with \"what's up\" text pasted over a goofy video clip. Pick one of those and send it to someone so they know you want to chat! If you want to be a little flirty and funny, send the classic Friends GIF of Joey saying, \"How you doin'?\""

When you discuss a common interest, it's easier for the other person to text you back—and because they're passionate about it, they'll probably text you back as soon as possible. You're also showing them that you remember the things you've learned about them, which would make anyone feel good about themselves. \"Hey! Are you watching the Packers game this weekend?\" \"Did you see the news? There's gonna be another season of Criminal Minds ! We've got to watch it together 😆\" \"We should hit up an amusement park soon! You're the only person I know as passionate about roller coasters as I am. 😍\""
