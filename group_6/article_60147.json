Your left side is the preferred side, but either side is fine. [2] X Research source Bend your knees and place a pillow between your legs. As your pregnancy advances, you may find additional relief from placing a pillow behind your back. Try using extra pillows to prop your head up if you are having trouble with indigestion or heartburn during the night. Try placing a small pillow beneath your abdomen, in addition to the one between your knees, if you are having trouble with back pain."

      "content": "Relax your hands. Place your hands in a neutral position as you get comfortable to fall asleep. Relax your hands and be sure your wrists are not bent at all. If possible, rest your hand and wrist on a pillow slightly higher than your chest. Be sure this is a comfortable position for you. By raising your wrist, you are helping to reduce the amount of fluid and swelling that is pressing on the nerve. Some women find it helpful to place their hand on a small pillow, sliding it between the pillowcase and pillow. This helps them to maintain a neutral hand position throughout the night."

As your pregnancy progresses, you will have extra weight and body changes that may cause unwanted symptoms to develop depending on your sleep positions. Plus, you may develop new problems that can be prevented by sleeping on your side. [3] X Research source Possible complications caused by sleeping on your back include back pain, hemorrhoids, problems breathing, heartburn and indigestion, blood pressure changes, and a decrease in circulation to your own heart and to the baby. Sleeping on your stomach causes prolonged pressure against your abdomen. This position can put pressure on major blood vessels and arteries interfering with the blood supply, plus this position will not be very comfortable as your pregnancy progresses."

      "content": "Avoid sleeping on your hands. Do not place your hands under your cheek or neck area, or under any part of your body. This action adds pressure to your wrist area that is already compressed. It also increases the chances of your wrist becoming bent while you are sleeping. [4] X Research source Avoid any sleeping positions that place pressure on your wrist or cause your wrist to bend in any direction. As you change positions during the night, be sure you do not end up sleeping on one of your hands. Clearly you cannot lay on your side and elevate both wrists on pillows, all at the same time. If you are having symptoms in both wrists, then consider placing a small but thick pillow on each side of you. As you turn to your other side, the extra pillow is within reach to rest your other wrist and hand in a neutral position. Find a comfortable, but neutral position for the lower hand. It may be possible to slide the lower hand and wrist under the small pillow without adding any pressure and without bending your wrist."

Bending the wrist in either direction restricts blood flow and adds pressure to the nerve that is already pinched or compressed.

Braces and splints can help to keep your wrists and hands in a neutral position so that you can avoid feeling pain during the night and avoid placing added pressure on the nerve. You can buy splints and braces at your local drugstore. You can also wrap your wrist. Click here to learn how to wrap a wrist that is plagued by carpal tunnel.

[8] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Exercises that involve tight gripping include holding tightly to the handles of a treadmill, stair climber, or elliptical machine. Consider replacing those exercises with a recumbent bicycle or other activity that does not require tight gripping. Adjust your muscle training workout to include exercises and the use of strength training equipment, such as manipulating weights, that do not put any pressure on your wrists. Either avoid certain exercises or loosen your grip. Be sure you can perform the exercises safely if you choose to continue but without gripping tightly."

If you are unable to apply enough pressure yourself, such as in cases where both hands are affected by carpal tunnel, then ask someone to help. Apply pressure at a point referred to as pericardium point 6. [12] X Research source To locate this area, relax your arm and hand, and rest your wrist area with the palm facing upward. Measure three finger widths from the point where your wrist naturally bends, measuring up your arm towards your elbow or shoulder. The point is located in a small dip in the skin, central to the flattened arm, and within the tendons, bones, and ligaments in the area. This might be an area where the clasp or buckle of a watch might normally rest. Apply firm pressure to that spot. It may feel as if it is bruised. Hold the pressure for ten seconds then repeat three times. Do the same thing to your other wrist. Repeat this procedure several times each day."

Relief of pain is one area that was determined to be possibly effective. This technique may be helpful during the night when you experience carpal tunnel pain. [13] X Research source To relieve the pain and discomfort from carpal tunnel symptoms, the reflex target point is on your foot. Use the foot that is on the same side of the body associated with the pain. Locate the point by finding the base of your fourth toe. Imagine a straight line coming back towards your ankle from the toe. You may need to ask someone to help you. The most tender spot is located about 2 cm, or 0.8 inches, from the base of the fourth toe along the straight line and back towards your ankle. Press on the center of the most tender spot as firmly as possible with your thumb. Try to apply constant pressure until the tender feeling subsides. Repeat the pressure applications four to five times. The point you are pressing on should begin to feel less tender. The pain in your wrist should be reduced by applying pressure to this point on your foot."

The benefit of the injections often last for several months. In extreme cases, a small surgical procedure may be performed.
