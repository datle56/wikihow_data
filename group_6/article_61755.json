      "content": "Examine the plunge router. You will note that it contains an electric motor mounted between two posts. The motor rests on top of springs and is attached to a flat base that guides the motor down at a 90 degree angle. [1] X Research source The motor rises back into position when downward pressure is released, raising the router bit above the base. Attached to a collet, the motor connects much like a hand drill chuck. It comes in 2 sizes, 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch (as well as 8 mm and 12 mm in metric sizes). This is where the router bit does the cutting."

      "content": "Use jigs and guides with the plunge router. These are often shop made or bought as add-on accessories. The most common jig will be used for cutting dadoes. Dadoes are used in joining two pieces of wood at 90 degrees, such as adding a kitchen cabinet shelf to a side piece. This type of joint uses a straight cut router bit for dadoes. Clamp the guide into place so that, when the router bit is plunged downward, the bit will line up with the dado joint you want to cut."
