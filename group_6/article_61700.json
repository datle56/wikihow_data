Except for activation being touched from the steering wheel (or in some conditions from the radio's dashboard area), most of this system is built to be low-touch and quick to establish. This article should be read before setting out, so some of this information should be in digest form. Other pieces will need to be rather elongated."

This system should be controlled either through the steering wheel or from the dashboard's OK and Phone (the button has a face with sync lines coming from the left side). It should be understood that all commands in this directory are assumed to have been started after pressing either of these buttons to initiate a voice command. In some steering wheel buttons, this can be used with a \"voice\" (in all-caps) button instead. What buttons you have are controlled by the trim line of the vehicle - most likely you'll have one or the other, with higher-end trim lines having the simpler buttons and those of the mid and sleeker lines having more buttons, but that is determined by the factory and the operability of your particular system."

This should not be played with often - unless you have a wide range of connectivity issues with your system hearing you or you hearing your system. \"Help\" gives you voice commands used with your system read through the car's speakers. \"Vehicle health report\" runs a report of vehicle systems checks that can be read - when the car is turned on but not started from the dashboard's display. \"Services\" runs the Services portal from your SYNC system. (If you have apps installed in your vehicle) \"Mobile Apps\" will give you the ability to run car-installed apps in your vehicle - separate from apps installed on your phone which run through the system.
