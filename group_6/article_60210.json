      "content": "Spin the ball to get a feel for how it rotates. Because of the gear rings that span adjacent faces, you can spin the right or left thirds of the sphere either up or down, or the top or bottom thirds either left or right. When you do so, the center third will follow in the same direction but cover half the distance. In other words, if you spin the right side all the way around (360 degrees), the center will spin halfway around (180 degrees). Each of the Gear Ball’s 6 faces has 13 colored components: 4 plus sign shaped corners; 4 side pieces that are each half of a gear ring; 4 interior pieces that look like block letter “C”s; and 1 square center. References to “sides” or “thirds” (left, right, up, down, center) of the Gear Ball are based on you holding the ball with a single face pointed towards you."

      "content": "Identify a “favorite color” corner and its two adjacent corner colors. Each corner of each side of a Gear Ball is next to corners from two other sides. So, once you pick out, for instance, a red corner to start with, you’ll see that it is next to two corners with different colors—for example, yellow and green. [1] X Research source There’s nothing special about red—you can start with any of the six colors you prefer. It may make the process easier if you start with the same “favorite” color each time, though."

      "title": "Create 2 matching pairs from 4 adjacent corners.",
      "content": "Create 2 matching pairs from 4 adjacent corners. The goal here is to have 2 corners (separated only by 1 side piece) of a face both be a single color (for example, red), and the 2 adjacent corners of an adjacent face both be another single color (for example, yellow). [2] X Research source If, for example, you’re holding the Gear Ball so that there’s a red corner on top of a yellow corner to the left, you may be able to rotate the right side of the ball up or down until you have a red corner on top of a yellow corner to the right as well. With practice, you’ll be able to quickly decipher which pairs will be easiest to match. If you always start with red, for instance, you might sometimes find matching red and yellow corners to be easier, while other times matching red and green corners will be simpler."

      "title": "Find the other 2 “favorite color” corners and move them into place.",
      "content": "Find the other 2 “favorite color” corners and move them into place. Now that you’ve established 2 starting corners, (for example, the 2 red corners that are next to 2 yellow corners), look for the 2 other “favorite color” (red, for example) corners on the Gear Ball. They will always be separated from each other only by a side piece, and you’ll be able to rotate them together into place. Move them around until they are the other 2 corners in the same face as your starting 2 corners (for instance, all 4 corners in the face will be red). [3] X Research source If your 2 starting (red) corners are to your left and facing you, for instance, the other 2 red corners may be to your right and facing away from you. In this case, you’ll need to rotate the right side of the ball either upward or downward 180 degrees in order to bring all 4 red corners into alignment in the same face."

      "title": "Relocate the center square that matches the color of your corners.",
      "content": "Relocate the center square that matches the color of your corners. For example, you might now have 4 red corners in a single face but have an orange center square. If the red square you seek is directly opposite the orange square (that is, facing away from you), rotate the right side of the ball around once (360 degrees) and the red square will move into place with the 4 red corners. [4] X Research source Remember that, whether you’re rotating up and down or side to side, the center section of the ball rotates half the amount of the side section. So, if you rotate the right side of the ball up and all the way around (360 degrees), the center section will rotate up and halfway around (180 degrees). In this example, then, the 2 red corners on the right will rotate all the way around and meet up with the red center square that has traveled halfway around."

The corners and center of the face directly opposite your “favorite color” face (red, for example) will also now match (they might all be orange, for instance). Hold the ball with these corner-center matched faces at the top and bottom, and rotate the top left or right. Keep rotating until the other corners and centers match up. [5] X Research source Eventually, you'll be able to match the colors of the corners and centers in each of the other 4 faces. At this point, the corners and centers will be the same color in each of the 6 faces."

However, say there’s a yellow interior piece below the blue center and a purple one above it, as well as blue interior pieces at the bottom of the yellow face and the top of the purple face. In this case, you need all 4 of these interior pieces to switch locations. [6] X Research source Once you’ve solved all the centers and corners, you’ll always find the above scenario somewhere on the ball—but the grouping of colors may vary."

Then, repeat the process again—so it’s right-twice-up, right-twice-up or R2-U-R2-U. [8] X Research source The interior pieces will now be in the correct vicinity, but still in the wrong faces. That is, according to the example, the purple interior piece will be at the bottom of the blue face, and the blue interior piece will be at the top of the purple face. Remember, each time you rotate the top, bottom, or side 180 degrees, the center rotates 90 degrees in the same direction."

Turn the ball up 90 degrees (¼ turn) so the orange face is towards you, then repeat the R2-U-R2-U algorithm to put the interior pieces in the proper vicinity. [9] X Research source In some cases, using R2-U-R2-U will not only put the interior pieces in the proper vicinity, but also place them in the correct face as well (for example, yellow into yellow). Keep repeating this process until all the interior pieces are either in the proper face or are next to the proper face (that is, in the correct vicinity)."

At this point, there are only 2 scenarios: either all the interior pieces will already be in their proper faces (this is rare), or exactly 8 pairs of interior pieces will need to be flipped. Look over the ball to find the 8 pairs that need to be reoriented, then choose a pair to start with. [10] X Research source For example, with the green face above the purple face, you might find that the bottom interior piece of the green face is purple, and the top interior piece of the purple face is green. This could be the first of your 8 mismatched pairs to fix. If all the interior pieces are already oriented (that is, none of them need switched because they’re already in their proper faces), skip this entire section and move on to the “R4” algorithm section."

And, you’ll be able to turn the ball so that these 4 pairs create a “belt” that goes around the entire center section of the sphere. Position the ball so this “belt” is facing up, down, left, and right, but not directly towards you. [11] X Research source If the Gear Ball was a globe, and you were looking straight at the Prime Meridian, the belt would cross over the North and South Poles and follow the 90 deg East and 90 deg West longitudinal lines. This orientation is called a “standing slice.”"

[12] X Research source Once you’ve completed the R-U-R-U-R-U algorithm, all the centers, corners, and interior pieces will be match in color within each face. Now, you just need to rotate some of the gear pieces into the correct orientation, and you’ll be all finished!"
