      "title": "She might pick little fights or mess with you if she likes you.",
      "content": "She might pick little fights or mess with you if she likes you. Because Aries women are really strong and independent, they can sometimes be resistant to being vulnerable in relationships. [1] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. What she really wants is to meet her match—someone who will go head-to-head with her and not back down when she asserts herself. Do that, and you might just capture her heart. For example, if she knows you're a fan of a football team that recently lost, she might go out of her way to poke you about it and talk about how shoddy your favorite team's defense is. Fight back by boasting about your team's winning record."

      "title": "An Aries woman typically loves sparring with someone she likes.",
      "content": "An Aries woman typically loves sparring with someone she likes. She also loves to win, but that doesn't mean you should just let her win. If you're not performing at your best, she'll likely take offense to that. When she comes out on top, expect to be teased about it for weeks on end—or at least until the rematch. [2] X Research source She's typically going to challenge you at something she already knows she excels at. If you happen to come out on top, you can tell she likes you if she immediately demands a rematch."

    {
      "title": "Her interest in you is probably painted across her face.",
      "content": "Her interest in you is probably painted across her face. The typical Aries woman has a hard time hiding her feelings—one look in her eyes, and you'll know. She also tends to blush easily, so if you're able to bring a flush to her cheeks, you have all the signs you need that she's into you. [3] X Research source The bold Aries woman usually won't shy away from making eye contact either, so this might just be one of the easiest signs to pick up on."

    {
      "title": "The active Aries is always on the move and chooses her companions carefully.",
      "content": "The active Aries is always on the move and chooses her companions carefully. She's perfectly capable of doing things alone, thank you very much—she doesn't need to have you along. If she invites you along, it's a sign that she likes you and respects you enough to believe you won't slow her down. [4] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. Don't be surprised if she invites you to do something sporty or active, especially if you haven't yet spent a lot of time together. She's trying to figure out if you have what it takes to hang with her."

    {
      "title": "The typical Aries woman is a child at heart with energy to spare.",
      "content": "The typical Aries woman is a child at heart with energy to spare. On the outside, the Aries woman is a force—determined and focused. But she never loses that inner sense of playfulness and if she likes you, it'll brim up to the surface. For example, if you're walking together to a café, she might tag you on the arm and shout, \"Race you there!\" before taking off down the sidewalk."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aries ladies typically express themselves physically.",
      "content": "Aries ladies typically express themselves physically. This is a woman who uses a punch on your arm or a squeeze of your hand as punctuation. If she's into you, you'll notice that she sits or stands close to you and touches you every chance she gets. Because of her competitiveness and activeness, don't be surprised if she asks you to play a more contact sport with her, such as basketball. Aries women are also likely to be tomboys, so she might favor touching you the way two guy friends would touch each other—a lot of play punches and back slaps."

    {
      "title": "The typical Aries woman is generous and wants to give you things.",
      "content": "The typical Aries woman is generous and wants to give you things. There doesn't have to be an occasion. If she likes you and she sees something that reminds her of you, she'll pick it up for you. Did you mention liking a particular TV series or movie? She'll get practically any little thing that has an associated character or phrase for you. Don't worry too much about getting things for her in return—she's not keeping score. This is just a way that she shows her affection for you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aries women don't usually like to acknowledge things they like.",
      "content": "Aries women don't usually like to acknowledge things they like. There's that avoidance of vulnerability again. Yes, complimenting someone else makes an Aries woman feel vulnerable, because she's essentially admitting that you might be better than her at something. And for an Aries, if you're not the best, you might as well be the worst. So if she's throwing compliments at you left and right? She definitely has a thing for you. This is an especially powerful sign if she happens to compliment you in the heat of competition. For example, if you're playing a little one-on-one basketball she might say, \"Nice block\" after missing a shot."

    {
      "title": "An Aries woman is typically open and honest about her feelings.",
      "content": "An Aries woman is typically open and honest about her feelings. Aries women tend to not like feelings very much because they're so difficult to control. That being said, if she's accepted that she feels a certain way about you, she won't make you guess—she'll straight up tell you. [5] X Research source Keep in mind this honesty cuts both ways. If you do something she doesn't like, or if she decides she doesn't have feelings for you anymore, she'll be just as quick to let you know. While this might not seem like a good thing, it really is, because it means you can trust her not to play games with you or lead you on.

      "title": "If this typical tomboy shows up in a dress, she probably likes you.",
      "content": "If this typical tomboy shows up in a dress, she probably likes you. With her active lifestyle, it makes complete sense that an Aries woman usually doesn't take to delicate clothing or fragile accessories. But when she succumbs to romantic feelings, she might find that she wants to indulge her softer side. The strong, competitive Aries woman often views softness and femininity as weakness, too. If she's willing to reveal this side of herself to you, it means she trusts you not to take advantage of her."
    },
    {
      "title": "She tends to feel more comfortable when she has control.",
      "content": "She tends to feel more comfortable when she has control. An Aries woman who isn't taking charge of a situation often feels pretty antsy, so if she invites you to take over, she thinks you're pretty special. It also means she trusts you not to mess anything up—maybe even to do as well as she would if she were in charge. Don't let this go to your head and don't take it for granted. Even if an Aries woman really likes you, she's still probably going to feel more comfortable being in charge most of the time."
