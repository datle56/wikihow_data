      "title": "A “tall drink of water” refers to a tall and attractive person.",
      "content": "A “tall drink of water” refers to a tall and attractive person. When someone says someone is a “tall drink of water,” “tall glass of water,” or “long drink of water,” they’re usually complimenting them—they think they’re physically appealing. They’re exclaiming that the person is slim, tall, long-legged, and beautiful. In other words, it’s an informal way to say, “Whoa, you’re tall,” or “Hey, you’re pretty!” This phrase or idiom can still be found in some of today’s pop culture. For example: In the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption , Morgan Freeman’s character (Ellis) refers to Tim Robbins’ character (Andy) as a “tall drink of water with a silver spoon up his [butt]” to describe Andy’s fine appearance. [1] X Research source The 2002 Rascal Flatts song “Dry Country Girl” has the lyrics, “A tall drink of water in a cotton dress. That preacher’s daughter, she sure is blessed.” In Disney’s Tangled , one of the thugs says when laying eyes on Mother Gothel, “Whoa! Somebody get me a glass because I just found me a tall drink of water.\""

Even exoterically, if the accuser intended to intimate the superiority of whisky to water or the necessity of a coalition between two things…But how flat it is, flat as is not even every drink of water! How destitute of the slightest laughter-provoking quality!”"
