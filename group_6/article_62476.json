This happens most commonly in your extremities, like your fingers, toes, and ears. [1] X Research source In very cold or very hot weather, your ears may feel hot as your blood vessels fluctuate in size to try to regulate their temperature. Treatment: If you’re out in cold weather, wear ear muffs, a headband, or a hat that covers your ears to keep them nice and cozy. In warm weather, be sure to stay hydrated. An icepack on your head or the back of your neck may help your body cool down."

Sometimes, reminding yourself of what you love about you is all it takes to cut through other people’s noise."
