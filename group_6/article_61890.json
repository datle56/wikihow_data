      "content": "Damaged or loose cables can cause your TV to not turn on. Make sure they are firmly plugged in, and there isn't any damage you can see. Look for fraying, sharply bent areas, or exposed wires. Loose cables can also turn off the TV randomly while you're using it."

      "content": "A dead outlet will prevent your TV from turning on. Plug something you know works, like a lamp, into that socket. If it turns on, you can eliminate a dead outlet from the list of reasons your TV isn't turning on. Alternatively, try plugging your TV into another outlet to see if it works. If it does, you can assume the original outlet is dead. If your Vizio TV is plugged into a power strip or surge protector, try plugging it into the wall directly. If it turns on when connected to a wall outlet, there's a problem with your power strip or surge protector. In case the outlet appears dead, check for any switches on the wall that might control it and turn them on. You can plug your TV back into that outlet, but make sure the switch is on whenever you want to turn it on."

      "content": "A dead remote will not send a signal to the TV to turn on when you press the button. Simply open the back panel and replace the batteries. You can also reset it if needed. Note that if you have multiple Vizio TVs, you may be using the wrong remote for each one. Simply find the correct remote to control and turn on your TV. If you inserted new batteries into your remote, you can check if the TV works by pressing the Power button on the TV instead of the remote."

Here's what you need to do to power cycle your TV: Unplug your TV from the wall socket. While the TV is unplugged, press and hold the Power button on your TV for 15-30 seconds (not the button on the remote ). Plug the TV back into power and turn it back on to see if you solved the issue. [1] X Research source"
