      "content": "Cut a long piece of ribbon that fits correctly around your gift and lay it over the top, holding firmly in the middle. This will wrap around your gift and be where the bow sits on top of your gift. The longer your ribbon is, the bigger the bow will be. Make sure the top is long enough for you to tie a (probably) large knot and a bow."

      "title": "Pull the ribbon around the box and make sure both sides of the ribbon are of the same length.",
      "content": "Pull the ribbon around the box and make sure both sides of the ribbon are of the same length. You can measure this by lifting them up and touching ends above the present. Next, pull one end of the ribbon under and over the other, so you have a \"T\" shape. Decorative elements like ribbons, tags, or foliage can add beauty to a wrapped present. Finishing off your wrapped gift with extra ribbon, a handmade tag, or tucked foraged plant foliage will ensure an attractive final result."

      "content": "Sharply twist the fold to the side as tightly as possible. You'll need to do this to create the crossed shape. After this, pull the entire ribbon around the box and meet in the middle with both ends. Now we can get into forming the bow."

    {
      "title": "Pull tightly into the middle of your box and make a huge knot.",
      "content": "Pull tightly into the middle of your box and make a huge knot. Press the middle of your bow with your finger to keep it down, or you can have somebody else hold it. You might also just use a clear piece of tape if you're unable or cautious to do this on your own and nobody's around. Now, make a regular knot. Your safest bet is to make a double or even triple knot, if you have the correct amount of ribbon and it won't be too bulky. This will be the center of your bow."

    {
      "title": "Tie a bow",
      "content": "Tie a bow . Make it as large as you want, and be sure it's tight. You can pull out the edges a bit if you'd like, and make sure the \"ears\" of the bow and wide and as round as possible. The fluffier and more cartoon-ish look is what you're going for, not a flat or typical bow. This will be easier to accomplish with a wired ribbon, but possibly be messier looking, so be careful!"

      "title": "Finally, trim the ends.",
      "content": "Finally, trim the ends. The ends should have quite a bit extra, so cut them at an angle in either diagonal direction. For an even more elegant and professional look, check the tips below for an alternative (but equally as easy) method."
