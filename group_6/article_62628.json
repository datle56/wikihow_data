      "title": "Identify why you want a hearing.",
      "content": "Identify why you want a hearing. There are many reasons why you might want a hearing. For example, you may have been charged with a traffic violation. In that situation, you have the option of pleading guilty or of requesting a hearing from the court. Alternately, you may be in the midst of litigation and want a hearing so that you can bring something to the attention of the judge. Maybe the other side in the lawsuit has not handed over requested documents. At the hearing, you can ask the court to order the other party to do something. Identify your reason for the hearing because you might not be able to use a letter to request a hearing in all situations."

    {
      "title": "Check if you can request a hearing by letter.",
      "content": "Check if you can request a hearing by letter. Call the court clerk and ask if you can request a hearing by letter. Sometimes, you need to file a lawsuit before you can get a hearing. In that situation, you need to file a petition with the court. In the petition, you will explain the facts surrounding your lawsuit and request relief from the court. The state of Indiana has provided a petition template. You could adjust this to suit your needs. Also, some courts might not accept letters. Instead, you will need to fill out a motion form. Your court should have blank motion forms for you to fill out. In the form, you explain what you want to talk to the judge about at the hearing. If your case is ongoing, then you might need to file a motion instead of writing a letter. A blank sample motion form for Colorado is available at https://www.courts.state.co.us/Forms/renderForm1.cfm?Form=365 . Check with your court if they have a blank motion form."

      "content": "Visit your self-help center. Some courts have self-help centers where people representing themselves can go to ask questions. To find out if your court has a self-help center, call the court clerk. Someone at the self-help center can look over your letter or advise you of how to request a hearing if writing a letter is not appropriate. You also might try to find a legal aid organization near you. Legal aid organizations provide legal services to low-income people either for free or at a reduced rate. You can find a legal aid organization near you by visiting the Legal Services Corporation’s website at www.lsc.gov. Search by entering your zip code."

      "content": "Search for a form letter. Some courts print off forms that you can use to request a hearing. Instead of writing a letter, you should get the form and fill it out. Pinal County, Arizona, for example, has a form you can use to request a hearing in traffic court. To check if your court has a form you can use, call the court clerk and ask. Sometimes, courts will require that you complete a Notice of Hearing form first, which will then allow you to get a hearing date."

      "title": "Begin the letter with your request.",
      "content": "Begin the letter with your request. You shouldn’t waste too much of the reader’s time. Instead, get directly to the point. In the first paragraph, ask for the hearing in your case.

In this situation, you could type, “The police department has not responded to my request for a copy of my arrest record. I made the request in writing on Jun 12, 2015. It has now been three months. I am requesting an order to compel the department to turn over a copy of the record.”"
