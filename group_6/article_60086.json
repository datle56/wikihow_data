If you see someone rummaging through your bins or notice open trash bags, it may be a red flag that someone is casing your home. [1] X Research source"

Thieves are able to hide on your property without getting noticed when it’s dark, so they may try to get rid of any lights near an entryway to your home. [2] X Research source"

Burglars may also check for homes to target when they drive by, so unfamiliar vehicles stopped on the street, parked in a driveway, or circling the area may be looking for a house to break into.

If you notice any physical damage to your windows, doors, or locks, it could be a sign that someone has been casing your place and trying to find an easy entry point.

Whenever you leave your home or go to bed, secure your home by locking up all the entry points. Sliding door locks usually aren’t as secure as other exterior doors. Put a wooden rod or dowel in the door frame so it can’t slide open. Don’t forget to lock the door that leads to an attached garage. Even if your garage door is closed, someone may be able to get inside and enter your home.
