Gemini is mutable, represented by their flexibility and love of change; they prefer to explore new possibilities. Gemini and Aquarius may see the world differently, but if this pair can learn to accept and respect one other's perspectives, they'll thrive!"

      "title": "Scorpio.",
      "content": "Scorpio. Aquarius will be immediately drawn to Scorpio's air of mystery and intrigue. On the other hand, their energies aren't always compatible—Scorpio tends to be brooding, serious, and inflexible, which Aquarius won't know how to deal with. Scorpios are intuitive, whereas Aquarius is logic-based, and compromise will be difficult because both are fixed signs. Scorpio's emotional intensity and Aquarius's revolutionary ideas make them both the outcasts of the zodiac. If they can learn to appreciate the drastic change they'll bring to one another's lives, they can build a happy relationship."

      "title": "Pisces.",
      "content": "Pisces. The only thing these signs tend to have in common is their humanitarian mindset. Pisces loves to help other people and may have creative ideas to inspire Aquarius. Outside of that, however, Aquarius will be turned off by Pisces's neediness, while Aquarius's unwillingness to connect emotionally will make Pisces feel insecure about the relationship. Pisces and Aquarius will need to work at finding an emotional balance together. If Aquarius can start being more vocal about their feelings, Pisces will find it easier to trust them and let go of any insecurities. Some Aquarians are also highly social, which can be frustrating to the more low-key and committed Pisces. While Pisces value community and relationship-building, they prioritize emotional connections over what they perceive as superficial social relationships.

      "content": "Taurus. Aquarius and Taurus are fundamentally different; old-fashioned, slow-moving Taurus will have a hard time understanding the rebellious mindset of a free-thinking Aquarius.

Unless they're truly committed, this pair will most likely part ways. Compromise is the name of the game for these signs. Taurus will need to give Aquarius space from time to time, and Aquarius will need to give Taurus peace of mind by proving their dedication to the relationship."
