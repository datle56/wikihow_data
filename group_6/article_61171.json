      "title": "During production, treacle usually boils for less time than molasses.",
      "content": "During production, treacle usually boils for less time than molasses. Both treacle and molasses are made by boiling the juice of crushed sugar cane plants or beets. Treacle is usually left to boil for a shorter amount of time, which gives it its sweeter taste and thinner consistency. Molasses boils for longer, which removes more sugar content and makes it thicker. [1] X Research source Treacle and molasses are actually byproducts of the sugar-refining process. When sugar cane juice is boiled, sugar crystals form. These are removed from the juice, which leaves behind the dark, thick syrup of treacle and molasses."

      "content": "Treacle tends to be sweeter than molasses, which is more bitter. Treacle and molasses are both super sweet, sugary syrups. However, treacle tends to have a smoother, more caramel-like taste than molasses. [2] X Research source Molasses is usually more bittersweet and often has a slightly smoky flavor.

      "title": "Molasses is usually thicker than treacle.",
      "content": "Molasses is usually thicker than treacle. “As slow as molasses” is a descriptor for slow, sleepy movements for a reason! The sugary syrup is super thick and viscous, so it takes a long time to pour it into a measuring spoon. While treacle is pretty thick too, it has a thinner consistency than molasses. For that reason, it might be easier to pour. [4] X Research source If you’re having trouble pouring treacle or molasses, just run the jar under some hot water. This warms the syrup up, making it flow quicker."

      "title": "Molasses is used in both sweet and savory recipes, unlike treacle.",
      "content": "Molasses is used in both sweet and savory recipes, unlike treacle. For the most part, treacle is only used as a sweetener in delicious recipes like ginger cookies, treacle tart, and toffee pudding. [5] X Research source Molasses is also used in desserts like gingerbread cookies and pecan pie. But, it commonly makes a sweet addition to savory recipes too. You’ll often taste it in barbeque sauce, baked beans, and even some beers! [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Treacle is a dark, sweet syrup that’s mostly used in the United Kingdom.",
      "content": "Treacle is a dark, sweet syrup that’s mostly used in the United Kingdom. You might be surprised to learn that treacle was originally used as an antidote to poison! It turns out that it didn’t really help, but it was kept around for its yummy, sweet taste. It comes in many different types, from the super sweet light treacle, often called golden syrup, to the intense and bitter black treacle. [7] X Research source Treacle is often referred to as the British version of molasses. If you live outside of the United Kingdom, you might have trouble finding treacle in stores. But, it’s easy to find treacle online ."

      "title": "Molasses is a rich, thick syrup that’s a byproduct of refining sugar.",
      "content": "Molasses is a rich, thick syrup that’s a byproduct of refining sugar. Used all throughout the world, molasses is well known for its deep, smoky caramel flavor. It also comes in a variety of types, with light and dark molasses being the most widely used for their sweet tastes. Blackstrap molasses is the darkest and thickest type, which is also quite bitter. [8] X Research source Unlike crystallized sugar, molasses is high in beneficial nutrients like calcium, magnesium, potassium, and iron. Molasses can either be sulfured, meaning it contains a sulfur-based preservative, or unsulfured. Sulfured molasses might be slightly less sweet, but there’s not a huge difference between these types."

      "title": "Treacle and molasses taste similar, so they make great substitutes.",
      "content": "Treacle and molasses taste similar, so they make great substitutes. Because they’re both byproducts from the sugar-refining process, both treacle and molasses have a rich, sweet, and caramel-like flavor. While there will be subtle differences in sweetness and consistency, your recipe will turn out just as good if you have to substitute one for the other! [9] X Research source When substituting treacle for molasses, or vice versa, keep the ratios the same. If the recipe calls for 1 cup (236 mL) of molasses, just use 1 cup (236 mL) of treacle. Brown sugar, maple syrup, honey, and dark corn syrup are other sweeteners you can use in place of treacle or molasses. However, these range more wildly in their flavor, sweetness, and consistency, so they will alter the taste of your recipe."
