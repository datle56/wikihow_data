      "title": "Wear a long-sleeved shirt or sweater.",
      "content": "Wear a long-sleeved shirt or sweater. Professional stylist Tannya Bernadette says to wear a “short skirt with a long sleeve or quarter sleeve top…to make it more modest.” Pick a longer, drapey-style top to provide contrast against a fitted skirt. Or, wear a more structured top that falls right at the waistline to balance out a flared or A-line skirt. Throw on a sweater in the fall or winter, or wear a thinner blouse in the spring and summer. If you feel uncomfortable with how much skin you’re showing in a short skirt, look for tops with higher necklines and sleeves to cover up more skin on top. Bernadette also recommends pairing a pleated high-waisted skirt with “something simple with clean lines.” In the summer, this could be a “lightweight knit sweater with a half tuck.”"

      "content": "Layer tops over the skirt. For extra coverage, wear a sweater, cardigan, jacket, wrap, or scarf that’s longer than your skirt. This will conceal the shorter hem of your skirt and help you feel more secure. Try pairing a long coat or cardigan with a short skirt. Keep it unfastened in the front to show off your skirt and legs, while being covered in the back. For a fun and unique look, pair a short skirt with a fitted tank and then layer a long, sheer dress on top. This keeps you completely covered while still showing off a little skin."

      "title": "Wear tights or leggings underneath.",
      "content": "Wear tights or leggings underneath. Pull on a pair of tights underneath your skirt for some warmth and modesty. According to professional stylist Tannya Bernadette, “ nude or blush-tone fishnets look really pretty and feminine with skirts.” But, feel free to experiment with different colors, prints, opacities, and textures. Textured tights, like fishnet , lace , or ribbed , can help keep a form-fitting skirt from riding up. Play it safe with a neutral-colored tight in black , white , or nude . Or, choose neon or patterned tights to spice up a muted outfit. If you want to show some skin, opt for sheer pantyhose in 7, 10, or 15 denier. If it’s cold or you want extra coverage, choose thermal tights or more opaque varieties in 40, 60, or 100 denier."

      "content": "Wear spandex shorts under your skirt. If you’re worried about flashing someone, throw on a pair of spandex shorts that are meant for sports or biking. They’ll help you feel secure, plus smooth out your midsection and make you look snatched! Make sure your spandex shorts are short enough so they don’t show underneath your skirt. Get your shorts in a neutral color like nude, brown, or black. Or, match them to the color of your skirt."

      "title": "Wear flat and comfortable shoes.",
      "content": "Wear flat and comfortable shoes. Instead of wearing high heels, pair your short skirt with flats, sneakers, booties, or tall boots. Heels accentuate the length of your legs, which can make you feel like you’re showing even more skin than usual. You’re also more likely to trip or fall in them, which may make you feel more uncomfortable or nervous. Casual sneakers and flats can help minimize the length of a shorter skirt. Try a taller leather riding boot, cowboy boot, or even a thigh-high boot to cover up more skin."

      "content": "Keep your knees together while sitting. Before sitting down, press your legs and knees together to avoid exposing yourself. Bend down slowly, then slide your hands over your skirt to smooth out the material and ensure it doesn’t ride up. Once you sit down, keep your knees pressed together, tilt your legs to the side, and cross your ankles. [1] X Research source Alternatively, cross your legs when you sit down and tilt your legs to the side. [2] X Research source Place a purse or jacket on your lap to prevent people from looking up your skirt. [3] X Research source If you’re sitting on the floor, sit on your shins with your legs folded straight under you. If your skirt doesn’t cover your bottom when you sit down, put a jacket on your seat as a barrier or consider standing (especially if you’re taking public transport)."

      "content": "Take small steps and walk on even surfaces. To avoid flashing others, walk around carefully and watch where you’re going. Taking large steps can cause your skirt to ride up, so step around trash in the middle of the street instead of leaping over it. Try not to tug at your skirt, even if it feels too short, because it will draw unnecessary attention to yourself. [4] X Research source If you’re at school, avoid physical activities like running, jumping, or sports. Straighten your back and hold your head high to appear more confident and ladylike. Instead of wearing high heels, opt for ballet flats—they make your legs look longer without the risk of tripping. Check the weather forecast before stepping outside. If it’s a windy day, for example, you may want to wear a skirt in a heavy material so it stays in place."

      "title": "Bend at the knees when bending over.",
      "content": "Bend at the knees when bending over. If you need to pick up something from the floor, bend from your knees to keep the hemline of your skirt level. Press your knees and legs together and slowly sink down to retrieve the item. Then, keep your knees pressed together as you stand back up. [5] X Research source If possible, hold the back of your skirt against your body before you bend over. If you bend at your waist, it may cause the back of your skirt to rise up and expose your backside."

      "content": "Keep your legs and ankles together when exiting a car. If you’re stepping out of a car , pull the hem of your skirt down as far as you can, open the door, then swing your legs out of the car—while keeping your legs and ankles together. When your feet touch the ground, use your hands to push yourself out of the car and rise smoothly. [6] X Research source To get into a car without flashing anyone, sit down first and then swing your legs into the car, keeping your knees and feet together."

      "title": "Pick a flared skirt for comfort.",
      "content": "Pick a flared skirt for comfort. Try a short skirt that isn’t fitted and flares out from your body. Since the material is looser, it will lay flat on your skin so you won’t get a gap in between your thighs when you sit down. [7] X Research source For a trendy and comfortable look, try a skater skirt , pleated skirt , or button-down skirt . Remember that flowy, loose skirts can blow up when a breeze comes through. If it’s a windy day, opt for a skirt in a thicker material like denim, wool, velvet, or corduroy."

      "title": "Choose an A-line skirt that sits at your natural waist.",
      "content": "Choose an A-line skirt that sits at your natural waist. Choose a skirt with a waistband that rests at the narrowest part of your torso. While it still falls at a normal length for a short skirt, you can feel a little more covered and secure with fabric covering your midsection. [8] X Research source Look for an elastic waistband for extra comfort, good fit, and better ability to move around. Flared styles that rest at the natural waist can help elongate the body and accentuate the waist on short or curvy bodies."

      "title": "Opt for a high-low skirt.",
      "content": "Opt for a high-low skirt . Think of the high-low skirt as the perfect hybrid between the mini skirt and the maxi skirt. Since it’s shorter in the front and longer in the back, it allows you to move freely—bend over, run around, and perform your regular activities as normal! Alternatively, try a skirt that is asymmetrical from side to side, with one leg exposed more than the other."

      "title": "Go for a little extra length in a fitted skirt.",
      "content": "Go for a little extra length in a fitted skirt. If you choose a bodycon skirt in a stretchy material, look for one that hits right below your knees. Because the material hugs your body, it might feel a bit short, but the extra length ensures your skirt won’t ride up. [9] X Research source For a more conservative look, opt for a fitted skirt that skims the outline of your legs, instead of clinging tight to your body. Thicker materials like denim, wool, and corduroy won’t ride up as much as cotton or polyester, but they might not be as stretchy or comfortable."

      "title": "Consider wearing a skort.",
      "content": "Consider wearing a skort . If you plan on moving around or playing sports, opt for a skirt with built-in shorts underneath. Even if your skirt flies up, you won’t expose yourself to others, and it’ll look like you’re wearing normal athletic shorts. Look for a style with skirt panels that fall lower than the hidden shorts so they don’t peek out."
