      "content": "Measure your room’s longest wall and divide by the width of 1 plank. Before installing vinyl plank flooring , it’s important to figure out the size of the area you want to re-floor. Start by taking accurate room measurements . Then calculate the number of rows of full planks you need by dividing your room’s width by the plank width. [1] X Research source Calculate the width of the room in inches. For example, a 15.75’ room is 189”. Divide the width of your room in inches by the width of 1 plank. For example, you would need 31.5 rows of 6” wide vinyl planks to cover a 15.75’ wide room. Always buy 10% more flooring than you think you need to account for mistakes. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Calculate how wide the first and last rows need to be.",
      "content": "Calculate how wide the first and last rows need to be. If the width of your room doesn’t divide evenly into the width of your plank, round down to the nearest whole number. Multiply that number by the width of 1 plank. [3] X Research source For example, 31.5 rows would round down to 31. Multiplied by 6 for a 6” wide plank would come to 186”. Subtract the combined plank widths from the width of the room to get the width of your last row. In this example 189” - 186” = 3” so the planks for your last row are 3” wide. If your last row is less than ½ the width of a plank, adjust the width of the first row by adding the width of your last row to the width of a full plank and then dividing it in half. For example, If you have 6” planks and the last row is 3”, add them together to get 9”. Then divide that in ½. Cut the first and last rows to 4½” wide for better symmetry. [4] X Research source Use a circular saw to cut vinyl planks along the length. [5] X Research source Scoring with a knife and then snapping the plank works well to make a plank shorter, but this technique causes a ragged edge when making a plank narrower."

      "content": "Check that your floor is level and make any necessary repairs. For the best results, vinyl plank flooring should be installed on a level surface. Spot-check different areas around the room to see if it’s level . Most floors have some natural variation. As long as the variations are less than 3/16” every 10’, you’re okay to go ahead with the installation. If your floor has uneven sections greater than 3/16”, mark them with a pencil. Then level those sections using the appropriate technique for the subflooring."

[10] X Research source Because this side of the first row of planks faces the wall, remove the tongue with a utility knife to help minimize any visible gaps once the installation is complete. Once you’ve removed the tongue, place a ¼” spacer between the end and length of the plank and the walls to maintain your expansion gap. [11] X Research source"

[13] X Research source Because the first plank of the first row is a full plank, cutting the first plank of the second row from ½ to ¾ of its length works. Hold on to cut pieces longer than 6” to 10” and use them to begin or end later rows. Use 6” as a guideline for narrower planks and 8” to 10” for wider planks. [14] X Research source Avoid placing end joints within 6-10” of the joints in adjacent rows. End joints that are closer than 6-10” weaken the floor’s layout. This can cause planks to pop out when you walk across the floor."

      "content": "Luxury Vinyl Plank Luxury vinyl plank (LVP) is a newer type of vinyl flooring that looks similar to laminate flooring but offers greater water resistance. This flooring is thicker, more rigid, and more durable than the older peel-and-slick vinyl flooring but is still flexible. These planks have multiple layers and feature a realistic wood look. [22] X Research source Pros: LVP is available in realistic wood-look patterns, and the finish is scratch- and water-resistant. Cons: It’s also not 100% waterproof, so it might not be a good choice for bathrooms. Some LVP products are glued down, making them harder to remove. Thinner LVP planks can show ridges and grout lines when installed over existing floors."

[23] X Research source These planks feature a 3D-printed layer that gives them a realistic natural wood appearance. WPC is also a floating floor that’s easy to maintain and can be installed over your existing hard flooring. Pros: The WPC plank’s waterproof core makes it suitable for installation in kitchens and bathrooms. It is more durable than LVP and can withstand heavy foot traffic. This floating flooring features a click-locking system, so it’s not glued down. Cons: WPC vinyl planks can’t be refinished, so you have to replace the floor if you want to change its appearance. If you damage a plank, it’s extremely difficult—if not impossible—to replace it. Take your time choosing a versatile color and pattern and a wear layer of at least 12 mil for residential areas with modest foot traffic."

      "title": "Stone Plastic Composite",
      "content": "Stone Plastic Composite Similar to WPC planks, stone plastic composite (SPC) vinyl planks are more durable because their core is mixed with stone instead of wood. [24] X Research source These planks are less likely to dent under heavy furniture than WPC but are less comfortable to stand on. Pros: The stone composite core makes these planks almost indestructible, making it great for homeowners with children and pets. Cons: SPC has less cushioning than WPC. This type of flooring can be more expensive than LVP and WPC. Not all options are suitable for installation in sunny rooms because they can fade. Look for UV-resistant products for sunrooms and closed-in porches."
