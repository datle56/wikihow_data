      "title": "Watch to see if they bend their knees as they fall.",
      "content": "Watch to see if they bend their knees as they fall. When you faint, your body doesn't have enough strength to bend its knees, so if the person fainting bends their knees, you can be pretty sure they are a faker."
    },
    {
      "title": "See if they put their hands over their face.",
      "content": "See if they put their hands over their face. A regular fall wouldn't do this, since if they don't have enough strength to bend their knees, they wouldn't be able to move their hands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Call the emergency services",
      "content": "Call the emergency services quickly. The emergency services will occasionally take them to the hospital and tell you whether or not they really fainted. This is a great way to catch the faker. If someone faints and you suspect they are a faker, say to everybody in the area that you are calling emergency services for them. This may spark a quick recovery."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have the doctor see if their bones are broken.",
      "content": "Have the doctor see if their bones are broken. If they are broken, this means the faint was all real. The reason for this is that someone pretending to faint may have actually broken their bones, but they would usually be in too much pain to keep up their act."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask them why they fainted, and what could have caused them to get a headache.",
      "content": "Ask them why they fainted, and what could have caused them to get a headache. If they think for a couple of seconds, they did indeed fake it. If they restate the question or don't use contractions when talking (ex: didn't, won't, aren't, etc.), they are probably faking as well."
