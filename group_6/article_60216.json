      "content": "Check the equation for varying terms and constant terms. Varying terms are numbers like 7 x {\\displaystyle 7x} , 3 x {\\displaystyle 3x} , 6 y {\\displaystyle 6y} or 10 z {\\displaystyle 10z} , where the number changes depending on what you plug into the variable, or letter. Constant terms are numbers like 10 {\\displaystyle 10} , 6 {\\displaystyle 6} or 30 {\\displaystyle 30} , where the number never changes. Usually, equations won't come with varying terms and constant terms lined up on separate sides. In the example above, the left-hand side (LHS) has both varying and constant terms, as does the right-hand side (RHS)."

In order to do this, you may have to subtract or add the numbers you want to move from both sides. In the next step, you'll see how to do that in example 1. The equation 16 x − 5 x = 32 − 10 {\\displaystyle 16x-5x=32-10} does have all the varying terms on one side (LHS), while all the constant terms are on the other side (RHS)."

In example 1, 7 x − 10 = 3 x − 6 {\\displaystyle 7x-10=3x-6} can be rearranged by choosing to subtract either 7 x {\\displaystyle 7x} or 3 x {\\displaystyle 3x} from both sides. Choosing to subtract 7 x {\\displaystyle 7x} , you have: ( 7 x − 7 x ) − 10 = ( 3 x − 7 x ) − 6 − 10 = − 4 x − 6 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}(7x-7x)-10&=(3x-7x)-6\\\\-10&=-4x-6\\end{aligned}}}"

[5] X Research source The coefficient of x {\\displaystyle x} in − 4 x {\\displaystyle -4x} is − 4 {\\displaystyle -4} . So divide both sides by − 4 {\\displaystyle -4} to get the value of x = 1 {\\displaystyle x=1} . Our answer to the equation 7 x − 10 = 3 x − 6 {\\displaystyle 7x-10=3x-6} is x = 1 {\\displaystyle x=1} . You can check this answer by plugging 1 {\\displaystyle 1} back into every x {\\displaystyle x} variable and seeing if both sides of the equation equal the same number: 7 ( 1 ) − 10 = 3 ( 1 ) − 6 − 3 = − 3 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}7(1)-10&=3(1)-6\\\\-3&=-3\\end{aligned}}}"
