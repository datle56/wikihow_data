      "title": "Find where your eyebrows should begin.",
      "content": "Find where your eyebrows should begin. Hold a pencil point up and vertical against your nose to see where your eyebrow should begin. The edge of the pencil that is closer to your nose marks the line where your brow should start. If it goes beyond that point, you should use tweezers to remove the excess hair. If it falls short, you will probably want to extend it to that point. [1] X Research source Use a white makeup pencil or a very light stroke from your brow pencil to mark this spot if you don't want to lose its precise location when you move the pencil.

      "title": "Locate the ideal end point of your brow.",
      "content": "Locate the ideal end point of your brow. Ideally, your eyebrow should end at a 45-degree angle from the outer corner of your eye. Still holding the pencil against the side of your nostril, pivot the point of the pencil away from your nose and to the outer corner of your eye. That is where the tail of your eyebrow should be. [3] X Research source You can mark this spot with a light dot from your brow pencil, using that as a guide for tweezing or penciling in your brow later. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Find your ideal arch point.",
      "content": "Find your ideal arch point. Look straight forward and line up the outer edge of the pencil with the outer edge of your iris to find where your arch should begin. [5] X Research source Mark this spot with your white pencil so that you can find it easily for tweezing or penciling."

    {
      "title": "Determine if your eyebrows are the same height.",
      "content": "Determine if your eyebrows are the same height. Hold the pencil horizontally across the tops of your brows to check that they are about the same height. [6] X Research source If they are not, don't immediately try to pluck them to the same size. You'll use the pencil later to build them up to a similar height."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose the best eyebrow shape for your face.",
      "content": "Choose the best eyebrow shape for your face. Use the shape of your face to help you determine the best eyebrow shape for your features. If you have a round face, a sharp, high angle will open your eyes and elongate and balance the face. You can get away with most shapes if you have an oval face. If your face is very long, try extending the length of your brows and don't fill them too much or too dark. A heart-shaped face can be a challenge--too shaped or angled can be harsh and accentuate your forehead. Try a lower, straighter arch that follows your brow bone. If you have a square face, full, even dark, brows will balance out your angular jaw."

      "title": "Groom your brows based on how wide- or close-set your eyes are.",
      "content": "Groom your brows based on how wide- or close-set your eyes are. You can enhance your eyes by grooming your brows in a way that best accentuates the spacing of your eyes. If you have wide-set eyes, keep brows fairly natural. Focus more on grooming than on shaping and plucking. If your eyes are close together, leave the hair closest to your nose alone. Instead of making your eyes look wider, it will highlight their closeness. Extend your brows with a long, wide arch and don't go too thin or sharp."

      "title": "Pluck any stray hairs around your brows.",
      "content": "Pluck any stray hairs around your brows. If the tail of your eyebrow is longer than the point you marked, remove those hairs. Clean up the hairs that are outside your natural arch. Just don't get crazy and over-pluck. The lines of your brow don't have to be totally precise--this can look dated and severe. A feathered appearance is more natural. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Choose an eyebrow pencil.",
      "content": "Choose an eyebrow pencil. For most people, a shade of taupe will work, and is the best starting point for color. Taupe gives dark brows some depth and it doesn't overwhelm lighter hair. Test different shades on the side of your hand so you can see if the shade has warm or cool undertones. If you have red or strawberry-blonde hair, warm (red or orange-ish) tones will look good. Other hair colors should stick with cooler undertones (blues, greys, and rosy pinks). Blondes should try light taupe or a pencil one or two shades darker than their natural hair color. Brunettes should choose a pencil that one to two shades lighter than your hair color. Don't try black or a shade darker than your hair unless you want some angry, evil-looking brows. Those with raven black hair should still keep away from the black pencil. Instead, try dark brown or taupe. Redheads should try taupe and medium brown. Grey-haired gals should go for light brown or taupe instead of another shade of grey."

      "title": "Sharpen your pencil to a fine point.",
      "content": "Sharpen your pencil to a fine point. You are not coloring your brow in a solid line--rather, you are trying to make it look like many individual hairs. You can use a sharpener for eyeliner and brow pencils, but a sharpener for regular pencils will work, too. If your pencil is too soft or crumbles, keep it in the refrigerator between uses and it should hold together."

      "title": "Fill out your brows with light, upward strokes of the pencil.",
      "content": "Fill out your brows with light, upward strokes of the pencil. Focus on sparse areas, feathering the pencil strokes so they resemble natural hair. [8] X Research source The pigment should be concentrated on the arch and the tail of your eyebrow--the thicker area that is closer to your nose should be lighter and a little less dense. [9] X Research source If you found your brows were different heights, use the pencil to add hair to the top of the lower brow, instead of trying to even them out by tweezing the higher one. [10] X Research source Remember the saying that your eyebrows are sisters, not twins. They won't look exactly alike, and that's okay."

      "content": "Blend the color with a spoolie or brow brush. Again, using light strokes, brush the spoolie through your brow, from front to tail. This will soften and shade the color, making the brow look more natural. [11] X Research source Remember to focus the color on your arch and tail of your eyebrow."

[12] X Research source If you have made a mistake or want to highlight your brows and brighten your eyes, use a small brush to carefully line under your brow with concealer. Make sure you blend this down toward your lids so it looks natural and not severe. [13] X Research source For small mistakes, erase with the tip of a cotton swab dipped in concealer."

      "content": "Sketch the shape of your eyebrow. Use a small, angled brush dipped in brow powder or eyeshadow to very lightly sketch the shape of an eyebrow. You can use the pencil trick from method one to determine precisely where your brow should begin, arch, and end, or you can eyeball it. Drawing very lightly will allow you to easily erase the shape of the brow if you've made a mistake. You don't need it to be perfect--too precise an eyebrow won't look as natural."

Keep a sharp point throughout the process, and make sure you sharpen when switching to your other brow. Don't try this with an eyeliner pencil instead of a brow pencil--it will smear and rub off."
