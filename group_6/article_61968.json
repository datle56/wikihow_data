    {
      "title": "Set aside the necessary supplies.",
      "content": "Set aside the necessary supplies. You will need microwaveable grooming wax, tweezers, a makeup brush or Popsicle stick, a brow comb/brush, brow shading powder or pencil, a pair of small scissors, and strips of cotton fabric (from an old t-shirt is fine)."

      "title": "Rinse your face with warm water in order to open the hair follicles, which helps it be less painful.",
      "content": "Rinse your face with warm water in order to open the hair follicles, which helps it be less painful. Next, prepare to do the upper region of one brow. Only wax one brow at a time so that you can concentrate on what you’re doing. You don’t want any of it to get in your eye! If you feel jittery at all doing it yourself, then stop and have someone else it apply it for you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Outline your eyebrow with loose powder to mark the areas you are going to wax.",
      "content": "Outline your eyebrow with loose powder to mark the areas you are going to wax. This will ensure that you don’t remove more hair than you intended. Use a small makeup brush to apply the powder to your face. Alternatively, you can trace over the brow with an eyebrow pencil to create a stronger line of demarcation. You should make sure that the starting point, end point, and arch of each brow are clearly marked before beginning. You can do this by making dots with a makeup pencil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Microwave the container of wax, uncovered.",
      "content": "Microwave the container of wax, uncovered. Only microwave for 10 to 15 seconds, 5 to 10 seconds if less than half is in the jar. Don’t let it come to a boil, though, which it can easily. Stir to make sure it’s evenly heated. (It should be the consistency of warm honey.)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Dip into the wax using the Popsicle stick.",
      "content": "Dip into the wax using the Popsicle stick. Quickly but carefully, while the wax is still warm, glide the wax on the hair that you want removed between your brows or below the brow. You should apply the wax in the direction that the hair grows. Next, place a strip of fabric over the area, press firmly and rub over it going in the same direction that the hair grows. Let it set for a few seconds. Then pull your skin taut with your non-dominant hand and pull off the strip in the opposite direction than the hair grows. But don’t worry! It only grabs the hair, not the skin, so it shouldn’t be painful. Avoid pulling up and back, as this could result in pain. After you remove the strip, press your fingers onto the skin with firm pressure to minimize stinging. You should only wax under and between your brows, never over them. Waxing above your brows can result in an unnatural look."

    {
      "title": "Repeat the procedure on the opposite brow.",
      "content": "Repeat the procedure on the opposite brow. Take your time. You want it to match as perfectly as possible to the other brow. Otherwise, you’ll have eyebrows with two different shapes! Put soothing lotion onto the areas when you’re finished."
    },
    {
      "title": "Brush the eyebrow with your brow brush.",
      "content": "Brush the eyebrow with your brow brush. Then, using the comb side, gently comb the hair upwards. Trim any excess and long hairs (only the ones sticking over the comb) by cutting straight across with the scissors. Be careful to not cut into the actual brow."

      "content": "Shade both brows in lightly using brow pencil or powder. No one’s brows are perfect, even after waxing. This helps make them look more symmetrical."

      "title": "Mark the desired shape of your eyebrow.",
      "content": "Mark the desired shape of your eyebrow. You can use either powder or an eyebrow pencil. This will help you wax your brow without pulling hairs you want to stay. Use a small makeup brush to apply a powder in the shape of your brow, or use an eyebrow pencil to create the shape you want."

      "title": "Heat the mixture until it bubbles and turns brown.",
      "content": "Heat the mixture until it bubbles and turns brown. You need to find the right balance, though. If you don’t heat it long enough, it will be too soft and sticky. If you heat it too long, it turns into hard candy. You may have to experiment with a few batches until you get it right. Generally, 30 to 35 seconds is good. It will take longer to heat if you’re using the stove."

      "title": "Let it cool.",
      "content": "Let it cool. This part is also important. You won’t know if you’ve heated it too much until it cools down. If it’s too thick, dilute it with a little water."

      "content": "Apply the sugar wax with your stick or flat knife between or below your eyebrow. For safety reasons, only do one brow at a time. And if you feel jittery at all doing it yourself, stop and ask someone to apply for you. Remember you’re working with a small area. Be careful to not accidentally get wax on the area you just finished! If you do, though, it’s not the end of the world, just dab a little baby oil on it to take it off."

      "content": "Place a cloth strip on the brow. Press and smooth it in the same direction as the hair. Let it set for several seconds. Next, pull the cloth off in the opposite direction from the hair. Know ahead of time that sugar wax is not as painful as paraffin wax can sometimes be!."

Most waxing kits contain a pre-wax cleanser, a waxing applicator, paraffin wax, wax warmer, and pellon strips or muslin. Along with these items, it’s also good to have baby powder, tweezers, small scissors and baby oil, which is a great wax remover should you get it anywhere other than where you want!"

      "content": "Outline your eyebrow with either powder or an eyebrow pencil. You should mark the desired shape of your brow to make waxing easier. You can use a makeup brush to apply powder to mark the shape, or you can use an eyebrow pencil. Simply color in the shape of your brow."

If any hair remains, replace the strip and pull again. Be prepared. If you’re not used to how tweezing feels, it could be a little painful. To help with redness, put a soothing moisturizer on the brow. Aloe vera works well. Wipe off after a few minutes."
