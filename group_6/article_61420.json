      "content": "Understand what a matrix is. A matrix is a collection of numbers, called elements, arranged in a rectangle or a square. The numbers do not have to be positive, and they can be decimals or even complex numbers. A square matrix is, as the name suggests, a matrix that is square in shape, with the same number of columns and rows. In algebra, a matrix is usually represented by a capital letter in bold or underlined. The numbers in a matrix are surrounded by square (or curved, sometimes, but not curly) brackets."

      "content": "Learn how to add and subtract two matrices. Simply add or subtract the relevant elements. The matrices must have the same dimensions if you are to add or subtract them. In other words, A + B and A - B exist if and only if dim( A ) = dim( B )."

      "content": "Learn that matrix multiplication has a few quirks that aren't found in scalar multiplication: You can only multiply two matrices A x B if dim( A ) = m x n and dim( B ) = n x p A x B is not the same as B x A . The resultant matrix has dimensions dim( C ) = m x p, so it isn't the same size as the starting matrices (unless you are multiplying square matrices). If A x B is possible, B x A is only possible if m = p However, in common with scalar multiplication, A x( B x C ) = ( A x B )x C , and A x( B + C ) = A x B + A x C"

      "content": "Learn how to multiply two matrices. This can be a bit tricky until you get the hang of it. For A x B : Draw the matrices into a grid, like the one on the left of the photo. A goes on the left and B goes on top. For each element in the resultant matrix, consider the column and row that it is in. Multiply the first element in the row by the first element in the column. Do this for the second elements, and the third, and so on. Add up the products of the elements. This is the value of the element in the resultant matrix. Do this for each element in the resultant matrix."

      "content": "Learn how to calculate the determinant. This is a value that is used in calculating the inverse of a matrix. It is usually written as det( A ) or | A |. If you see a matrix with lines instead of square brackets, it means the determinant of that matrix. The determinant only exists for square matrices. For a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is simply ad-bc. For a 3x3 matrix, it's a bit trickier: a x minor(a) - b x minor(b) + c x minor(c)"

Say the element is in the first row and second column. It's position is 1,2. For an element at position i,j, calculate (-1) (i+j) . The cofactor is the minor multiplied by this value."

Multiplying the two together cancels them out, leaving the identity matrix. To take the inverse: Calculate | A | Calculate the cofactor of every element in the matrix. Replace every element in the matrix with its cofactor. This is matrix C . A -1 = C T /| A |"
