      "title": "Wear a standard turtleneck with a pleated or smooth neck for a simple look.",
      "content": "Wear a standard turtleneck with a pleated or smooth neck for a simple look. Traditionally, turtlenecks have one layer of fabric that extend up the neck. The neck can be tight and form-fitting, or have some slack in the fabric to create some pleats in the neck. Standard turtlenecks are the obvious choice if you have an average neck and want the freedom to dress the turtleneck up or play it down in a casual outfit. [1] X Research source Turtlenecks with a smoother layer of fabric on the neck are considered more modern than the looser varieties with pleats in them."

      "title": "Opt for a taller turtleneck if you have a thin neck.",
      "content": "Opt for a taller turtleneck if you have a thin neck. Often referred to as skivvies, these turtlenecks have higher, thicker fabric in the neck area. Sometimes, a longer piece of fabric is folded over itself to give the neck an additional layer. These turtlenecks are a smart choice if you think you have a skinnier neck or are a little taller than most people. [2] X Research source When trying on these items, make sure that the neck fabric isn’t extending past the corners of your cheekbones. If they’re took thick, they can make your neck look too big for your head."

      "title": "Choose a mock turtleneck if you have a shorter neck.",
      "content": "Choose a mock turtleneck if you have a shorter neck. Mock turtlenecks refer to turtlenecks with shorter pieces of fabric running up the neck. Mock turtlenecks are a great choice if you’re a little on the shorter side or don’t want to make too big of a statement with your outfit. [3] X Research source Many mock turtleneck sweaters come with a small zipper. These are great because you can unzip the sweater and fold the neck fabric down to create a collar. Some people find zippers unstylish, though."

      "content": "Get a tighter-fitting turtleneck if you’re layering clothing on top. Layering jackets, shirts, or sweaters over a turtleneck is a great way to create a unique look.

      "content": "Wear a solid-colored turtleneck with jeans for a versatile look. If you don’t want the slick, dark look of a black turtleneck, choose a more colorful option. Darker, warmer colors like burgundy, tan, and navy blue are great options. On their own, these turtlenecks feel a little softer than the traditional black, and are a great choice for when you’re heading out on the town during the cooler months without a light jacket. [7] X Research source While blue, black, or white jeans are ideal for a solid-colored turtleneck. You can wear any kind of shoes with a colorful turtleneck. It really depends on the temperature outside and where you’re going. Athletic shoes will work well if you’re just hanging out on the weekend.

      "content": "Wear khakis with a turtleneck sweater over a T-shirt for a preppy style. If you have a zipper on your turtleneck sweater, throw on a solid white or black T-shirt. Over it, pick a solid-colored turtleneck sweater that will contrast with your shirt and zip the sweater as needed. For sweaters without zippers, choose turtlenecks with elegant patterns. Plaid sweaters, sweaters with horizontal bands, and polka dot sweaters can all work well on their own. [8] X Research source Use simple knit caps and contemporary boots to compliment your turtleneck sweater. If it’s a little warmer out, feel free to trade the boots in for some boat shoes or loafers. Turtleneck sweaters already look a little preppy to begin with, so khakis compliment the look well."

      "content": "Put on a bomber jacket over your turtleneck for a retro vibe. A bomber jacket refers to a style of flight jacket with an upturned piece of fabric on the neck. Because the neckline of a bomber jacket runs up, it will match the high neckline of the turtleneck. This is a classic look reminiscent of old school fighter pilots. While it’s a retro look, it’s also quite warm. [9] X Research source Bomber jackets are traditionally green, gray, or brown. These colors will clash with brightly-colored pants, so keep the bottom half of your outfit muted. For your shoes, stylish boots, canvas sneakers, and athletic shoes will all work depending on where you’re going."
