And besides, who's going to know? Put on suitable shoes too. You may have a long walk. If it's icy, try to wear shoes or boots that give you some grip. Remember pavements and drives won't be gritted."

Make sure that you are usually finished and home around the same time so people know to look for you if you are delayed, if your bike got a puncture for example."
