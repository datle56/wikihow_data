    {
      "title": "“Open-box” means an item’s packaging has been opened.",
      "content": "“Open-box” means an item’s packaging has been opened. Not to be confused with used or refurbished items, an open-box product has simply had its packaging opened for some reason. It may have been returned—either because the buyer changed their mind, didn’t need it, wanted a different product, or for another reason. Thus, it’s possible for an open-box item to be totally unused. [1] X Research source However, don’t assume every open-box item is brand new and unused; depending on the store’s return policy, an item may have been used briefly by the person who first bought it. Open-box items may have a little wear or minor cosmetic damage if they’ve been used before—but generally, used open-box items have only been used lightly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Some open-box items are former floor models.",
      "content": "Some open-box items are former floor models. Floor models are what the store uses to show off a product—and though they never leave the store, buying them can actually be more risky than buying slightly used open-box items. Floor models are typically used quite a bit daily by interested customers, so they may have more wear and tear than other open-box items. [2] X Research source If possible, check to see whether an open-box item is a floor model or opened for some other reason. If it’s a floor model, it might be wiser to reconsider buying the item (and buy the product refurbished, gently used, or new instead, depending on availability and price)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open-box items are typically tested before being resold.",
      "content": "Open-box items are typically tested before being resold. Regardless of why an item is labeled open-box, stores often inspect them to make sure they’re working before selling them. However, the extent of that inspection can vary by store; some are thorough, while others just do a brief check. Typically, discounts on open-box items can be up to 20% off the original price. [3] X Research source So, although open-box products are generally functional, try to get a sense of how thoroughly it’s been tested by the store before buying it. Keep in mind that open-box items are also sometimes sold “as is,” which means they can’t be returned or exchanged—and may not have a warranty."
    },
    {
      "title": "Used items have been used by a previous buyer.",
      "content": "Used items have been used by a previous buyer. While it’s possible for an open-box item to be lightly used, labeling an item “open-box” doesn’t necessarily mean it’s been used; it may be brand new. On the other hand, items labeled “used” have definitely been used by a previous owner. Most stores label used items based on their condition and how much wear and tear they have. You might see used labels like: [4] X Research source Like New or Barely Used. This generally means an item looks brand new and comes with all original parts and accessories. Very Good Condition or Gently Used. This typically means an item has minor cosmetic damage but is still in good working condition. It may or may not be missing included originally accessories. Good Condition. These items usually show moderate signs of use but are still fully functional. They may not have original packaging or all original parts or accessories. Acceptable or Fair Condition. These items still work as intended but show significant wear and signs of use, which can include dents, scratches, and more. They’re often missing their original packaging and accompanying parts or accessories. Remember, the above is just a general guide; retailers classify their used items differently, so be sure to check a used item’s condition (and what it means) before buying!"

      "title": "Refurbished means an item was damaged and has been repaired.",
      "content": "Refurbished means an item was damaged and has been repaired. Refurbished items are different from both used and open-box. If an item has been refurbished, that typically means it’s pre-owned, but the store has repaired it to the point that it looks and works as though it’s brand new. Comparatively, open-box items may be new, but may not be. [5] X Research source Some stores may advertise refurbished and open-box items in the same place (or page on their website), but the two labels don’t mean the same thing. In some cases, buying a refurbished item may be safer than open-box—especially if you’re choosing between a floor model or refurbished product, for example. That’s because both are used, but refurbished products are guaranteed to work like new by the store. However, you can find great discounts on both refurbished and open-box items, so it’s worth taking a look at both (if possible) to see where the better deal is."

    {
      "title": "Return policy",
      "content": "Return policy Many open-box items work exactly like they’re supposed to, but some don’t. So, make sure you know what the store’s return policy on open-box items is; if you’re not sure a product will work, it may not be wise to buy something you can’t return. [6] X Research source Plus, check to see if there are any costs associated with returns—like a restocking fee or paying postage for online returns."
    },
    {
      "title": "Warranty",
      "content": "Warranty As mentioned above, some open-box products are still covered under the manufacturer’s warranty, but others aren’t. Warranties can help you get free repairs if an item breaks down, so check to see if the product you’re interested in has a warranty—and factor the answer into your final decision on whether to buy it. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wear and tear",
      "content": "Wear and tear If at all possible, look at the item before you buy it. In a store, ask to see the item directly—and if you’re online, look for pictures of the item so you can see if there’s any notable damage. This way, you can also check to see if the product comes with all its original accessories and parts (if any), like manuals, cables, batteries, and more. While checking for wear and tear, try to find out where the item is coming from and why it’s labeled open-box. Was it returned? Why? Is it a floor model? If you know why an item is labeled open-box, you’ll likely also get a sense of its condition. For example, if someone returned an item after a day because they wanted it in a different color, the open-box item is probably brand new or barely used."

      "title": "Discounts",
      "content": "Discounts Compare the price of an open-box item to its refurbished or brand new counterparts. Some open-box discounts can save you a decent amount of money, but if there’s not a huge difference in price between products, it might not be worth buying something open-box (since refurbished or brand new products are less of a risk). [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pros",
      "content": "Pros The main benefit of buying open-box items is the potential to save money and get a hefty price reduction compared to buying something brand new. Since it’s possible that an open-box item is unused itself, this can be like getting an easy discount on a brand new product. So, if you buy an unused open-box item with a warranty and return policy, it’s usually a solid, low-risk investment. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cons",
      "content": "Cons On the other hand, open-box items aren’t guaranteed to be brand new or even work like new (unlike refurbished items). So, if there’s no return policy or warranty on an open-box item (and you don’t know why it’s labeled open-box), it's possible to find yourself with an item that doesn’t work right and can’t be returned. [10] X Research source Sometimes, it can also be tough to tell how much wear and tear an open-box item has. Some stores might show you (or tell you about it), while others might not."

      "content": "Retailers like Best Buy and Amazon Warehouse sell open-box products. If you’re interested in buying an open-box product, try to do it from a retailer you trust. Popular retailers with open-box deals include Best Buy , Amazon Warehouse , Newegg , Wayfair , Pottery Barn , West Elm , and Walmart . Just be sure to double-check the return policy at each retailer you shop with! You can also get open-box products from eBay , although this can be more risky, since sellers aren’t all verified businesses. Before buying from an eBay seller, make sure they have plenty of positive ratings and feedback from other buyers!"
