      "content": "Buy extra-virgin coconut oil. Since your dog will be ingesting the oil, choose the highest quality coconut oil you can find. If possible, purchase organic oil. Avoid buying refined, bleached, and deodorized (RBD) coconut oil because the processing destroys nutrients.

      "content": "Give your dog the oil on a spoon or mixed into food. While you can give your dog 1 teaspoon (4 g) of coconut oil for every 10 pounds (4.5 kg) it weighs, you want to gradually work up to this amount. Start by feeding your dog 1/4 of this amount for a few days before you increase the amount. Feed the coconut oil directly off of the spoon or stir it into your dog's food. [3] X Research source If you feed your dog too much coconut oil right away, it may have diarrhea and indigestion. For example, if your dog weighs 20 pounds (9 kg), start by feeding your dog 1/2 teaspoon (2 g) of oil for a few days. Gradually work up to 2 teaspoons (8 g)."

      "content": "Balance the omega-3 oils in your dog's diet. Consider your dog's overall diet and ensure that it doesn't get too many essential fatty acids (omega-3s) that are found in coconut oil. If your dog takes a supplement that contains omega-3 oil, alternate days when you give your dog the supplement and coconut oil. Too much omega-3 can cause digestive problems, trouble with blood clotting, and insulin sensitivity. [4] X Research source For example, if you give your dog an omega-3 oil three days a week, alternate with the coconut oil for the other four days."

      "content": "Ask the veterinarian about using coconut oil in the long term. Some veterinarians are skeptical about the potential benefits of coconut oil on the dog's skin. Ask your veterinarian about giving your dog coconut oil as part of its regular diet. If your dog is overweight, the vet might recommend that you only give the oil in the short term because coconut oil contains 120 calories for every tablespoon (12 g)."

      "title": "Purchase high-quality coconut oil.",
      "content": "Purchase high-quality coconut oil. Look for an unrefined, extra-virgin, organic coconut oil since it will be higher in nutrients than highly refined coconut oils. Avoid using refined, bleached, and deodorized (RBD) coconut oil. Keep in mind that coconut oil might become liquid if it's in a warm location, but will harden as it cools.

      "title": "Warm the oil between your hands.",
      "content": "Warm the oil between your hands. If the coconut oil is in liquid form, spoon about 1/2 teaspoon (2 g) of coconut oil into the palm of one hand. Rub your hands together so they're coated with the oil. If you're using coconut oil that is solid, scoop a small spoonful into your hand and rub your palms together for a minute. The coconut oil will soften and become liquid."

      "content": "Put a sweater on your dog. Don't worry if your dog immediately licks the coconut oil off of its fur or skin, since it's safe to ingest. But if you're concerned that the coconut oil isn't coming into contact with your dog's skin or fur, you might need to put a sweater on your dog. The sweater will prevent the dog from licking off the oil."
