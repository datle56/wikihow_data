      "content": "Medium value The Soft Summer color palette has a medium value, meaning it doesn’t have primarily dark or light colors. Because of this, Soft Summers can style a variety of color shades without overpowering their natural glow. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Neutral or cool skin tone",
      "content": "Neutral or cool skin tone Soft Summers usually have a neutral or cool skin tone with an ashy or pink undertone. More often than not, if you’re a Soft Summer, silver and gold jewelry looks good on you. You probably have freckles, too. Determine your skin tone by looking at the color of the veins on the inside of your wrist. Soft Summers tend to have green, blue, or purple veins."

    {
      "title": "Ashy blonde or brown hair",
      "content": "Ashy blonde or brown hair If you’re a Soft Summer, your hair might have gray undertones, giving it a dull or ashy tone. Your hair may be lighter but darker than a dirty blond, and if it’s dark, it’s likely too light to be considered a deep brown or charcoal."

[5] X Research source Bright yellows and bold reds can drain your complexion and overpower your natural glow. Here’s a quick overview of what colors you should and shouldn’t wear as a Soft Summer: Colors to wear: Gray brown Gray green Almond Dark lava Gray blue Light blue Light green Gray teal Muted purple Tuscan red Colors to avoid: Sunflower yellow Orange Mustard Tomato red Caramel Lime green Bright pink Royal blue Can Soft Summers wear black? Black isn’t included in the Soft Summer palette because its dark tone can overpower the season’s muted tones. Instead of wearing black, try a dark berry or lava to bring out your best features."

      "title": "Patterns",
      "content": "Patterns As a Soft Summer, stick to muted, low-contrast prints. Bold and busy patterns can overpower your natural glow and be too harsh against your skin tone. So, rather than reaching for a loud Hawaiian shirt, opt for something with a dainty floral pattern or very light and dark colors together. Abstract and watercolor prints typically gear towards a Soft Summer color palette. With geometric patterns, stick with softer lines and cool tones. Wear stripes and plaids as long as they feature colors from the color palette. Animal prints are more than okay if they’re muted and feature a gray-tone scale (such as a gray leopard print or blue snakeskin)."

      "content": "Makeup Soft Summers shine in neutral, cooler tones. Avoid bright and warm tones, such as coral blushes, golden eyeshadows, and orange lipsticks if you're a Soft Summer. Instead, opt for natural tones with a blue base, such as dusty purples, grays, and pearly whites. Rather than a bold, red lip, opt for a muted red with a neutral undertone (which isn’t too deep or bright). Gravitate toward eyeshadow palettes with muted pinks, blues, grays, and browns. Opt for a dusty pink, mauve, or berry blush. Highlight your eyes with a gray smokey eye."

Because of the natural gray tones in your skin, it’s best to stay away from warm, bold, and vibrant colors that could wash you out. For instance, opt for a medium ash blonde color over a honey, strawberry, or platinum blonde. [6] X Research source"
