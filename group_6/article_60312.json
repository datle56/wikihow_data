Squats are safe to perform every day, with the understanding that rest days are necessary for your muscles to recover properly. Incorporate 1-2 rest days per week to give your body a chance to heal, especially after an intense workout. [32] X Research source As a beginner, start with 1 set of 15 to 20 reps. If you feel up to it, increase the number of sets or reps as you proceed through the challenge. It’s best to vary your squat type rather than repeating the same squat for 30 days so your body doesn’t plateau. Adding variety keeps the workout engaging and stimulates other muscles in your body. Give your body a break and switch up your fitness challenge for a month before repeating the squat challenge so your body doesn’t get too adjusted to the movement. If you’re experiencing weak knees or a knee-related injury, a 30-day challenge may not be the best fit for you. Incorporate more rest days or lessen the reps."
