      "title": "Rational",
      "content": "Rational Type Cs prioritize logical thinking and rarely get carried away by emotions. They problem-solve by carefully analyzing a situation and all the details involved and making an informed choice. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Consistent",
      "content": "Consistent Type Cs are sturdy, stable, and reliable. They typically follow a consistent schedule and appreciate a structured routine. They’re also consistent in their relationships: they value others’ opinions and are always there to turn to for assistance or support. Their consistency not only makes them popular among friends and in the workplace; it also helps them feel safe and in control. The “shadow” side of this trait is their aversion to change . Even minor changes may be difficult for type Cs to adjust to, whether in the workplace or their personal life, especially if they are unexpected or unwanted changes. They may also have a hard time letting go of the past. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Controlled",
      "content": "Controlled Type Cs are outwardly calm and rational even in high-stress situations. They are skilled at maintaining control over their emotions and at managing the emotions of others. [3] X Research source Their desire for control may lead them to exhibit perfectionist tendencies. They have high standards for themselves and for others and may take it hard when they fail. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Their high standards make them a strong employee, because they take pride in their work and always get it done. Their careful, controlled, and rational personality often makes them detail-oriented and able to excel in more technical careers. They typically pick up on small details others easily overlook and are skilled at identifying how the puzzle pieces come together to form one big picture. In other words, they see the forest and the trees."
    },
    {
      "title": "Creative",
      "content": "Creative They’re logical and fact-oriented, but their ability to easily pick up on seemingly minor details helps them find creative ways to problem-solve and find new, innovative solutions to problems others can’t seem to solve."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cooperative",
      "content": "Cooperative Despite their reliance on logic and rationality, type Cs are very sensitive to the needs of others and find it easy to work as part of a team, though they’re prone to sacrificing their own needs and wants in favor of the needs and wants of others. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Conflict-avoidant",
      "content": "Conflict-avoidant Type Cs are very accommodating of others, to the point of being non-confrontational. When it comes to standing up for themselves or giving in to another person’s demands and not rocking the boat, they’ll often choose the latter in order to keep the peace and not be perceived as needy or dramatic. [6] X Research source They tend to be outwardly passive , often putting others before themselves, but inwardly, they may grow resentful and pessimistic if their needs aren’t met or if they feel ignored.

    },
    {
      "title": "Emotionally restrained",
      "content": "Emotionally restrained Type Cs rely on facts and logic not because they struggle to understand or feel emotions, but because they may fear their own emotions, especially strong emotions. It’s often easier for a type C to ignore big feelings like rage or despair than to engage with them—but holding in these emotions may lead to complications down the road. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Because they so often hold back their emotions from others and from themselves, type Cs may struggle with stress and depression, as well as feelings of being misunderstood by others, since they don’t often communicate what they’re really thinking or feeling. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "They’re skilled at working independently or in a team.",
      "content": "They’re skilled at working independently or in a team. While type As gravitate towards leadership roles and type Ds prefer to work alone, type Cs are more versatile and adapt well to working in a group or on their own as the situation demands. This makes them an ideal candidate for many workplaces, as they’re equipped to cooperate with coworkers but also thrive when left to their own devices."

    {
      "title": "They’re excellent decision-makers.",
      "content": "They’re excellent decision-makers. Because a type C’s judgment is rarely clouded by emotion and they’re so detail-oriented, they make terrific problem-solvers, easily understanding what steps need to be taken in order to come to a solution."

    {
      "title": "They’re hard workers.",
      "content": "They’re hard workers. Because they have such high standards and are such skilled problem-solvers, type Cs make excellent, dedicated workers who are able to prioritize their mission above their own feelings."
    },
    {
      "title": "They can be overly submissive.",
      "content": "They can be overly submissive. Type Cs may easily give in to the needs and wants of more dominant personality types. They may be eager to please or simply eager to avoid confrontation. [10] X Research source While this is sometimes a positive quality, it may also lead to the type C sacrificing their own needs and wants for others or not speaking up when they observe incorrect behavior for fear of rocking the boat."
    },
    {
      "title": "They may resist change.",
      "content": "They may resist change. Type Cs are consistent, reliable, and hardworking, but they’re easily thrown off course when plans change or they’re forced to shift out of their routine. They may find it difficult to adjust to even miniscule changes. While type C is skilled at handling even complex problems, small, unexpected changes can negatively affect their ability to problem-solve or stay focused on their responsibilities."

    {
      "title": "They may be emotionally avoidant.",
      "content": "They may be emotionally avoidant. Type Cs prefer to keep things organized and consistent, and emotions are often anything but. This personality type may choose to avoid their own emotions when they can, especially if their feelings are inconvenient to others, which can lead to stress, loneliness, and resentment. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This may also make it difficult for type Cs to rely on others and form emotional connections. They may refuse to speak up when something is bothering them, leading to conflict within their relationships. [12] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "They work well alone or with people.",
      "content": "They work well alone or with people. Because type C's are so cooperative, they're great team players and know how to listen to others' needs and understand where they're coming from. But they're independent at heart, and they excel when working alone on a project on which they can really focus and not have to rely on anyone else's input. Type C's pull their own weight and take pride in their accomplishments, so even when they're working alone or according to their own schedule, they'll thrive. Though they can work well with others, they can become overwhelmed when there is too much going on or too many people around."

    {
      "title": "They may not excel in a fast-paced environment.",
      "content": "They may not excel in a fast-paced environment. Because type Cs are resistant to change, fast-paced or unstable work environments may not be the right place for them. Alternatively, they often excel in steady, consistent environments where they are in control of their own schedule or where they adhere to a specific routine. They may appreciate remote jobs because remote work may allow them to work without distraction and to set their own pace."

      "title": "They may be more prone to poor mental health.",
      "content": "They may be more prone to poor mental health. Due to their resistance to change, their neuroticism, and their tendency to withhold emotions, type Cs may suffer from mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and stress more than other types. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Excessive stress may compromise the type C’s immune system, leaving them at risk of physical health concerns.
