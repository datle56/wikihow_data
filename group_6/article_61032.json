      "content": "1. When you steal their hoodies . Guys think you look incredibly cute swimming in their oversized hoodies. It also helps them feel closer to you, knowing you’re all cozied up in their clothes. Just be sure to give it back at some point, please. 2. When you tell them about their star sign. We might roll our eyes when you break out the word “cusp,” but we secretly love it. Who doesn’t like hearing about themselves? And if you reveal that the two of us are compatible? Instant validation and connection. 3. Being asked for help or advice. We’re not here to make general statements on masculinity, but it’s a fact that many men like to feel like providers for the people they love. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Whether we’re opening that tight jar or getting something down from the top shelf, helping you makes us feel useful, which makes us feel good. 4. Listening to your music. It’s not that men aren’t allowed to be Swifties, that’s just not usually their scene. So when you grab the aux, put on some 1984, and give them an excuse to just vibe, they’re all about it. Bonus points if you encourage them to sing along. 5. When you brag about them in public. Dating coach Imad Jbara says, “The most attractive thing a girl can do is actually stroke our egos.” Manners make us keep things humble, but we’ll never turn down a little hype every now and then. 6. Head and back scratches. It’s like our own mini massage session, and heaven knows we need to get some tension out of our shoulders. Scritch-scratch away! 7. Getting their eyebrows tweezed. Speaking of self-care, even guys need some primping and preening now and then, but they usually don’t bother with it themselves. So when you break out the tweezers and tilt their chin back, they might fuss, but they won’t turn away. 8. Getting called cute nicknames. Men are suckers for pet names and doting compliments , and the mushier, the better. Dating coach John Keegan lists some for us: “Adorable. Cute. Handsome… good looking. Sweet, kind, sexy. Cool, fun, easygoing. Creative, masculine.” 9. When you ask his opinion on your outfit. Look, we know that you’re going to wear that dress anyway, or that you were already planning to switch to the other one, but we like to be included. And any opportunity to send some compliments your way is a win. 10. Good morning and goodnight texts. No, it’s not annoying and it doesn’t bother us. Actually, it’s the highlight of our day, hearing from you right when we wake up and again before we hit the hay. Go ahead, send that good morning text . 11. When you lay on their chest. Everyone needs a little intimacy, though men don’t always like to admit it. [2] X Research source But when you go full weighted blanket and lie on top of your guy while you both scroll or just generally chill? Bliss. 12. Being the little spoon. Sure, being the big spoon lets men feel like protectors, but who’s to say men don’t need to feel protected every now and then? Plus, research shows that men who play the little spoon every so often make for better, more sensitive partners. [3] X Research source 13. Goofy little displays of affection. Pokes, tickles, butt smacks, hand-holding, running start hugs, ruffling our hair. We sigh and whine, but we’re all about it. We love the attention, and we love when it comes from you. 14. When you make the first move. Gender roles are antiquated, and guys love it when the girl is the one to take the lead. It gives them a chance to sit back and be the one being pursued, rather than the pursuer."

Physical affection. Did you know physical intimacy reduces stress hormones? [6] X Research source Showing your affection through touch seems like a no-brainer, but it’s too often taken for granted, and guys can feel it when it’s missing.

A little independence. Even in the healthiest relationships, partners need some alone time and the ability to do their own thing. The important thing here is that you both trust each other to make good decisions, even when you’re physically apart.
