      "content": "Apply an antihistamine or corticosteroid cream to their skin. It's pretty common for the sting area to start itching after it's turned red.

      "content": "Give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen to manage the pain. If you've got children's pain medication at home, it's completely fine to give them some.

      "content": "Swelling and redness can last for 7 days. Unfortunately, swelling and redness are really common with kids and wasp stings—the area might keep swelling up to 48 hours after the sting. Swelling can start to go away in the following days, but it's not uncommon for the skin to be red and swollen for up to a week. [9] X Research source If your child was stung near their neck or throat and it's swelling up, you need to get them emergency medical attention. The swelling could make it hard for them to breathe. Don't be surprised if the skin swells and gets red around the sting—you may see it extend up to 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) away from the sting. [10] X Research source"
