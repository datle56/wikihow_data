      "content": "The weed may have a chemical smell. Typically, marijuana has a natural, earthy, grass-like smell. If you pick up on any chemical-like or unnatural type of scent, your marijuana may be laced with another substance or have contaminants in it. [1] X Research source Some people also report a strong chemical odor, similar to paint thinner, which they associate with fentanyl contamination. However, it's not recommended to try tasting or smelling the substance, as those are common ways fentanyl is ingested. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "The color is too dull or overly bright. Many strains of weed have complex color differences, such as disbursements of red, orange, blue, or purple, making it tricky to spot bad weed based on color alone. However, laced weed can look very off. For example, it may appear to have strange spots or look suspiciously dull or obnoxiously bright. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "White specks might fall off of laced weed.",
      "content": "White specks might fall off of laced weed. If you notice white specks in your weed, it may indicate the presence of another drug. Also, natural weed is mildly sticky, so nothing should be flaking off. In fact, when you touch genuine weed, the trichomes may stick to your fingers, so any white or powdery substances falling off on their own could mean the weed is laced. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "The effects after smoking it feel different from typical weed. The effects of laced marijuana can vary widely depending on the type and amount of other drugs present. Weed laced with drugs like cocaine, meth, or PCP often produces the oppositeâ€”a rush of energy and hyperactivity instead of a calm, drowsy high. [5] X Research source Other common side-effects of laced weed include: Experiencing no psychoactive effects at all as a result of additives Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or other signs of illness Difficulty breathing, dizziness, lightheadedness, or feelings of derealization Significant alterations in heart rate or blood pressure Insomnia, decreased appetite, nervousness or jitteriness, or irritability Psychotic effects like hallucinations, delusions, confusion, or disorientation"

These kits can reliably detect the presence of dangerous substances like fentanyl or methamphetamine. Simply take a small sample and follow the kit's instructions. While it may seem like an extra step, it's better to be cautious and ensure your cannabis is free of harmful or dangerous adulterants."

      "content": "Laced weed is marijuana mixed with another substance. Marijuana is less likely to be intentionally laced compared to other drugs, but it does occasionally happen. Drug dealers will sometimes lace marijuana with stronger, more addictive substances. The goal is typically to add weight and volume to the weed so it appears more substantial, allowing dealers to charge higher prices.
