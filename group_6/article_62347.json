      "content": "“Which of the following” invites the reader to choose from a list of options. As a phrase, “the following” is a synonym of “the next.” [2] X Research source When worded as “which of the following,” the phrase refers to a list of items or options that come next . These types of questions are pretty common on multiple-choice exams, as they test your knowledge on a really specific topic or skill. [3] X Research source Which of the following is correct? Which of the following is a preposition? Which of the following are mammals? Which of the following are sedimentary rocks?"

      "content": "Use “which of the following” before listing multiple items. A “which of the following” question is most commonly found on a quiz or test, but you can still sprinkle it into your texts and emails when you’re asking someone to choose from a list of options. You could ask something like: [4] X Research source Which of the following is your favorite pizza topping? Which of the following cities have you visited? Which of the following is your favorite animal? Since a “which of the following” question always includes a follow-up list of options, you probably won’t be using it in your verbal conversations."

      "content": "You say “which of the following,” not “which of the followings.” “The following” means “the next,” which lines up with the correct meaning of the phrase. \"Followings\" would be grammatically incorrect in this context.

      "content": "Use “which of the following is ” when the second half of the sentence is singular. “Which of the following is ” implies that the reader is looking for a singular answer rather than multiple options. [6] X Research source Let’s say you’re looking at the test question “Which of the following is a reptile?\" “Lizard,” “seal,” “bear,” and “dog” are listed as possible answers. The question uses the verb is , because only a lizard is a reptile."

      "content": "Use “which of the following are ” when the second part of the sentence is plural. “Which of the following are ” indicates that the reader needs to pick out multiple options rather than just one. If you’re asking a question that has more than one correct answer, use “which of the following are.” [7] X Research source For example, you’d use “which of the following are” for a question like “which of the following are polygons,” where you’d invite the reader to pick multiple polygons out of a list."
