      "content": "A parcel locker is used to store large packages delivered by USPS. Many large, communal neighborhoods (typically apartment complexes, townhouses, and condominiums) use CBUs to organize and store residential mail—they’re basically large lockers made up of small, lockbox-style mailboxes (with each resident getting a key to their own mailbox). Parcel lockers are larger lockboxes attached to or installed near a CBU, and they essentially act as “overflow” that the USPS uses for larger packages. [1] X Research source Parcel lockers are different from USPS Smart Lockers, which are electronic lockers found in the lobbies of USPS offices. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a key in your regular CBU mailbox. Parcel lockers can only be opened with a specialized key that your local USPS office has—your regular mail key won’t do the trick. When a USPS employee plays your package in a parcel locker, they’ll place the corresponding key in your mailbox. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the locker key to see which parcel locker your package is in.",
      "content": "Check the locker key to see which parcel locker your package is in. CBUs have multiple parcel lockers, so check the label written on the keychain to see which locker your package is in. Your key will only work in the specified parcel locker. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Unlock the parcel locker and retrieve your package.",
      "content": "Unlock the parcel locker and retrieve your package. Once you insert the key into the lock, it’ll stay put, and you won’t be able to remove it. That’s okay—a USPS employee will retrieve the key the next time they’re at your neighborhood’s CBU. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "You don’t request parcel box deliveries—they’re done automatically.",
      "content": "You don’t request parcel box deliveries—they’re done automatically. As long as you’re ordering a decently large package with a merchant that ships via USPS, there’s a good chance that your parcel will end up in a parcel locker. If the package is small enough, it might fit in your regular CBU mailbox (and a parcel locker won’t be necessary)."

    {
      "title": "How long will a package stay in a parcel locker?",
      "content": "How long will a package stay in a parcel locker? USPS doesn’t actually give an exact estimate on their website, but some people estimate that USPS will leave packages in parcel lockers for at least a few days."

    {
      "title": "I never received a parcel locker key. What do I do?",
      "content": "I never received a parcel locker key. What do I do? If you never received a parcel locker key, visit your local USPS office and see if they can help locate your package for you. You can also reach USPS at their customer service line: 1-800-275-8777. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "What happens if I don’t pick up my package?",
      "content": "What happens if I don’t pick up my package? A USPS employee will remove the package and return it to the USPS building. Visit your local USPS branch if you suspect that you’ve missed your delivery window for your parcel locker package."
    },
    {
      "title": "Why was the package delivered to a parcel locker rather than my door?",
      "content": "Why was the package delivered to a parcel locker rather than my door? Placing your package in a parcel locker keeps it secure and helps prevent theft. If you live in a neighborhood with Cluster Box Units (CBUs) rather than individual mailboxes, USPS employees will typically put large packages in parcel lockers rather than leaving them outside your door."
