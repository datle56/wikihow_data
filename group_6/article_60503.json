      "content": "Eating poop can also be a behavioral issue. Often, dogs who engage in eating poop do so out of boredom, anxiety, or isolation. Studies show that dogs who are kept alone rather than with humans are more likely to engage in poop-eating. If you’ve been keeping your dog out of the way somewhere, like in a kennel or a basement, they might be showing that they’re upset by eating their own poop.

Try playing fun games or hiding treats for them to find to exercise their mind as well as their body. A lot of times, young dogs will experience anxiety during house training. If they have an accident inside, they will eat the poop to “get rid of evidence,” but that only gets them punished more. Eating poop can also be a habit dogs learn from their mother. Fortunately, your dog can be trained out of this habit or discouraged from doing it, especially if they’re still young. [4] X Research source"
