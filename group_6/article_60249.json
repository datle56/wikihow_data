Yoda tends to structure his sentence in the object-subject-verb agreement manner instead of our modern way of structuring sentences with the subject-verb-object agreement. [1] X Research source For example, \"I play soccer\" becomes \"Soccer, I play.\" when Yoda says it. \"This is my home.\" --> \"My home, this is.\" \"I will stay and help you.\" --> \"Stay and help you, I will.\""

      "title": "Be mindful of Yoda's vocal cadence and tonality.",
      "content": "Be mindful of Yoda's vocal cadence and tonality. Yoda's pace of speaking is very important to be aware of. He speaks quite quickly at times but with an intelligible rhythm.
