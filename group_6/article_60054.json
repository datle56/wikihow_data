      "content": "Observe the goiter and see if it shrinks on its own. After your doctor examines the goiter, they may decide that it isn’t causing major problems. In this case, they’ll simply use a “wait and see” approach. If the goiter doesn’t get any worse, then they’ll probably leave it alone without any specific treatment. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your doctor will probably want you to come back in for regular exams to monitor the goiter. If it grows or starts causing problems, then they’ll probably start treatment."

      "title": "Take hormone medications to regulate your thyroid.",
      "content": "Take hormone medications to regulate your thyroid. A goiter can be caused by an over or under-active thyroid, and you need medication for either condition. Hormone replacement should bring your thyroid function back into balance and shrink the goiter. For hyperthyroidism, an overactive thyroid, common medications include methimazole and propylthiouracil. These should slow your thyroid function and treat the goiter. For hypothyroidism, an underactive thyroid, the common medication is levothyroxine. This should boost your thyroid function."

      "content": "Treat the swelling with anti-inflammatory medications. Along with hormone therapy, your doctor may also recommend anti-inflammatory drugs to try and shrink the goiter. In most cases, over-the-counter drugs like aspirin will work. Follow your doctor’s instructions and take the medication as directed.

      "content": "Shrink your thyroid with radioactive iodine treatments. Radioactive iodine is an oral medication that attacks the thyroid gland. It’s sometimes used on a very overactive thyroid. The medication reduces the thyroid’s activity and shrinks it, which should get rid of the goiter. If your doctor prescribes this medication, take it exactly as directed. Radioactive iodine destroys the thyroid gland, so you’ll probably have to take thyroid hormones for the rest of your life afterward."

      "content": "Undergo thyroid-removal surgery for severe cases. If the goiter is very large and causing breathing problems, then the doctor will probably recommend surgery to remove it. A surgeon will make a small incision on the front of your neck and shave away part of your thyroid. This gets rid of the goiter and relieves pressure in your neck. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Surgeons try to remove enough of the thyroid to treat the goiter but leave enough so the thyroid can function properly. This isn’t always possible, however, so you may need to take thyroid hormones after the surgery."
