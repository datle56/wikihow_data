Frame rate is a measure of how \"fast\" a game is running. Frame rates are usually measured in frames per second (FPS.) Motion in computer games is actually an illusion created by a rapidly changing series of still images called frames. The more images shown per second, the smoother and clearer the motion in the game will appear. Frame rate overlay is a feature which displays the game's current frame rate in one corner of the screen. Graphically intense portions of the game can result in a low frame rate - the overlay will display this and any other fluctuations in a game's frame rate. Benchmarking is a process by which a game's average frame rate is calculated for a certain length of time."
