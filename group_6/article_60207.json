      "content": "Remember that U, D, L, R, F, and B create the 6 cube faces. Hold your Rubik’s cube in 1 hand, keeping the puzzle upright as you hold it. To have an easier time solving the puzzle, assign labels to all 6 faces. Label the top face as “Upper” (or “U”), the bottom face as “Down” (or “D”), the leftmost face as “Left” (or “L”), the rightmost face as “Right” (or “R”), the front face as “Front” (or “F”), and the back face as “Back” (or “B”). [1] X Research source Always keep the cube in the same position as you complete the puzzle, or else you won’t be able to solve it properly."

      "title": "Perform a ¼ clockwise turn when a single letter is shown.",
      "content": "Perform a ¼ clockwise turn when a single letter is shown. Grip the edges of a cube face and rotate it clockwise by 90 degrees. Use this small turn whenever the algorithm specifies a single letter. [2] X Research source Unless specified, always perform a ¼ turn in a clockwise direction. For example: Imagine that the upper face is completely green, while the front face is completely red. Grab the edge of the front face and rotate it 90 degrees clockwise to perform a ¼ turn. At this point, 1 row of the green squares will now be visible of the right face of the cube."

      "title": "Use a ½ clockwise turn whenever you see the number 2.",
      "content": "Use a ½ clockwise turn whenever you see the number 2. Keep an eye out for algorithm shorthand that includes both numbers and letters. If you see a “2” immediately after a letter, rotate 1 face of the cube by a full 180 degrees. Keep in mind that ½ turns are also clockwise, unless the algorithm specifies otherwise. [3] X Research source For instance: Pretend that the upper face of the cube is white, the right face is blue, the bottom/down face is orange, the left face is red, and the front face is green. If the algorithm says “F2,” grip the front face of the cube and rotate it 180 degrees. Once you finish turning the front face, the bottom row of the upper face will be orange."

      "content": "Do a counter-clockwise ¼ turn when you see an apostrophe ( ’ ). Keep an eye out for stray apostrophes, as they can make your puzzle-solving experience much more difficult. While most algorithm steps require you to turn the cube clockwise, this punctuation requires you to turn the cube in the opposite direction. Double check all algorithms before you rotate anything so your puzzle doesn’t get jumbled. [4] X Research source For example: Imagine again that upper face is green, while the front face is red. Turn the front face 90 degrees to the left whenever you see an apostrophe listed in the algorithm (e.g., U’, F’). More often than not, counter-clockwise movements are used for ¼ turns, but not ½ turns."

Since the Professor cube is much larger than its 3x3x3 counterpart, you‘ll need to rotate the cube in larger amounts in order to solve the puzzle. [5] X Research source For instance, if a puzzle algorithm reads “Rw,” perform a ¼ turn using 2 layers of the right face. If you see an apostrophe after the “w,” be sure to turn the cube counter-clockwise."

When you see the letter “x,” turn the cube clockwise on its invisible x-axis. If you see the letter “y,” rotate the cube clockwise on its invisible y-axis. If you notice an apostrophe next to the “x” or “y,” rotate the cube counter-clockwise instead. [7] X Research source Imagine that you have a Rubik's cube with a white upper face, a red front face, a yellow bottom/down face, an orange back face, a blue right face, and a green left face. If you see “x” listed in the algorithm, rotate the cube so that red becomes the upper face. If you see “y” in the algorithm, turn the cube so that white remains the upper face, but blue becomes the front face. If you see x’ or y’ in the algorithm, perform these actions in reverse."

To start, try using the F R’ D’ R F2 algorithm to get a cross on the upper layer of the cube. [8] X Research source This algorithm is most commonly used on 3x3x3 cubes. For more information on algorithms specific to 5x5x5 cubes, check out this resource: https://protofusion.org/idiots_guide_to_rubiks_cube/oldsite/5x5x5.html .

To solve the second algorithm, turn the front face clockwise, the right face counter-clockwise, the front face counter-clockwise, and the right face clockwise.
