      "content": "They may be throwing out a random comment to cover up a crush. This person might really like you, but they’re not ready to admit that. If they keep finding reasons to talk to you, that's a clue that they have some feelings for you. [2] X Research source Maybe they’ve developed an interest in you over time and after getting to know you, or they’ve admired you from a distance. They might also bring up a common interest and say something like, \"You play that video game, too? You nerd!\" If they keep making the same running joke, they might want to stand out so you remember them."

      "content": "They may be insecure about their own performance in school. If your crush feels like they’re behind on their work, your success will remind them that they’re struggling. When they see you shine academically, they may start to doubt themselves and act like hard work doesn’t really matter.

When your crush sees you get an \"A\" or hear a teacher compliment you, they'll probably secretly compare themselves to you, then make a rude comment.

[4] X Trustworthy Source StopBullying.gov Website run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services providing information related to identifying and preventing bullying Go to source Your crush probably also wants to set themselves apart from anyone who doesn’t seem “cool” or who doesn’t prioritize popularity. The person you like might say something rude just because they think it makes them look more “tough” or powerful. If your crush just wants to lash out, they’re probably struggling at home or with some personal issues. That still doesn’t excuse their behavior, though, and you should report them to people you trust."
