      "content": "Tuck your laces beneath the tongue and step on them. First, lace up your shoes in their default lacing pattern, with the ends of the laces dangling and untied. Don’t tighten the laces—instead, slip them under the tongue of your shoe, so they won’t be a tripping hazard when you’re out and about. Then, you can slip on your shoes, with your feet holding the laces in place. [1] X Research source This helps keep your shoe secure and saves you from a nasty spill!"

      "title": "Grab the sections of lace along the wide part of your shoe’s tongue.",
      "content": "Grab the sections of lace along the wide part of your shoe’s tongue. Give these laces a couple of good tugs, so both ends of your laces grow shorter and shorter. Keep pulling on this front portion until the ends of your laces are only about 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) long. Then, slip your foot into the shoe for an easy, seamless fit. [2] X Research source You don’t need to tuck in the ends of your shoelaces—they’ll be short enough on their own."

      "title": "Lace up your shoes loosely and trim off the ends.",
      "content": "Lace up your shoes loosely and trim off the ends. Leave at least 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of lace left over, and toss out the extra bits that you just cut off. Squeeze a dot of super glue along the frayed ends of your laces, and follow the recommended drying time on the bottle. Once your laces are sealed and ready to go, feel free to wear them outside! [3] X Research source You can also order heat shrink tubing for your laces online and seal them off that way."

      "title": "Knot your laces separately if your shoes are a little too big.",
      "content": "Knot your laces separately if your shoes are a little too big. Grab your right shoelace, which is sticking out of the right side eyelet. Tie this lace into a simple knot along the outside of the eyelet, leaving 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of lace sticking out the side. Repeat this with the left shoelace, along with both shoelaces of your other shoe. [4] X Research source This technically requires you to “tie” your laces, but you won’t be tying them together."

      "title": "Tie your laces together into a bow.",
      "content": "Tie your laces together into a bow. Slide the bow off and beneath the tongue, so it’s completely hidden from view. While you’re technically tying your shoes for this one, it’ll look like your shoes are untied! [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Lace up your shoes in a criss-cross pattern while skipping an eyelet.",
      "content": "Lace up your shoes in a criss-cross pattern while skipping an eyelet. Pull your laces through the 2 bottom eyelets. Then, thread your right lace through the third eyelet on the left side of the shoe. Do the same thing with the left lace, threading it through the third eyelet along the right side. Repeat this criss-cross pattern up the tongue of your shoe, skipping an eyelet on each side as you go. Once you’ve finished, knot your laces beneath the tongue of your shoe, so no one can see them."

    {
      "title": "Point your shoe forward and thread both ends of your laces through the lowest row of eyelets.",
      "content": "Point your shoe forward and thread both ends of your laces through the lowest row of eyelets. Then, take the right lace and skip the first eyelet, pulling it upwards through the second hole. Pull the left lace upwards through the first eyelet, and then drag it straight across your shoe, creating a horizontal line. Repeat the same motion with your right lace, dragging it across the shoe to create a second horizontal bar. Follow this pattern up the tongue of your shoe, creating a “ladder” of horizontal bars up your shoe. Knot the laces together along the inside of your shoe beneath the tongue, so they aren’t visible to the naked eye.
