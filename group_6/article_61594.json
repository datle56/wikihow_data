Advanced users can create their own functions using Google Apps Script. For example, you could create a simple script to add the time and date automatically . Here are a few common Google Sheets functions: IF lets you return a specified value by evaluating a logical expression. This works similarly to using If-Else in Excel . VLOOKUP searches a column for a key value, then returns a cell value in a specific column to the right of the search range. (Check out our Excel guide for this function ). SUM adds multiple cell values together. ( Same as SUM in Excel ). ABS will give you the absolute value of a number. FLOOR rounds a number value down to the closest integer. NPV returns the net present value for an investment given periodic cash flows."
