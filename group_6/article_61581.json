You can either sign up on CVS's ExtraCare website to get an account and receive the card in the mail or ask a cashier in person and get a CVS card as soon as you're done filling the form out. You will need a physical card with you in order to receive the Extra Care Bucks. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Know what Extra Care Bucks are. Extra Care Bucks (abbreviated as \"ECB\") are basically extra cash towards your next purchases or transactions. Typically, ECBs expire within 30 days from when they are printed. [2] X Research source There are three ways to achieving ECBs. Search the CVS store ad or the store and look for items that are attached to an ECB deal. If you purchase that specific item, you will receive the value of ECBs, printed on your receipt of your transaction. Receive $1 in ECBs for every two prescriptions you purchase through CVS. Be aware of the prescription exclusions and amount limitations. Get awarded 2 percent back for all purchases at the end of every quarter. The quarters run in January, April, July, and October of every year. Your 2 percent will be printed out on your receipt. The quarterly accumulation excludes lottery tickets, postage stamps, gift cards, alcohol, tobacco, money orders, and special ordered health care items."

      "content": "Earn them through purchasing items that are attached to an ECB deal. It is the fastest and most savings method out of the three ways. [3] X Research source Always read the fine print for any household limits. This is how to read an ECB sale deal: Right Guard Sport or Total Defense 5 Deodorant - sale price 2 for $6.00 ($3.00 each) Receive $2.00 ECBs when you purchase two. Pay $6.00 out of pocket and receive $2.00 ECBs on your receipt. It's like spending $4.00 for 2 ($2.00 each) instead of the regular sale price because you can use the $2.00 ECBs on your next purchase."

[4] X Research source Remember that you can not use ECBs on the same items (an ECB from deodorant on another deodorant). Let's take the reward example from above with another ECB deal. Eclipse Gum - sale price 3 for $3.00 ($1.00 each) Receive $0.50 ECB when you purchase 3 gum packs. Transaction total comes out to $3.00. Use the $2.00 ECB from the deodorant receipt. Pay $1.00 out of pocket and receive $0.50 on your receipt from the gum. It's like spending $0.50 on 3 gum packs instead of the original $3.00 sale price."

      "content": "Remember that ECBs can be stacked and used with manufacturer coupons. [5] X Research source This is an example of a transaction using a manufacturer coupon with ECBs: Right Guard Sport or Total Defense 5 Deodorant - sale price 2 for $6.00 ($3.00 each) Receive $2.00 ECBs when you purchase two. Transaction total comes out to $6.00. Use one \"Save $3.00 on any two Right Guard Total Defense 5 Deodorant\" coupon. New transaction total comes out to $3.00. Use a $2.00 ECB receipt from a cosmetics deal. Pay $1.00 out of pocket and receive $2.00 ECBs on your receipt. This is a \"moneymaker\" because you are receiving more reward value back than what you spent."

      "content": "Be careful on how you use your Extra Care Bucks. You will need to use the amount listed on the receipt at once and CVS does not refund back any ECB differences back. So if you have a $15.00 ECB receipt and use it towards a $13.99 purchase, you will not receive the $1.01 difference."
