      "content": "Start by applying acupressure to the acupressure points on the ear. Place your thumb directly in front of the triangular shaped flap of tissue found at the front of each ear. The thumb is used because it covers the most area and will affect all three points. Another way to find this point is to place your finger against your jaw and open and shut your mouth. Find the point that has most of the movement in your jaw. Apply medium and constant pressure for three minutes to control appetite and hunger and improve digestion. If you only want to use one point, use the ear points. It is the only part of the body where three or more acupressure points that control hunger and appetite can be found together. Acupressure points SI19, TW21, and GB2 are located around the ear. These have been studied most for weight loss. [2] X Research source Hsieh, C. H., Su, T., Fang, Y., &amp; Chou, P. (2012).

      "content": "Apply pressure to additional acupressure points that promote weight loss. There are a wide variety of other points that can help you reach your weight loss goals. GV26 is located between the upper lip and the nose, in the crease or depression (the philtrum). Apply medium pressure for five minutes twice a day. This point can curb appetite and control hunger. Ren 6 is found 3 cm directly below the belly button. Use your index and middle fingers to massage this point up and down two minutes twice a day. This point can improve digestion. Knee Point ST36 is found 2 inches below the knee cap and slightly off center, towards the outer part of the leg. Apply pressure on this point for one minute with your forefinger. You can know you are in the right spot by flexing your foot — you should be able to feel the muscle move under your finger. Press this point for two minutes every day. This point supports healthy stomach function. Elbow point LI 11 is found on the inner side of the elbow crease, near the outer part of the elbow. This point stimulates the function of the intestine by removing excess heat and unwanted moisture from the body. Use your thumb and apply pressure to this point for one minute every day. Pressure point SP6 is found 2 inches above the ankle, on the inner side of the leg and behind the bone. Apply pressure for one minute every day with your thumb. Release slowly. This point helps balance fluids. The abdominal sorrow points are located beneath your lowest ribs in a straight line down from your earlobes. Press into this point under each rib for five minutes a day. This point can also help relieve indigestion."

Each person may respond uniquely, depending on their situation. Don’t overdo it! You can use these acupressure points until you have reached your ideal weight and then use them to help maintain that weight. There are no known negative effects of this type of acupressure."

You want to limit the additives and preservatives that can cause some people increased inflammation if they have sensitivity to these additives and preservatives. It may take some extra practice and planning, but the closer you can get to cooking from scratch, using whole foods that have not been processed (and therefore retain most of the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients) the healthier you will be. A rule of thumb is that if the food is too white, like white bread, white rice, white pasta, it has been processed. Instead, eat whole grain breads, brown rice, and whole grain pasta."

Try using a pedometer to track and monitor how many steps you take through the day. Gradually increase this number over time to increase your activity level."

      "content": "Understand the basic concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Acupressure and acupuncture utilize various points along 12 basic meridians in the body. [15] X Expert Source Karina Menali, L.Ac., DACM, Dipl. OM Licensed Acupuncturist & Diplomate of Oriental Medicine Expert Interview. 25 August 2021. These meridians are energy pathways, which are believed to carry “qi” or “chi”, the Chinese terms for life energy. The basic concept is that illness is caused by a blockage in qi. The needles in acupuncture and the pressure in acupressure can unblock these energy pathways and restore the easy and unimpeded flow of qi. The meridians correspond with pathways of the nerves or the circulatory system. [16] X Expert Source Karina Menali, L.Ac., DACM, Dipl. OM Licensed Acupuncturist & Diplomate of Oriental Medicine Expert Interview. 25 August 2021. In acupressure, you can apply pressure on the points with a finger or a tool. You can also use essential oils. [17] X Expert Source Karina Menali, L.Ac., DACM, Dipl. OM Licensed Acupuncturist & Diplomate of Oriental Medicine Expert Interview. 25 August 2021."

      "title": "Understand how acupressure can be used to stimulate weight loss.",
      "content": "Understand how acupressure can be used to stimulate weight loss. In TCM, weight loss can be encouraged by allowing excess “heat” and “moisture” to be expelled and by supporting the organs of digestion. [18] X Research source Hsieh, C. H., Su, T., Fang, Y., &amp; Chou, P. (2012). Efficacy of Two Different Materials used in Auricular Acupressure on Weight Reduction and Abdominal Obesity. American Journal Of Chinese Medicine, 40(4), 713-720. The terms “heat” and “moisture” don’t necessarily have literal meanings. In other words, applying pressure at these points won’t significantly change the temperature of the skin or cause any dampness on the skin. The terms should be understood to indicate imbalances of energy that are viewed as heat and moisture. [19] X Research source Hsieh, C. H., Su, T., Fang, Y., &amp; Chou, P. (2011). Effects of Auricular Acupressure on Weight Reduction and Abdominal Obesity in Asian Young Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial. American Journal Of Chinese Medicine, 39(3), 433-440. Some studies have indicated that acupressure on the ear points in particular can significantly help people achieve weight loss. [20] X Research source Hsieh, C. H., Su, T., Fang, Y., &amp; Chou, P. (2011). Effects of Auricular Acupressure on Weight Reduction and Abdominal Obesity in Asian Young Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial. American Journal Of Chinese Medicine, 39(3), 433-440.

      "title": "Learn how to apply pressure on acupressure points.",
      "content": "Learn how to apply pressure on acupressure points. Unless the point is on the center of your body, make sure you apply pressure on both sides for the same amount of time. The amount of pressure is generally light to medium-- find a level of pressure you are comfortable with. Never press hard. Think of three levels of pressure — light pressure is the amount of pressure it would take for your finger to depress your skin slightly and moves the skin around the pressure point slightly. You won’t feel a pulse or bone —but will feel a muscle moving under the skin. Medium pressure depresses the skin more — and in areas where the skin is thin (e.g. around the ear) you should feel some bone and will feel joints and muscle moving. You may also feel a pulse around (for example) around the knee, elbow or ankle points. You can apply acupressure anywhere: at work, at school, at home, or after (or during) a shower. Though it is usually best to be in a quiet and peaceful environment, it is not absolutely necessary."
