      "title": "Buy nitric oxide test strips.",
      "content": "Buy nitric oxide test strips. There are several brands of commercially-available test strips that measure the levels of nitric oxide found in the saliva. These levels are supposed to indicate how much circulatory nitric oxide is being produced in your body. Purchase these strips online, or at select pharmacies and health stores.

      "content": "Place the test strip on your tongue for 5 seconds. Nitric oxide PH test strips have a saliva absorption pad on 1 end and a test pad on the other. Place the absorption pad flat on your tongue. Remove it after 5 seconds.

      "content": "Press the 2 ends of the test strip together to get a result. After removing the strip from your tongue, fold it in half. Make sure that the part that touched your tongue presses onto the test pad. Hold the end together for 5 seconds.

      "title": "Refer to the color chart for your results.",
      "content": "Refer to the color chart for your results. The packaging of the test strip should feature a color chart illustrating the possible range of nitric oxide levels measured by the strips. If the test pad turns a dark color, that means that you have high levels of nitric oxide in your body. If the color is light, your nitric oxide levels are somewhat depleted.

      "title": "Speak to your doctor about your breathing problems.",
      "content": "Speak to your doctor about your breathing problems. Increased levels of nitric oxide are associated with swelling in the airways, so a pulmonary specialist may test your exhaled nitric oxide levels to check for asthma when other routine tests are not providing answers. Tell your doctor about any breathing difficulties you are having. Ask about the exhaled nitric oxide test, as it may not be available in all doctor's offices or hospitals. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Lung Association Nonprofit health organization dedicated to improving lung health through education, advocacy, and research Go to source Your doctor will usually make a separate appointment for your test so you can prepare for it. This test may be ordered if you have already been diagnosed with asthma if your doctor is testing your treatment progress or considering a new line of treatment."

      "content": "Avoid alcohol and tobacco for 24 hours prior to your test. There are many things that can affect nitric oxide levels in your body, even in small doses. Alcohol and tobacco should be avoided for a full 24 hours before your test. Inform your doctor if you are a regular smoker. [6] X Research source Long-term drinking habits can affect your nitric oxide levels significantly, so tell your doctor if you drink more than 1 drink a day, or drink more than 4-5 drinks a day at least once a month.

      "content": "Avoid aerobic exercise for 24 hours before your test. While cardiovascular exercise is excellent for your health, it should be avoided for a full day before your test. Aerobic activity increases the levels of nitric oxide in your body, which may skew the results of your test. Skip any type of workout, including: [8] X Research source Jogging or running Bicycling Jumping rope Rollerblading Dancing Speed walking"

      "title": "Do not get an allergy shot on the day before your test.",
      "content": "Do not get an allergy shot on the day before your test. Allergy shots work by introducing allergens into your system to help it build a resistance to them. As a result, an allergy vaccination may affect your nitric oxide levels for 24-48 hours after it is administered. To ensure accurate results, avoid scheduling an allergy shot within 1-2 days of your nitric oxide test."

      "title": "Don't eat or drink within an hour of your test.",
      "content": "Don't eat or drink within an hour of your test. Consuming food or beverages right before your test can affect the levels of nitric oxide being released. Plan ahead so you can go at least an hour without eating or drinking anything prior to your test appointment. This includes drinking water, which can also skew test results. [9] X Research source"

Disclose any prescription or over-the-counter medications that you are taking. If you are sick with the flu, allergies, or another ailment, tell your doctor to rule out any other causes of your symptoms.

Allow the technician helping you to put clips on your nose and a mouthpiece in your mouth when you are ready to start the test. Inhale and exhale slowly until the technician or doctor tells you to stop. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Lung Association Nonprofit health organization dedicated to improving lung health through education, advocacy, and research Go to source You may have to repeat the test a few times to confirm the results.

      "content": "Eats foods that are high in nitrogen and protein. Nitrogen produces nitric oxide when metabolized in the body, and can be found in many vegetables. Similarly, most high-protein foods contain arginine, which produces nitric oxide when broken down in the body.
