      "content": "Browse your favorite streaming services for new releases. In recent years, services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have adopted a day-and-date release model, which means that a new film is released in theaters and on streaming simultaneously. Check out your favorite streaming service and see if any recently added movies are also in theaters as well. Even if a film is not released day-and-date, it may end up on streaming towards the end of its theatrical window. Apple TV+ tends to release their films in this way, for example."
