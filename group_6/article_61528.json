You can feel confident that when \"too\" is not appropriate, \"to\" is the right choice.

[2] X Research source Choose the word \"too\" when it can be substituted for the word \"also.\" For example: \"She felt awful too (also)\" or \"I can see you too (also)\". Use \"too\" to modify or emphasize a word. For example: \"The weather is too (excessively) hot\", \"I've eaten too (excessively) much\", or \"The package is too (excessively/extra) big\". \"He wasn't too (very) interested in my book.\""
