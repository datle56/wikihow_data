      "content": "Dopamine helps regulate motor control and executive function. Whenever you need to do something, your brain triggers a little release of dopamine to motivate you to do that thing. From the smallest voluntary movement to the chores you know you need to do but don't really want to, dopamine gets you moving in the right direction. It also helps you plan, prioritize, and keep track of what you're doing. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source When you're learning something new, dopamine both gets you started and keeps you going. This means that if you have low dopamine levels, you're more likely to decide to quit when things get difficult.

      "content": "Dopamine connects feelings of pleasure to behavior to motivate action. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter released by brain neurons when you do something enjoyable or beneficial. Neurotransmitters send messages through your nervous system, and dopamine's message is \"This is great! Let's remember this and do it again sometime!\" [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You get a small burst of dopamine just to get the action going—that's the motor control aspect of dopamine. Then, if the action turned out to be enjoyable or beneficial, you get another burst of dopamine to reinforce it. There's a dark side to this reward system. If you start craving more dopamine, you might start engaging in pleasurable activities excessively. Ignoring everything else to pursue that pleasure exclusively is a compulsion or an addiction. Alcohol and illegal drugs can cause a surge of dopamine, which encourages people to continue consuming them, leading to addiction. Addictions to certain activities, such as gambling or sex, are also tied to a craving for the dopamine that those activities trigger."

      "title": "No, dopamine itself doesn't really make you feel anything.",
      "content": "No, dopamine itself doesn't really make you feel anything. Dopamine is commonly associated with pleasure, but the truth is this neurotransmitter is more about \"wanting\" than \"liking.\" It doesn't actually make you feel good or happy, it simply makes you want to do the thing again. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You might associate dopamine with a feeling more like a craving for something. When you finally get the thing you've been craving, your brain triggers another burst of dopamine that reinforces your actions. Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and heroin, are so addictive in part because they trigger a massive dump of dopamine. Getting so much dopamine at once feels euphoric and users chase after that feeling. Unfortunately, the drugs also make it more difficult for the body to produce dopamine, often trapping the individual in the cycle of addiction."

      "title": "Behaviors your brain considers beneficial trigger a release of dopamine.",
      "content": "Behaviors your brain considers beneficial trigger a release of dopamine. Your brain typically doles out dopamine in small bursts—just enough that you associate whatever you just did with pleasure and want to do it again. The burst of dopamine you get every time you do it reinforces that behavior and makes you more likely to continue doing it. [7] X Research source For example, when you exercise, your brain keeps kicking out little bursts of dopamine. These little bursts both motivate the voluntary movement to keep you going and make you feel good about exercising. You'll remember that good feeling and want to do it again. But how does your brain decide when a behavior is beneficial or pleasurable? From what scientists can gather so far, it seems the brain cells that produce and release dopamine just figure that out on their own. In a healthy brain, scientists believe, dopamine release is self-regulating. Research is ongoing. [8] X Research source You can't control how or when your brain releases dopamine. It's a self-regulating, automatic process."

This might lead you to take actions that you regret after the fact. Scientists believe this is mostly genetic, although environment likely plays a part as well. [9] X Research source High dopamine levels can also make you hyper-competitive, so you take anything anyone says as a challenge. Couple this with aggressive behavior (also caused by too much dopamine) and you have a recipe for trouble.

Low levels of dopamine lead to a lack of motivation in general—if your levels of dopamine get super low, you might not even be motivated to leave your bed or eat food. You might also feel really tired or lethargic. [11] X Research source Dopamine levels can fluctuate throughout your life. If you find that something that once excited you isn't making you feel the same way anymore, that might be because your dopamine levels have dropped."

      "content": "No, dopamine doesn't actually decrease when you avoid overstimulating activities. You might have heard of the \"dopamine fast\" concept, which encourages people to abstain from electronic devices and social media for a specific period. This concept is based on a misunderstanding of how dopamine works. [12] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Abstaining from electronic devices for short periods isn't a bad thing and does have benefits—but those benefits aren't related to dopamine. For example, turning off screens for an hour or two before you go to bed helps you get more restful sleep. If you deprive yourself of something for a while, it might indeed seem more pleasurable when you experience it again, but it's not because you've replenished your depleted dopamine stores. The amount of dopamine you have available doesn't diminish that way. Talk to your doctor or to a therapist if you think you have excess dopamine. They can help you figure out if medication would be appropriate."

People with depression might also have a flat affect, meaning that they don't show much emotion. That, too, might be attributed to low levels of dopamine.

Dopamine has an interesting relationship with schizophrenia that depends not only on the overall level of dopamine but also on the areas of the brain where that dopamine is released. Some symptoms of schizophrenia can be caused by a dopamine deficiency while others can be caused by an excess of the neurotransmitter. Although scientists don't totally know the role dopamine plays in schizophrenia, there are good reasons to suspect it's important. [15] X Research source Low dopamine is a factor in many of the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, including poor working memory, lack of pleasure, trouble with speech and speech processing, and social withdrawal. These are referred to as \"negative\" symptoms of schizophrenia because they refer to a loss of typical brain functions. High dopamine causes the delusions and hallucinations that many people consider the hallmark of schizophrenia. These are \"positive\" symptoms because something happens that doesn't happen in a typical brain."

      "content": "Substance Use Disorder/Addiction. Amphetamines, cocaine, and similar drugs cause the neurons to release massive amounts of dopamine at once. Other drugs, such as heroin, mimic dopamine, making the receptors think they have more dopamine than they actually do. As a result, you start craving the euphoric feelings of a dopamine rush, which can lead to substance abuse and addiction. [16] X Research source Because drugs disrupt dopamine production, people who misuse drugs don't have enough of it to go around unless they're under the effects of the drug. They start to feel as though they're not capable of enjoying anything anymore unless they're also on the drug."

Sleep deprivation damages your brain's dopamine receptors so that even though your brain is making dopamine, you're not getting the benefits of it. Your brain, in turn, recognizes that it's not getting the dopamine it should be and triggers the release of more. [25] X Research source More dopamine, in turn, can lead to more impulsive actions, aggression, and hostility. If you've ever been highly irritated after spending an all-nighter, you know what this feels like. The best way to make sure you're getting enough sleep is to check in on your energy levels throughout the day. If you find that you're lagging mid-morning or mid-afternoon, it could be that you're not getting enough sleep.
