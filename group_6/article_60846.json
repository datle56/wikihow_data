      "content": "Touch the meat with tongs or a spatula to see how firm it is. While you are cooking the pork chops, feel their firmness by poking them with your tongs or spatula. If they are still very soft they are still raw in the middle. If they are extremely firm they are very well done. [1] X Research source You want to finish cooking the chops when they are firm, but not overly hard or leather-like. If they are too firm they will be dried out and tough in the middle."

If you are baking or broiling the chops, then use an oven glove to safely remove the dish they are cooking in from the oven. [2] X Research source In a frying pan the cook time will usually take anywhere from 3-5 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the pork chops. In an oven they will be done after about 30 minutes at 375 degrees F (175 degrees C)."

      "content": "Put the pork chops on a cutting board and let them rest for 5-15 minutes. This will allow the fibers to relax and absorb the juices. The middle will also keep cooking as the pork chops retain the heat. [3] X Research source You can make a small tin foil tent to place over the pork chops to keep them warmer while they rest."

      "content": "Cut into the thickest part of the meat and look at the color in the middle. After you have let the meat rest for a few minutes after cooking, cut into one of the pork chops and look at the color. It is okay if it has a little pink in the middle but any juices that flow out should be clear. [4] X Research source Previously it was commonly taught that pork needs to be completely white in the middle in order for it to be edible. The USDA now says that pork cooked to at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) that may still look a bit pink in the middle is perfectly safe to eat.

When you see that the meat has begun to turn golden-brown and is firm to the touch it is a good time to check the temperature. Place the pork chop on a plate or cutting board.

You want the tip of the thermometer to be in the thickest part of the pork chop to get an accurate reading. The thermometer should finish reading the temperature within a few seconds. Don’t let the thermometer touch the bone of the pork chop as this will not provide an accurate reading of the meat’s temperature."

Try not to let the internal temperature of the meat get higher than 160 degrees F (16 degrees C) to avoid overcooking it. [7] X Research source If the temperature is less than 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), continue cooking the pork chops for 1-2 minutes until the internal temperature rises. [8] X Research source"

The cold water does not clean up bacteria. If you want to defrost pork chops quickly , you can put them in a sealed bag like a Ziploc style bag and run them under cold water."
