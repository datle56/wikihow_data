      "title": "Purchase boot stretchers made specifically for the calves of boots.",
      "content": "Purchase boot stretchers made specifically for the calves of boots. Visit a local shoe store or browse online to find a pair of stretchers with good reviews. Plan to spend about $20 for plastic stretchers or closer to $40 for wooden ones. [1] X Research source Most stretchers come in pairs of 2. If you’re buying ones sold individually, consider buying 2. That way, you won’t have to wait 12 hours for the first boot to finish stretching before you can move on to the second one. Wooden stretchers are more durable, but plastic ones work just as well and usually take up less storage space. Pay attention to the length of the stretcher compared to the length of your boots and make sure to purchase stretchers that are long enough."

      "title": "Slide the unexpanded calf stretchers into each boot.",
      "content": "Slide the unexpanded calf stretchers into each boot. Position the stretchers so that the narrower end goes into the boot first. Push the calf stretchers down until they are just past the ankle into the actual body of the boot. This ensures the entire calf will get stretched evenly. [2] X Research source Keeping the stretchers unexpanded at this stage helps you get them into the boots completely."
    },
    {
      "title": "Twist the handle to expand the stretchers until the leather is pulled taut.",
      "content": "Twist the handle to expand the stretchers until the leather is pulled taut. As you twist the handle, you’ll notice the leather getting tighter and tighter as the stretchers push against the material. Keep twisting until you can visibly see the leather straining against the stretchers. [3] X Research source With time, you should be able to expand the calves of your leather boots by about 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the stretchers do their work for about 12 hours.",
      "content": "Let the stretchers do their work for about 12 hours. Stretching leather takes some time, so start the process well before you’ll need to wear your boots. It won’t hurt the boots if you leave the stretchers in for longer than 12 hours. [4] X Research source If you stretch the boots for just a few hours, the leather will most likely shrink back down to its original size."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat the stretching process until you’ve achieved the desired fit.",
      "content": "Repeat the stretching process until you’ve achieved the desired fit. After the initial 12 hours have passed, remove the stretchers and try on your boots. If they’re still a little too tight, stretch them again for an additional 12 hours, this time expanding the stretchers just a little bit further. [5] X Research source If you find your boots are still too tight after 2-3 sessions, you could try taking them to a cobbler to see if they can expand them a bit further."

    {
      "title": "Mix 1 cup (240 mL) each of water and rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle.",
      "content": "Mix 1 cup (240 mL) each of water and rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle. The rubbing alcohol loosens the leather, which allows it to expand and stretch. Diluting the rubbing alcohol with water keeps it from evaporating too quickly. [6] X Research source You could also purchase a leather-stretching spray from a shoe store or online for similar results. Most products are in the $10-$20 range."

    {
      "title": "Spray the inside of the boot calves until they’re saturated with the mix.",
      "content": "Spray the inside of the boot calves until they’re saturated with the mix. Wipe away any spray that ends up on the outside of the boots; the rubbing alcohol could potentially discolor the leather. Try flipping the boots upside down if you’re having a hard time getting the bottom half of the calves wet. [7] X Research source If needed, make more of the alcohol and water solution."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put on the boots and wear them for about 30 minutes until they dry.",
      "content": "Put on the boots and wear them for about 30 minutes until they dry. After you’ve sprayed the insides, put the boots on immediately. This should help the leather conform to the exact size of your calves as they dry. [8] X Research source If you hate the idea of wearing wet boots, use boot-calf stretchers in conjunction with the spray instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub a leather-conditioning cream on the exterior of your boots.",
      "content": "Rub a leather-conditioning cream on the exterior of your boots. The application of water to your boots increases the risk that they could dry out and crack. If you rub the exterior with a conditioning cream, it’ll help keep the leather supple. [9] X Research source You can apply the conditioning cream while you’re wearing the drying boots, or you could wait until you’ve taken them off again. The conditioning cream will work either way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat the process 2-3 more times until the calves fit comfortably.",
      "content": "Repeat the process 2-3 more times until the calves fit comfortably. Respray the inside of the boots with the water and rubbing alcohol solution, wear the boots until they dry, and continue to apply conditioning cream each time. It may take several sessions for the calves to fully stretch to the size you want. If after 2-3 attempts the calves are still too small, consider taking the boots to a cobbler. They have additional methods they can use to manipulate the size."
