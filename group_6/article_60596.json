      "content": "Gather some tools in your house. A hoe, scythe, and an axe are all that you really need. Save your rocks as you may need them for artificial fences. Clear out the area right next to your shipping bin because you want to harvest your crops as fast as possible. Since you do not have a shipping basket at this time, planting crops in a C plot will allow you the most time (A C is one horizontal row of three, one row of two, and one row of three). Create 4 plots with one square of space in between them and make sure to place them as close to the shipping bin as possible."

Now would be a good chance to familiarize yourself with the town but remember, time is money. Head to the supermarket and buy some turnip seeds. Turnips will grow the fastest and yields a good amount of profit. Four packets of turnip seeds should be the maximum amount of seeds you can buy at this point with five hundred G."

The stairs lead to a hot spring and a mine behind the waterfall. Straight down will lead you to a lake, a field of flowers, and the top of the mountains. Taking the path opposite of the stairs will lead you to Gotz the Woodcutter's house."

You should still be carrying your hoe with you. \"Mine\" the land and occasionally, some ores will pop up or you will find a ladder down. The lower the level, the greater the chance of finding more expensive ores like the Blue Mysterile. You will probably have a hard time going to lower levels since your stamina is not that high yet. But if you are lucky, you will dig up a power berry here which will increase your stamina. If you find any ores, make sure to put it into your rucksack and ship it if you can make it to your bin in time. Otherwise, wait until tomorrow."

A suggestion would be to start your grass stash in the bottom right corner of your farm and work outwards from there). Get 800 g to have enough money for a brush because you need to talk to the horse and brush the horse every day."

In the summer, you can use corn and put it in the water mill right next to the coop. Eventually, you can receive a free chicken if you woo Popuri enough so you can use your money solely for feed. Another opportunity comes up when Rick asks you to take care of a chicken for him and though you have to return the chicken, you can still keep the eggs and put them in the incubator. And the third option is you can buy your own chicken, but remember to have enough feed for it."

A word of warning: these pineapples take a long time to grow so your mountain harvests, chickens, and the livestock you have will come in very handy. Plant a field of corn right next to your chicken coop to be devoted for chicken feed and plant a few fields of tomatoes and corn or all corn, since corn should yield a larger profit than tomatoes. The reason you may want to plant both though is to get 100 of each crop shipped so you can get the special seeds for summer."
