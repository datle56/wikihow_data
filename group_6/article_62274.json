      "content": "This Windows hex editor allows you to edit a DLL's hex code directly. DLLs are compiled code that can't be edited with a traditional text editor. If you don't want to decompile the DLL and edit the linked source code files directly, you can use a hex code editor to edit the contents of the binary. While there are a variety of hex code editors available, HxD also has the ability to compare the hex code of two different files. You can download HxD Hex Editor from https://www.portablefreeware.com/?id=1454 . Keep in mind that hex code is literally just 1s and 0s—you won't be editing any programming code with an editor like HxD."

      "content": "If you have Visual Studio, use the dumpbin command to view information about a DLL. Dumpbin is a part of Visual Studio (including the free Community versions) that displays information about DLL files. [4] X Research source You'll need to run dumpbin from the Visual Studio command prompt, not the Windows command prompt. To check a DLL file with dumpbin, use the syntax dumpbin [options] filename.dll . Some helpful options: Use dumpbin /DEPENDENTS filename.dll to view all dependencies. [5] X Research source Use dumpbin /HEADERS filename.dll to view headers for each member object. [6] X Research source Use dumpbin /EXPORTS filename.dll to see all definitions exported from the DLL. [7] X Research source Visit https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/dumpbin-options?view=msvc-170 for a list of all dumpbin options."
