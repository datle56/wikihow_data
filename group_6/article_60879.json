      "content": "Observe your rabbit's breathing to see if it is rapid or heavy. Irregular breathing is an observable sign of pain or injury in rabbits. If you suspect that your rabbit is in pain, listen to its breathing carefully to see if it is fast or laboured. If a rabbit is hot it will breathe more rapidly to try and cool down."

      "title": "Note any high-pitched squeals that come from your rabbit.",
      "content": "Note any high-pitched squeals that come from your rabbit. While rabbits tend to deal with pain quietly, they may let out an unnerving sound in the event of sudden pain. If you hear your rabbit make a high-pitched noise, take this sign of pain seriously and bring it to the vet as soon as possible. It will normally take a significant amount of distress to make a rabbit go against its own nature in such a dramatic way. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for bleeding or open wounds. If you are concerned that your rabbit may be in pain, observe it for any visible bleeding or lacerations to the skin.
