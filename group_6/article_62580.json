      "title": "Put “$1,000.00” in the check’s amount box.",
      "content": "Put “$1,000.00” in the check’s amount box. Write out the exact amount in numbers in the small box on the right. Even if you’re writing a check for a flat dollar amount, include “.00” so no one can add extra numbers at the end. [1] X Research source Use a black or blue pen when you write your check so no one can alter the amount. Write the numbers legibly. If someone isn’t able to read your writing, then the check may not go through."

      "title": "Write “one thousand and 00/100” on the amount line.",
      "content": "Write “one thousand and 00/100” on the amount line. Write out the check’s full amount using words without any abbreviations. Add “00/100” at the end to include cents on the check . [2] X Research source Example: If the check is for $1,250.50, write “one thousand, two-hundred fifty and 50/100” on the line. Avoid shorthand like using “1K” instead of “one thousand.” If there is any space at the end of the amount line, draw a slash through it so no one else can alter your check. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill out the name of the check’s recipient. On the “Pay to the Order of” line, put down the full name of the person or business you’re writing the check to. Make sure to double-check that you spelled everything correctly. [4] X Research source Avoid leaving the line blank and giving a “blank check” because anyone could write their name in and cash it. Always confirm the name and write it on the line."

Banks and financial institutions will not cash any voided check. [7] X Research source Rip or shred the check if you really want to ensure that no one tries to alter or cash it."
