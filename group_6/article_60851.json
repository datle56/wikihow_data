      "title": "You're locked out of your Apple ID.",
      "content": "You're locked out of your Apple ID. If you are locked out of your Apple ID because the password got changed and/or you got a notification from Apple that there was suspicious activity on your Apple ID, this is usually a good indicator that your phone is compromised. [2] X Research source However, if you share a device with someone else, you may want to make sure they didn't change your Apple ID password for some reason."

      "title": "The camera or microphone on your phone turn on by themselves.",
      "content": "The camera or microphone on your phone turn on by themselves. On the top of your phone screen, a colored dot will appear if the camera or microphone is in use. A green dot means an app is using the camera, and an orange dot means an app is using the microphone. [3] X Research source If you're not using an app that has camera/microphone abilities (or you're not using your device at all when the indicators light up), this is usually a good indicator that someone is remotely accessing your device."

      "title": "Your phone feels hotter than usual.",
      "content": "Your phone feels hotter than usual. While it's normal for your iPhone to feel hot after you've been using it for a while, it shouldn't be hot when it's not in use and shouldn't be so hot that it's actually painful. A phone that is noticeably hotter than usual can be a sign of a compromised device. Before worrying that your phone is hacked, consider the age of your device, what phone case you have on it, and what you use your phone for. If your phone is very old, it may run slightly hotter than it did when it was new. Phone cases can also cause your device to get hotter if made with thick material or if one of the air vents at the bottom of the device is blocked. If you use your phone for intensive activities (like gaming or streaming), it may feel hotter than if you just use it to send messages or browse the web."

      "title": "Your phone's battery runs out much quicker than it used to.",
      "content": "Your phone's battery runs out much quicker than it used to. If you notice that your phone is dying very quickly, this may be a sign that someone is accessing your device remotely. When you use your phone, the battery will go down, but there shouldn't be a noticeable jump in battery drain from day to day. Consider the age of your phone and what you use it for before worrying that you're hacked. An old phone will drain the battery faster than a new one, but it shouldn't be a noticeable switch. If you use your phone for intensive activities (like gaming or streaming), your battery might die faster than if you just use it to send messages or browse the web."

    {
      "title": "Your phone's performance has gotten worse.",
      "content": "Your phone's performance has gotten worse. If you notice that your phone is crashing a lot more than usual or has gotten very slow, this might indicate that it is compromised. Crashes happen occasionally, but they are not normal, especially crashes that shut down your entire phone. Before you worry that your device is hacked, think about the age of your phone. Phones slow down as they age, and a crash every once in a while isn't a big indicator that you're hacked. However, if the crashes or performance issues are noticeable and sudden, this may indicate that your phone is hacked."

      "title": "Your phone is using more data than it usually does.",
      "content": "Your phone is using more data than it usually does. Go to Settings > Cellular to check your data usage for your billing period. If this number is much higher than normal, or you've noticed a huge spike in your cell phone bill, hackers could be using your iPhone's data without your knowledge. If you share a phone plan with other people or someone else uses your device (i.e., a child playing games on your phone), check in with them to make sure they weren't the reason for the data spikes."

      "title": "There are apps on your phone that you didn't install.",
      "content": "There are apps on your phone that you didn't install. If you notice any strange apps you didn't install on your device, this could indicate that someone is remotely accessing your device. However, if more than one person uses your phone (such as a child, spouse/significant other, or friend), they could have been the one installing the app. Check with the other people who use your phone before concluding you're hacked. If you have more than one Apple device, you may see apps installed on those devices on your phone. This is especially true for Apple TVs or iPads that are signed in to your iCloud account. If you notice a new app on your iPhone that you didn't install, check to see if someone added it to your Apple TV or iPad first."

      "content": "There are unauthorized purchases made on your Apple ID. If you get notified that your Apple ID made a purchase you didn't authorize, this may indicate that you're hacked. If your Apple ID is connected to an iPad or Apple TV, make sure the purchases didn't happen on either of those devices. Also, if your iPhone is used by more than one person (i.e., a child, spouse/significant other, friend, etc.), one of them could have made the purchase."

      "content": "There is proof of phone activity when your device is locked. If you unlock your phone to see new activity (newly installed apps, rearranged Home Screen, Home Screen wallpaper change, etc.), this could be an indicator that your device is being accessed remotely. If you have more than one Apple device, you may see apps installed on those devices on your phone. This is especially true for Apple TVs or iPads that are signed in to your iCloud account. If you notice that an app was installed on your iPhone while it was locked, make sure it wasn't installed on your Apple TV or iPad then."

If you share your phone with someone else, they may have been the one to send that message. Check with them before worrying that your phone is being accessed remotely. If you're logged into a MacBook or iPad with your Apple ID, messages you send on these devices might also appear on your iPhone."

      "content": "Disconnect from the internet, Bluetooth, and cellular service. Before continuing, turn off your phone's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters and disable cellular service. This will immediately push out the hacker so they can't continue accessing your device. To disconnect from Wi-Fi, go to Settings > Wi-Fi and toggle off Wi-Fi (the toggle should be gray). To disconnect from Bluetooth, go to Settings > Bluetooth and toggle off Bluetooth (the toggle should be gray). To disconnect from cellular service, go to Settings > Cellular and toggle off Cellular Data (the toggle should be gray). This is not a long-term solution. However, when you're trying to figure out the hacker's entry point, disconnecting your device is an important step so the hacker can't get ahead of you and undo any of the steps you're taking to secure your device."

If there is malicious software on your phone, an antivirus scan can help identify, quarantine, and remove it. If you already have an antivirus on your computer, check for an associated mobile app for the company you use. Some antivirus providers have bundles for their computer clients and mobile apps. If you don't already have an antivirus app, you'll need to temporarily reconnect to the internet or cellular data to download it."
