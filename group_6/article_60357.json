      "content": "Tinder is any highly flammable material that only needs a spark to light. Search the area for dry pine needles, grass, moss, bark, wood chips, or wood shavings. [1] X Research source If they're all wet or you can’t find anything, use cotton balls, dryer lint, crumpled paper, or toilet paper, or similar materials you might have on hand. [2] X Research source In wet conditions, add cooking oil or petroleum jelly to materials like cotton balls to make a DIY fire starter. If you’re planning ahead, pack steel wool or magnesium shavings to include in your tinder. They burn hot and help dry out firewood in wet conditions. [3] X Research source Pack or collect about 4 times as much tinder as you’d normally need to start a wet wood fire. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Kindling is small twigs and sticks that you’ll burn to dry out your logs. Search dead trees (fallen or standing) for twigs you can snap off. Also look in the underbrush or for twigs and sticks that were shielded from the rain. [5] X Research source You’ll need about 4 times more kindling to start a wet wood fire than a regular one. [6] X Research source If you can only find wet twigs, shave off the outer layers with a knife to get to the dry center. [7] X Research source The ideal kindling sticks are thinner than the width of an adult finger and around 6 inches (15 cm) long. If necessary, use a hatchet to split large logs open, revealing the dry wood inside. Then shave off dry pieces to use as kindling. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Fuel logs are the biggest pieces of wood you’ll burn to feed the fire. Use a hatchet or ax to break your wet firewood into smaller pieces, then make several cuts into the sides of the wood. The cuts expose even more dry wood, plus they create more surface area that can catch fire. [9] X Research source In a pinch, lay a knife perpendicular to the log you want to split and “baton” it (tap the knife with a sturdy log) through the log to split it. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Elevation is key to keeping your fire off of the wet ground.",
      "content": "Elevation is key to keeping your fire off of the wet ground. Fire pits are great for safety, but they tend to collect water when it rains. Clear any wet debris out of the pit and fill it with logs or rocks to create a small mound or platform. This will allow the ground to dry out without extinguishing your fire. [11] X Research source The added height also increases air flow to your fire, which is essential for starting one with wet wood. If you build your platform with logs, they will eventually dry out and be able to burn too."

      "content": "Pack your tinder in the center of the ring and surround it with kindling. Arrange the kindling sticks so they’re leaning against each other in a cone or teepee shape around the tinder. [12] X Research source Turn the kindling sticks so the driest side of them is facing inward toward the tinder. [13] X Research source The teepee shape helps you build your fire upward, away from the wet ground, while still allowing ample air flow."

Make sure to leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between the logs and the kindling for air flow. [14] X Research source The top side of the logs should be level with or slightly taller than the top of the kindling teepee. If they’re not, stack another log on top to achieve that height. Stack 2 more logs on top of the base layer. Lay them perpendicular to the bottom logs to create a criss-cross or hashtag shape. [15] X Research source"

Keep adding tinder and kindling to the flames until the fuel logs catch on fire too. [16] X Research source The driest logs on the bottom will burn first, which will help dry out the wetter logs on top. [17] X Research source If it’s windy, make a shield with a stack of wet logs. This keeps the heat from blowing out of the fire and offers additional protection from the elements. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your wet logs near the fire so the heat will start drying them out. Add logs to the fire sooner than you think you need to since they will take a while to fully dry out and light. [19] X Research source Add more layers gradually rather than all at once. This will ensure you don’t accidentally smother the fire. Enjoy your fire! As long as you continue to dry out your wood ahead of time, you’ll be able to keep your fire bright, hot, and healthy all night long."
