      "title": "Discover the symptoms.",
      "content": "Discover the symptoms. It may be the case that even during an episode of hyperventilation a person may be unaware that they are over-breathing. Since most cases of hyperventilation are caused by fear, anxiety, or panic it may be difficult to notice specific symptoms. Pay careful attention to your symptoms during such states to see if they are indicative of hyperventilation. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Fast or increased rate of breathing. Confusion, dizziness, and light-headedness may be present during hyperventilation. Weakness, numbness or tingling in the arms or mouth, and muscle spasms in the hands and feet can also occur with hyperventilation. Palpitations and chest pain may be noticeable during hyperventilation."

      "title": "Understand the causes.",
      "content": "Understand the causes. The main causes of hyperventilation are states of panic or anxiety which increase the rate of breathing in a person. This over-breathing results in unusually low levels of carbon dioxide in the body. Altering these carbon dioxide levels cause the typical symptoms that come with hyperventilating. [2] X Research source Hyperventilation can also be done at will, purposefully over-breathing. Some medical issues such as infection, blood loss, or heart and lung disorders can cause hyperventilation."

      "content": "Find a paper bag to use. Breathing into a paper bag can be a useful method when managing the symptoms of a hyperventilation episode. By breathing into a paper bag you can help reuse carbon-dioxide that would normally be lost on your exhalation, maintaining proper levels in the body and avoiding the symptoms of hyperventilation. [3] X Research source Do not use plastic bags as these can pose a choking hazard. Make sure the paper bag is clean and there are no small items inside that could be accidentally inhaled. Be sure that your doctor has cleared you for this technique as it can be dangerous to use when hyperventilation is caused by a physical injury or disease."

      "title": "Place the paper bag over your mouth and nose.",
      "content": "Place the paper bag over your mouth and nose. In order to properly use the paper bag breathing method during an episode of hyperventilation you will need to make sure that it completely covers your mouth and nose. This will ensure that the carbon-dioxide is caught in the paper bag, allowing you to re-breathe it and reduce some of the effects caused by hyperventilating. [4] X Research source Hold the bag with one hand towards the opening of the bag. Pinching the bag slightly can help shape the opening of the bag, allowing it to fit over your mouth and nose more easily. Place the opening of the bag directly and completely over your mouth and nose."

      "title": "Breathe in and out of the bag.",
      "content": "Breathe in and out of the bag. Once you have placed the paper bag over your mouth and nose you can begin breathing in and out of the bag. Try to remain calm and breathe as naturally and completely as you can during an episode of hyperventilation. [5] X Research source Take no more than six to 12 breaths using the paper bag. [6] X Research source Breathe as slowly and easily as you can. After taking six to 12 breaths remove the bag from your mouth and nose and breathe without it."

      "content": "Lie on your back and relax. To start your practice of retraining your breathing you will need to rest comfortably on your back and relax your body. Relaxing the entire body will help you focus entirely on your breathing and let you get the most out of your breath training. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Take off any tight or restrictive clothing such as a belt or tie. You can try putting pillows under your knees or back for extra comfort."

      "title": "Put something over your stomach.",
      "content": "Put something over your stomach. Breathing during an episode of hyperventilation is generally shallow, at the chest level, and rapid. You will be working to retrain your breathing to have more rhythmic and complete inhalations using your stomach and diaphragm. By placing an object on your stomach you help keep the focus on this area and provide resistance to strengthen the muscles responsible for abdominal breathing. [8] X Research source You can place something like a telephone book on your stomach while you retrain your breathing. Avoid any items that are too heavy or are an unusual shape. These can either cause injury or be difficult to balance on your stomach."

The goal here is to raise and lower the item on your stomach, using your abdomen like a balloon. Keep the following in mind as you practice this new way of breathing: [9] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Breathe through your nose when practicing. If you can't breathe through your nose you can purse your lips and breathe through your mouth. Take comfortable and rhythmic breaths. Breathe smoothly and try to avoid pauses on the inhalation or exhalation. Only your abdomen should be moving. Keep the rest of your body relaxed."

      "title": "Keep practicing.",
      "content": "Keep practicing. In order to get the most out of this new method of breathing you will need to get regular practice. By practicing you will become more comfortable using this method of breathing, allowing you to avoid hyperventilating during a stressful time. Practice for at least five to 10 minutes a day. Gradually slow your rate of breathing during your practice sessions. Begin practicing this way of breathing while sitting up or walking. Eventually you will want to use this method right before you expect a panic attack or during one."

      "content": "Consider medication. If your hyperventilation is caused by panic or anxiety related issues your doctor may prescribe medications to treat your anxiety. These medications work to reduce the effects of anxiety and panic attacks, in turn reducing the instances of hyperventilation. Talk with your doctor to learn more about the medications used to treat anxiety and panic attacks. [10] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are commonly prescribed antidepressants. SNRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are FDA approved as a antidepressants. Be aware that medications can take weeks before effects are noticeable. Benzodiazepines are usually given only for short term use as they are habit forming over time."

Your psychotherapist will work with you to uncover and cope with any underlying psychological issues that may be responsible for panic or anxiety-related issues and the hyperventilation they can cause. [11] X Research source Most psychotherapists will use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to help you move beyond the physical sensations caused by panic or anxiety. Psychotherapy sessions can take time before the effects are noticeable. Sticking with the process for several months will help ensure that your symptoms decrease or disappear completely."

Often times hyperventilating can cause even more panic during a panic attack, resulting in an increasing cycle and worsening symptoms. Calm reassurance can help lower the amount of panic the person is feeling and restore normal breathing rates. [14] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Remind her that she is having a panic attack and that she is not experiencing something life-threatening, such as a heart attack.

During an episode of hyperventilation, carbon-dioxide levels fall in the body and can cause symptoms typically associated with hyperventilating. In order to retain carbon-dioxide in the body, have the person breathe using the following methods: [15] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Have him purse his lips, exhaling and inhaling through them.
