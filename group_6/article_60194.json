      "content": "Learn the correct words and vocabulary for exponent problems. When you have an exponent, like 2 3 {\\displaystyle 2^{3}} , you have two simple parts. The bottom number, here a 2, is the base . The number it is raised to, here a 3, is known as the exponent or power . If you are talking about 2 3 {\\displaystyle 2^{3}} , you would say it is \"two to the third,\" \"two to the third power,\" or \"two raised to the third power.\" [1] X Research source If a number is raised to the second power, like 5 2 {\\displaystyle 5^{2}} , you can also say that the number is squared, such as \"five squared.\" If a number is raised to the third power, like 10 3 {\\displaystyle 10^{3}} , you can also say it is cubed, such as \"ten cubed.\" If a number has no exponent shown, like a simple 4, it is technically to the first power and can be rewritten as 4 1 {\\displaystyle 4^{1}} . If the exponent is 0, and a \"non-zero number\" is raised to the \"zero power\", then the whole thing equals 1, such as 4 0 = 1 {\\displaystyle 4^{0}=1} or even something like ( 3 / 8 ) 0 = 1. {\\displaystyle (3/8)^{0}=1.} There is more about this in the \"Tips\" section."

You want to multiply the base by itself for the number of the exponent. So, if you have 3 4 {\\displaystyle 3^{4}} you would multiply three in a series of four separate factors, or 3 ∗ 3 ∗ 3 ∗ 3 {\\displaystyle 3*3*3*3} . More examples include: [2] X Research source 4 5 = 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}=4*4*4*4*4} 8 2 = 8 ∗ 8 {\\displaystyle 8^{2}=8*8} Ten cubed = 10 ∗ 10 ∗ 10 {\\displaystyle =10*10*10} [3] X Research source"

For example, with 4 5 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}} , you'd start with 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 {\\displaystyle 4*4*4*4*4} This looks daunting, but just take it one step at a time. Start by multiplying the first two fours. Then replace the two fours with the answer as shown here: [4] X Research source 4 5 = 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}=4*4*4*4*4} 4 ∗ 4 = 16 {\\displaystyle 4*4=16} 4 5 = 16 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}=16*4*4*4}"

Continuing our example, you would multiple 16 by the next 4, so that: [5] X Research source 4 5 = 16 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}=16*4*4*4} 16 ∗ 4 = 64 {\\displaystyle 16*4=64} 4 5 = 64 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}=64*4*4} 64 ∗ 4 = 256 {\\displaystyle 64*4=256} 4 5 = 256 ∗ 4 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}=256*4} 256 ∗ 4 = 1024 {\\displaystyle 256*4=1024} As shown, you continue multiplying the base by your product of each first pair of numbers until you get your final answer. Simply keep multiplying the first two numbers, then multiply the answer by the next number in the sequence. This works for any exponent. Once you're done with our example, you should get 4 5 = 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 ∗ 4 = 1024 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}=4*4*4*4*4=1024} ."

      "content": "Add or subtract exponents only if they have the same base and exponent. If you have identical bases and exponents, such as 4 5 + 4 5 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}+4^{5}} , you can simplify the addition of terms into simply a multiplication problem. Remember that 4 5 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}} can be thought of as 1 ∗ 4 5 {\\displaystyle 1*4^{5}} so that 4 5 + 4 5 = 1 ∗ 4 5 + 1 ∗ 4 5 = 2 ∗ 4 5 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}+4^{5}=1*4^{5}+1*4^{5}=2*4^{5}} by adding, where \"1 of that plus 1 of that = 2 of that\", whatever \"that\" may be. Just add the number of similar terms (with the identical base and exponent) together and multiply the sum by that exponential expression. You can then simply solve 4 5 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}} and multiply that answer by two. Remember, this is because multiplication is just a way to rewrite addition, since 3 + 3 = 2 ∗ 3 {\\displaystyle 3+3=2*3} . Check out some examples: [6] X Research source 3 2 + 3 2 = 2 ∗ 3 2 {\\displaystyle 3^{2}+3^{2}=2*3^{2}} 4 5 + 4 5 + 4 5 = 3 ∗ 4 5 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}+4^{5}+4^{5}=3*4^{5}} 4 5 − 4 5 + 2 = 2 {\\displaystyle 4^{5}-4^{5}+2=2} 4 x 2 − 2 x 2 = 2 x 2 {\\displaystyle 4x^{2}-2x^{2}=2x^{2}}"
