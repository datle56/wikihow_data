    {
      "title": "Get to know your goldfish.",
      "content": "Get to know your goldfish. Spend time around the tank. You can talk to your fish, read to them, and feed them daily. This helps your fish learn to trust you. Once they get to know you, they will start swimming towards you every time you come near the tank."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put your hand in the tank.",
      "content": "Put your hand in the tank. Clean your hands before you place your hand in your fish's water (do not use soap). Keep your hand in the water for a few minutes. Don't make any sudden movement and don't be discouraged if your fish darts away from your hand. Your goldfish may come explore, they may swim away, or they might ignore you. This is perfectly normal. Put your hand in your goldfish' tank on a daily basis to help your fish get used to your hand. Once they are comfortable with your hand, you can begin the next step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Feed your goldfish.",
      "content": "Feed your goldfish. Take your pellets or flakes and hold them in your hand. Hold your hand under the water and drop the food. Let the food sink to the bottom. Repeat this daily. Your goldfish will soon approach the top of the water as they become used to your hand. This is a good start. If your fish doesn't come, be patient. Let them have their own time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold food under the water.",
      "content": "Hold food under the water. This time, instead of dropping the food, hold it in your hand. Your goldfish will smell the food and likely approach your hand. If your goldfish approaches to investigate, drop the pellets into their mouth. If your goldfish doesn't approach your hand, repeat the steps until they become less timid."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a target.",
      "content": "Create a target. You can use your finger or a brightly colored stick to navigate your goldfish. Make sure to find a colored stick that does not leach toxins into the water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stick your target into the water and take it out.",
      "content": "Stick your target into the water and take it out. Each time you take the target out of the water, drop a pellet or flake. Your fish will come up and eat the food. Repeat this step daily. Soon your goldfish will start coming up to you when the stick touches the water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow your goldfish to investigate the target.",
      "content": "Allow your goldfish to investigate the target. Keep your target into the water instead of removing it. Your fish will swim around it and explore. Your goldfish may peck the target. When it does that, immediately remove the target and give your fish a treat. Repeat until your goldfish understands the training process. Your goldfish may not do this immediately. It may take your goldfish sometime to peck at the stick so just keep it there and wait."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move the target.",
      "content": "Move the target. Once your goldfish pecks or touches the target with its mouth, you can move it. When your goldfish swims up to the target, move it along the water slowly. Moving the target by a centimeter is a good start. When your goldfish follows the target, reward it with a treat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start moving the target greater distances.",
      "content": "Start moving the target greater distances. Slowly increase the distance of your moving target. When your goldfish follows, give it some food. Repeat at least weekly for best results."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a hoop.",
      "content": "Make a hoop. You can make a hoop out of wire or just your fingers would work. Once you have a good-sized hoop, you can get started. Be aware that your fingers won't be as effective in training your goldfish if you use your finger during target practice as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your hoop in the water.",
      "content": "Place your hoop in the water. Allow your goldfish to get used to the hoop. This won't take long unless your fish is skittish towards new things. Keep the hoop in the tank and encourage your fish to investigate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your target to lead your goldfish through the hoop.",
      "content": "Use your target to lead your goldfish through the hoop. If your goldfish goes around the hoop, keep practicing until he goes in the hoop. Practice daily and if your fish doesn't respond right away, wait and be patient with it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep practicing each day.",
      "content": "Keep practicing each day. Using reward-based training, your goldfish should soon learn to swim through the hoop. Now you can play with your goldfish in many different ways. You can even try teaching it other tricks or make up new ones. Your little friend now has all the attention he needs to live a happy and healthy life!"
