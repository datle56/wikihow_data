      "content": "RS is a slang term meaning “Real sh*t” over text and on social media. Generally, “Real sh*t” can be used interchangeably with phrases like “I know right” (or “IKR” when abbreviated). It’s an acronym that conveys your strong agreement—usually with whatever someone else has texted or messaged you about. It can also mean that you really relate to something or just want people to know you’re being honest and speaking from the heart. [1] X Research source Them: “I’m so tired today, I could just sleep nonstop! 😴” You: “That’s rs, me too.”"

    {
      "title": "Use RS to agree wholeheartedly with someone.",
      "content": "Use RS to agree wholeheartedly with someone. Using the phrase “Real sh*t” is the same as saying, “I agree” or “You’re so right!” When you strongly concur with someone else’s words and want them to know that you relate to what they’re saying, use RS to show them that you agree. Respond to their statement with RS (and, if you feel like it, explain why you agree). [2] X Research source Them: “Is it just me, or was class especially boring today?” You: “No, you’re right, that’s such rs. I could barely focus on anything! 🫠”"

      "title": "Show someone you’re being honest (and not lying) using RS.",
      "content": "Show someone you’re being honest (and not lying) using RS. You can also use RS to confirm that you genuinely mean what you’re saying; it’s the same as saying something like, “For real, though,” or “Honestly, I think…” So, when you want to get real with a friend and emphasize that your words are honest, reliable, and should be believed, incorporate RS into your text or social media message. [3] X Research source “Rs, I’m not a huge Katy Perry fan.” “Rs, I think Fortnite is totally overrated.”"

      "title": "Share factual or socially relevant information with RS.",
      "content": "Share factual or socially relevant information with RS. RS (“Real sh*t”) implies not only honesty but also the idea that whatever you’re saying is totally factual. So, when you have something to share with another person, try beginning your text (or social media message) with RS to show them that your information is 100% accurate. For example: “Rs, did you know that the Alaskan town of Talkeetna had an (honorary) cat mayor?” “Rs, my boss told me Dave got fired! I had no idea.”"

      "title": "Expand on your thoughts if someone uses RS to agree with you.",
      "content": "Expand on your thoughts if someone uses RS to agree with you. When a friend strongly agrees with your opinion or point of view, that’s typically your cue to keep talking! After all, they relate to whatever you’ve just said—so they’re probably open to hearing more from you. So, go ahead and share any other thoughts you might have about whatever it is that your friend agrees with. [4] X Research source You: “ The Emperor’s New Groove is an underrated Disney movie!” Them: “Omg yes, that’s rs!! 👏” You: “It’s probably one of the best ones, in my opinion. We should watch it sometime!”"

      "content": "Be truthful in return when someone uses RS to show honesty. When a friend opens up to you and speaks with complete sincerity (while using the RS acronym), do the same for them if you feel comfortable! So, respond authentically to their statement and show them that you mean what you say. For example: Them: “Rs, I didn’t really enjoy Haley’s party last night. 🙁” You: “To be honest, I didn’t either. It got a little too rowdy, I think!”"

      "content": "React to the true fact that someone shares with you using RS. If someone shares a cool fact or important piece of information with you, respond in whatever way feels right. For example, you might comment that the fact they shared was super interesting, react with surprise to the information they gave you, or express disappointment if they gave you some bad news. Them: “Rs, did you know that tigers have striped skin—not just striped fur? 🐅” You: “Whoa, really? That’s wild!”"

      "content": "RuneScape RuneScape is a popular MMORPG (massively multiplayer online roleplaying game). While “Real sh*t” is the most common definition of RS over text, TikTok, Snapchat, and more, you may see someone who’s specifically into gaming use RS to refer to RuneScape instead—especially if they want to ask if you play the game, or they want to plan a time for the both of you to play it together. [5] X Research source “I’ve been trying to boost my RS combat level a ton!! What’s yours right now?” “Wanna play some RS later? We could do a few quests together! 🎮”"

      "content": "Red shirt A Star Trek fan might use RS to refer to “red shirts,” which are the security personnel in the original Star Trek television series who wear red and tend to die during episodes to make the danger seem more dramatic. If you see a friend mention Star Trek and RS in the same text, they’re probably referring to red shirts. “All the RS in this episode of Star Trek keep dying!!” “TBH, I think RS should be the highest-paid of the Enterprise crew. Their job is so dangerous! 🖖”"

      "content": "Rainbow Six Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six is a series of FPS (first-person shooter) games based on a novel called Rainbow Six (by author Tom Clancy). The full title is often shortened to “ Rainbow Six ,” which is why RS is sometimes an acronym used when fans want to discuss one of the games or play together. For example: “Wanna play co-op in RS sometime this week?” “I’m totally addicted to RS right now. The new update is so much fun!” Since RuneScape (the game more commonly referred to as RS) and Rainbow Six have the same acronym, try asking someone which game they mean if you aren’t sure. However, if you already know what games they usually play, you may be able to assume which one they’re talking about!"

      "content": "Risos RS can sometimes be an acronym for “risos,” which means “laughs” in Portuguese. So, essentially, RS is the Portuguese equivalent of writing the common English acronym “LOL” (laugh out loud) in a text or social media message. However, you probably won’t see this version of RS unless you or someone you know speaks and understands Portuguese. You: “Why did the teddy bear say no to dessert? …Because he was stuffed!” Them: “RS 🤣”"
