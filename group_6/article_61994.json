      "content": "Straighten your hair and wear it down for a sleek, polished look. This style works great on both medium and long hair, though you can also pull it off with shorter locks. Leave your hair over your ears rather than tucked behind. Pull your beanie onto your head and position it so it’s a little lower in the back than it is in the front. [1] X Research source One of the downfalls of wearing a beanie with longer hair is the resulting tangles you may experience. To combat this, make sure your hair is dry and tangle-free before you put on your beanie. You may also want to apply a leave-in conditioner and skip the hairspray. If you’re concerned about your hair looking even on each side, part your hair down the middle."

      "content": "Opt for dreamy beach waves for a chic style you can wear anywhere. Part your hair down the middle and use a curling wand or iron to create gentle waves in your hair. Position your hair so it’s in front of your ears, then pull on your beanie. Choose a baggy beanie for a more bohemian vibe, or pick a smaller one for a cleaner look. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that a smaller or tighter beanie may flatten your hair. If you know you’re going to be taking off your beanie while you’re out, you may want to opt for a baggier one to help preserve your hairstyle."

      "title": "Keep your super curly hair voluminous by pairing it with a baggy beanie.",
      "content": "Keep your super curly hair voluminous by pairing it with a baggy beanie. Whether your natural hair is short or long, leave it down to showcase your beautiful curls. Position the front of the beanie so it is just in front of your hairline, then gently pull the back down in place so it’s slouched back on your scalp. [3] X Research source Baggy beanies can sometimes feel a little precarious like they might fall off at any moment. If you’re worried about your hat coming off, try pushing a few bobby pins through the knitting of the cap pointing toward your face. Catch a few strands of hair with the bobby pin to help keep the beanie in place."

      "title": "Cover super short hair with whatever kind of beanie you prefer.",
      "content": "Cover super short hair with whatever kind of beanie you prefer. Because your hair will be hidden from sight no matter what kind of beanie you wear, you can focus more on the style of the actual beanie itself. A tighter beanie will look more clean-cut, while a baggy beanie will look more casual. [4] X Research source Because your hair is so short, it may get mussed no matter what you do. Try styling it with a little bit of hair wax or pomade so it’s easier to reshape once you take off your beanie."

      "title": "Show off your fringe by positioning the beanie higher on your forehead.",
      "content": "Show off your fringe by positioning the beanie higher on your forehead. If you have bangs, you don’t have to hide them or flatten them if you want to rock a beanie. Get them in place, then gently line up the front of your beanie so it’s just covering the top of your forehead, then pull the back of the beanie into place. [5] X Research source Leaving your bangs down along with straight or wavy locks will frame your face even more and make your hair look fuller. Bangs tend to look better with a slouchy or baggy beanie rather than a tight-fitting one. Of course, you can wear bangs if you’re sporting a braid, bun, or ponytail, too."

      "title": "Keep your hair out of your face with braided pigtails.",
      "content": "Keep your hair out of your face with braided pigtails. Use a comb to part your hair down the middle. Braid each side into a 3-strand braid, french braids, fishtail braids, or whatever braided style you prefer. Secure the ends with elastics, then position your beanie. [6] X Research source You can position your braids so they come forward over your shoulders, or you could push them back so they peak out the back of the beanie. This is a great option if your hair was down but has started to get tangled or in the way. Leave your beanie in place and simply separate your hair into 2 sections. Braid each side, tie the ends with a hair elastic, and continue on your way."

      "content": "Use double-buns to create a casual-chic style with your beanie. Use a comb to separate your hair down the middle. Take one side and tie it into a basic ponytail at the base of your neck on the side of your head. Twist the ponytail until it starts to tighten and wrap around itself. Secure the bun with several bobby pins, then repeat on the opposite side. Pull your beanie on over your head and position the back of it so it is slightly above your buns. [7] X Research source If you prefer a shabby-chic style, simply tie each side into a mini-messy bun"

      "content": "Toss your hair back in a low bun or ponytail if you’re in a rush. This is a great way to look put together without having to spend much time on your hair. Simply secure your hair with an elastic at the base of your neck, pull on your beanie, and head out for the day. [8] X Research source Try leaving out a few wisps of hair in the front to frame your face."

Wear this look with the braid over your shoulder, and consider pulling out a few strands of hair on the opposite side for a casual finish to the look. Pair this look with any style of beanie.

      "content": "Rock a messy bun with a modified beanie. If you love wearing your hair in a messy bun but also want to keep warm, look for a beanie with a hole on the top. Put your hair up in a ponytail, then pull on your beanie, pushing the ponytail through the hole. Create the messy bun after the beanie is on so that you don’t risk ruining it while pulling on your hair. [10] X Research source You can also use this type of beanie to wear a ponytail if you don’t want to put your hair up in a bun."

      "content": "Hide a bad hair day by tucking your hair completely into a slouchy beanie. You can either tie your hair into a low bun and tuck it up inside the beanie or try flipping your hair upside down and gathering it into the hat before flipping right-side-up and positing the beanie on your head. If your hair is super curly or voluminous, try putting a wig cap or something similar over your hair to hold it down, then put on your beanie. [11] X Research source A tight-fitting beanie would look odd if all your hair was shoved underneath it. A baggy beanie has more room and looks more natural."
