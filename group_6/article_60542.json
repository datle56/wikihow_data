      "content": "Pick a dark place to store your fur. Fur does not do well if it gets exposed to direct sunlight. The ideal place to store fur is a dark location. A closet, for example, is a great place to store fur. Choose an area of your home that does not get a lot of direct sunlight. A closet right by your bedroom window may not be a great place for a fur coat. A closet near the hallway, away from windows, may be a better option."

      "content": "Do not use cedar closets or moth balls. Both cedar closets and moth balls absorb moisture. This can dramatically increase humidity, which can be very harmful to a fur coat.

      "content": "Avoid over filling the closet. A coat should never be pushed into the corner of a crowded closet. Coats need ample room for safe storage. If you don't have room for a fur coat in a closet, do not squeeze the coat in. Either move other clothing elsewhere or store the coat in another area. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure to ask questions at the facility.",
      "content": "Make sure to ask questions at the facility. You can find storage facilities online or in the local yellow pages. You should always ask questions when selecting a storage facility. Storing coats is expensive, so you want to make sure your coat will not get damaged by the wrong facility. Ask where the storage area is. Some facilities store fur coats in a cramped back room. [5] X Research source You should also visit a facility in person and ask to see the storage area. You do not want to store your coat in a facility where it will be jammed in with other clothing items. You should also ask about coverage in the event the fur is lost or damaged. If you have insurance, make sure your insurance still covers your fur if you choose to store it. You should also make sure the storage facility has insurance coverage, and ask whether or not you would be compensated in the event of damages."
