      "content": "Print out an image. You can find pictures of the things you want to draw, it can be a cartoon, a nature view or even selfies. Just make sure the photos you are printing are in black and white; that way you can see the lines better."

      "title": "Shade the image.",
      "content": "Shade the image. Turn the printed image upside down, use a graphic pencil (5B<) and cover up the printed area. You don't have to be super perfect on this. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Place it on the drawing surface.",
      "content": "Place it on the drawing surface. Turn the printed image back up, place the image on your drawing surface. You might want to draw a tiny triangle connecting both surfaces, in case you want to adjust the image. Now the shaded side should be facing down. You can use this method on almost anything, from office paper to acrylic canvas. [3] X Research source Even a window can be a drawing surface. Put the printout on a window that receives lots of light. Take out masking tape and tape the corners of the printout onto the window. Place the paper youâ€™ll use for your drawing over it and tape the corners."

    {
      "title": "Done.",
      "content": "Done. Remove the printed image to review the perfect tracing. If there are any small mistakes, don't worry! If you've got a small eraser, like a Tombow mono eraser, then you can rub away tiny details with lots of precision."
