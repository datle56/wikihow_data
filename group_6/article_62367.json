      "content": "In the world of romance, Aries is a go-getter, unafraid to step up and let a crush know they’re interested. Their least compatible zodiac matches are more reserved earth signs like Virgo and Capricorn and highly sensitive water signs Cancer and Pisces. Aries is most compatible with fellow fire signs Leo and Sagittarius and air signs Gemini and Aquarius."

      "title": "Taurus",
      "content": "Taurus Taurus and Aries move at different paces through life. Taurus prefers to take things slow and steady, while Aries is reckless and full of energy; Taurus can end up boring Aries, while Aries can easily wear down Taurus. However, they’re both sensual and passionate during physical intimacy, making quite the sexually compatible pair. [1] X Research source This couple’s greatest challenge: Their stubbornness and lack of emotional connection. How to make it work: Communication can be difficult because both signs are stubborn. They’re at their best when Aries and Taurus can be patient and take time to fully understand each other’s needs."

    {
      "title": "Scorpio",
      "content": "Scorpio There’s not a lot of love between Scorpio and Aries . Scorpio is secretive, controlling, and sometimes jealous, which conflicts with Aries’s need for freedom. Aries can quickly grow bored with Scorpio’s paranoia, while Aries’s flirty nature is sure to rub Scorpio the wrong way. Aries is an outgoing sign who craves the spotlight, while Scorpio wants to observe from the background. This couple’s greatest challenge: Their conflicting values and relationship standards. How to make it work: Both signs are intense and exceptionally passionate, but they’ll need to respect their differences before taking the relationship to the next level."

    {
      "title": "Cancer",
      "content": "Cancer Cancer and Aries tend to act very differently in relationships; Cancer’s desire for stability and emotional vulnerability is a far cry from Aries’s idea of a fun, adventurous partnership. Their communication styles clash since blunt, forthright Aries might come across as too aggressive and domineering for sweet, sensitive Cancer. This couple’s greatest challenge: Their communication. How to make it work: Aries will need to learn how to soften their words and adapt to Cancer’s communications style, while Cancer will need to start speaking up and letting Aries know what they want."

    {
      "title": "Virgo",
      "content": "Virgo Stability will be an issue for a Virgo-Aries pair . Methodical, orderly Virgo won’t know how to handle Aries’s spontaneous, chaotic energy, while Aries may get impatient with cautious Virgo. Aries also needs more independence than Virgo may be willing to give, while Virgo can often be critical of their significant other—which stubborn, hotheaded Aries won’t take well. This couple’s greatest challenge: Their clashing lifestyles. How to make it work: If both signs work to balance each other out, they can go far together. Aries can bring a little fun and excitement to Virgo’s life, while Virgo can offer Aries some structure."

    {
      "title": "Pisces",
      "content": "Pisces Intimacy may be difficult for Pisces and Aries since they have vastly different approaches. Dreamy Pisces craves complete emotional vulnerability, which is not in Aries’s nature. Aries wants to let loose and have fun! Pisces is typically introspective and lives with their head up in the clouds, so a forthright Aries might have trouble figuring out Pisces’s thoughts. This couple’s greatest challenge: Their physical connection and communication. How to make it work: Both signs should be open to seeing life from another perspective. Aries can hype up Pisces and motivate them, while Pisces can show Aries how to be more thoughtful and empathetic."

    {
      "title": "Capricorn",
      "content": "Capricorn Capricorn and Aries are both bold and ambitious, but they operate at different speeds. Aries takes life by the horns and dives into every project headfirst, while Capricorn takes their time and thinks through every decision. Capricorn might write Aries off as too childish and unpredictable, which could quickly spark Aries’s anger and conflict between them. This couple’s greatest challenge: Their stubbornness and mismatched values. How to make it work: These signs should work on developing mutual respect for one another’s values and compromise to avoid fights caused by both signs’ stubbornness."

    {
      "title": "Gemini",
      "content": "Gemini Gemini and Aries are two signs with boundless energy! When they come together, these fun-loving signs won’t be able to resist one another.

This couple’s greatest strength: Their matching energy and intellectual chemistry. How to make it work: Aries and Gemini both love going on adventures and trying new things. So long as they keep it up as their relationship develops, they’ll never get bored in each others’ company."

      "content": "Leo As fellow fire signs, Leo and Aries have a lot in common. Individually, they’re ambitious, bold, and outgoing signs who shoot for the moon. Together, they can be an indomitable power couple! Aries has the passion to chase lofty goals, and Leo has the determination to see them through. Plus, neither sign is afraid to let loose and have fun; this couple will be the life of the party. This couple’s greatest strength: Their shared values and goals in life.

      "title": "Sagittarius",
      "content": "Sagittarius The other fire sign match, Sagittarius, is flexible and spontaneous—and this is no problem for Aries! Sagittarius’s deep-seated independence and adventurousness are a siren call for equally free-spirited Aries. Sagittarius also has a philosophical mind and hunger for knowledge which Aries will be happy to indulge. This couple’s greatest strength: Their ability to respect each other’s boundaries. How to make it work: Aries’s hot temper and Sagittarius’s moodiness means they both tend to act and speak without thinking. If they can be more empathetic and consider one another’s feelings, they’ll be a fantastic match."

      "content": "Aquarius Intellectual and rebellious Aquarius will hold a ton of appeal for Aries , who can, in turn, easily give Aquarius the mental stimulation they need to be happy in a relationship. [2] X Research source They’ll be able to talk endlessly and trust one another with their wildest thoughts—but although they’re both passionate, physical intimacy might be a problem for two signs that struggle to show their softer emotions. This couple’s greatest strength: Their communication. How to make it work: Neither sign is terribly sensitive or emotional. Both Aries and Aquarius will need to work on being vulnerable with one another and get comfortable expressing their deepest emotions."

      "title": "Libra",
      "content": "Libra As an air sign ruled by Venus, the planet of love, Libra has both intelligence and the ability to see the beauty in everything, which is sure to impress Aries! Libra will appreciate Aries’s boldness and determination since Libra can be pretty indecisive at times. Libra and Aries’s physical attraction will also be off the charts; they’re opposites on the zodiac wheel, and opposites attract. This couple’s greatest strength: Their physical connection and independence. How to make it work: Communication can take lots of work between a conflict-avoidant Libra and an aggressive Aries. They make a great team if they adapt to one another’s communication styles and accept their differences.

      "content": "Aries Two Aries will share a passionate, fast-paced relationship—and their intimacy will be positively explosive! Because Aries is a no-nonsense, direct sign, each partner will appreciate the other’s straightforwardness, and trust will be easy to build between them. After all, two Aries will also have similar values and naturally crave the same things in a relationship. This couple’s greatest strength: Their mutual honesty and passion for one another. How to make it work: Aries’s tendency to take a “me-first” approach to life can cause tension between the two. Unless they learn to value one another’s needs (and not just their own), these two hotheads might combust!"
