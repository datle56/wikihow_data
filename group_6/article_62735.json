      "content": "Yes—you can indirectly transfer money by linking your bank account. While you can't directly transfer funds between Zelle and Cash App (since they are two different financial platforms), you can link your bank account or debit card to both platforms as a workaround. After your bank account is synced, you can transfer Cash App funds to your bank account, which can then be used to send money with Zelle . Similarly, any money you receive via Zelle will be added to your bank account and can be transferred to your Cash App balance. If you're eligible for instant transfers, you may be able to send money from Zelle to Cash App and vice versa fairly quickly. If you don't have instant transfers, you'll need to wait until the funds finish processing on each platform."
