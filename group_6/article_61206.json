      "title": "Try to keep from scratching at your blisters.",
      "content": "Try to keep from scratching at your blisters. As difficult as it may be, leave your blisters alone and avoid scratching. They will crust over and then fall off on their own. If you scratch them, they will open up and become more susceptible to infection. [3] X Research source You will also spread bacteria with your hands if you scratch at the blisters. If this does happen inadvertently, always wash your hands afterward to stay hygienic."

      "title": "Use a baking soda paste to reduce irritation.",
      "content": "Use a baking soda paste to reduce irritation. Baking soda has a pH greater than 7 (making it alkaline), giving it the ability to neutralize the chemical that creates the itching sensation. The chemical creating the itching sensation is acidic with a pH that is less than 7. [4] X Research source Apply a paste made of 3 teaspoons baking soda mixed with 1 teaspoon of water. This relieves itching and helps the blisters dry out quicker. You can apply this paste as often as needed to relieve the itching."

      "content": "Apply a cold compress to your blisters. Use a cool, moist compress to ease discomfort. You can apply this compress for up to 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. [5] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source You can make a cold compress by wrapping an ice block in a clean towel and pressing it against your skin. Alternatively, you can use a bag of frozen vegetables. Just make sure not to put it directly on your skin and not to keep it on your skin for more than 20 minutes at a time as both of these conditions can lead to tissue damage."

      "content": "Spread Benzocaine cream on your blisters after you remove the cold compress. Apply a topical cream, such as nonprescription benzocaine cream, directly after your cool compress application. Benzocaine works as an anesthetic, numbing the nerve endings in the skin. [6] X Research source As an alternative, talk to your doctor about prescription 5% Lidocaine patches. You can apply the patch to the area where you're experiencing the pain, as long as your skin is intact. You can apply as many as 3 patches at once. You can wear your patches for up to 12 hours in a 24 hour period."

You can purchase it without a prescription at your local pharmacy. Instead of soaking your sores, you can also apply the Burow’s solution directly onto your sores via the cold compress.

      "content": "Try transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). This treatment involves the placement of electrodes over the nerves that are causing the pain. These electrodes deliver tiny, painless electrical impulses to nearby nerve pathways. [17] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Exactly how these impulses relieve pain is uncertain. One theory is that the impulses stimulate the production of endorphins, your body’s natural painkillers. Unfortunately, this treatment doesn’t work for everyone, but it tends to be more effective if it is given in conjunction with a drug called pregabalin."

Like TENS units, you can turn these units on and off as needed to control pain. [18] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Before the device is surgically implanted, doctors do a trial first using a thin wire electrode. The trial is done to ensure that the stimulator will provide effective pain relief. The electrode is inserted through your skin into the epidural space over the spinal cord for a spinal cord stimulator, or under your skin above a peripheral nerve in the case of a peripheral nerve stimulator."

      "content": "Use a topical medication to clear the shingles up before they get worse. In addition to antiviral medications, your physician may prescribe a topical medication, such as caladryl. Caladryl may help your already open lesions by reducing pain and itching. Caladryl works by interfering with the pain signals the nerves send to the brain and is available in gel, lotion, spray or stick form. Caladryl may be applied every 6 hours, up to 4 times a day. You need to wash and dry the affected area prior to application. As another option, ask your doctor about prescription 5% Lidocaine (Lipoderm) adhesive patches. You can apply the patches to intact skin to help manage your pain. For an over-the-counter option, use capsaicin cream (Zostrix, Zostrix HP). Apply the cream to intact skin 3 to 4 times per day. The cream may cause a burning or stinging sensation when you apply it, but this side effect should go away. If it doesn't, stop using the cream. Be sure to wash and dry your hands thoroughly after you apply the cream.
