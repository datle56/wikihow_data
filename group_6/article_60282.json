      "title": "Separate your rope into 3 strands.",
      "content": "Separate your rope into 3 strands. Start by taking the end of 1 strand and unraveling it about 5 revolutions down the rope—take the end of a strand and rotate it around the others 5 full times. [1] X Research source You may need to cut the end of your rope free to separate it, if it’s bound by adhesive or melted together. If you’re using a rope with more than 3 strands, unravel them, then gather them as evenly as possible into 3 groups, making essentially a 3-strand rope. Eye splices are useful for making a stable loop in a line of rope. This can be useful for towing, pulling, hanging, or pulleys."

      "title": "Seal the ends and bases of your strands with tape.",
      "content": "Seal the ends and bases of your strands with tape. Wrap electrical tape (or another sturdy kind of tape) once or twice around the end of each strand, as well as where the strands meet. [2] X Research source This prevents your rope from fraying while working on it, and from unraveling any further. Or, seal the ends of synthetic rope by singing the fibers together with a lighter. Hold the flame to the very end of each strand for a few seconds until the fibers fuse together. Always exercise caution when working with fire. If your rope has soaked up a flammable substance, it could catch fire easily. Or, use a rope-safe glue to attach the end strands of a natural fiber rope together to prevent further fraying."

      "title": "Size the loop by laying the base of the strands over the rope.",
      "content": "Size the loop by laying the base of the strands over the rope. Bring the point of the rope where the unraveled strands meet back up to the main body of the rope where you want your splice tied. This establishes the size of your loop. [3] X Research source Mark this point on the rope with a marker to help you remember where it is. Keep in mind what you want to use the spliced rope for—a big loop may work well for some jobs, but may not be ideal for others."

    {
      "title": "Loosen the base of your loop and feed in your first strand.",
      "content": "Loosen the base of your loop and feed in your first strand. Loosen the point on the body of your rope that’ll form the base of the loop by twisting it against the rotation of the rope. Then, feed 1 end strand under and through the loosened, untwisted strand nearest you, and pull the end strand through. [4] X Research source As you pull the end strand through, position the 2 other end strands so that they “straddle” or fall on either side of the rope."

      "title": "Tuck your second end strand over, under, and through the rope’s body.",
      "content": "Tuck your second end strand over, under, and through the rope’s body. Take the next end strand that’s clockwise around the end of the rope. Position it so that it travels over the loosened body strand through which you fed the first end strand, then feed it under and through the very next loosened strand. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Tuck the last end strand through the last body strand.",
      "content": "Tuck the last end strand through the last body strand. Now take the last end strand and feed it through the third loosened body strand—the one which you haven’t yet pulled a strand through. Pull it all the way through, just like the other 2 end strands. Make sure all 3 end strands are pulled all the way through, so that the base of the loosened strands are firmly up against the body of the rope."

      "title": "Continue to weave the end strands up through the rope’s body.",
      "content": "Continue to weave the end strands up through the rope’s body. Take the first strand you tucked and move it over the next strand on the body of the rope, then tuck it under and through the strand after that. Do the same with the other 2 end strands, repeating your way around the rope. [6] X Research source Keep working until all 3 end strands are completely tucked into the body of the rope, weaving them over and under one at a time. As you work, continue to twist the rope to loosen its body, and pull each strand all the way through so that the strands are sturdy and secure. Weave the ends until each has been tucked into the body at least 5 times, or until you cannot tuck them any further."

      "content": "Unravel the last 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of your rope. Untwist the very end of your rope until you have 3 separate strands that are each about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) long. [7] X Research source Cut the end of your rope free to separate it if it’s held together with adhesive or melted together. Thicker ropes are easier to back splice if you unravel an additional 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm). If you’re using a rope with more than 3 strands, unravel them, then gather them as evenly as possible into 3 groups, making essentially a 3-strand rope. A back splice is especially useful for preventing a rope that has become unraveled from fraying. This splice will securely keep the rope together."

Depending on the length of your end strands, you may have to continue this pattern for several twists in the rope until the full length of your end strands is spliced. Pull on the ends of your rope firmly until the weave is solid. Further tighten your spliced rope by rolling it in your hands, feeling the rope squeeze and settle as you do so. Your end-spliced rope is now ready to use!"

If you’re using a rope with more than 3 strands, unravel them, then gather them as evenly as possible into 3 groups, making essentially a 3-strand rope. A short splice is great for joining the ends of 2 different ropes, making for a longer length of rope. That said, avoid using short-spliced ropes as load-bearing ropes. They’re plenty sturdy, but not as ideal as a fully intact rope."
