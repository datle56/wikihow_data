      "content": "Sparse, thin, or patchy facial hairs The quality of your facial hairs individually are a good indicator of what kind of beard you can expect to grow. If you grow gruff five o’clock shadow followed by thick and itchy beard hairs, you can probably go the full lumberjack route with the mountain man beard. If your bear hairs are kind of whispy, a fuller beard may be difficult for you. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Slow growth It doesn’t automatically mean you can’t grow a full beard if your facial hair grows slowly, but it may take you a really long time. Rivas says that it’s not uncommon for some men to need up to a full year to grow a “full” beard. That said, it may take so much time for you to grow a beard that it’s functionally the same as not being able to grow one."

      "content": "No change to facial hair with age It’s normal for an 18- or 21-year-old guy to have a patchy or thin beard, but if that doesn’t change by 30 or so, it may be a sign there’s no full beard on the horizon. It’s not like there’s some line you cross as you get age where you wake up the next day and can suddenly grow a full beard. For some guys, it just takes time and age to develop the hair follicles needed for a giant beard. [2] X Research source"

Your family history isn’t the end-all be-all when it comes to whether you can grow a beard or not, but it is a very good indicator of what you’re likely to end up with in the facial hair department.

      "content": "Lack of body hair elsewhere If you aren’t a naturally hairy guy, you probably aren’t going to grow a super thick beard. Body hair growth tends to correlate relatively closely with facial hair growth, so if your chest, back, and pits don’t have a lot of hair, you’re unlikely to grow thick beards quickly.

[5] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Some ethnic groups seem to have a much harder time growing full beards. Growing facial hair out has no advantage biologically speaking, so it makes sense that some cultures wouldn’t prioritize men with beards as partners. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Hormones Your body’s hormone levels are a huge influence on whether you can grow a beard or not. A lot of people say it’s just testosterone impacting your facial hair, but it’s actually androgens as a group. These are the hormones that give men reproductive abilities and tell cells how to differentiate, so if your androgen levels are atypical it can prevent facial hair. [8] X Research source This isn’t to say that being unable to grow facial hair means you aren’t able to reproduce (or anything like that). Hormones are complicated, so don’t read too much into an inability to grow a beard. It’s unlikely that anything is wrong with you, but if you are worried about your beardlessness being a sign of a hormone imbalance, it doesn’t hurt to see your doctor to have your hormone levels tested!"
