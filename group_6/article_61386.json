      "content": "“Unc” is short for “uncle” and is a way of calling someone old. When you see the word on TikTok or Twitter/X, it’s short for “uncle.” It’s AAVE (African American Vernacular English), and people use it to point out that someone has “uncle vibes,” or certain habits or behaviors that make them seem of a certain age. And not just older, but also a bit eccentric or goofy. Like that one weird uncle you have. [1] X Research source People might also say someone has “unc status” to mean the same thing—that they’re giving off uncle vibes. Example: “Jared always shows up to the family gatherings single and with some new expensive accessories. He’s a real unc.” Example: “Yeah Jeff likes to watch 60 Minutes for fun. What an unc.”"

      "content": "Someone has “unc status” if they act older than their actual age. We guarantee you know somebody who fits the description. They’re about your age, but they might use weird, outdated words that nobody their age has business knowing. They still listen to the radio. They just spent thousands of dollars on an ugly paint job for their car. The list goes on: They watch old-school TV shows, like M*A*S*H or Family Matters. They grunt whenever they lift something heavy. They grunt when they sit up or stand down. They complain about back or joint pain. They say things like “back in my day” or “my generation…” They don’t know about new artists or musicians. They’re out-of-the-loop with current slang. They have a big, adult job and probably work in an office."

      "content": "Use “unc” or “unc status” to joke about a friend acting too old. Got a friend who seems to be aging comfortably into their elder status, even though they’re only 19? Or maybe they really are just getting plain old. Call them “unc” to let them know that they’re not the young buck they used to be. Example: “Sorry, unc, I’m just too fast for you. Maybe you could’ve taken me 5 years ago.” Example: “Hey unc, you’ve still got your phone from 2015. Time for an update, maybe?”"

But they usually have unc vibes. That’s what makes them your uncle. (And that they’re your mom or dad’s brother, of course.) Example: “My unc’s picking me up in 10. We’re getting ice cream.” Example: “How’s it going, unc? Long time no see, how’s Aunt Carol?”"
