      "content": "“Fruity” is used to describe things that might be gay or queer. As a slang term, “fruity” is a cheeky adjective that implies someone or something might be queer, or could be seen as queer. It's a not-so-subtle, somewhat slick way to identify someone or something as LGBTQ+, or related to the LGBTQ+ culture. [1] X Research source Example: “My girlfriend and I love this new show about a lesbian couple. It’s fruity, just like us.” Example: “Nobody was surprised when I came out as gay. I’ve always been a little fruity.”"

      "content": "“Fruity” is a reclaimed slur that was used against LGBTQ+ people. The term “fruit” has been used as a negative word to describe gay people, or anyone who might be LGBTQ+, or even just feminine, for a long time. [2] X Research source In 1984, the word referred to someone who was an easy target, and the term likely morphed to refer specifically to gay men. [3] X Research source In the years since, the queer community began using it themselves in order to make it less powerful. The slur is also probably related to the phrase “nutty as a fruitcake,” with “fruitcake” itself having history as an anti-queer slur. The term “fruit” likely has origins in Polari, which is an outdated way of speaking that was used by queer people, prostitutes, and other marginalized people. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "“Fruity” now has widespread use in online queer communities. Slang comes and goes, and while “fruit” and “fruity” aren’t new terms by any means, they’ve recently surged in popularity among queer internet users on platforms like TikTok, Twitter, and Tumblr. It's easy to see why: “fruity” is a sort of exclusive, playful, and even empowering term that helps queer users describe themselves and the world around them."

      "title": "Use “fruity” to imply that something or someone is queer.",
      "content": "Use “fruity” to imply that something or someone is queer. “Fruity” is a fun and silly way for queer people to discuss media, trends and cultural phenomena, and even other people who express themselves as queer. It’s mostly used as a sort of wink-wink, to suggest that something might be queer-coded, even when it might not obviously seem that way. Example: “I always thought that band's music was a little fruity. I mean, it’s a bunch of guys singing about how much they love other men.” Example: “What do you think of this outfit? Too fruity? Is it too obvious that I’m a raging homosexual?”"

      "title": "Avoid using “fruity” if you aren’t queer yourself.",
      "content": "Avoid using “fruity” if you aren’t queer yourself. The reality is that “fruity” has is roots in an anti-LGBTQ+ slur, “fruit.” Just like you wouldn’t use other slurs if you don’t belong to the groups those slurs have historically been used against, it’s best to avoid describing people or things as “fruity” if you aren’t fruity yourself. Queer people say it to reclaim a violent word, and it’s hard to “reclaim” a word that was never used against you in the first place. Also, avoid describing people who aren’t openly queer as “fruity.” Publicly speculating on someone’s sexuality is invasive, and can even put them in danger."

      "title": "“Is he… you know…”",
      "content": "“Is he… you know…” This phrase is a parody of the way non-queer people tend to gossip about the sexualities of people they think are queer. Nowadays, queer people themselves often say it as a sort of joke about people or things that are, either allegedly or obviously, visibly queer. The phrase is also often paired with the 🫳 emoji, which in this context is meant to represent a limp wrist, something also historically thought of as “gay.” Example: “Woah, Jack’s wearing a rainbow cape. Is he… you know…”"

      "content": "“Fruity (derogatory)” This is a joke that originated on Tumblr. The “(derogatory)” is a jab at or a parody of online “tone indicators” that are meant to tell you the intended meaning of a phrase over text. Here, “(derogatory)” is used as fun self-deprecation to describe your own blatant or over-the-top queerness. [5] X Research source Example: “I didn’t realize I left the house wearing my rainbow cape. I'm so fruity (derogatory).”"

      "content": "Relating to, or like, fruit Most commonly, when not used as a slang term, “fruity” just means that something is similar to or has qualities of fruit. It might be used to describe things like wine, flavored sparkling water, perfumes or aromas, or virtually anything else that calls to mind fruit. [6] X Research source Example: “Your lemon bars are so fruity and delicious!”"

These can be qualities like sweet, refreshing, natural, or nourishing, to name a few. [7] X Research source Similarly, “fruity” can also mean something sweet or sentimental, or intellectually or emotionally profound. Example: “I found the lecture a bit fruity. I thought the speaker was a little too precious, but overall it was thoughtful and enriching.”"
