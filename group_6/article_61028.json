      "content": "Look for products that say “thickening” or “volumizing” on the label. Unlike normal shampoos and conditioners, these products work to add more definition and volume to your hair, which makes your hair look fuller and thicker. Take time to lather the ends of your hair whenever you apply these types of shampoo and conditioner. [1] X Research source Dried-out ends tend to look a lot thinner. Try to use shampoos and conditioners that also work as moisturizers. [2] X Expert Source Michelle Bebbington Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 3 August 2021."

      "content": "Sulfates are harsh chemicals that can damage your hair over time. Check the ingredients on your current hair care products and see if there are any sulfates listed on the bottle. If your typical hair products include these ingredients, switch to a different formula. Try to use shampoos and conditioners with lots of protein, instead of harsh additives. [3] X Research source If you’re using sulfate-filled shampoo on a regular basis, your ends will look thinner."

      "content": "Remove built-up dirt and oil with a clarifying shampoo. If you use a lot of thickening shampoo and conditioner on a regular basis, you might feel the product building up in your hair. Work a grape-sized amount of clarifying shampoo into your hair and knead it into your scalp. If you feel a lot of product build-up near the ends of your hair, rub the shampoo into those areas as well. [4] X Research source Don’t use a clarifying shampoo more than once a week. Simply replace your normal thickening shampoo with this product when you take a shower. While cleansing your scalp doesn’t directly affect the ends of your hair, a clean scalp will make the rest of your locks look and feel a lot cleaner and fuller."

      "content": "Heating tools can make your hair look frizzy and thin. Although they're convenient, think twice before drying, curling, and straightening your hair with heating tools on a regular basis. If these tools are essential to your daily routine, try spritzing your locks with a heat protectant spray before using a blow dryer, curler, or straightener. [5] X Research source Whenever possible, try setting your heat devices to a lower temperature. While you don’t have to cut these devices out your life altogether, try reducing the number of times you use them each week."

      "content": "Avoid applying a lot of pressure to your natural hair as you style it. While you might feel the need to tug on your hair lightly while blow drying or styling it, try not to put a lot of strain on your ends overall. If you pull or tug too much, you could do long-term damage to the ends of your locks, making them look thin and brittle. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim off the damaged, thinner ends of your hair. Evaluate your current hairstyle and see if you’d be comfortable sporting a cut that’s shoulder-length or shorter. When your hair is shorter, you might notice that ends appear thicker, as compared to longer locks that go past your shoulders. [7] X Research source If you’re intimidated by the idea of a big hairstyle change, try trimming a few inches or centimeters from your current cut. [8] X Expert Source Michelle Bebbington Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 3 August 2021. Ask your hairstylist for suggestions if you can’t think of a good hairstyle to try. You can also layer your hair to add an extra dimension."

      "content": "Changing your part can make your hair look thicker. Instead of parting your hair down the center or to a certain side, try flipping your hair in the opposite direction. While you’re not making any permanent changes to your hair, you’ll make both the roots and ends of your locks appear thicker at a glance. [9] X Research source Your ends will be more noticeable if you have a shorter haircut."

      "content": "Curls create an optical illusion that makes your hair look thicker. Use a curling iron, a curling wand, or a no-heat curling method to add waves to your hair. Focus on the ends of your hair as you go along, checking that the waves are visible on the bottom few inches or centimeters of your hair-do. [10] X Research source Your hair doesn’t need to be in ringlets for your locks to appear thick. Simple waves can do the trick."

      "content": "The added dimension will create the illusion of thicker hair. Talk to your stylist about adding colorful highlights throughout your hair. Explain that you’d like the highlights to fall to the ends of your locks, instead of fading out in the middle of the strands. [11] X Research source If you’re going for a natural look, choose a highlight that naturally blends with your hair. If you’d prefer a bolder style, opt for a bright color to serve as a highlight."

      "content": "Supplements like Omega 3 oils and pumpkin seed extract are good for hair. Over time, they can add a helpful boost to the strength and thickness of your hair, including the ends. Always check with your doctor before adding a new supplement to your diet, as you might encounter undesired side effects. [12] X Research source Talk to your doctor before trying any new supplements. They can recommend the best products for you to use, or other possible alternatives. Supplements won’t improve the thickness of your hair overnight. You probably won’t see results for at least 3-6 months. If you don’t want to commit to supplements, you can opt for foods with nutrients that are great for your hair. Try avocados, salmon, and nuts, which are rich in healthy oils."

As you make your selection, check that the product doesn’t have any sulfates, or other harsh chemicals that can do long-term damage to your hair. Before you use the product on a full-time basis, spray or rub the formula on a small section of your hair. If you don’t have any negative reactions, try using the product on a regular basis! [13] X Research source Volumizing products come in sprays, foams, and mousses. Pick a product that appeals the most to you! Several dry shampoos have volumizing benefits.
