      "content": "This is one of the easiest ways to start making a difference. CFL and LED light bulbs cost a little more than traditional incandescent light bulbs, but they use 75% less energy and last much longer, so the extra cost is definitely worth it! CFL and LED light bulbs are easy to find—you can buy them at your local hardware, grocery, and discount stores. [1] X Research source Changing 20 million light bulbs to CFLs would save $118 million in energy costs per year."

      "content": "It takes a lot of energy to pump, heat, and treat your water. Simple things like reducing water consumption make a big impact! You can make changes like taking shorter showers, turning off the faucet when you’re brushing your teeth, and switching to water-efficient fixtures to reduce the amount of water you use. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Resources Defence Council Multinational environmental advocacy group focused on grassroots activism and legislative action Go to source If 1 out of every 100 American homes switched to water-efficient fixtures, it would save around 100 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year and prevent 80,000 tons of global warming pollution."

      "content": "Appliances and electronics are using energy if they're plugged in. Most electronic devices that can be turned on/off with a remote, like TVs and gaming consoles, keep using power when they’re off. Appliances with digital clocks and devices plugged into power adaptors are also energy vampires. Here's one easy solution: plug your devices into a surge protector or power strip with an on/off switch. That way, you can cut the power to all of them with the press of a button! [3] X Research source You can also: Adjust screens/monitors to automatically power down Unplug electronic devices (and their charging docks) after charging them [4] X Trustworthy Source National Resources Defence Council Multinational environmental advocacy group focused on grassroots activism and legislative action Go to source"

      "content": "Generating less trash every day can make a big difference. Taking advantage of your local or city program to recycle trash like paper, plastic, newspaper, glass, and aluminum cans is one easy way to get started. Also, try to buy products with zero waste or eco-friendly packaging whenever you can so you’re putting less trash in your bin every day. [5] X Research source You can also: Donate items you don't want instead of throwing them away Use cloth towels, reusable plates, and silverware instead of paper towels, paper plates, and disposable silverware Buy used items, like furniture, from classified sites like Craigslist or local thrift stores"

      "content": "The meat and dairy industries generate tons of pollution. Cattle alone produces enough greenhouse gases in a year to rival the countries of China and the United States! Changing your diet may seem like a minor way to fight climate change, but the results can be really significant. [6] X Research source For example, if you reduce your consumption of animal protein by half, you'll cut your dietary carbon footprint by more than 40%. Try to incorporate more fresh fruit and vegetables into your diet. Buy organic whenever you can—not only is this healthier for you, but organic produce requires less energy to grow.

      "content": "You’ll be supporting your community and generating less pollution. One of the easiest ways to buy local is by visiting your local farmers markets for fresh produce. You can also buy items for your home, like furniture, from local craftsmen. Try to support local businesses as often as possible, especially if they use and promote sustainable, climate-smart practices. [8] X Research source For example, most fruits and vegetables travel about 1,500 miles (2,400 km) from the farm to your supermarket. That’s a lot of transportation-related carbon emissions.

Sealing cracks and making sure everything is properly insulated can reduce that by a lot! Bonus: you may even be able to claim federal tax credits for certain energy-efficient home improvements. [10] X Trustworthy Source National Resources Defence Council Multinational environmental advocacy group focused on grassroots activism and legislative action Go to source Try things like: Replacing old or inefficient insulation in your attic, basement, walls, and ceilings Caulking and sealing air leaks around plumbing and ducting Installing foam gaskets behind outlet and switch plates Using foam sealant to close larger gaps around windows and baseboards [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Cars are the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. To reduce your carbon footprint, try to carpool, use public transportation, bike, and walk more often. For example, leave your car at home 2 days a week and take the bus or metro instead, or carpool with a friend or coworker every other day. [12] X Research source Try to combine outings, like shopping trips and errands, instead of making individual trips. [13] X Research source Regular maintenance can help lower your vehicle's emissions. Remember to get your oil changed regularly, keep tires adequately inflated, and replace the air filter when it gets dirty."

      "content": "Fuel-efficient cars can drastically reduce emissions. If you're in the market for a new car, look for one with improved fuel efficiency so you can drive more miles on less gas. To reduce gas even more or stop using it altogether, consider an electric or hybrid car. You have to plug them in to charge them, so they do use some energy, but they run cleaner than regular gas-fueled engines. [14] X Research source Major car companies are making plans to improve the fuel economy of their vehicles. The U.S. government hopes that by 2025, all gas-fueled cars and light trucks will average 54.5 miles per gallon of gas.

It’s a bit scary to think about sometimes, but global warming is impacting our daily lives more and more as the years go by. Simply sharing your concern with the people around you can help. [16] X Research source You can try: Posting articles and sharing insights on social media Telling people why you’re doing certain things, like eating a meat-free diet Sharing easy ways to save energy, like insulating their home or driving less"

Politicians have a lot of power when it comes to changing the system and citizens have the right (and responsibility) to pressure them to do something about it. Start by finding out who represents you at the local, state, and national level. Then, contact them and share your concerns about global warming. [17] X Research source Urge them to do things like: Promote mass transportation projects Help fund alternative energy projects Support regulation that limits carbon emissions Enter agreements with foreign nations to limit carbon emissions Fight disinformation [18] X Research source"
