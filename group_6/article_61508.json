      "content": "There are several types of bases. You'll need to decide what type of base you want to build . The two main bases are Trophy bases and Farming base. [1] X Research source Trophy Base: Trophy bases protect the town hall above all and try to prevent their attacker from getting any stars. If you are building a trophy base, make sure you keep your town hall in the middle. Upgrading your barracks, army camps, laboratory would be the best for you. Farming Base: Farming bases often have a semi-exposed town hall to lure attackers looking for trophies and center their loot with the most protection. Farming bases are designed to protect Elixer, Gold, and Dark Elixer. They risk minor resources in favor of protecting major resources are heavily guarded. Upgrading walls, defenses, collectors, and storages is the way to go if you are farming. Hybrid Bases: Hybrid bases try to protect both your town hall and your loot. They aren't the best at either but are a jack of all trades."

      "title": "Upgrade your Elixer and Gold collectors.",
      "content": "Upgrade your Elixer and Gold collectors. If you start to go for other things like walls and defenses first, it is going to take a long time to get the gold and elixir needed for these upgrades. If you have your collectors maxed out for your level, then you will be able to get these upgrades faster in the long run."

      "content": "Upgrade your offensive structures. Start upgrading your clan castles, barracks, and army camps. This will give you access to more troops for farming and gaining loot as well as allow you access to the newest troops."

      "title": "Make sure you have enough storage for your loot and resources.",
      "content": "Make sure you have enough storage for your loot and resources. Storages are often overlooked. However, it's important to keep your storages upgraded as well, especially at the lower town hall levels. Its easy to run out of space in your storages, which will prevent you from collecting any more loot."

    {
      "title": "Put defenses as priority over walls.",
      "content": "Put defenses as priority over walls. The defenses you want to upgrade first are mortars and air defenses, as all attacks use a creature that can be taken down with one of these two defenses. Upgrading the walls to the max may not be efficient for your town hall, such as town hall 7 where the walls cost 200k gold apiece. Splash defenses like mortars and wizard towers should be prioritized. Save one builder inactive to spend extra gold on your walls. Otherwise, you will quickly fall behind on those."

      "title": "Unlock as many builders as you can.",
      "content": "Unlock as many builders as you can. Builders allow you to build more things at once, maxing out at 5 builders. These cost gems, but don't waste gems on speeding up production. Use them on buying builder's huts as they allow you to build things faster."

      "content": "Manage your builder's effectively. Keep your builders building and upgrading. Make sure you know when your builders are going to be done building something so that you can assign them a new task as soon as possible. Manage your builders efficiently."

      "title": "Protect your vital resources.",
      "content": "Protect your vital resources. There's no point in trying to stock up on supplies if you lose all the gold you make in one attack. Keep your dark elixir drill and all storages in the very inner part of you base. Then surround them with your defenses to make people go through all your defenses before they can take your supplies."

      "title": "Upgrade everything else before upgrading your Town Hall.",
      "content": "Upgrade everything else before upgrading your Town Hall. Some people only focus on upgrading their Town Hall to get the most defenses quickly without actually upgrading their defenses. Try to max out everything before upgrading your Town Hall. An exception to this is if you have all your elixir upgrades maxed, but still have defenses to upgrade. If that's the case, you should go to the next town hall so you don't waste elixir. This is the case for Town Hall 8 and once you run out of elixir upgrades, move to Town Hall 9."
