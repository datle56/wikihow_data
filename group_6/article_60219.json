      "title": "Find Henrietta's Hideaway.",
      "content": "Find Henrietta's Hideaway. Go to the southeastern tip of Manor Cape. You'll find Ashwinders and an Infamous Foe, Dustin Trinity, here that you should defeat before continuing so they don't get in the way."

      "title": "Follow the path south.",
      "content": "Follow the path south. Once you've taken care of the Ashwinders in the area, you can look for a path heading south. You'll find it on the east coast, and it goes down some stairs and ends at a large wooden door. You need to head this way for another side quest called \"Rescuing Rococo\", so stopping here to pick up the map isn't a bad idea. The door is below the cliffside under the Merlin Trial platform."

      "title": "Light the brazier to your left with Confringo or Incendio.",
      "content": "Light the brazier to your left with Confringo or Incendio. As soon as you walk into the room, you'll see a puzzle with 1 block and 2 circles. There's a reaper statue on your left that has an unlit brazier in front of it. When you light the brazier, the reaper statue turns to reveal the second cube that you need."

      "title": "Solve the first puzzle with Wingardium Levisa, Confrigo, and Glacius.",
      "content": "Solve the first puzzle with Wingardium Levisa, Confrigo, and Glacius. Use Wingardium Leviosa or Accio to move the cubes to the circles with the same icons. For example, the cube with the flame goes to the circle with the flame, which is to the left side of the door. With the cube and circle with the snowflakes on them matched up, cast Glacius on the cube so it lights up. Cast Confrigo or Incendio to make the other cube glow. The door will open, but you can get some gear by lighting the other brazier on the right side of the room. The revealed room is filled with Ashwinders that you can defeat or slip by using the Disillusionment spell that makes you harder to see."

      "title": "Go to the 2nd corridor on your left.",
      "content": "Go to the 2nd corridor on your left. Head towards the statue and the balcony behind it to the second corridor on your left. You'll immediately go up a curved staircase to another large room. Stay to the right to continue walking across the balcony you saw from the previous room. Once you pass the balcony, stop moving!"

    {
      "title": "Stop the trap floor.",
      "content": "Stop the trap floor. You can stop this floor from sucking you up and spitting you back out at the beginning in some different ways: Use Arresto Momentum on the floor to stop it from teleporting you. However, if you don't have that spell, there are other things you can try: Lure or pull (using Accio) an enemy onto the trap floor. Once it moves away, you can sprint across the trapped area. However, timing on this option is a little difficult and requires fast acting, so it might not be the best option for you. Use Wingardium Leviosa to move an object to the trap floor. While the floor is momentarily gone, you can sprint across the opening. This is very similar to the previous option, but if you don't have an Ashwinder, you can use the brazier instead. Once you make it across the trap floor, continue following the path to another large room with Ashwinders. Defeat the enemies to continue."

There are a lot of Ashwinders hiding in the castle and surrounding area, and the spells you're casting to solve the puzzle may attract their attention. In that case, you should clear the area to get rid of Ashwinders who might interrupt you."
