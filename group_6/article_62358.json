      "title": "White candles are also a good “default” or “all-purpose” candle.",
      "content": "White candles are also a good “default” or “all-purpose” candle. Because they’re associated with cleansing and clear-headedness, white candles work well in a wide range of rituals. They’re sort of like a blank slate for candle magic, and they can be substituted for pretty much any other candle color. [2] X Research source So, if you aren’t sure which color to use for your situation, a white candle is likely your best bet! [3] X Research source White candles are also associated with Mondays, so they're a great choice if you’re performing a ritual on this day of the week. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide what you want to attract or manifest with your spell. Before you begin your ritual, think about your specific goal. Maybe you want to invite positive energy into your life as you embark on a new journey. Or, maybe you want to cultivate more peace and calm on a day-to-day basis. Whatever you decide, try to condense it into one sentence, and make it as specific as possible. This helps you manifest it more successfully. [5] X Research source For example, your intention might be, “I want to surround myself with positive energy as I start my freshman year of college,” or “I want to cultivate more serenity in my life and banish anxiety about my job.” You can hold the intention in your mind, or you can write it down on a slip of paper to help you remember it."

      "title": "Cleanse and prepare your space.",
      "content": "Cleanse and prepare your space. Choose a quiet, distraction-free place to perform your candle spell. Light a bundle of sage or palo santo, then blow out the flame and waft the smoke around the space to cleanse any negative energies. If you don’t have sage or palo santo on hand, you can open a window and let some fresh air in, instead. Next, arrange any meaningful objects you want to use for your spell, such as herbs, photographs, mementos, or crystals. Crystals that combine well with a white candle spell include: Clear quartz : cleanses, promotes positive energy, and banishes negativity Selenite : helps you cultivate inner peace and awakens your spirituality Amethyst : brings wisdom, promotes optimism, and activates your crown chakra [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Dress your candle. Rub the essential oil of your choice into the candle with your fingers. If you don’t have any essential oils on hand, you can also use olive oil or coconut oil. This process is called dressing your candle , and it is an important step to amplify the power of your spell. [7] X Research source If you’re performing a spell to help you let go of something (like negative energy or an emotional wound), rub the oil into the candle from the top downward. If you’re trying to attract something into your life (like peace, positivity, or clarity), rub the oil into the candle from the bottom to the top. Lavender , orange , and mint essential oils work well with white candle spells. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Light the candle and recite your intention out loud.",
      "content": "Light the candle and recite your intention out loud. Visualize your goal as clearly as you can first. [9] X Research source For example, if your intention is to create positive energy as you start a new job, imagine yourself thriving in the position and making great connections with your coworkers. When you have the image clear in your mind, speak your manifestation statement aloud (“I want to surround myself with positive energy as I start my new job”), then light your candle."

      "title": "Interpret your candle’s flame.",
      "content": "Interpret your candle’s flame. Assess the size, strength, and intensity of the flame, and pay attention to any popping, hissing, or sizzling. These different flame behaviors can help you determine whether or not your spell was a success. If your candle’s flame is strong, steady, and tall, your intention was clear, and you’ve successfully performed your ritual. If the flame is weak or small, your intention may not have been clear enough, and the spell may not be very strong. Try to refocus your energy and visualize your manifestation one more time. If you notice hissing, popping, or sizzling, an entity or spirit may be near, and they may be trying to communicate a message through these noises. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Snuff out the flame or let it burn out, but don’t blow it out. When you’re ready to conclude your manifestation ritual, use a candle snuffer to extinguish the flame, or pinch it with your fingers. Don’t blow out the candle, as this can blow away your intention and diminish the spell’s effectiveness. [11] X Research source If you have some extra time, you can also wait for the flame to burn out on its own."
