      "title": "If she matched with you, she likes what she sees.",
      "content": "If she matched with you, she likes what she sees. Bumble works similarly to Tinder and other dating apps—you swipe right on photos of people you like and left on photos you don’t. If 2 people both swipe right, then it means they’re both interested and they’re matched together. So if she matched with you, it means she’s interested enough to connect with you!. [1] X Research source On Bumble, once a match is made, she has 24 hours to message you. If she doesn’t, then the match expires."

      "content": "Girls who liked your profile tend to show up first in your match queue. While you’re searching through photos and swiping left or right, she’s actually doing the same thing. If she’s swiped right on your photo (meaning she’s interested), then she’ll appear toward the top of your feed. If you swipe right on her as well, then it’s a match! [2] X Research source"

      "title": "The girl has to message the guy first on Bumble.",
      "content": "The girl has to message the guy first on Bumble. Unlike other dating apps, Bumble is designed to be more friendly for women (and cut back on unsolicited messages and pics from random guys). That means once a match is made, the girl has to message the guy within 24 hours. So if she messages you after you match, it means she’s interested in talking to you. [3] X Research source Bumble isn’t only for straight people, though! If 2 people are of the same sex, then either person can start the conversation."

    {
      "title": "If she trusts you with her full name, it’s a good sign.",
      "content": "If she trusts you with her full name, it’s a good sign. Users on dating apps create profiles that include a few basic bits of info about themselves, but the profiles don’t require you to include your full (or even real) name. If a conversation with a girl you matched with is going well, she may trust you with her full name. It’s a great sign that she likes you. [4] X Research source Having someone’s full name means you can also look them up on other social media like Facebook and Instagram."

      "title": "If she likes you, she’ll want to get to know more about you.",
      "content": "If she likes you, she’ll want to get to know more about you.

      "content": "If you’re texting more than 3 days in a row she may really like you. Matches that aren’t really going anywhere can often fizzle out on their own. But if she keeps messaging you and you talk to her for multiple days in a row, it means she likes talking to you. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "If she’s fast with the replies, it means she likes talking to you.",
      "content": "If she’s fast with the replies, it means she likes talking to you. Getting left on read, meaning she isn’t responding to your messages, is a pretty clear signal that she may not be interested. But if she’s lightning-quick with her responses, it means she’s actively communicating with you and likes talking to you.

      "content": "Texting and calling outside of the Bumble app is a good sign. Once you both really start to get to know each other, and after maybe you’ve had a date or two, you may want to start communicating outside of the Bumble messaging. Try giving her your number and adding her on social media. If she’s okay with it, it means she trusts you and may really like you. [11] X Research source You can text, call, or even use social media apps like Facebook Messenger to talk to each other."

      "title": "If she wants to meet up, she probably likes you.",
      "content": "If she wants to meet up, she probably likes you. If the conversation has been going well and she seems to be interested, try confirming it with a casual date. When the time seems right, ask her if she’d like to get together sometime. If she says yes, it could mean she’s really into you. [12] X Research source For instance, try something simple like, “Hey, do you want to grab a coffee/drink/whatever sometime?”"
