      "content": "Buy a set of strings. There are a few different options for steel-bound strings. You’ll need to determine which gauge string you use and what type of finish you prefer. The standard size for strings is .11 or .12, but you could go higher for lighter strings or lowers for heavier strings. Decide what type of finish from the following types: Bronze strings have a clear, ringing, and bright tone, but age quicker. Phosphor bronze strings are warmer and darker than bronze strings. The sound is crisp and lasts a long time due to the phosphor finish. Brass strings have a bright, jangly, and metallic texture. Polymer-coated strings have less sustain and brightness, but are warm sounding and resistant to corrosion. Silk and steel strings are popular among folk guitarist and finger picking players due to their softer touch and delicate tone."

      "title": "Remove the current strings.",
      "content": "Remove the current strings. Begin by removing the deep E or the 6th string which is the thickest string on the guitar. Start unwinding your string by turning the tuning peg to loosen the string. You can figure out which direction to turn the peg by plucking the string and turn it one direction. If it gives off a higher note that means you are tightening the string. Keep turning the peg until the string falls off the guitar. If the strings are very old then consider just cutting them off with a wire cutter. Remove each string moving from the thickest to thinnest."

      "title": "Remove the strings from the bridge.",
      "content": "Remove the strings from the bridge. Now the string should be hanging from the bridge of the guitar. The bridge is underneath the sound hole where the guitar strings are attached. Depending on what type of bridge your guitar has, you may need to remove the bridge pin. If your guitar doesn’t have bride pins, you should be able to wedge the strings out of their socket. Pull the pin to remove it. If you can’t wedge it out, use pliers. Bridge pin pullers are available for about $5.00 and are a nice accessory. Pull the string out of the hole."

      "title": "Begin stringing.",
      "content": "Begin stringing. Isolate the lightest string from your new pack. Place it through the bridge's hole that is farthest to the right of the guitar. Begin pulling the string with slight pressure. Thread the new string until the end of the string falls into place. Now place it in the groove on the bridge of the guitar. If your guitar has bridge pins, you'll need to remove them before inserting the new string. The best way to remove the pins is by using a bridge pin puller. Lodge the tool into the pin and rock it from side to side until the pin becomes loose. Wait until you've fully thread your new string into place before reinserting the pin."

Wrap the string around the peg twice and insert the string into the hole between the two loops you created. Begin tightening the string, but don’t tighten the string too much. While tightening the string, use your other hand to stretch the loose string so it holds tune quicker."

Use a tuner once every string is attached and tune to the following tuning: EADGBE. Wait a few days to cut the excess string."

While there are different types of materials that go into these types of strings, they are generally called nylon strings or classical guitar strings. Like steel strings, there are different options for nylon strings like the following: Clear nylon strings are the most popular and are known for their rich and clear tones. Rectified nylon strings have mellower and have a more rounded tone than clear nylon. Black nylon strings produce a warm, pure sound with more treble overtones. These are popular with folk guitarist. Titanium strings are exceptionally brighter than the other strings. Composite strings are bright and have a strong projection."

If you plan to change one string, don’t worry about changing all the strings. Change all the strings for consistent tone and wear. Unwind the strings until the strings get loose enough to remove from the tuning pegs. Pluck the string and turn the peg in one direction. If the tone becomes higher, turn it the other way to loosen the string. If the strings are old then consider just cutting them off with a wire cutter."

Insert the string into the hole farthest to the right of the guitar, and leave about three inches of slack. Loop the free end of the string under the string just behind the saddle and pull it down towards the bottom of the bridge. Pass the free end under the loop below the back corner of the bridge creating a second loop. [1] X Research source"

Use a slightly damp cloth to clean the spots that were inaccessible when the strings were attached. Some people like to use guitar polish which can be found at many guitar and music shops. This is not a necessary technique and is even criticized for reducing the quality of the finish. [3] X Research source"

Position the guitar so that your eye is in level with the neck of the guitar. If the truss rod is in good condition, the neck should be straight. If there is an area that is sloping in, you either adjust it yourself using an hex key or take it into a repair shop. Unless you’ve fixed a truss rod before, you should not try to repair this type of damage yourself."

Do not store a guitar without strings or else your neck could become warped. Try to store your guitar in a case in the upright position if possible. Store the guitar in a comfortable environment like a closet or in an environment where you could stand to live. Never store the guitar in a garage or basement that is not heated or controlled by a proper air unit."
