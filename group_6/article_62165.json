      "content": "Blood moons bring chaos, disruption, and change in astrology. Because they require a full moon and total lunar eclipse to occur, blood moons amplify the already strong powers of the lunar cycle. The full moon symbolizes sudden illumination, hidden information rising to the surface, and shifts in your inner life. Meanwhile, lunar eclipses are like cosmic whirlwinds of change and chance. Add the rust color of the blood moon, and you get a lunation that’s associated with violence and disturbances in nature. Despite its eerie associations, the blood moon doesn't have to bring negativity. Like all eclipses in astrology, think of this moon as a time of change—ultimately, you have control over whether or not the change is positive. There are about 2 lunar eclipses every year, and about 1 in 3 of those eclipses are total lunar eclipses with the potential for a blood moon. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "A blood moon occurs during a total lunar eclipse when red light scatters through the earth’s atmosphere.",
      "content": "A blood moon occurs during a total lunar eclipse when red light scatters through the earth’s atmosphere. During a lunar eclipse, the sun, earth, and moon all align. When these three celestial bodies move into place, the earth’s position between the moon and the sun casts the moon into shadow. Still, some light from the sun passes through our atmosphere, and the orange and red wavelengths get directed towards the moon, making it look reddish or copper. [2] X Research source Some people might use the term “blood moon” when the moon appears red from haze or pollution, but a true blood moon only occurs during a total lunar eclipse."

Eclipses are a time to consider shifts in interpersonal dynamics since the illumination from the full moon will give you a new perspective. You might start to see the true colors of the people around you. [3] X Research source Ask yourself whether your relationships feel balanced in terms of effort and energy. Call up a friend and check in with yourself after the call. Do you feel energized or drained?"

      "content": "Meditate and journal. The silence brought by the lunar eclipse’s brief moments of darkness might make you feel uneasy—even all the birds and animals go quiet. However, remember silence can be a good thing! Use the blood moon as a time for reflection and contemplation, since lunar eclipses can bring our deepest thoughts and feelings to the surface."

      "content": "Give thanks to the people around you. In the past, people would use the blood moon as a time to honor the gods through animal or human sacrifice. To honor the blood moon’s history of ritual sacrifice in a nonviolent way, take a moment to recognize what others have given up for you. [4] X Research source Call up your parents or important mentors to thank them for what they’ve done, donate to a local charity that supports veterans, or volunteer with an organization to help out those in need."

Create a vision board of hobbies or activities you wish you could do more often."

      "content": "If you're interested in astronomy and astrology, there's more to explore. Astrologists have long looked to the skies for insights into the world, and because of this, many moon phases, planets, and constellations are believed to have deep spiritual meaning. Here are a few other interesting terms to look into: Full moon : The phase in the lunar cycle when the entire moon is illuminated in the sky. In astrology, full moons are associated with strong emotions, spiritual growth, and completing projects. Waxing gibbous moon : The phase right before a full moon. Astrologists associate waxing gibbous moons with the final steps of completing a project or task. Supermoon : Occurs when a full moon gets unusually close to earth, making it look larger. Astrologists believe supermoons boost energies and intensify emotions. Mars : The fourth planet from the sun in our solar system. In astrology, Mars represents aggression, energy, drive, and sexuality. Saturn : The sixth planet from the sun in our solar system. Astrologically, Saturn represents hard work, discipline, responsibility, and karma. Pluto : Formerly the ninth planet in our solar system, until it was redefined as a dwarf planet. In astrology, Pluto represents transformation, renewal, and power. Orion’s Belt : A constellation made up of three bright stars in a line. Spiritually, Orion’s Belt is associated with good luck, intuition, and strength."
