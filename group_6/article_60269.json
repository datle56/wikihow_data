Stay up late until the game is done (or at least until you beat that super hard level), and set out plenty of snacks and drinks to make it feel like a party.

Ask your husband if there's anything he would like to try, or offer some suggestions yourself. Although every couple is different, sex can really help revive your relationship if it's feeling stuck.

Only try things that you're both comfortable with. Sex is only enjoyable if both people feel respected and safe. Remember that physical and sexual intimacy doesn’t exclusively mean intercourse. Make it a point to cuddle, kiss, and hold hands with your partner whenever possible.

      "content": "Use this as an opportunity to really listen to each other. Staring at your phone instead of your partner hurts your communication as a couple. A study published in 2017 even found that it can diminish how satisfied you are in your marriage over time. [13] X Research source To avoid these negative effects, pick a time to put your phones away and talk. Alternatively, choose places in your house where you both agree to not use your phone, like the bedroom. When your husband talks to you, make sure to keep your eyes off your phone. Even if you get a text, wait until your conversation is over to answer it. Though things may come up, like work phone calls or emergencies, being more conscious of how your phone usage affects your partner makes the time you spend together more intentional."
