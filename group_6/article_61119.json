      "content": "Use a headband, barrette, or hat to keep hair from sticking up. One simple way to get your baby's hair to go in the direction you want it to go is to use accessories, such as a hat, barrette, or headband. Smooth out the hair how you want it to go and then put the hat or headband over it to hold it down. For example, if your baby has a tuft of hair that sticks up on the top of their head, smooth it down and then slide a hat on over it to secure the hair. Make sure that you watch your baby carefully if you use barrettes. These pose a choking hazard if they come loose."

      "content": "Trim any hairs that cover your baby's eyes. Your baby may have trouble seeing due to stray hairs that fall in their face and cover part or all of their eyes. To help your baby see better, consider trimming these hairs or taking them to a hair stylist for a trim.

      "content": "Keep hair longer if your baby has a cowlick. A cowlick is a section of hair that grows in a circular pattern, often near the top rear part of a baby's head. Avoid cutting the hair too short around the cowlick because this will cause the hair to stick up even more. Keep the hair longer in this area. [2] X Research source For example, if your baby has a cowlick on the top of their head, then you could keep the hair longer on top and just have their hair stylist trim the sides."

      "content": "Put long hair into ponytails to keep it from getting tangled. If your baby has long hair, then putting it into 1 or more ponytails can help to prevent it from becoming tangled as they go about their daily activities or while they are sleeping. Use a comb to section the hair into as many ponytails as needed to keep the hair contained. [3] X Research source For example, if your baby has lots of hair, but it is not long enough to gather into 1 ponytail, then divide it into 3 sections: 1 at the top of their head and 1 on each side of their head. Make sure that the ponytails are not too tight because this can damage baby hair. [4] X Research source"

Continue to do this until you have worked through all of the tangled sections of your baby's hair."

      "content": "Change your baby's position often to prevent bald spots. Babies may lose hair in patches from being in 1 position for too long. Make sure to turn your baby's head for them if they have been in 1 position for a while. This will also help to prevent your baby from getting a flat spot on their head. For example, if your baby has been napping on their back with their head turned to the right for about an hour, then gently turn their head so that they are facing towards the left or looking up instead."

[10] X Research source Start out washing your baby's hair only 1 time weekly. If you notice that their hair looks oily or greasy after a few days, then your baby probably needs you to wash their hair twice per week."
