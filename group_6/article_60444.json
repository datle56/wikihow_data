If, for instance, you have a dream about your boyfriend cheating on you, don’t automatically assume it’s a premonition of something to come or proof of something that’s already happened. Instead, the dream may indicate that you’re burdened with trust issues that you haven’t been able to manage during your waking hours. [2] X Expert Source Samantha Fox, MS, LMFT Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 19 January 2021. Instead of getting caught up in the little details of your dream, ask yourself how the dream made you feel and how you now feel about the dream. There’s a lot about dreams we still don’t understand, so it’s easy to find widely differing views on how to interpret them. Just remember that having bad dreams, even about people we care about, is extremely common. Dreams rarely are a direct reflection of what is to come or what has already happened. Instead of taking them as literal, try being more curious about the feelings the dream evokes.

Start by writing down a general outline of the dream, providing as much detail as you feel is important. Then, pay special attention to the feelings attached to the dream. How did you feel about it when you woke up, and how do you feel about it now? [5] X Expert Source Samantha Fox, MS, LMFT Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 19 January 2021. For example, say you had a dream in which you were getting married and your boyfriend left you at the altar. You might write down that it made you feel shocked and ashamed when you woke up, and makes you feel worried and uneasy when you think about it now. Read through past journal entries each time you have a new dream about your boyfriend. Look for patterns both in the dreams and in how you feel about them."

      "content": "This strategy might help change a recurring negative dream. To give it a try, start by writing down the dream in your journal. Then, literally erase the “bad” part of the dream/story and rewrite it into a “good” part. Visualize this happier version of the dream as you fall off to sleep—and it may end up being the dream you have! [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, say you keep having a dream in which your boyfriend turns into a snarling wolf that chases you around your home. You could rewrite it so he becomes a purring cat that curls up next to you. This strategy is sometimes called “imagery rehearsal,” and there’s evidence that it can be effective in altering dreams.

      "content": "You might sleep more deeply and remember fewer dreams. Consistently getting a good night’s sleep is always a good idea—it benefits your physical and mental health in all kinds of ways. Also, if you sleep more deeply during the night, you may be less likely to wake up during REM cycles (during which you dream) and remember what you’ve been dreaming. Try healthy sleep strategies like the following: [12] X Research source Set a consistent evening routine, time for going to sleep, and wake-up time. Avoid “screen time” for at least 1 hour before going to sleep. Don’t drink caffeine or alcohol for several hours before bedtime. Avoid eating large meals before bed as well. Sleep in a room that’s dark and comfortably cool, and use comfortable bedding. Add calming activities like taking a warm bath, reading, or listening to soothing music to your bedtime routine."

      "content": "Dreams aren’t proof, but may reflect your existing suspicions. It’s very possible that you’re dreaming of your boyfriend cheating, or leaving you, or hitting you when he’s absolutely not doing (or planning on doing) those things. But, if you have some real-world suspicions that align with what you’re dreaming about, consider investigating them. If you’re suspicious and dreaming that he’s cheating, for example, you might check for physical or behavioral evidence , or use tech to see if he’s on dating sites. Before doing any investigating, take some time to think about how willing you are to invade your boyfriend’s privacy."

Unless your dreams have led you to investigate (and uncover) evidence that he’s been cheating, lying, etc., remember that this conversation is all about you. He may be in your bad dreams, but they’re your dreams and your feelings. Choose a time when you’re both calm and able to talk, and use “I” statements to make it clear you’re not blaming him for being bad in your dreams. [13] X Research source For example: “This feels weird to talk about, but I’ve been having this strange dream where you send me flowers at work with a card that says you’re cheating on me. I know it’s not reality and it may mean nothing at all, but I end up feeling anxious each day afterward.”"

Even if you’re doing your best to explain that your dreams are separate from the reality of your relationship, your boyfriend may feel like he’s hurt you somehow.
