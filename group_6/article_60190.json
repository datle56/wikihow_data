      "content": "Identify the key of your song . The most common way of checking the key signature of the song you are in is by observing the notation in the clef at the beginning of your music. This will either have a number of sharps (#), flats (♭), or nothing at all. This will help you identify the key. When there are no flats or sharps in the starting clef of your song, your song is in C major. The relative minor of C major is A. Major keys: G (one sharp), D (two sharps), A (three), E (four), B (five), F# (six), C# (seven), C♭ (seven flats), G♭ (six flats), D♭ (five), A♭ (four), E♭ (three), B♭ (two), F♭ (one). Minor keys: E (one sharp), B (two sharps), F# (three), C# (four), G# (five), D# (six), E♭ (six flats), B♭ (five flats), F (four), C (three), G (two), D (one). [1] X Research source"

These are like an eraser that deletes the sharps or flats in your key previously. Each natural sign removes one sharp or flat. New accidentals. \"Accidental\" is the term used to describe any key change (#, ♭, ♮). [3] X Research source These will indicate your new key."

      "content": "Choose a complementary key. Playing your solo in the same key as your song is the simplest way of ensuring you rock your solo in a complementary key. However, you could also play in keys that are harmonic to the key of your song. [4] X Research source Keys sharing the same number of sharps or flats, or keys different by only a single sharp or flat on the Circle of Fifths , generally share many tones, creating harmony."

You can play the key in scales , you can break up chords and solo those notes, or you could even transition between the notes of harmonic keys, like the ones surrounding the key you're playing in on the Circle of Fifths. [5] X Research source If you hit a note that's dissonant, don't panic. Hold the note for a moment, and then scale up or down with whole or half steps until the dissonance resolves. This way, your dissonant note will seem intentional."

      "content": "Break your song into chords. You'll be able to come up with more interesting and varied notes for your solo if you base your solo off chords. Chords change much more frequently throughout a song than keys, meaning your chord based solo will likely have a greater variety of notes than a key based one. [7] X Research source You may want to go through your song and write the chords for each bar of music if this information isn't already there."

When the chord changes, change the scale or arpeggio you are playing to match the key of the new chord.

By playing the root of the chord throughout your solo, weaving it into scales, arpeggios, and more, your solo will sound more tonally centered and harmonic. [10] X Research source The letter name of each chord generally indicates its root. For example, a Gmaj7 chord has a root of G, an F#min chord has the root of F#. [11] X Research source"

It involves playing a note (or notes) either a half or whole step away from the root of the next chord, before that next chord is played. The notes surrounding the root of your next chord will resolve to that root. When you play the next chord, this technique creates a natural kind of transition between chords. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine the chords of your song. Go through the music for your song and, bar by bar of music, write out the chord progressions that will be used throughout the song. From these chords, you're going to find the relative minor pentatonic of each one. The relative minor pentatonic scale of each chord will only contain notes already in the chord. This means its notes will sound pleasing in your solo. You may want to leave some space between chords when you write them out. This way you can write the relative minor pentatonic beside the root chord. A pentatonic scale is a scale is limited to five notes, with each note of the scale usually being a strong harmonic complement to the chord off which it's based. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Find the relative minor of major chords, if necessary. The general rule when soloing with a pentatonic scale is to use the relative minor pentatonic scale, which will nearly always sound good with the original chord. The relative minor of any major scale is three half-tones below the root note. On a guitar, three half-steps will be represented by three frets on the neck of your guitar, with each fret standing for a half step. [14] X Research source For example, if the root of a major chord is C, the relative minor would be A. For an F major chord, D would be its relative minor. [15] X Research source"

To transform your relative minor scale into a relative minor pentatonic, you should remove the second and sixth tones from your relative minor scale. [16] X Research source Benward, Bruce and Saker, Marilyn N. <i>Music: In Theory and Practice</i>, seventh edition, vol. I, p. 37. Boston: McGraw Hill, 2003. Print. For example: The relative minor of C major is A. To form a pentatonic scale in A minor, remove the second and sixth intervals from the root. This yields a pentatonic scale of: A, C, D, E, G. The relative minor of F major is D. D minor's pentatonic scale, therefore, would be: D, F, G, A, C. If you want to create a pentatonic from a major scale, you can do this by removing the fourth and seventh tone from the scale. [17] X Research source"
