      "content": "Give your Chihuahua a big bed to sleep on. Chihuahuas like their naps and sleep 12 to 14 hours a day on average. Get a big, fluffy dog bed from the store, stack some soft blankets, or try making your own custom bed. The more customized the bed is, the more spoiled your dog will look on it. Most people don’t realize dogs sleep so much because they wake up so quickly. When your Chihuahua isn’t active, it is most likely getting its beauty rest! Chihuahuas like getting close to their owners, so expect your dog to squeeze up close to you at night. After all, spoiled dogs sleep on mattresses!"

      "content": "Get a variety of toys for your dog. Every spoiled dog has a big basket brimming with colorful toys. Chew toys, fetch toys, and other varieties all meet different needs your dog has. To keep your dog entertained, keep plenty of toys in your home and replace older toys as they fall apart. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Choose durable toys like ropes or small balls when you join in on the fun. These toys withstand rougher activities like fetch and tug of war. Plush toys are good comfort toys for your dog to chew on. Select toys made from stronger materials if your dog will play with them while you’re not home. Many of these toys have squeakers or other fun quirks. Treat toys provide mental stimulation for your dog. You put a treat in the toy, then let your dog figure out how to get its tasty snack. Even stuffed animals are good toys. Many Chihuahuas adopt a stuffed animal or another object as a comfort toy. They will sleep next to it and stay by it when you’re not around."

      "content": "Serve food and water in customized dog bowls. A fancy Chihuahua can do better than the plain plastic bowls other dogs use. Look for some special bowls at local craft or pet stores. Stylish bowls are made from a variety of materials, from metal to ceramic. Many of these bowls have custom graphics that show off your dog’s status. If you’re crafty, try making your own bowls. [2] X Research source For example, print your dog’s name on the bowl, or get images like a crown to show your dog’s royal status. For extra style points, get a customized water bowl. For instance, choose bowls that say “prince” or “princess” for your pampered pooch."

      "content": "Choose specialized collars and leashes for your dog. A truly spoiled Chihuahua needs more than a basic rope leash and plain collar. Shop around for pretty accessories that make your dog stand out. Select accessories that look unique, such as those with graphics or embroidery. For instance, have your dog’s name embroidered on its collar for style points. Look for places that take custom orders on pet accessories. Many places online make this part easy, but you may also be able to find retail design shops in your area."

      "content": "Set up a quiet area for your Chihuahua to escape to when it’s stressed. Sometimes your Chihuahua won’t feel like being around others. Having a little “den” for your dog is particularly helpful if you live with other people or animals. Pick a spot away from the activity and noise of your home, such as in a spare bedroom. Set up the area so it belongs to your dog. [3] X Research source For instance, put soft cushions, toys, and other things your dog likes in the den area. Choose an enclosed area, such as a doggy playpen with a door your Chihuahua can open. That way, no one else will bother it when it wants to be alone."

      "content": "Buy your Chihuahua stylish clothing that fits. Chihuahuas often enjoy playing dress up, which is why you may have seen some fashionable dogs on TV. They get lots of attention from their owners, and then they get plenty of additional attention from other people appreciating their fashion. A lot of clothing has additional benefits, such as keeping your Chihuahua warm during cold weather. Measure your dog after grooming it in order to get clothing that fits well. [4] X Research source Chihuahuas generally don’t mind fitting into warm, enclosed spots, but even they don’t like clothing that feels restrictive. If your dog has a hard time dealing with its clothing, make sure the fit is right. Having at least 1 sweater or shirt is a good idea, especially if you plan on taking your dog outside in the winter. Snow boots also help. Chihuahuas are small dogs that get cold easily, so bundle it up! Be careful about putting on clothing in hot weather. Don’t let your Chihuahua overheat."

      "content": "Set aside time in the day to give your dog lots of attention. A Chihuahua will bask in all the attention you give it. Take some time to pet and play with your dog at least once a day. Focus fully on your dog during this time. If you’re having fun, your Chihuahua will be a happy member of your pack. Remember to spoil your Chihuahua even during busy days. Creating a daily routine helps ensure your dog gets plenty of attention no matter what else you have going on. Alternative sources of attention help keep a Chihuahua spoiled when you're busy. Have other people watch after your dog or give it a stuffed animal friend, for instance."

      "content": "Pet your dog and give it belly rubs. A well-loved dog is a happy dog. A Chihuahua will squeeze up next to you on the bed or couch and let you touch it all over. Chihuahuas often like being petted on the back of the neck, under the chin, and at the base of the tail. In addition, try massaging your dog’s back and shoulders. [5] X Research source Your Chihuahua may not like having its ears, nose, legs, or tail touched. Each dog has its own preferences, so watch how it reacts to know what areas to avoid."

      "content": "Teach your dog commands for a fun way to learn new tricks. View basic obedience training as a way to spend time with your Chihuahua while teaching it something fun. Have plenty of treats on hand and offer it when your dog does something you like. Eventually, it will be able to do the “trick” on consistently. Some common commands to start with are sit, stay, come, and down. [6] X Research source Training may seem like the opposite of spoiling a dog, but your Chihuahua will get so much attention and so many treats that it won’t mind. Training is a great way to help a hyperactive Chihuahua calm down. If your dog is nervous around people, for instance, telling it to stay still gives it a chance to learn that the situation is safe."

Wrap up some nice presents, such as new toys or clothing. Then, get a cake made from safe ingredients like peanut butter, applesauce, and pumpkin. Have a party for your dog’s birthday, a special occasion, or for the sake of spoiling your dog on a random day. Look for local bakeries that produce cakes for dogs. If you like baking, try making your own. Come up with activities that the dogs can do, such as swimming in a pool or playing games. Keep in mind that dogs are creatures of habit, so in some cases throwing a party may upset your dog more than it will entertain it."

      "content": "Take your Chihuahua walk once a day. Exercise keeps your dog healthy and happy. A walk gives your Chihuahua a chance to strut their stuff while exploring the great outdoors. If you have the time, take a second walk or extend your walk to spend more time with your dog. [7] X Research source Chihuahuas are prone to trachea injuries. To avoid the risk, get a harness that fits your Chihuahua comfortably. Hook the leash to the harness instead of your dog’s collar. Using a stroller is the ultimate way to spoil a Chihuahua, but your dog won’t get much exercise in it. It may be a good option if you’re walking a long distance, walking in hot weather, or walking through a busy location."

      "content": "Get a new household pet to keep your dog company. Chihuahuas are pack animals that often get along well with other pets. Other Chihuahuas make for perfect companions, but many Chihuahuas get along with bigger dogs and even cats.

When they play together, they burn excess energy. Having company helps a lot when you’re busy. Every animal has its own temperament.

      "content": "Bring your dog with you when you're on the go. Since Chihuahuas are small dogs, they're easy to bring with you when you run errands, visit friends, and take car trips. Roll back the window and treat your dog to a ride whenever you can. Go to the pet store, for instance, and let your dog choose some treats or toys. Find other enjoyable places that welcome dogs, such as the local dog park. [9] X Trustworthy Source Best Friends Animal Society Nonprofit animal welfare organization dedicated to saving animal lives by operating and supporting no-kill animal shelters Go to source Remember that not all public places welcome pets. Look up your region’s dog laws and read the rules of any establishment before taking your dog to it. Public areas are filled with cars, dogs, and other people that may be scary or even dangerous for your dog. Keep your dog close to you on a leash at all times. If your dog is still afraid, train it and expose it often to public places. Taking a dog on a ride has many benefits. People will likely give your dog lots of attention. Many places hand out or sell treats like doggy ice cream. Ask before bringing your dog to someone else’s home. Most people don’t mind, but some may not enjoy having your dog over for a visit. Be aware that it is also a good idea to have some time apart from your dog and not spend all day every day with it. Otherwise, your dog may become dependent on you and become distressed when you are away."

[10] X Research source Exposure training often helps dogs become less clingy and aggressive. The best time to do this is when your dog is young, although adult dogs are still capable of adapting.

Watch for any signs of nervousness or aggression, like bared teeth or snarling. Your pooch is sure to get tons of attention from others. [11] X Research source Hold your Chihuahua proudly and let it feel like the boss. Sometimes this helps a dog feel safer, so it is more willing to let strangers approach it. If you live with other people, have them take turns playing with and spoiling your Chihuahua. Chihuahuas often latch onto their primary caregiver, so letting your Chihuahua bond with everyone makes it less clingy and aggressive."

Dip the nail in styptic powder or cornstarch if you nip the quick.
