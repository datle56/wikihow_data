Use less water for a smaller quantity of food, but go ahead and add the full 2 cups (470 mL) if you’re steaming a whole basket of veggies or seafood. [1] X Research source You don’t want the water to go up over the food since it will boil your meal instead of steaming it."

Place the foods that take longer to cook at the bottom, closer to the water. Top the basket with your quickest cooking food. [3] X Research source Root vegetables take longer to steam than green veggies. Similarly, seafood also steams pretty quickly. For instance, you might put potatoes on the bottom, carrots in the middle, and broccoli on top. Instant Pots don't always come with a steam basket, but you can use most steam baskets with your Instant Pot. If you don't have a steam basket, use a small colander or place the food on the trivet."

      "content": "Avoid overfilling your steam basket. While it’s okay to layer food in your steam basket, leave a little space at the top of the basket so the lid will fit securely. You don’t need a lot of space; just make sure no food comes up over the top of the basket. If the lid is loose or the pot can’t securely seal, your food may be undercooked. [4] X Research source If your basket seems overly full, cooking your meal in 2 or more batches may be best. Since your Instant Pot is so fast, dinner will still be ready soon."

Times vary for each type of food, so double-check the recommended time the first time you steam a food. Use the time listed in your recipe, if you have one, or use Instant Pot's handy guide. [9] X Research source Generally, most veggies steam in as little as 1 to 5 minutes, but root veggies typically take longer. However, frozen veggies will need a longer steam time than fresh veggies. Similarly, most seafood cooks in 1 to 5 minutes. If you’re following a recipe for a traditional pressure cooker, add 7% to 15% more time to the recommended cooking time because Instant Pots have lower pressure. For instance, if the cooking time is 15 minutes, you could multiply it by 1.07 to add 7% more time and 1.15 to add 15% more time. This gives you a cooking range of about 16 to 17 minutes after rounding."
