Capricorns set high expectations for themselves, often feeling like they work at warp speed only to come up short, over and over again. This can cause a lot of tension and frustration for their partners. If your Capricorn engages in negative self-talk, try offering a more positive perspective: “I hear you saying that you're not far enough in your career. But you’re actually much farther along than most people your age; plus, you love hard work. You're doing great.\" You can’t be their sole source for confidence or validation, but you can offer perspective and try to help them find ways to make peace with themselves."

      "content": "Their rigid worldview can make disagreements a lot harder. Instead of compromising and recognizing how you both might’ve contributed to an issue, a Capricorn might only be able to accept that one person is at fault. To overcome this, try explaining yourself in simple, direct, and logical terms. “I know I forgot your work event, but you’ve asked me to go to three of those this month alone. That’s a lot to ask of me, because I have my own schedule, too.”"

      "content": "Capricorns see optimism as a luxury that they can't afford. People of this sign expect the worst in everything.

      "content": "Capricorns are happiest when things go according to plan—their plan. This sign believes that no one organizes better than they do. They'll probably assume you agree, and because of that, you'll always be happy to go along with whatever they think is best. Depending on the Capricorn, this may range from being just a bit annoying to being a genuine issue. [5] X Research source No matter someone’s sign, controlling behavior is a huge red flag. If your Capricorn just likes being in charge (but is self-aware and willing to let you take the reins, too), then that’s fine. But if they try to control the way you speak, dress, or act, that’s unacceptable."

      "content": "Spontaneity is not their strong suit, so things can start feeling stale. Some people imagine meandering plans, flexibility, and romantic whims when they're in a relationship. With a Capricorn, romance will be a given; however, it will never be improvised. Your romantic outings will be organized down to the sweater they suggest you wear depending on the temperature. A Capricorn can loosen up a bit with help. Try taking little, manageable steps to bring some flexibility to your routines together. Have a place you always go for breakfast?

      "title": "A Capricorn values responsible spending, arguably too much.",
      "content": "A Capricorn values responsible spending, arguably too much. Capricorns are famously good with money, sometimes to the point of refusing to spend it at all. Yes, people of this sign love a good luxury item, but any purchase they make will be strategic and labored over for weeks before finally pulling the trigger. Their partners may find them hard to read in this respect—because Caps will only support splurging when it's on their terms. If you want to splurge on something, let your Capricorn know ahead of time and explain your reasoning. This way, they'll understand that the money spent has value to you. You might say, “I really want to pick up a treat or two while I’m out today. I had a long week, and buying something fun will help me relax. Just warning you!”"

      "title": "A Capricorn's skepticism can make their partner feel like they're on trial.",
      "content": "A Capricorn's skepticism can make their partner feel like they're on trial. This is a sign always on the lookout for that leg up at work, in relationships, in everything. Because of this, Capricorns are used to keeping a sharp eye out for lies and deceit. They may read into your harmless behaviors, and if you ever do slip up, there'll be no chance for forgiveness. This behavior keeps Caps' partners at arm's length and can make them hard to love. Stay loyal, honest, and forthright in your relationship. Assume that, with a Capricorn, they'll find everything out eventually anyway. It's better to be upfront. Watch out for manipulative, toxic behavior. If your partner is constantly questioning your loyalty with little cause, that's not okay. You deserve someone who trusts you."
