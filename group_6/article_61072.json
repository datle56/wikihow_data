      "content": "Tighten the hinge. Get your long nose pliers and gently lift both ends of the metal rod/pin toward the headband one at a time. This will tighten the hinge and keep it from wiggling around. Be careful not to damage the metal arm where the pin is place and the plastic part of the headband. Bend only the tip of the pin and not its entire body. Don’t pull the pin off of the metal arm too. Do the same to other arm if it’s also loose. [1] X Research source"
