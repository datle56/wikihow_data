      "content": "Hand roll the dough into a long, thick strand. Place the pretzel dough on a floured surface and use the palms of your hands to roll it back and forth against the counter top. Push the dough outwards as you roll until you achieve the desired length. Pretzel dough tends to shrink back on itself after rolling, so a good technique is to roll it partway, then leave it to rest for a few minutes before rolling again. The ideal length is between 18 and 20 inches -- this will give you nice, large pretzel."

Imagine the pretzel is a clock and attach the ends to the points where the numbers 5 and 7 would be, by pinching them firmly into the dough. If you're having trouble getting the ends to stick, use a little water or milk to press them into place. You now have a simple, neatly folded pretzel, ready to bake! [2] X Research source"
