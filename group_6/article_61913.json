      "content": "Call 1-800-775-5944 to call in sick over the phone. When prompted, enter your Walmart Identification Number (WIN), date of birth, and the store number for the Walmart where you work. You’ll receive a confirmation number. Write this number down. You’ll then be transferred to your store manager. Give them your confirmation number and explain why you’re calling out. For instance, you can say “I’m not feeling well,” or “My daughter is sick and I’m taking her to the doctor.” [1] X Research source If possible, call out at least 3 hours before your shift is scheduled to begin. You don’t need to provide a doctor’s note. You don’t need to provide detailed medical information when calling out. You can simply say “I’m feeling sick.” You’re allowed to call in sick if you’re experiencing an illness or injury, or if your child or dependent family member is sick. Avoid calling out unless you (or your child or dependent family member) are actually sick."

      "content": "Go to one.walmart.com to report an absence online. Select “Login” at the top right of your screen, then enter your WIN and password. Once you’re logged in, select “Report an Absence” from the options at the top of your screen. Select which shift you’ll be missing, then provide a brief explanation for the absence. For instance, you could write “I have a fever” or “My son is sick and missing school today.” After providing your reason, click submit. Write down the confirmation number that appears on your screen. You can also download the Me@Walmart app and report your absence using the steps above. Submit your absence request at least 3 hours before your shift is scheduled to begin, if possible. As a courtesy, call your manager to let them know you’ll be missing your shift, in case they aren’t automatically notified in time."

      "content": "You get 6 paid days off per year to use for call outs, with no penalty. More specifically, you get 48 hours of “Protected Paid Time Off” (PPTO)—or six 8-hour workdays—which you can use at any time. PPTO is available to all Walmart retail associates: full-time, part-time, and temporary. Using PPTO won’t count against you as long as you call out before your shift begins. [2] X Research source New hires don’t get PPTO right away. Associates accrue PPTO according to how many hours they work and how long they’ve been with the company. PPTO counts against your regular “paid time off” (PTO). For instance, new full-time associates accrue 72 hours of PTO in their first year, 48 of which are “protected” for use as sick days. Likewise, using too much regular PTO (say, for vacation days) may leave you with fewer PPTO hours to use for sick days. Unused PPTO rolls over into the next year."

      "title": "If you run out of PPTO, you accrue “warning points” for call outs.",
      "content": "If you run out of PPTO, you accrue “warning points” for call outs. You receive 1 “warning point” for each absence you request. Warning points are used to track employee conduct, and each point stays on your record for six months. Having points on your record makes it more likely that you’ll face disciplinary action, like write-ups or termination. [3] X Research source For instance, if you have no PPTO remaining, and you call in sick twice in January and once in March, you’ll have 3 points on your record starting in March. In this example, the 2 points from January will disappear in July, and the point from March will disappear in September. You’ll also receive 1 point for missing more than half a shift by showing up late, leaving early, or both. If you have no more PPTO, you won’t get paid for your shift if you call out."

      "title": "You receive 2 warning points if you fail to report an absence.",
      "content": "You receive 2 warning points if you fail to report an absence. This happens regardless of whether you have PPTO hours available. Failing to report can include not showing up to your shift, or reporting an absence after your shift’s start time. You can void this situation by calling in sick before your shift is scheduled to begin. [4] X Research source If you have an emergency and can’t call in, contact your manager (or have a family member do so) as soon as possible. They may be able to provide an accommodation or exception, depending on the situation."

You’ll accumulate points quickly if you miss multiple shifts in a six-month period, so it’s best to avoid calling in sick unless you’re unable to work. Talk to your manager if you feel you’re worried about occurring points due to an illness or injury, or due to a child or family member’s illness. If possible, ask them for an accommodation, such as allowing you to work fewer shifts, if you think such a change would help you.
