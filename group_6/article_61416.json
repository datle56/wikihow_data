If the subordinate wins, they become the dominant wolf of the pack and the previous dominant wolf will usually leave the pack and start one of their own. [1] X Research source In a deadly fight, however, a wolf may kill the other once their vulnerabilities are exposed. The pack leader may also snap at another wolf (without the teeth making contact) as a warning to the other wolf not to challenge them.

When a dominant figure is present, the submissive wolf lowering his/her head and shoulders can indicate acknowledgment of their superiority. The subordinate wolf will also tuck its paws over its chest and may also whimper. If the dominant figure is showing more aggression towards the lower ranked wolf than usual, the lower ranked wolf may urinate. Its tail with either be tucked in or out. The dominant wolf will then lick the muzzle, throat, genitals, and anus of the submissive wolf. The second version of passive submission is while the wolf is crouching. The submissive wolf will simply crouch down with its ears smoothed down against its lowered head. It will curl in its tail and rear. This is similar to active submission except the dominant wolf will not nuzzle or lick the subordinate one."

It may also curve its back and tail. The more the back and tail are curved, the greater the submission towards the dominant wolf.
