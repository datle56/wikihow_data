      "content": "Apply blurring powder after your regular makeup. Blurring powder is generally used to enhance existing makeup and help further smooth over any inconsistencies in your skin tone. Before applying blurring powder, put on your makeup as you regularly would. Once you're finished with your normal makeup routine, you can apply the powder as necessary. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Shake the container to loosen the powder.",
      "content": "Shake the container to loosen the powder. Blurring powder sometimes gets stuck on the bottom of the container. This is especially true if the container is new. To loosen the powder for use, shake the container lightly before opening it. When opened, there should be a light layer of blurring powder on top of the container. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Pat it on your face using a brush or pad.",
      "content": "Pat it on your face using a brush or pad. Dab a pad or makeup brush into the container, getting a light dusting of blurring powder on the pad or brush. Then, gently dab the powder onto your face. Use brief, patting motions throughout your face to apply the powder. You should apply a layer of blurring powder over all your regular makeup. This should make your makeup look more even. [3] X Research source If your makeup looks particularly uneven or sparse in certain areas, target these areas a little more when applying blurring powder. Make sure to use gentle motions. Moving too fast can cause blurring powder to create dust, which can cause sneezing and coughing. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Do another layer if necessary.",
      "content": "Do another layer if necessary. After you're done applying powder, examine your face. Some blurring powder is very sheer, and your face may not look much different after the first layer. If you believe it is necessary, add another layer of blurring powder. You can also simply add a layer on areas that look particularly sparse, like your chin or forehead. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Erase pores with blurring powder.",
      "content": "Erase pores with blurring powder. Blurring powder is generally applied after your regular makeup. However, if you have large pores around certain areas, like your nose or chin, blurring powder can be used to diminish their effect. It can create a smooth surface on your skin before applying regular makeup, which can seep into pores and make them more noticeable. [6] X Research source If you have pores you want to conceal, add a layer of blurring powder over areas where pores appear. Then, apply your regular makeup."

      "title": "Conceal troublesome areas.",
      "content": "Conceal troublesome areas. Things like inconsistency in skin tone and wrinkles are easier to conceal with blurring powder than other cosmetic products. Blurring powders are designed to create an airbrush effect similar to something like Photoshop. If you have problem areas, dust a layer of blurring powder over these areas before applying your regular makeup. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Use blurring powder when you'll be under harsh light.",
      "content": "Use blurring powder when you'll be under harsh light. You do not necessarily need to use blurring powder for an every day look. It can take awhile to apply and may not be necessary in some circumstances. However, if you're going to be under harsh, bright lights, blurring powder can give an extra boost to your regular makeup, better concealing imperfections. [8] X Research source For example, use blurring powder if you're going to be out in the sun all day."

      "content": "Apply blurring powder to your lips. If you want matte lips, but do not want to pay the extra money for supplies, blurring powder can be used to create the effect. Use a glossy lipstick. Then, blot on some blurring powder with a piece of tissue. Keep blotting until you reach your desired effect."

      "title": "Switch up your tools if necessary.",
      "content": "Switch up your tools if necessary. Blurring powder can create dust when applied. Different powders may respond better to different tools. If your blurring powder scatters while you're applying a layer, try switching up tools to see if this helps. For example, switch from using a makeup pad to a brush. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Do not use blurring powder on irritated or damaged skin. If your skin is burnt, damaged, or otherwise irritated, do not try to cover this with blurring powder or any makeup. Allow damaged skin to heal completely before concealing it with makeup."
