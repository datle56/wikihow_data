      "content": "Hot tempers lead to fiery but passionless sex between a Scorpio and Aries. Although being constantly at odds makes for brief desire, the lasting sexual compatibility of these signs is limited. Scorpio and Aries share the planet ruler Mars, but this leads to butting heads in and out of the bedroom. You both quickly lose your tempers, and although this can lead to angry sex, it can dwindle the intensity of your relationship. Things may seem great at first, but an Aries won’t be able to provide the level of intimacy and devotions you’re looking for. Show off your muscles to turn on an Aries. Try flexing when they’re around or inviting them to join your workout."

Because of this, you may find pleasure with an Aquarius for a brief moment, but your sexual compatibility won’t last. An Aquarius will want to slow things down, but that’s not what you like. Talk with an Aquarius about what you both like and dislike when having sex. Being on the same page can help your sexual relationship thrive, ensuring everyone’s needs are satisfied."

      "title": "A sexual connection between a Scorpio and Sagittarius can be awkward.",
      "content": "A sexual connection between a Scorpio and Sagittarius can be awkward. Although passionate in the bedroom, you’re probably a homebody.

With different styles of showing affection, a Scorpio and Sagittarius can struggle to find sexual harmony. Your dominant nature in bed may be a turnoff for a Sagittarius. Chat with your Sagittarius partner to find a compromise. Understanding what you both want in a relationship can help you enjoy each other’s company in bed."

As a Scorpio, you crave the thrill of sex, whereas a Leo enjoys the playful fun of the act. In the end, you’re both left wanting more.

      "title": "A Scorpio and Gemini are the least sexually compatible pairing.",
      "content": "A Scorpio and Gemini are the least sexually compatible pairing. These signs have drastically different ideals, especially when it comes to the bedroom. Extroverted and investigative, a Gemini will dig too much into your personal life for your comfort. As a Scorpio, your passion and loyalty are at the forefront of your sex life, which conflicts with the free-spirited and analytical personality of a Gemini. Geminis need motivation to get frisky, while it comes naturally to you. Because of all this, your spirits find it hard to connect emotionally and physically."
