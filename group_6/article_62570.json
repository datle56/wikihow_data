Then, put your item on the paper, and bring the paper up and over the item. Cut the paper where the ends overlap by about 2 in (5.1 cm) to ensure that the bag will be big enough for your item. [1] X Research source Check to be sure that the paper extends beyond the top and bottom edges of your item by at least 2 in (5.1 cm). [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Position the ends so they are overlapping and tape them.",
      "content": "Position the ends so they are overlapping and tape them. After you cut the paper, move the item you want to wrap aside. Take the end of the gift wrap you just cut and the edge of the paper parallel to that end, and fold them towards each other. Overlap the edges by about 1 in (2.5 cm). Then, place a few pieces of tape along this edge to secure the ends together. [3] X Research source Double check the top and bottom edges of the paper before you tape the ends together. Make sure that they are even."

      "content": "Fold 12 in (30 cm) of the bottom of the bag up. With the taped section of the bag in the center, fold the wrapping paper up by about 12 in (30 cm). Bring the bottom of the paper up to the point 12 in (30 cm) from the bottom edge. Press your fingers along the fold to crease it. [4] X Research source This creates the base of the bag."

Move them away from each other to open up the folded portion of the gift wrap. Then, use your fingers to crease the diagonal edges and form a diamond shape. [5] X Research source Make sure that you do not open up the base of the bag beyond the creased edge."

      "content": "Fold the tips of the triangles so they are overlapping and tape them. Next, take the top half of the diamond, 1 of the pointed tips, and fold it down to the center of the diamond. Allow the point to overlap the center by about 0.5 in (1.3 cm). Then, repeat for the bottom of the diamond. Place a few pieces of tape along the tips of the diamond and along the diagonal edges.

Then, place 2 to 3 pieces of tape along the bottom of the last fold. [7] X Research source Add a bow, curled ribbon, or whatever other decorations you want on the outside of the bag! If desired, you can also punch a hole into the corner of the folded edge of the bag to string a ribbon through and add a tag. [8] X Research source"

Putting it into a box or tube will help to ensure that the item stays a secret until the recipient opens their gift. You may need a big box for the item. Wrapping a big box can be a challenge, and you'll also need to make sure you have extra wrapping paper and tape."

If you have a large item that you do not have the time or resources to wrap, then covering it with a blanket or tablecloth is an easy solution. Choose a festive or colorful blanket or tablecloth that will completely cover the item. Place the blanket or tablecloth over the item and tuck it in at the bottom to ensure that the item is hidden.

      "content": "Put the gift inside of another item. You can use a different item to conceal something before you wrap it. Or, use a box to conceal the shape of the item before you wrap it. For example, if you want to give someone a piece of jewelry, and you don’t have a box for it, then get a jewelry box and put the item inside of it. Wrap the jewelry box and give it to the person. They will be totally surprised to find a piece of jewelry in the box already!"
