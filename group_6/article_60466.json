      "content": "People dislike simps because they put women on a pedestal. Make a vow to stop treating women and men differently.

      "title": "You’re more likely to find love if you stop looking for it everywhere.",
      "content": "You’re more likely to find love if you stop looking for it everywhere. Ever hear the phrase, “A watched pot never boils?” You’re going to be more likely to simp if you make finding a girlfriend your sole mission. On top of that, a lot of girls tend to be attracted to guys who don’t try too hard. [3] X Research source By putting your desire to land a girl on the backburner, you’ll stop simping while getting closer to your goal! Enjoy your time with your friends and family. Those relationships will keep you from feeling like you need to go get a girlfriend at this exact moment."

      "title": "Refuse to be anyone’s servant if you want to stop simping.",
      "content": "Refuse to be anyone’s servant if you want to stop simping. A simp will stop whatever they’re doing at the drop of a hat to help others. If you make plans, stick to them. If someone asks for a favor and you’re busy, tell them you can’t help. This will help you get into the habit of putting yourself first, which is a key component of not simping. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Simps tend to be uptight and attentive, so flip the script!",
      "content": "Simps tend to be uptight and attentive, so flip the script! Chill, man! Being laid back and adopting a more free-flowing attitude will keep the simp accusations away. If you find yourself getting anxious about coming off a certain way, just take a deep breath and relax. Play it cool and you’ll stop simping in no time. [5] X Research source One way to start doing this is to try saying yes to every invitation and suggestion. This will give people the impression that you’re super laid back."

      "title": "Wanting other people to like you can make you come off as a simp.",
      "content": "Wanting other people to like you can make you come off as a simp. If you like the way a shirt looks, wear it. If you love that cheesy 90s song that none of your friends like, pump up the volume with pride. Stop making decisions based on what you think other people find cool and just be yourself. On top of that, it’s super rewarding and freeing to forget about the opinions of others. [6] X Research source This will also help you find the girl of your dreams. The woman out there who is authentically attracted to you for you is going to be a much better partner than someone who only knows some version of you."

      "title": "Simps are notorious for not taking “no” for an answer.",
      "content": "Simps are notorious for not taking “no” for an answer. If you flirt with a girl, ask her out, or throw her a compliment and she isn’t receptive, just move on. There’s nothing wrong with shooting your shot, but chasing a woman who isn’t interested in you is certifiable simp behavior. Respect her wishes and let it go. [7] X Research source Under no condition should you continue pursuing a girl if she has explicitly told you to stop."

      "content": "Doing things on your own will help you be the best version of you. Go to a movie by yourself and have fun. Don’t wait around for your friends to join you when you have something you want to do. Taking care of yourself is a great life skill, but it’s also a big part of not overdoing it when it comes to pleasing other people. [8] X Research source Simps tend to seek out attention from other people—especially women. It makes them feel wanted. Stop looking to other people for validation and learn how to be happy on your own."

      "title": "If someone tries to take advantage of you, call them out.",
      "content": "If someone tries to take advantage of you, call them out. Some people will try to take advantage of people they perceive to be simps because they’re known for giving gifts and doing favors. If someone tries to get you to do something for them with nothing in return, tell them to beat it. Standing up for yourself will keep others from seeing you as a simp. [9] X Research source The same goes for bullies. If someone tries bullying you, ignore them, laugh it off, and tell them to stop being such a jerk."

      "content": "Some people mistakenly think simping is when you’re nice to girls. The thing is, a simp doesn’t respect women—they just pretend to respect women in order to get what they want. Be kind to the women in your life and don’t put anyone down. Try to be an empathetic, open, and kind person. Not only will you be happier, but you’ll be more likely to find a partner, too. [11] X Research source A lot of people (especially rude guys) will call people who are friendly and reasonable a simp. If someone in your life is leveling this criticism at you, laugh it off and tell them to get a life. So long as you’re making a conscious decision to treat people with kindness and you aren’t manipulating anyone by being artificially nice, you aren’t a simp. [12] X Research source"
