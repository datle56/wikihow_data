      "content": "Soak your nails in warm water for about 10 minutes. Fill a tub or large bowl with warm water and dip your toes in so they’re submerged. The heat and moisture will help soften your toenails so they’re less likely to break when you trim them. After about 10 minutes, dry your nails off so you can start cutting them. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Alternatively, trim your nails as soon as you get out of the shower since they’ll already be softened. If you have really thick toenails from fungus, then try soaking your nails for up to 30 minutes so the moisture can penetrate deeper. Try adding in 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt for every 1 US pint (470 ml) of water you use for your foot soak if your nails are difficult to cut. The salt will help soften your nails so they’re easier to cut through.

      "content": "Try softening and scraping nails with urea cream and a file . Urea cream penetrates deeper into your nail and softens the surface. Rub a fingertip-sized amount of the cream onto your nails and cover them with a bandage. You can leave the cream on your nail for up to 24 hours to soften your nail. After that, rub the surface lightly with your nail file to scrape away some of the fungus. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You may need to apply the urea cream nightly for a few days until your nails become soft. Avoid applying too much pressure when you’re filing the surface of your nail. If you feel any pain, stop filing right away."

      "title": "Thin extremely thick nails with an electric file.",
      "content": "Thin extremely thick nails with an electric file . An electric file has a rotating abrasive head that grinds down the surface of your nail so it’s thinner and easier to cut. Soak or soften your nails beforehand so they’re easier to grind. Turn the electric file on and gently rub the spinning head over your toenails. Apply light pressure as you use your file to remove up to half of the toenail’s thickness.

      "title": "Use nail nippers meant for cutting toenails.",
      "content": "Use nail nippers meant for cutting toenails. Your nails may be too thick to easily cut with regular clippers, so use a pair of nippers instead. Nail nippers look similar to a pair of scissors and they have a stronger blade that makes it easier to cut through toenails with fungus. [5] X Research source Avoid using nail clippers that are small and made for cutting fingernails since they won’t be able to fully cut through your nail. Fungus is contagious, so don't share your nail nippers with anyone else. [6] X Expert Source Marta Nagorska Nail Artist Expert Interview. 26 May 2021."

      "content": "Clip straight across your nails using short, small cuts. Start at the outer corner of your nail and make short, horizontal cuts across the top. Trim your toenails just shorter than the ends of your toes. Rather than rounding the corners of your nails, keep them straight to avoid getting an ingrown nail . [7] X Research source Make your cut through the white part at the end of your nail so you don’t accidentally cut into your nail bed."

      "title": "File your nails",
      "content": "File your nails with a file or emery board . Once you’re done trimming toenails with fungus, gently rub the file or emery board against the edges of your nails. Rather than moving the file back and forth along the edge, only file in one direction to prevent your nail from cracking or fraying. Once the edge feels smooth, you can stop filing your toenail. [8] X Research source Filing your nails will prevent them from snagging on your socks, which could cause further irritation or injury."

      "title": "Trim your nails every 6–8 weeks.",
      "content": "Trim your nails every 6–8 weeks. Toenails only grow about 2 millimetres (0.079 in) every month, so they don’t need to be cut as frequently as your fingernails. [9] X Research source Once your nails start sticking out past the ends of your toes, trim them so they’re less likely to catch on anything."

      "content": "Cut toenails with fungus after healthy nails. Nippers contaminated with nail fungus can spread the infection to any healthy nails you still have. [10] X Research source Focus on the nails that don’t have any signs of fungus before you move on to clipping the ones that are thick or hardened. Use a separate pair of clippers for your fingernails so you can avoid any cross-contamination with toenail fungus."

Then, wet a cloth with rubbing alcohol and wipe your nippers down to get rid of any bacteria. Since bacteria could get on your nippers in between uses, clean them before the next time you use them too.

[13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your toenails are too thick to cut on your own or if it hurts when you try trimming them, then your doctor will be able to trim them for you.
