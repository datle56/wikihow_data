You can also add heart-eye or other flirtatious or affectionate emoji so the meaning behind the text doesn't get lost. [4] X Research source You might also send them videos or memes that remind you of them, your feelings for them, or your relationship in general. If you're talking to the person on the phone, pay attention and really be engaged in the conversation. Dating expert John Keegan mentions showing affection through things such as \"words of encouragement... playful little jokes and teasing... [and] also just directly saying what you like about them.\" [5] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 28 September 2021."

      "content": "Write a love letter expressing your feelings. If you enjoy writing and putting your thoughts down on paper, this can be a great way to show affection. Think about what you love about the person, then go into a little detail about each of the things you've thought of. Not only will this be really touching to them but also they'll get to keep it and refer back to it whenever they want. [6] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source If you're not into writing, you might also draw them a picture, make them a mix tape, or knit them a scarf. All of these are great ways to show how much you care about someone."

      "title": "Follow up on details about things they tell you.",
      "content": "Follow up on details about things they tell you. Listen actively and ask the person open-ended questions as they're telling you something. Then, you'll know what's going on in their life and you can ask about it later. This shows that you're really interested in them and care about them. [7] X Research source For example, if a friend tells you about a problem they're having with a family member, you might ask them about it the next time you see them. Or if your significant other mentions a short story idea they have, you might ask about their progress on it a week later. If you have a hard time remembering things, there's no shame in setting a reminder on your phone so you'll remember to follow up with them when it's appropriate."

[8] X Research source For example, if your best friend is on a basketball team, you could show affection by going to their games and cheering for them.

Make eye contact to show them that, as far as you're concerned, they're the only person who exists. Focusing like this enables the two of you to connect and bond on a deeper emotional level. [9] X Research source Dating expert John Keegan notes that \"the number one way to show someone that you like them, or that you're interested in them, is to pay attention to them....

      "content": "Do chores for them without being asked. People will know that you love and care about them if you take something off their plate so they have more time to relax and enjoy themselves. Even better if you take on something that you know that person hates to do. [11] X Research source For example, if you know that your significant other hates to do the dishes, you might surprise them by doing the dishes before they get home so they don't even have to think about it. Doing small things to make the person's life a little easier will always be appreciated. For example, if it's icy outside and your significant other has to drive to work in the morning, you might set your alarm before theirs so you can go out and scrape their windows and warm up their car for them."

Make sure it's something meaningful that either reminds you of them or is symbolic of your feelings for them. [13] X Research source For example, you might pick up an owl keychain for your best friend because owls are their favorite animal. Dating coach John Keegan suggests showing up with something small you know they'd like, such as a box of chocolates, and saying \"Hey, before I showed up today, I thought about you. Just a little thing, nothing major, but I thought of you.\" [14] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 10 June 2021. This doesn't have to be something new or store-bought!

When you cook for someone, they know that you've put your heart and soul into feeding them and caring for them. And if you're not a chef, don't worry! There are plenty of simple recipes that are nearly impossible to mess up. [15] X Research source Don't have the time or patience to cook from scratch?

If you have to shift your schedule around or pass up something else to do this, let them know! They'll appreciate that you're making a sacrifice for them and really understand how much you love them. [16] X Research source For example, you might tell a friend, \"I love spending time with you so much that I'm going to go to the 5:30 spin class instead of the 6:00 spin class so we can meet each other for breakfast!\" If you're trying to make plans with someone, you might say, \"I have a crazy busy week, but I would never survive it without having a little quality time with you.\""

This doesn't mean that you're always going to be dressed to the nines—you want to be appropriate for the occasion—but they'll know how you feel about them if you always look presentable. If there's a particular style or outfit they like, dressing in that is another way to show them affection. For example, you might wear your best friend's favorite hat when you go out to eat with them."

      "content": "Help them when they're having a problem. Being there for someone when they're going through a tough time is one of the most valuable ways to show affection for them. Having a problem can lead people to feel really isolated and alone, so it's really helpful for you to show up for them and remind them that you're there for them and willing to do anything you can to help them out. [18] X Research source For example, if a friend calls or texts and tells you that their car has broken down, you could offer to give them a ride to school or work. Keep in mind that you don't necessarily need to drop everything every time a friend or loved one has a problem. If you have a previous commitment that means you can't be there for them right away, just let them know that you will be there for them as soon as you can. Dating coach John Keegan warns against going into \"fix-it mode.\" He notes that sometimes you just have to \"allow that person to be sad, allow them to be upset, allow [them] to feel what they're feeling, and sit with them.\" Sometimes all someone wants is for someone to understand, and you can show affection by empathizing with them.

      "content": "Make a list of forms of touching you like. You might be willing to touch people, or let them touch you, in specific ways. This is valuable information if you love someone who is more touchy-feely because it allows you to communicate what you're alright with as opposed to taking everything off the table. [20] X Research source For example, you might be okay with someone patting you on the back or touching your arm as they're talking. There might be specific body parts that you consider off limits, while others are generally okay for people to touch. Think about the type of touch as well. For example, you might love deep pressure but hate light touching. It might also be that you're just not comfortable with anyone touching you at all—and that's okay!

There might also be certain times of day that you feel less comfortable with touch. [22] X Research source For example, you might not like to be touched while you're in bed trying to fall asleep. If you have a significant other who likes to cuddle as they drift off to sleep, explaining this preference to them will help them understand that you're not personally rejecting them.
