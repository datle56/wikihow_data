      "content": "Cancers, more than any other sign, live for flattery. These people prefer super sweet partners, so if you can prove that that’s you, your Cancer crush will be thrilled. With a Cancer, any compliment is welcome. But they may feel especially touched if you show appreciation for their warm nature, their ability to nurture others, or their sparkling eyes. [1] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. “You really try your best to be kind to everyone. I admire that about you, you know. 😊\" “I feel so safe with you. I want you to know that. 😇\" “Your eyes absolutely sparkle. I feel like I could stare into them for hours. 😘” Try to offer plenty of compliments about their character, rather than just sticking to physical compliments.

      "content": "Sending daily messages proves you’re consistent—which Cancers love. This is a sign that craves a loyal, trustworthy partner. It may sound simple, but through daily morning messages, you can show that you're a reliable person. Plus, this is a sweet way to remind your Cancer crush that the second you wake up, they're on your mind. “Back again! Here to wish you another fabulous morning. Talk soon :) ❤️😘” “Hey sunshine! ☀️ Hope you get outside today (it’s supposed to be 75 degrees!). Good morning :)” “Good morning to my very favorite person 🥰\""

      "content": "In their heart of hearts, a Cancer wants to be taken care of. To impress a Cancer, you need to show an interest in their feelings. The most attractive thing you can say to this water sign is simple: “How did that make you feel?” Periodically check in on how your Cancer crush is doing. If they've been down, make sure to follow up with them later in the week. “Hey, how are you feeling today? Things okay on your end?” “I wanted to check back in after you mentioned feeling bummed yesterday. Have things gotten better?”"

      "content": "Cancers adore all things cute and silly—which includes emojis and gifs. Tacking on one or two emojis to standard greetings and questions will go a long way. With gifs, look out for things you both enjoy and use that for inspiration. Are you both major Parks and Rec enthusiasts? There’s definitely a Leslie Knope gif for every occasion. “Hey! ☀️🤗” “Was just thinking about you. 😽🥰” “Can’t wait to see you this week. 😋🤩”"

      "content": "A Cancer will melt if you lay on the charm and make them feel special. Focus on being affectionate and openly admiring them in a flirtatious way. Teasing and play-fighting are not the right flirting methods for your Cancer crush. They'll want every exchange with you to be sweet and lighthearted—even your flirty texts. “How am I doing? Oh, I don’t know. I’m texting this amazing person that I’m super into, so I guess I’m pretty good. 🤗” “I had a fortune cookie recently that said good things were headed my way, but it didn’t clarify that \"good things\" meant an amazing girlfriend:) 🥰” “You were in my dream last night! Was a bit sad to wake up, actually. I missed you right away\" :) 😇❤️”"

      "content": "A Cancer wants to be on your mind as often as you're on theirs. To this sign, love doesn't need to be flashy or extravagant. A simple, kind-hearted message can be just as powerful as an expensive gift. They'll be thinking of you on loop, so if you shoot over a quick text whenever they cross your mind, it'll mean the world to a Cancer. “I just finished my shift and wouldn’t you know it, I’m sitting here thinking about you again. Hope you’ve had a nice day 😽” “I swear, you live rent-free in my head. Thinking of you. Talk soon! Xoxo ❤️🤗” “Daily reminder that you’re on my mind. That’s all I have for ya! 😇”"

      "content": "Cancers need openness and sensitivity in their relationships. When you’re texting a Cancer, find opportunities to provide them some emotional insight. For example, say a Cancer asks how your day has been. If you respond with what you've been feeling instead of what you've been doing, this will be impressive to any Cancer. [3] X Research source “I’ve been a bit off today, actually. I think I might be stressed about work.\" “Weather like this reminds me of where I grew up. I’m feeling super nostalgic today—in a good way, though.” “I’m actually worried about my sister at the moment. I know she’s struggling with a breakup. I want to give her a call, but I think she needs some space.”"

      "content": "Cancers are the most nostalgic sign in the zodiac. Reflecting on sweet memories can be a great way to strengthen any bond. Because Cancers find getting nostalgic so meaningful, this will work extra well with them. If the two of you share great memories already, nod to that over text. If you're still getting to know each other, open up a more general conversation about nostalgia. [4] X Research source “You know what I remembered today? That time the two of us walked the Brooklyn Bridge last summer. I’d love to repeat that day.” “Here’s a blast from the past. My friend just asked if I wanted to watch Harry Potter . Remember when we watched the first four movies in one day?? 😊” “Would you say you’re a nostalgic person? I try not to be, but to be honest, I actually totally am.”"

      "content": "If you plan a romantic outing, your Cancer crush will be over the moon. This sign is constantly the shoulder to cry on, the empathetic ear, and the perfect support system. That's why, in romance, they crave being nurtured and taken care of. When you show a Cancer that you’re willing to put time and effort into planning an evening that’s all about them, it’ll be extremely meaningful. [5] X Research source “I have two tickets to the movies with our names on them. And I may just have another surprise waiting…You in? 😊” “I’ve got the candles lit, my famous lasagna in the oven, and all that’s missing is you. Want to come by this evening? I’ve got something special planned. 😘🤗” “I know you mentioned wanting to see that new exhibition at the MOMA. I figure if we finish the day with a walk in the park and croissants, we’ll have covered all of your favs! 🥰”"

      "content": "A Cancer wants to feel special to you. In a Cancer's perfect world, you'd only have eyes for them right from the very beginning. Of course, you have to do what feels right for you. But if you're committed to getting a Cancer's attention, make it clear that they're your main focus. A Cancer will appreciate it if you tell them that directly. “Hey! Have I mentioned yet that you’re the only person I’m talking to right now? I just wanted to let you know :)”"

      "content": "Mind games and playing hard to get are turn-offs to any Cancer. A Cancer hates tension in their relationships, even if it's flirtatious or humorous. So, be direct with them over text. There's never a good reason to be aloof with a Cancer. Instead, focus on being open about how you feel. “I know I'm supposed to play it cool…but I don’t want to! How are you? How’s your day been? 😊” “Ugh, I'm going to be honest...I like you. I’m so excited to hang out again! ❤️”"

      "content": "Cancers aren't impressed by sultry texts. When you're into someone, it can be totally thrilling. You may be looking for ways to keep excitement levels up. With a Cancer though, risqué texts are probably not going to have the effect that you want them to have. Cancers love it when you’re open about your emotions, but when it comes to physical intimacy, they prefer a little mystery at the beginning."

      "content": "A Cancer takes everything to heart, even being left on read. This is an extremely sensitive sign. It may not feel like a big deal to you, but an unanswered text can really bum out your Cancer crush. Even worse, this could send the message that you're not interested in them anymore. [6] X Research source Before you go to bed, check your texts to make sure you haven’t accidentally left any messages without a response. If you do forget one or two (we all make mistakes!), communicate to your crush that there was no hidden meaning behind it. Then, remind them of how much you care."
