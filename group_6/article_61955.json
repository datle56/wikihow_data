Many of the specials or later series are considered non-canon because the original manga author didn’t have any input on them. If you want to cut out all the filler episodes and stick to the main story, then do the following: Skip all of the movies and TV specials. Instead of watching all of Dragon Ball Z , replace it with Dragon Ball Z Kai . Dragon Ball Z Kai is a remastered and condensed version of the original Dragon Ball Z arcs that are truer to the manga.
