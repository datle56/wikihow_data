      "content": "Do research on your topic. Finding out background information can help you figure out an angle and identify subjects to interview. Doing online research is good, but it may only get you so far. You may also need to consult books to make sure you are fully aware of the issues surrounding a topic. A historical article may require a visit to an archive."

      "title": "Decide on the type of feature you want to write.",
      "content": "Decide on the type of feature you want to write. There are a number of ways to write a feature, depending on what you want to focus on. Some of these include: Human Interest : Many feature stories focus on an issue as it impacts people. They often focus on one person or a group of people. Profile : This feature type focuses on a specific individual’s character or lifestyle. This type is intended to help the reader feel like they’ve gotten a window into someone’s life. Often, these features are written about celebrities or other public figures. Instructional : How-to feature articles teach readers how to do something. Oftentimes, the writer will write about their own journey to learn a task, such as how to make a wedding cake. Historical : Features that honor historical events or developments are quite common. They are also useful in juxtaposing the past and the present, helping to root the reader in a shared history. Seasonal : Some features are perfect for writing about in certain times of year, such as the beginning of summer vacation or at the winter holidays. Behind the Scenes : These features give readers insight into an unusual process, issue or event. It can introduce them to something that is typically not open to the public or publicized."

      "content": "Consider the audience you’d like to talk to. As you brainstorm story ideas, think about who will read these stories. Ask yourself questions such as Who will be my readers? and What kinds of angles appeal to these readers? For example, you might write a profile about a pastry chef, but you’ll write differently depending on if your readers are aspiring chefs or if they are wedding planners looking to buy a wedding cake.

      "title": "Consider the type of publication you’re writing for.",
      "content": "Consider the type of publication you’re writing for. If you are writing for a magazine or blog with a very specific topic, such as gardening, then you will likely need to tailor your feature article to reflect that interest in some way. A newspaper, on the other hand, is meant for a more general audience and may be more open to varied content."

      "title": "Schedule an interview at a time and place convenient for the interviewee.",
      "content": "Schedule an interview at a time and place convenient for the interviewee. Ask your interviewee to tell you when and where the best place is for them to meet. If they give you a choice, ask for a quiet place where you will be relatively undisturbed for the duration of the interview. Schedule about 30-45 minutes with this person. Be respectful of their time and don’t take up their whole day. Be sure to confirm the date and time a couple of days ahead of the scheduled interview to make sure the time still works for the interviewee. If your interviewee needs to reschedule, be flexible. Remember, they are being generous with their time and allowing you to talk with them, so be generous with your responses as well. Never make an interviewee feel guilty about needing to reschedule. If you want to observe them doing a job, ask if they can bring you to their workplace. Asking if your interviewee will teach you a short lesson about what they do can also be excellent, as it will give you some knowledge of the experience to use when you write."

      "content": "Arrive early for the interview. Your interviewee’s time is valuable, so you don’t want to waste the appointment rushing in and catching your breath. Get to the interview site early. Set up your audio recording equipment and test it out. Make sure you have extra pens and paper."

      "content": "Audio-record the interview. Use an audio recorder for the interview, but take notes throughout as well. There is always the possibility that your recorder will run out of batteries or memory. Be sure to ask your interviewee if it’s okay to audio-record the interview. If you plan to use the audio for any purpose other than for your own purposes writing up the article (such as a podcast that might accompany the feature article), you must tell them and get their consent. Don't pressure the interviewee if they decline audio recording."

      "title": "Ask open-ended questions.",
      "content": "Ask open-ended questions. Questions that rely on yes or no answers will not give you very rich information. Instead, ask questions that start with “how” or “why.” These types of questions give the interviewee a chance to tell a story, relate details or give their opinion. Another good option is a question that begins Tell me about a time when.... This allows the interviewee to tell you the story that's important to them, and can often produce rich information for your article."

      "title": "Actively listen.",
      "content": "Actively listen. Listening is a key component of a good interview. Don’t give too many of your own observations, but do react to what they are telling you by smiling or nodding. People are more likely to continue talking when their audience is receptive."

      "title": "Ask follow up questions.",

      "title": "Choose a format for your article.",
      "content": "Choose a format for your article. Feature articles do not have a particular formula the way hard news articles do. You don’t need to follow the “inverted pyramid” style of writing that conveys the “who, what, where, when and why” of a news story. Instead, choose a more inventive way to write a story. Some possible formats may include: Start by describing a dramatic moment and then uncover the history that led up to that moment. Use a story-within-a-story format, which relies on a narrator to tell the story of someone else. Start the story with an ordinary moment and trace how the story became unusual."

As you get to the conclusion, think of the overall theme or lasting impression you want to leave with the reader. [2] X Research source Consider what you absolutely must have in the story and what can be cut. If you are writing a 500-word article, for example, you will likely need to be very selective about what you include, whereas you have a lot more space to write in a 2,500 word article."

The outline can also help you remember how details connect to each other and how quotes support certain points that you’re making. Be flexible, however.

      "content": "Don’t use too many quotes. While it can be tempting to include the interviewee’s own words in the story, don’t rely too much on quoting them. Otherwise, this becomes more of a straightforward interview. Write around their quotes to give them context, build the story and help the reader interpret what the interviewee is saying."

      "content": "Have your subject read your article. Not all feature writers do this, and in fact, some may argue that this can detract from the journalistic quality of a piece. But many subjects often want to see their article before it is printed in order to make sure they feel they are represented properly and fairly.

The headline is short and to the point, using no more than about 10-15 words, if that. A headline should be action-oriented and should convey why the story is important. It should grab the reader and draw them into the article.
