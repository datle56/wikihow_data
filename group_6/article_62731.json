      "content": "Websites often block IP addresses due to unusual or suspicious traffic. This type of traffic may have originated from your computer or phone, somebody on your network, or even another person whose IP address is in the same range as yours. Some of the most common reasons why an IP address is temporarily blocked: Too many failed login attempts. Multiple error messages in a short period, such as several 403 Forbidden or 503 Service Unavailable errors in a row. Malicious activity, such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or spam, originating from someone on your network or ISP. Regional/country blocks. Your computer may be infected with malware that is scanning the website for open ports. Your IP may be on a major IP address blacklist. If you see the message \"Your IP has been banned,\" this is a bit more serious and usually points to rule violations—especially for community-oriented websites."

      "content": "Check for and remove your IP address from blacklists. If your IP address is on a popular blacklist, you won't be able to access sites that utilize that blacklist. Even if you didn't do anything wrong, your IP might be on a blacklist because of another person on your network or someone who previously had your IP address. Fortunately, most IP blacklists make removal a breeze as long as you're not a repeat offender. To see if your IP is on a blacklist, go to https://whatismyipaddress.com/ . Once you see an IP next to \"IPv4,\" click the address. Click CLICK TO CHECK BLACKLIST STATUS to look up your IP in several blacklists at once. If you see a red exclamation point next to a blacklist, your IP address was found on that blacklist. Click the link to learn about the blacklist. Click the blacklist's website link at the top of the page and look for the \"Delist an IP Address\" option (or similar). Follow the site's instructions to get your IP address delisted from the blacklist."

The drawback is that some security-conscious websites may be blocking the IPs assigned by Tor. However, you can change your IP address in Tor as often as you want without paying for a VPN. You can download Tor from https://www.torproject.org . There's no official version of Tor for iPhone and iPad, but you can install the official Tor browser on an Android."

      "content": "Access the site through a proxy. A proxy server allows you to mask your IP address while browsing the web. Many sites block proxy IP addresses by default, especially the popular ones. One thing to remember is that proxy servers are not very secure—don't use a proxy server if you need to pass any sensitive information to the website, such as a username and password. There are many free proxy servers available , though they'll usually be pretty slow and filled with ads. Instead of paying for a proxy server, paying for a VPN is better."
