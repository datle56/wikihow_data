Yogurt with lactobacillus acidophilus has been used by women, either orally or applied vaginally, to help combat developing yeast infections. Lactobacillus acidophilus is a good bacteria that can help you to fight the bacteria causing your yeast infection. You can buy this kind of yogurt at most grocery stores. Make sure to check the label to ensure that it has active and live lactobacillus acidophilus cultures in it. Studies have shown that yogurt may be effective at decreasing symptomatic relief in some women. However, as other studies have shown, it isn't effective in all women.

While taking a shower or bath two times a day can throw off your daily schedule, it is important that you stay as clean as possible to combat your yeast infection. When you bathe, do not use any chemical soap or body wash. These kinds of soaps can kill good bacteria that you need to fight your infection, while doing very little to reduce your infection.

Yeast thrives in warm, damp places, so use a clean, dry towel to get rid of any lingering moisture. If you use a towel that you used before, you might transfer yeast to it, which can thrive on the dampness left behind from your previous shower. Instead, wash your towels after you have used them once. [7] X Research source"

This is particularly important if you have a vaginal yeast infection. Wear cotton underwear and avoid any underwear made with silk or nylon, as these two fabrics do not let any air through. Avoid activities that cause unnecessary heat, sweat, and moisture in affected areas in order to help prevent further growth of the yeast.

In particular, it is important to avoid soaps that could wash away good bacteria, as well as vaginal sprays or powders. You should also not use certain lotions, since they can keep your skin moist and cause the skin to retain heat and liquid. While you may want to use sprays or powders to combat some of the side effects of yeast infections, these products can actually irritate the skin further.

For skin infections, doctors generally recommend antifungal creams that are applied directly to the affected area. These creams will generally clear the infection within a couple of week. The two most common antifungal creams for yeast infections on the skin include miconazole and oxiconazole. The cream have general instructions for application, but make sure you follow the doctor's instructions carefully. To use cream for your skin yeast infections, wash the affected area with water and then dry it off very thoroughly. The skin should not be moist at all. Apply the recommended amount of cream as indicated by your doctor or the manufacturer's instructions. Let it absorb into your skin before you reapply clothing or do any activities that might cause the area to rub against another object or material. [11] X Research source"

For infrequent episodes of yeast infections that only have mild to moderate symptoms, you can use over the counter medication that either comes as a cream, tablet, or suppository that gets inserted directly into your vagina. [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The common yeast-fighting medical creams include miconazole (Monistat) and terconazole (Terazol). They are generally used as a cream or suppository, given intravaginally every day at bedtime, for as many days as specified in the instructions. You can get medications that last one to seven days. You can also get oral antifungal medication that can be taken, such as clotrimazole (Myecelex) and fluconazole (Diflucan), which you take by mouth. You can also take clotrimazole as tablets, which are taken intravaginally at 100mg every day at bedtime for six to seven days, 200mg every night for 3 days, or 500mg daily for 1 day.

This may provide relief from infections that occur frequently if conventional treatments have not been as effective as expected. Additionally, boric acid may provide increased resistance against other strains of candida that may have become resistant to certain antifungal medications over time.

Also talk to a doctor about additional prescription oral medications that you can take. Oral antifungal medications also come in the form of tablets and lozenges. If you have a very weakened immune system and are combating other illnesses like cancer or HIV, your doctor may also prescribe amphotericin B, a medication that combats oral yeast infections that have become immune to antifungal medications.

There are infections that affect the skin, the mouth, and the vagina. Symptoms of a mouth yeast infection, also called oral thrush, are creamy patches of white in the throat or mouth region or painful cracks at the corners of your lips. Skin yeast infections cause blisters, red patches of skin, or skin rashes, which are most commonly found between the toes and fingers, under the breast, and around the groin area. Skin yeast infections can also affect the penis. The symptoms can be the same, but the penis can also develop white patches of skin or moist areas of skin with a white substance collecting in skin folds.

      "title": "Consider the general risk factors.",
      "content": "Consider the general risk factors. There are many risk factors that can contribute to yeast infections. If you suffer from a disorder that compromises the immune system, such as HIV, it will open up increased possibilities for infection because the body is unable to properly defend itself against outside sources. If you are taking antibiotics, you are also more likely to get a yeast infection. Antibacterial therapies, such as antibiotics, serve to fight against infections, but they can also reduce the number of bacteria that live on your body and play a role in protecting you from other types of infections, such as yeast infections. In these cases, a yeast infection may occur if it is provided a surface to effectively multiply on, such as the skin, penis, or vagina. People who are overweight can also suffer from increased chances of yeast infections. This is typically due to the overabundance of skin folds, which can cause bacteria and yeast growth.

      "content": "Look for the gender specific risk factors. Women with hormonal fluctuations, due to menopause, birth control pills, pregnancy, or premenstrual syndrome, can be more susceptible to yeast infections because of the physical stressors the hormonal changes cause. Women may also be prone to yeast infections through the use of douches and chemical irritants. While well-intentioned, these can alter the natural pH balance of the vagina, which naturally creates an environment that is difficult for foreign bacteria to infect. Men are more prone to yeast infections if they are uncircumcised. These men have an increased risk for the yeast bacteria that causes the infections due to the increased ability of bacteria to grow on or under the foreskin. [20] X Research source Domino, F. (n.d.).

      "content": "Reduce the possibility of a yeast infection. There are general ways you can prevent yeast infections. Only use antibiotics when absolutely necessary, so your body keeps its natural bacteria that fights off yeast infections. [22] X Research source Since steroids can cause immune system problems, reduce or minimize the use of inhaled and other steroids. Try to stay away from moist environments and clothes. If you are in moist clothes, try to change out of them as soon as possible. [23] X Research source Yeast infections can grow in the mouth, especially in those with diabetes and those with dentures. To prevent this issue with dentures, keep your dentures clean and use well-fitting dentures. For other instances, the yeast will remain dormant until a trigger, such as antibiotic use, causes it to manifest. Women should avoid douching if at all possible.
