      "title": "Ask yourself, “What would I do?”",
      "content": "Ask yourself, “What would I do?” History can seem so far apart from us that it’s difficult to connect with sometimes. It helps to put yourself in the mindset of a historical character and think about what you would do in their position. Try to use the information about that time period to make a reasonable assumption about their choices. [1] X Research source For example, if you are studying the early English colonization of the Americas, consider what you’d encounter as a colonist. How would you respond to your surroundings? It’s important to note, however, that putting yourself in someone else’s shoes doesn’t have to mean completely agreeing with their lifestyle or perspective. It’s more about understanding the past than forgiving it. You might also ask yourself why it is important to study history? How am I learning about the past? Who recorded these stories? Whose voices are missing from the picture? These questions will help you to delve deeper into the concepts of bias and conflicting sources in history texts."

      "title": "Look up art from the period you’re studying.",
      "content": "Look up art from the period you’re studying. Hopefully your teacher is already using visual sources to discuss social studies. However, enter in the period that you’re studying in a search engine and narrow the search down to images to find even more materials. Looking at paintings, prints, or other images from the period can help to transport you there mentally. For example, if you search for the “1920s” in images, then you’ll see lots of art deco buildings."

      "title": "Think about the significance of each person, place, or event.",
      "content": "Think about the significance of each person, place, or event. To keep history relevant and to help you remember facts, always ask yourself why a particular historical moment is significant. You can even say aloud when studying, “Why do we care about this?” If you can answer this question, then you’ll feel more motivated to learn the information and you’ll do better on tests or essays.

      "title": "Look up terms you don't know.",
      "content": "Look up terms you don't know. If you don't understand the vocabulary, you're going to have a hard time understanding what you are reading. When you get lists of terms in class, make sure to study their definitions, and ask questions if you don't understand their importance. When you read a word in your textbook or your homework and don't understand it, take time to look it up or ask someone for help defining it. You may have to learn words about government, geography, economics, history, and culture. Keep a list of new terms, and add the words you learn to it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Study for at least 15 minutes each day.",
      "content": "Study for at least 15 minutes each day. This is a minimum amount of studying that you can do no matter your grade level. Keeping your study sessions short will also help you to stay focused and concentrated. If you need to increase your study time before a test, go ahead and do so. However, take breaks every 30 minutes. [4] X Research source Set a timer on your phone to start each session and then put it away."

    {
      "title": "Create study notecards.",
      "content": "Create study notecards. On one side of each notecard write down a name, place, event, or date of historical importance. On the other side, list out the facts that you need to know about that particular item. Carry the notecards with you and pull them out to flip through whenever you have down time. Don’t wait to study your notecards until right before a test or they won’t be as effective. Some students find it helpful to color-code their notecards. Using pink notecards for places or green ones for people."

      "title": "Divide large topics into manageable chunks.",
      "content": "Divide large topics into manageable chunks. If you sit down determined to understand everything about World War II, then you’re going to feel overwhelmed and discouraged. Instead, ask yourself what interests you about this period and what you need to know for your class, if necessary. Break up the history into chunks, such as social, political, cultural, or economic, for starters. [5] X Research source For example, if you are studying WWII, start by determining if you need to focus on just the U.S. or the entire globe."

      "title": "Use memory aids to remember historical facts.",
      "content": "Use memory aids to remember historical facts. Try to attach each person, place, or thing in social studies to something that you are already familiar with. If a historical figure looks similar to someone you already know, try to link their names in your mind. Create little rhymes for historical events and repeat them until memorized. Always remember practice makes a man perfect. [6] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source “Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492,” is a great example of a memory rhyme in action."

      "title": "Attend every class.",
      "content": "Attend every class. Social studies is usually taught partially chronologically, so if you miss a class you’ll likely have a big gap in your knowledge. Try to minimize the number of classes or review sessions that you miss. If you just can’t attend a class, then reach out to a classmate for notes right away. Sending a quick email to your teacher to let them know you’ll be absent is also a good idea. Never ask your teacher, “Did I miss anything?” Instead, ask them to point out what you missed."

      "title": "Set content and grade goals.",
      "content": "Set content and grade goals. Look over your calendar and decide how quickly you’ll need to master each topic. This will help you to determine what to study each day. Also, decide what grade you’d like for the entire class. Then, see what grades you’ll need to get on various assignments to accomplish that. [7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source For example, if you want an A for the semester, you’ll probably need an A for the major tests as well."

      "title": "Ask your teacher for help.",
      "content": "Ask your teacher for help. Talk to your teacher after class or set-up an appointment with them. Be open and honest about the problems you’re facing with understanding social studies and what you’ve done so far. Ask for their advice and assistance moving forward. [8] X Research source In some cases, your teacher might be willing to provide you with extra study materials. Some teachers will even meet with you after class to go over recent lectures."

      "title": "Work with a social studies tutor.",
      "content": "Work with a social studies tutor. Ask your teacher or school counselor for a tutor recommendation. Only use a tutor who can provide references and who has experience in teaching social studies at your grade level. Meeting with a tutor 1-2 times weekly can usually give you great results. [9] X Research source If you don’t mesh well with a certain tutor, go ahead and meet with another one on a trial basis."

    {
      "title": "Study with your peers.",
      "content": "Study with your peers. Talk with your classmates and set up a study group outside of class. Create an agenda for each study session, so that you’ll stay focused on the task at hand. You may need to move groups a few times before finding one that works the best for you. [10] X Research source Some people can find studying in a group to be distracting. If this is the case with you, try studying with only one other person to see if that works."

    {
      "title": "Ask your teacher what each test covers.",
      "content": "Ask your teacher what each test covers. Because you are going to cover so much material in your social studies class, it’s important to know what time periods each exam includes. Either before, during, or after class, ask your teacher for the class dates that will be covered. They may also suggest to focus more on certain periods or subjects than others. [11] X Research source For example, if your teacher only briefed discussed Reconstruction, then it’s a good idea to ask them that period will play a large part in your future exam."
