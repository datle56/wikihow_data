To recover a deleted text message, follow these steps [1] X Research source : Open the Messages app, if it's not already open. Tap Edit in the top-left corner. If you have message filtering turned on, tap Filters in the top-left corner instead. Tap Recently Deleted . Select the conversation(s) you want to restore. Tap Recover in the bottom-right corner."

Cellular carriers use algorithms that rely on machine learning to determine which numbers are likely to be spam.
