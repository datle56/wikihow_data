      "content": "If your evil eye bracelet breaks, you may be the target of negative energy. Evil eye bracelets are a form of protection, as many believe this ancient, spiritual symbol guards you from jealousy and envy. [2] X Research source Many believe that an evil eye bracelet breaking is a sign that someone has sent negative energy your way. While this ultimately indicates that your evil eye bracelet has done its job, it’s also a sign that someone is out to get you, and bad luck is just around the corner. [3] X Research source If the evil eye breaks on your left hand, it may be a sign that built-up negative energy has been released. If the evil eye breaks on your right hand, you might be sucking in negative energy from your surroundings. Have an evil eye necklace or ring that’s broken? The same interpretation can be applied—the evil eye has done its job protecting you, but now it’s time to watch your back. Alternatively, there may be no spiritual meaning to an evil eye bracelet breaking—it might just be a simple malfunction with the charm or bracelet itself."

If you believe in the evil eye’s protective power, get a new bracelet to continue warding off evil spirits. Avoid repairing the broken bracelet at all costs, as the evil eye has most likely lost its spiritual properties and won’t have the same energetic effects. Discard your broken evil eye bracelet to rid yourself of negativity. Throw the bracelet away or bury it in the earth, but remember to say a quick thank-you prayer before throwing it out to show gratitude to the spirits.

If you don’t feel a difference wearing it, no biggie—do you!"
