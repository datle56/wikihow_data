      "content": "Remember that emulators are only part of what you need to play games on your computer. You need to download a ROM for that video game console you wish to emulate. A ROM acts as the video game cartridge for the emulator, which acts as the console. The Internet is your best friend when searching for the ROMs. Try searching for \"(System Name) ROMs\"."

      "content": "ROMS mostly come in compressed formats, such as ZIP or RAR. You need to have a program that will decompress them, such as Winzip (Trial Version), or 7-Zip (Free). Sometimes, it is easier to leave the ZIP file compressed, and just place in its own folder. All of the save files should go directly into the created folder, nicely organizing your ROMs."

Most Emulators have a ( File>Open ROM ) option, so do that, and a box will appear to select your game file."
