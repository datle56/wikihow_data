      "content": "Choose the right capacity for the dehumidifier. In addition to being categorized in terms of room size, dehumidifiers are categorized according to the level of moisture in a given room. This is measured in number of pints of water that will be extracted from the environment in a 24-hour period. The result will be a room with your ideal level of humidity. For example, a 500 square foot room that smells musty and feels damp would require a 40–45 US-pint (19,000–21,000 ml) dehumidifier. Consult a buying guide to determine the proper size for your needs. [2] X Research source Dehumidifiers can accommodate up to 44 pints (20.8197 liters) per 24 hours in a space as large as 2,500 square feet (232.257 square meters)."

      "content": "Buy a portable dehumidifier. If you plan to move the dehumidifier from room to room frequently, consider buying a portable model. These often have wheels on the base or are light and easy to move. Having a portable dehumidifier will also enable you to move it around the room. If you need dehumidifying in multiple rooms in your house, you might consider ducting a dehumidifier into your HVAC system instead of buying a single room unit."

      "content": "Consider which features you need on your machine. Modern dehumidifiers have multiple features and settings, and the more expensive the machine is, the more options it will have. Some of the potential features include: Adjustable Humidistat : This feature allows you to control the level of moisture in the room. Set the humidistat to your ideal relative humidity level. Once it reaches this level, the machine will automatically shut off. Built-in Hygrometer : This instrument reads the humidity level in the room, which helps you accurately set the dehumidifier to maximize water extraction. Automatic Shut Off : Many dehumidifiers will automatically shut off when they reach the set humidity level, or when the water reservoir is full. Automatic Defrost : If a dehumidifier is overly used, frost can easily build up on the machine’s coils. This can damage the components of the dehumidifier. An automatic defrost option will keep the machine’s fan running to melt the frost."

Using a dehumidifier can restore the room to an ideal relative humidity. If the walls feel damp to the touch or have moldy patches, a dehumidifier should be used frequently. Obvious signs that you need to use a dehumidifier are when the windows are covered in condensation, mold is visible, or you see moist or wet stains on the walls or ceiling. However, you may also need to use one if the room smells musty or feels damp or stuffy. [4] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. A dehumidifier is necessary if you have experienced flooding in your home. Use a dehumidifier constantly to help remove excess moisture from the air."

      "content": "Use a dehumidifier in the summer. Humid climates, especially in the summer, can produce uncomfortable conditions and damp-feeling rooms. Using a dehumidifier in the summer will help maintain a more ideal relative humidity level inside your home. A dehumidifier works in tandem with air conditioning units, making your AC work more efficiently and keeping the room more comfortable and cool. This can also potentially result in reduced electricity costs."

      "content": "Use only certain dehumidifiers in cooler weather. Many dehumidifiers, such as compressor dehumidifiers, are not very efficient when the air temperature is lower than about 65 °F (18 °C). Cooler weather increases the possibility of frost build-up on the machine’s coils, interrupting its efficiency and potentially damaging its operation. Desiccant dehumidifiers are effective for cold spaces. If you do need to dehumidify a cold space, you can purchase a dehumidifier specially made for working at lower temperatures."

If your machine does not have this feature, you should make sure that you leave plenty of room around the machine. Do not place it against a wall or furniture. Better air circulation will allow your machine to work more efficiently. Aim for about 6–12 inches (15–30 cm) of airflow space around all sides of your dehumidifier. [7] X Research source"

Periodically check to make sure that the hose hasn’t been moved and still drains properly into the sink. Use twine to secure the hose to the faucet if it doesn’t want to stay put. Keep the hose away from electrical outlets and cords to prevent electric shock. Use the shortest hose possible. Someone might trip over a long hose."

If you are not using a hose to drain the water into a sink, you’ll need to empty the water reservoir tray regularly. The machine should turn off automatically when the tray is full in order to prevent overflow. Unplug your machine before dumping out the water. Monitor your reservoir tray every few hours if it is particularly humid. Check your machine’s manufacturer instructions to determine the approximate frequency for dumping the tray."
