      "content": "Notice dry mouth. Dry mouth is the most common symptom of a blocked salivary duct. It is caused by decreased saliva production made possible by whatever is blocking the duct. Dry mouth is an uncomfortable condition that may lead to dry, cracked lips and bad breath. A key sensation is a bad taste in the mouth. This is one of the first signs of a blocked salivary duct. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep in mind that dry mouth can also be a symptom of many other things, such as certain medications, dehydration, cancer treatment, and tobacco use. Make sure to rule out other possible conditions that can cause dry mouth."

      "content": "Pay attention to pain in the face or mouth. The salivary glands are located in a number of areas in the mouth: under the tongue, inside the cheeks, and at the floor of the mouth. A blockage can cause mild to intense pain in any of those areas, depending on where the duct is located, the size of the stone, and the length of time you’ve been affected by the blockage. The pain may come and go, but typically gets worse as time goes on. [2] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source About 80-90% of salivary gland stones are found in the submandibular gland (underneath the jaw), but it's possible to develop a stone in the parotid (on the sides of the mouth) or sublingual (under the tongue) glands as well since these are the 3 major salivary glands in the body."

      "content": "Look for swelling of the face or neck. When saliva cannot exit a blocked gland, swelling can occur. You may notice swelling below the jaw or ears, depending on which gland is blocked. This swelling may be accompanied by pain in the area, which may make it difficult to eat and drink.

      "content": "Watch for increased pain while eating or drinking. Another main issue that accompanies a blocked salivary duct is difficulty eating and drinking. Some people with this condition experience a sharp or stabbing pain right before or during meals. The pain may be present while chewing or when you open your mouth. You may also have trouble swallowing when a salivary duct is blocked.

      "title": "Be aware of signs of infection.",
      "content": "Be aware of signs of infection. An untreated salivary blockage can cause an infection in the salivary gland. When saliva is trapped in the gland, bacteria are more likely to develop and spread. Signs of infection include redness and pus around the stone. Fever is another sign of infection. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Schedule an appointment with a doctor as soon as you suspect an infection. They can quickly treat it and prescribe antibiotics to clear it up."

      "content": "Drink a lot of water to keep the mouth hydrated. One of the first steps to take if you have a blocked salivary gland is to increase your water intake. Drinking water can help you stay hydrated and increase saliva flow, which may relieve dry mouth. Keep a bottle of water at your side and sip some throughout the day to ensure you stay hydrated. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It is recommended that women drink about 11.5 cups (2.7 L) of fluids per day, while men drink at least 15.5 cups (3.7 L) per day. This depends on your activity level, environment, and weight. If you exercise frequently, live in a hot and humid environment, or are overweight, plan to drink more water.

If you’re experiencing intense pain from a blocked salivary gland, relieve your symptoms with an over-the-counter pain reliever. Some common medications to alleviate pain and inflammation include ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Make sure to follow the instructions when taking these medications so you know when and how often to take it. [9] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Eating something cold such as ice cubes or popsicles can also help to reduce pain and swelling if you don’t have medication at home."

      "content": "Suck on citrus fruits or hard candies to dislodge a stone. A great way to unclog a blocked salivary duct is to suck on something sour, such as a lemon wedge or sour candies. These treats can increase the flow of saliva and gradually dislodge a stone that’s blocking the duct. Make sure to suck on the candy or fruit for as long as possible instead of chewing and swallowing it right away.

      "content": "Massage the salivary gland with your fingers. Another remedy for a blocked salivary gland is to massage the affected area. A gentle massage with the fingers can relieve pain and encourage the stone to pass through the duct. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To correctly perform the massage, locate the exact area where the duct is blocked. It may be in the cheek area right in front of your ear or under the jaw close to your chin. Place your index and middle finger on the area you feel pain or swelling and gently apply pressure as you move them forward along the gland. Massage your salivary gland as many times as you need to until the blocked duct is cleared. Stop the massage if it becomes too painful."

Make a warm compress at home or purchase one at your local drug store. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To make a warm compress, fill a bowl with warm water, making sure it is not too hot. You'll know it's too hot if it is uncomfortable or painful to the touch. Take a clean washcloth and submerge it completely in the water. Then, wring it out until it is just damp. Fold it, put it on the painful area, and leave it on for several minutes. When the washcloth gets cold, repeat this process with a new, clean washcloth and bowl of warm water."

If all attempts to remove the blockage on your own have failed, contact your doctor, especially if you are experiencing a lot of pain. It’s also important to talk to a doctor if you suspect an infection caused by salivary gland stones. If a doctor is unable to remove the stone, they may refer you to the hospital for surgery. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If the blockage is caused by a stone, the doctor may simply massage or press on the stone to remove it from the duct.

      "content": "Consider a sialendoscopy to remove salivary gland stones. A sialendoscopy is a less invasive method of removing salivary gland stones. In this method, an endoscope is inserted into the opening of the duct and a small wire is used to remove the stone. This procedure takes about 30-60 minutes to complete and patients heal and recover very quickly. The only major side effects are pain and swelling of the salivary gland that generally does not last very long. [16] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Your doctor will consider the size, shape, and location of the stone when determining if it can be removed with a sialendoscopy. They are more likely to do this procedure if the stone is small."

      "content": "Undergo surgery to remove large salivary stones. Stones that are smaller than 2 millimetres (0.079 in) are typically removed without surgery. However, stones larger than that are harder to remove and surgery may be the only option. Surgery for salivary stone removal involves making a small incision in the mouth. [17] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Surgery may also be necessary for those who get recurring salivary gland stones."
