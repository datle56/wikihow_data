      "content": "Make your code easy to remember, but hard to decode. One of the most common coding methods is to give each letter of the alphabet a number, A=1, B=2. The problem is it is the most common coding method. Reversing this method and starting with Z=1, Y=2, X=3 may be a better solution, but it is still a very flimsy method of coding. Similarly, writing the words from right to left is also a flimsy method because it only takes a few seconds to figure out that it is written backwards.

      "content": "Give each letter (or certain words) its own corresponding shape. For example, if you wanted to mention shoe, you would instead draw a small square, a textbook could be a square. A table could be a square with three straight lines draw above it. This will make an almost unbreakable code, but it also makes writing, and reading, a very lengthy process. By using this method, you can essentially create your own language of squares, chevrons, lines, circles with boxes inside, etc. and only someone with the decoder sheet would be able to tell what you had written.

      "content": "Give each letter its own corresponding letter; A=Q, B=T, C=R. The problem with this system is that it can easily confuse the writer. Trying to write a T while thinking of a B is contrary to the way our brains are designed to perform. [3] X Research source"
