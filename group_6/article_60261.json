Otherwise, you'll be queued up with them. You can sit out in Fortnite and spectate, but you'll need to keep joining back as a spectator after each match ends; Fortnite won't move you automatically.

You can't spectate friends when they're still on the bus . If the button still doesn't light up, or you don't see it, open your Social tab, select your friend, and then select Watch Game ."

Select Spectate to spectate the player who dealt the final blow. You can spectate until that player is eliminated or wins the match. To switch to another active player, select Next Player or Previous Player at the bottom of the screen."

If you're spectating a friend from outside of the match, you can only watch. After being eliminated, make the most of spectating by keeping an eye on the map and pinging landmarks or loot as needed, switch between your other team member's POV, and make verbal callouts to help your team win ."
