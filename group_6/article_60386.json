      "title": "Stand still with your arms relaxed at your sides.",
      "content": "Stand still with your arms relaxed at your sides. Do not wave your arms or hands around, as this can be seen as aggressive by the dog. Clench your fingers together into loose fists and keep your arms at your sides. Plant your feet hip width apart and stand still. Do not try to touch or pat the dog, as this can be interpreted as aggressive. Never reach out to touch a dog you do not know."

This will let it know you are not a threat."

      "content": "Allow it to sniff you. If the dog gets close to you and does not display signs of aggression like growling, crouching, or barking, allow it to sniff your legs or waist. Stay still as it sniffs you. Once it smells you, it may determine you are not a threat and move away from you. If you are not comfortable letting the dog sniff you, move away from the dog safely and slowly so neither of you are in danger."
