Test the water with your hand first to make sure it’s right around room temp. Using water from the sink or shower is a great way to remove foreign objects from your eye. Not only is it simple and readily available, but the steady stream of water helps push objects out quickly. If you’re out and about, you can also rinse your eyes with a bottle of water. Simply hold the bottle slightly above your eyes and pour the water gently."
