      "title": "Replace the \"t\" sound with a glottal stop.",
      "content": "Replace the \"t\" sound with a glottal stop. A glottal stop is something like a pause, which you make by closing the airflow from your throat (glottis) so that no air is being released at all. In practice, this basically sounds like a short, sharp break in the middle or at the end of a word, wherever the \"t\" sound is found. [1] X Research source For example, the word \"Scottish\" would be pronounced \"Sco'ish\" and the word \"fought\" would be pronounced \"fough'.\" You can hear the glottal stop better in a full sentence: \"Me 'n' me mates fough' down the pub.\" (\"My friends and I fought [while we were] down at the pub.\" Cockney speakers sometimes do this with \"p\" or \"k\" sounds as well, if they occur as the last letter of the word, although this pronunciation isn't common in 21st-century Cockney. [2] X Research source Some Cockney speakers also replace the \"t\" with either a \"d\" or an \"r,\" depending on the letter's location in the word and the other letters surrounding it."

      "content": "Drop the \"h\" when it's the first letter of a word. If you've ever seen My Fair Lady , you're likely already familiar with this aspect of Cockney pronunciation. French does this too, although it's much more formalized in that language. [3] X Research source For example, you'd pronounce \"horse\" as \"'orse\" or \"hopefully\" as \"'opefully.\""

      "title": "Add an \"h\" to the beginning of words that start with a vowel.",
      "content": "Add an \"h\" to the beginning of words that start with a vowel. This might seem a bit odd, since dropping an initial \"h\" means that the word now effectively starts with a vowel, but this is a pronunciation feature for many Cockney speakers. This rule applies generally to any word that begins with a vowel in standard British English, or Received Pronunciation (RP). [4] X Research source For example, you would say \"hair\" instead of \"air\" or \"hatmosphere\" instead of \"atmosphere.\""

      "title": "Replace the \"th\" sound with an \"f,\" \"d,\" or \"v\" sound.",
      "content": "Replace the \"th\" sound with an \"f,\" \"d,\" or \"v\" sound. The \"th\" sound can be changed to \"f\" regardless of where it occurs, but usually becomes a \"v\" sound when it occurs in the middle of a word. A \"th\" sound at the beginning of a word might also be replaced by a \"d,\" as when \"this and that\" becomes \"dis 'n' dat.\" Some of these words can be shortened even further, such as \"bruv\" for \"brother\" or \"guv\" for \"governor.\" [5] X Research source \"Th\" as \"f\" examples: fought (thought), fink (think), firsty (thirsty) \"Th\" as \"v\" examples: norvern (northern), bruver (brother), bover (bother)"

      "title": "Use a vowel sound for an \"l\" at the end of a word or syllable.",
      "content": "Use a vowel sound for an \"l\" at the end of a word or syllable. This \"l\" sounds much different (and is formed in the mouth differently) than the \"l\" at the beginning of a word, such as in the word \"light.\" Think of the difference between saying \"la la la\" and saying \"ell.\" In the Cockney accent, it's realized more as a \"w\"—sounding almost like a small child who's still working on pronouncing words correctly. Here are some examples: [6] X Research source Troubow (trouble) Pow (pal) Alright (owright) Milk (miwk)"

      "content": "Drop the \"g\" at the end of words ending in \"ing.\" Cockney shares this feature with many other English dialects and accents and it's a really easy way to make your speech sound more Cockney. For example, you would pronounce \"laughing\" as \"laughin'\" or \"starting\" as \"startin'.\" [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Pronounce an \"ou\" or \"ow\" at the end of a word as a schwa sound. Linguists refer to this as a \"weakening\" of the vowel and it's a really easy adjustment to make if you want your accent to sound more Cockney. For example, instead of saying \"window,\" you would say \"winduh\" and instead of \"you,\" you'd say \"yuh.\" [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a long \"e\" sound for the \"y\" in words such as \"city.\" In standard British English, you pronounce this \"y\" at the end of words with more of an \"eh\" sound. With the Cockney accent, however, it's a strong \"ee\" sound, so the word \"city\" sounds like \"sitee\" rather than \"siteh.\" [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Add \"innit\" to the end of your sentences as a tag question.",
      "content": "Add \"innit\" to the end of your sentences as a tag question. Speakers use a tag question when they're looking for agreement from the person they're speaking to—like if you added \"right\" to the end of a sentence. \"Innit\" is short for \"isn't it,\" but in Cockney slang, it's used regardless of the subject of the sentence, so it could mean any pronoun combined with verbs such as \"to do\" or \"to be.\" [10] X Research source For example, you might say, \"West Ham really put it to Arsenal, innit?\" (\"West Ham really put it to Arsenal, didn't they?\") While this phrase has become pretty standard British slang in many dialects, it started with Cockney."

The word \"ain't\" is typically used as a contraction for \"is not\" or \"are not,\" and appears in many different English dialects. Cockney speakers also use it in place of \"have not.\" [12] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I ain't seen 'im.\" (\"I haven't seen him.\") The word \"ain't\" has been a part of the English language since the 1700s and is entirely grammatical, although it's considered nonstandard and likely wouldn't fly in more formal writing.

      "content": "Substitute the word \"never\" for the word \"ever.\" This particular bit of Cockney grammar is something that can be confusing to those who are unfamiliar with the dialect because at first glance it sounds like you're saying the opposite of what you intend. But this is a common feature that Cockney speakers will understand instantly. [14] X Research source For example, you might say, \"That's the biggest fish I never seen.\" (\"That's the biggest fish I've ever seen.\") You could also use something like, \"I could stay down the pub for never.\" (\"I could stay down at the pub forever.\")"

If you listen to a Cockney speaker, you'll quickly notice that the more adamant they are about something, the more negations they seem to cram into a sentence.

      "content": "Omit helping prepositions such as \"of\" or \"to\" in prepositional phrases. In a phrase with 2 prepositions, Cockney speakers tend to leave out the second one entirely. This sometimes results in casual phrases you might be familiar with in other dialects, such as \"out the window\" (\"out [of] the window\").

      "content": "Take a phrase where the last word rhymes with the word you want to use. Cockney rhyming slang typically uses a phrase of a couple of words (although it can be just one word) in which the last word rhymes with the word you really mean to say. These rhymes are often used in place of things you might not want to say directly in public, although they can be used for more run-of-the-mill things as well. Here are some examples: [18] X Research source Apples and pears = stairs (\"Blimey, I have to climb 4 flights of apples and pears just to reach me flat!\") Adam and Eve = believe (\"Can yuh Adam and Eve it?!\") Barney Rubble = trouble (\"Mate, you're about to get in Barney Rubble for that one!\") nuclear sub = pub (\"Fancy a few beers down the nuclear sub?\") dog and bone = phone (\"Is dat de dog and bone ringin'?\")"

      "content": "Say only the first word of the phrase in place of your target word. In practice, true Cockneys don't normally say the whole rhyming phrase (that would make it too obvious!)—they say only the first word, the one that doesn't rhyme.

      "content": "Cockney has been spoken since the 16th century. This old dialect of English is associated with working-class Londoners who were born \"within the sound of Bow bells,\" which refers to the bells of the church of Saint Mary le Bow in Cheapside, London. In the 21st century, Cockney is associated with the entire East End of London. [21] X Research source The word \"cockney\" might refer to a \"cock's egg,\" although it has several other definitions in English (none of them favorable). Cockney speech became popular in the 19th century, particularly through the works of Charles Dickens."
