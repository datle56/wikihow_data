      "content": "Note details at the top of your paper. Keep your notes organized by writing important details at the top of each page.

      "title": "Use your own language.",
      "content": "Use your own language. Write down key facts, ideas, and details in your own words. Avoid noting anything in the text verbatim, or word for word, unless it is a phrase or quote you may later use. Taking notes in your own words actively engages your brain, helps you better understand the text, makes you more likely to retain the information, and may minimize the risk of plagiarism. [2] X Research source Develop your own system of signs and abbreviations that can help you more quickly take notes and review them. For example, “SM” for “scientific method,” or “GH” for “gender history.”"

      "title": "Write keywords instead of full sentences.",
      "content": "Write keywords instead of full sentences. Think about the text you’re reading or the lecture you’re listening to—they may be a bit dense and hard to understand. Avoid using these models when you write your notes. Instead, use keywords to say the same things in a short and manageable way that you can easily and quickly review later. [3] X Research source For example, for obstetrics, you might note words such as midwife, placental abruption, childbed fever, and preeclampsia."

      "title": "Skip lines on the paper for later review.",
      "content": "Skip lines on the paper for later review. As you write your keywords and ideas down, leave space between each line. Having extra room allows you to make additional notes or clarify points that you may not understand. This helps you quickly have and identify all of the relevant material to that keyword or thought.

Then take your notes in the following columns: [8] X Research source Note-taking section: Use this largest section to write down the main ideas of the lecture or text. Leave room for later notes or questions. Be sure to note any guiding material related to this section.

Use thicker lines to indicate main points and write a brief keyword or two that summarize supporting information to the topic. Finally, add shorter and thinner lines for supporting details.

      "content": "Underline key ideas. Most texts will have central arguments and ideas they want to convey. Note any key ideas you find with a short phrase or sentence. Highlighting these key ideas—in your own words— can ensure you have all of the important information about the text. [17] X Research source In addition to underlining the key ideas in your notes, you can also literally underline or highlight them with your pen or pencil in the text. Make sure to write down the exact page in your notes so you can refer back to the original text. For example, “fall of the Weimar Republic,” is much more manageable than, “The overall conditions that led to the Nazi takeover of power in January of 1933 were a product of interwar intrigue that ultimately damned the young republic.”"
