      "content": "Sarcasm and irony: Dry humor is great, but it’s sometimes hard to pick up on in a text. To avoid any miscommunication, some people use the 🙃 as a tone indicator to show that they aren’t being serious. It’s a sleeker, less awkward alternative to the backslash tone indicators that some people end their messages with, like “/s” and “/j.” [1] X Research source"
