      "content": "Wagwan is an informal greeting that means “What’s going on?” Wagwan is a slang term used in Multicultural London English (MLE), a social dialect used by young Londoners with roots in Jamaican patois (Jamaican creole). It’s a casual greeting in youth and street culture and is interchangeable with phrases like “What’s up?” “What’s new?” or “How’s it going?” Since it’s so informal, “wagwan” is mostly used among friends and acquaintances. [1] X Research source You might walk up to a friend and say, “Wagwan, brother?! What’s good?” You could approach an acquaintance with, “I remember you from Tina’s party. Wagwan?” You might greet someone you haven't seen in a while with, \"Wagwan, Burton? It's good to see you again!\""

      "content": "Use wagwan to say hello to friends or acquaintances in casual settings. Since wagwan is very informal and has roots in youth and street culture, it's not something you would use in a formal setting or say to someone much older than you. Stick to using the term with other young people who you consider to be friends or acquaintances. Anytime you want to say a casual hello, you can insert wagwan instead–essentially, you’re saying, “What’s up?” For example: ”Wagwan, fam. Are you ready to go?” ”Wagwan, blud, how have you been?” ”Yo Jake, wagwan? It’s been a minute.”"

      "content": "Anyone can use wagwan, but it may come off as inappropriate in some cases. “Wagwan” is derived from Jamaican English and mostly used by working class youth in London, but most agree that just saying the term is not considered cultural appropriation. Some people do think it’s a bit “try-hard” for a person completely outside of working class or street culture to say it, though. Also, since it’s so informal, it’s pretty much never appropriate to say in formal situations by anyone. For example, if an upper middle class middle-aged white male greeted a group of younger folks on the street with, “Wagwan,” they would probably think it was a bit weird. Or, if a young person showed up to a job interview and greeted the interviewer with “Wagwan,” they probably wouldn’t seem very professional. At the end of the day, “wagwan” simply means “what’s going on?” and anyone can say that. As with all things, though, context and intention are key."
