      "title": "In dating, NSA stands for “no strings attached.”",
      "content": "In dating, NSA stands for “no strings attached.” A no strings attached arrangement means that there are no commitments, requirements, or responsibilities for either partner in the relationship. Basically, you get to have sex without all of that dating and courting business. If you see someone looking for an NSA arrangement, they are likely looking for something physical that isn’t all that emotionally serious. [1] X Research source You will often find “NSA” referenced in dating profiles on Tinder, Grindr, or classified sites. Someone might mention that they’re “looking for an NSA hookup” or, “only interested in NSA.” Some NSA arrangements are long-term, while some NSA meetups are strictly one-night stands. There is usually an implication that privacy and discretion will be respected when engaging in an NSA hookup. You should be careful while making your profile and putting pictures while dating online. [2] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source For example, do not put pictures that show you wearing tons of makeup, drinking with girls, or showing too much skin. There are plenty of predatory men who use online dating sites to get sex from women. They may see the pictures and think that you are not smart enough because you are putting such pictures online, and they can get you.

      "content": "You don’t have to commit to anything serious. Relationships can be messy, and there’s no doubt that they come with all kinds of headaches. You have to spend money on dates, put effort into wooing your partner, and take the time to communicate and connect. With an NSA arrangement, there’s no expectation that you have to do any of that stuff; it’s just hookup and go home! [4] X Research source"

      "title": "You can have fun and fulfill your physical needs.",
      "content": "You can have fun and fulfill your physical needs. We’re not telling you anything you don’t know when we say sex is a good time. An NSA arrangement is strictly about physical intimacy, so you can let loose and get down at your own leisure. [5] X Research source Just make sure that you’re comfortable with the person you’re sleeping with. NSA doesn’t mean you can’t say “no,” so don’t let anyone pressure you into doing something you don’t want to."

      "title": "You get to pursue other partners.",
      "content": "You get to pursue other partners. With an NSA hookup, you’re still free to go out and look for Mr. or Ms. Right. There’s no reason you have to stay abstinent while you’re on the hunt for your soulmate! Alternatively, you can just hookup with multiple partners and stay single for as long as you want. All is fair when it comes to what the heart wants. [6] X Research source If you’re taking a break from dating, NSA can be a great way to still get out every now and then and get your rocks off."

      "title": "You can leave whenever you want without feeling guilty.",
      "content": "You can leave whenever you want without feeling guilty. There’s no expectation of a long-term commitment with an NSA relationship. If you ever want to cut ties with the person you’re seeing, simply let them know you’re no longer interested and move on—there shouldn’t be any hard feelings. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "You might catch feelings.",
      "content": "You might catch feelings. It’s easy to say that you’re going to sleep with someone and never fall for them, but it’s actually super difficult for a lot of people. There’s always going to be a risk that you start falling for someone you’re intimate with. The kicker here is that you’ve got an agreement that nothing serious will happen between you two. This can be difficult to handle on an emotional level. [8] X Research source Some people like to say that they can have sex without attaching any emotional weight to it, but your brain actually releases oxytocin—the hormone responsible for emotional attachment—when you’re physically intimate with someone.

      "title": "The person you’re sleeping with may become attached.",
      "content": "The person you’re sleeping with may become attached. In the same way you might catch feelings, the person you’re seeing can fall for you. When this happens, you may end up with someone who can’t take a hint. If things get ugly, you may have to block a phone number, stop going to your regular hangout, or deal with an obnoxious guy/gal who can’t leave you alone. [10] X Research source This is why a lot of people don’t invite their NSA partners to their home. It can be a little dicey to invite someone who’s barely a step above a stranger into your personal space."

      "content": "It can be risky to sleep with people you don’t know very well. There’s no doubt that there are some creeps out there. While there’s nothing wrong with casual sex, you are taking some chances when you sleep with someone. You could catch an STD, or be unknowingly meeting up with a dangerous person. Always screen your partners carefully and meet them in a public place before you take them to bed. [11] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Always use protection. It’s extremely important to use condoms if you’re sleeping with someone you don’t know very well. Let a friend know when and where you’re going to meet up with your partner."

      "content": "FWB: friends with benefits. A friend with benefits is someone you sleep with without dating. This might sound like the same thing as an NSA arrangement, but the word “friend” is pretty key in “friends with benefits.” People typically know their FWB partner for a good chunk of time before they start sleeping them, so the dynamic can be a little more intimate .

They may have an open relationship with their husband or wife, or they may be trying to start an affair (it’s usually the former if they’re advertising it online). [13] X Research source If someone mentions that they have an MBA or they put an MBA after their name, they probably just mean that they went to business school. MBA can also stand for master of business administration!"
