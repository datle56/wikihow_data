      "title": "Comment on the silence to draw her attention to it.",
      "content": "Comment on the silence to draw her attention to it. Instead of making her feel bad for not replying, mention something silly about what you said. That way, you make light of the situation rather than sounding like you’re upset about it. “I must have taken the words out of your mouth!” “It’s okay, I wouldn’t know how to respond to me either haha”"

      "title": "Making fun of yourself makes your teasing sound less harsh.",
      "content": "Making fun of yourself makes your teasing sound less harsh. This is a good idea if you read the last text you sent and realize the girl didn’t have a lot to work with. Instead of teasing her about not replying, joke around and blame yourself for stalling the convo. She might have just been confused about what to say, or she could have been waiting for a different topic. “You can admit it. Even I know that was a boring text to reply to 😛” “LOL I expected you to reply to that?? We can move on if you want to.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "She’ll get that you’re excited to chat with her and learn more.",
      "content": "She’ll get that you’re excited to chat with her and learn more. Joke around about what you expect from her message since it’s taken so long for her to write. Even though you don’t really want a really long reply, you hint that you’re still ready to have a quality conversation with her. “Your thumbs must be tired from writing such a long reply!” “Wow, I can’t wait to read the novel you’re about to send me 😝”"

    {
      "title": "A little sass will make her laugh and show off your sense of humor.",
      "content": "A little sass will make her laugh and show off your sense of humor. If you want a speedy reply, poke fun at how long it’s taking her with a sarcastic comment. Since sarcasm is a little tough to read in a text, follow it up with some laughter or an emoji so she understands you’re only joking. [1] X Research source “Wow, just when I thought I was a slow texter, you came along 😜” “It’s not a race! You can take your time hahaha.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Saying something exaggerated lets her know you’re only joking.",
      "content": "Saying something exaggerated lets her know you’re only joking. If you mention an insane hypothetical situation, you’re probably going to make her laugh and get her attention back. When your text sounds unbelievable, she’ll get that you’re just having fun. [2] X Research source “FYI I just finished reading all the Harry Potter books since my last text 😂” “Julie always texts back, so who are you and what did you do with the real Julie?”"

    {
      "title": "You won’t make her feel bad if you just assume she fell asleep.",
      "content": "You won’t make her feel bad if you just assume she fell asleep. If you’re texting late at night, you can’t be sure if she left you on read or just went to bed. Sending a goodnight text also sounds sweet and caring, plus your message won’t read like you’re upset at her for not texting you back. You can always pick up your conversation right where you left off once you both wake up. “Aw someone couldn’t stay up 🤣I better hear from you in the morning!” “I get it, sleep is more important than me 😜”"

      "title": "Give off a fun and flirty vibe to make her feel more comfortable.",
      "content": "Give off a fun and flirty vibe to make her feel more comfortable. If you just started chatting, there’s a chance she’s a little nervous chatting with you. Reassure her that you’re excited to talk with her and that she has nothing to worry about. Add an emoji to your message so she doesn’t think you’re being too aggressive. “I’m not that scary to talk to, am I? 😂” “Do you believe in second chances? Because I’m using mine right now with this message haha.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make her curious by playing a little hard to get.",
      "content": "Make her curious by playing a little hard to get. Even if you’re really excited to talk to the girl, make it sound like you’re keeping a secret from her. Since she’ll probably be more interested and want to know what you’re hiding from her, she’ll try to text you again to ask about it. “Wow, I had a craaazy story for you, but I guess you don’t want to know 😉” “I’m surprised you don’t want to hear the details because they’re really juicy.”"

      "content": "If you aren’t sure what to say, a GIF or meme can make her laugh. You can find a ton of relatable memes and GIFs about someone not responding online. If you want to go for something simple, you might send a GIF of someone staring at the clock or obsessively checking their phone to get your point across. You could send a GIF of someone falling asleep and say something like, “This is going to be me if you keep me waiting 😂”"

      "content": "You could accidentally offend her if your texts come across as pushy. Teasing can be pretty tough to read over text, so it might make a girl upset if you push it too far. Rather than acting passive-aggressive or upset that she hasn’t replied yet, stay kind and only make jokey responses. Add emojis or write “haha,” “LOL,” or “lmao” to show that you’re laughing and still having fun. [3] X Research source"

If she’s not responding or only sending you one-word replies, it might mean that she's not super interested in chatting.
