      "content": "Dynamic Island is essentially an information hub. It was introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, and is a black, pill-shaped cutout at the top of the phone's screen. Various alerts are displayed in Dynamic Island, including outputs from your current activities and background activities. Dynamic Island replaces the notch used in previous iPhone generations. The notch previously housed the phone's front-facing camera, but didn't have much function beyond that. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus do not have Dynamic Island. These models have the same notch that was present in previous models of the iPhone. It isn't possible to disable Dynamic Island as it's used in many iPhone 14 functions. However, you can collapse Dynamic Island background activities by swiping from the left or right of the island to the center. [1] X Research source"
