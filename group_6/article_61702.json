When the lever locks into place, a flashing left arrow will blink on your dashboard. The signal makes a ticking sound that clicks in time with the flashing light to indicate that the signal is operating properly. [3] X Research source Keep your right hand on the wheel while flicking the signal lever down with your left hand. Usually, you can flick the lever down with a finger so you don’t have to fully let go of the wheel. If your car blinkers aren’t working properly, use a hand turn signal to alert other drivers. Roll down your window and hold your left arm straight out horizontally. [4] X Trustworthy Source State of Oregon Official website for the State of Oregon Go to source"

Leaving your turn signal on after finishing your turn can confuse other drivers who are expecting you to make a turn."

To move into the left lane, push your turn signal lever down. [9] X Research source When the lane is all clear, turn your wheel slightly toward the lane. Once you’re completely within the boundaries of the lane, move your left hand to your turn signal lever and switch it off. Avoid crossing multiple lanes of traffic after only activating the turn signal once. Instead, wait for about 5 seconds in your new lane so the next lane knows you’re planning to merge."
