      "title": "Understand Solver's use.",
      "content": "Understand Solver's use. Solver can analyze your spreadsheet's data and any constraints you've added to show you possible solutions. This is useful if you're working with multiple variables."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add your data to your spreadsheet.",
      "content": "Add your data to your spreadsheet. In order to use Solver, your spreadsheet must have data with different variables and a solution. For example, you might create a spreadsheet documenting your various expenses over the course of a month with the output cell resulting in your money left over. You can't use solver on a spreadsheet which doesn't have solvable data (i.e., your data has to have equations)."

      "title": "Select your target cell.",
      "content": "Select your target cell. Click the cell in which you want to display your Solver solution. This will add it to the \"Set Objective\" box. For example, if you're creating a budget where the end goal is your monthly income, you would click the final \"Income\" cell."

      "title": "Set a goal.",

For example, if your goal is to have $200 at the end of the month, you would type 200 into the text box. You can also check either the \"Max\" or \"Min\" box in order to prompt Solver to determine the absolute maximum or minimum value. Once you've set a goal, Solver will attempt to meet that goal by adjusting other variables in your spreadsheet."

    {
      "title": "Add constraints.",

You can add a constraint by doing the following: [2] X Research source Click Add Click the cell (or select the cells) for which the constraint applies. Select a type of constraint from the middle drop-down menu. Enter the constraint's number (e.g., a maximum or minimum). Click OK"
