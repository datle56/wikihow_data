They might use guilt (“but we’ve known each other online for so long!”) or even pity (“I have no money to feed my family”), but you’ll never know if what they’re saying is true. You should never give out any personal info online, and you should only send money to the people you know, not ones you’ve met over the internet. [1] X Research source Some people will spend weeks (or even months) getting to know you over the internet before they ask for money. Just because you think you know someone online doesn’t necessarily mean you know who they are in real life, so always be cautious. Be especially wary of scammers asking for your money when you’re online dating or looking for a sugar momma or daddy relationship. Reader Poll: We asked 539 wikiHow readers, and 64% of them agreed that constantly asking for financial support would make them doubt if a sugar momma is actually wealthy. [Take Poll]"

If an account asks you to send explicit messages or photos to them, be very cautious, and never send anything you wouldn’t want your friends and family members to see. Accounts will sometimes make you pay money to them so they don’t send the pictures and videos to your close contacts. [2] X Research source People might also try to use your explicit photos to get you to send them more images. If you’re being extorted, tell a trusted adult right away, or report it to the police."

      "content": "Unfortunately, some people lie to make themselves look better on the internet. If you’re online dating, you can’t quite trust everything someone’s profile says—maybe they exaggerated about how good their job is, or perhaps they’re using pictures of themselves from 10 years ago. You can avoid liars by doing a little sleuthing on your own: try googling their name or finding their social media profiles to see if what they’re presenting is really true. [3] X Research source More insidious people will lie to get personal information about you online. That’s why you should never give out your full name, address, or any financial info to someone you don’t know."

These people, called catfishers, will create online profiles and befriend you while using fake pictures and information. They might do this because they have low self-esteem, or they might do it just to trick people online. You should always try to do a little background checking on the person you’re talking to, just to make sure they’re a real person. [4] X Research source If you ask to talk to them over the phone or on video chat and they refuse, that’s a red flag. It could be a sign that their pictures and who they are don’t match up."

They might also try to get you to tell them your personal passwords or your bank account information. Never give this info out online, and always block anyone who is trying way too hard to glean this info from you. Sometimes, thieves will get your bank account information by saying they want to send you money. Instead, they’ll use your info to wire themselves a large amount and then block you online."

If you’ve been talking to someone for a while and you all of the sudden can’t get ahold of them, that’s called being ghosted. You might reach out for multiple days (through multiple avenues), and still get no answer. This can be really disheartening, and it can be tough to move on from relationships where you get ghosted. [6] X Research source People ghost others for a lot of reasons: maybe they wanted to break off your relationship and they didn’t want to upset you, maybe they had to delete their accounts, or maybe they were lying about who they really were. Getting over being ghosted can be hard, but the best thing you can do is move on."
