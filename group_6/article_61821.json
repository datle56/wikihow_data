      "title": "Select your Marksman.",
      "content": "Select your Marksman. ADCs can sometimes be reliable in any situation, but in Draft Banning, it’s not common to see heroes banned in this category (Wanwan and Granger). Also, you can tell if they’ll use the 1-3-1 situation, which doesn’t require a Marksman. If you rely on faster attack speed, use Kimmy, Hanabi, or Karrie. If you are needing higher damage from critical items (Berseker's Fury), use Lesley, Granger, Irithel, or Yi Sun-Shin. If you rely on Crowd Control, use Moskov, Bruno, Clint, and Popol and Kupa. If this doesn't apply to any of them, try to look at the Meta and see what's more popular."

      "title": "Check the laning opportunity first.",
      "content": "Check the laning opportunity first. The side lanes can carry opportunities for heroes. The EXP carries quick leveling up, and the Gold carries money for your equipment. According to the game, you should go to the Gold Lane when the Red Buff is near. If this isn't applicable, try to handle a certain lane."

    {
      "title": "Clear Minion waves and push.",
      "content": "Clear Minion waves and push. Enemy minions can block your way into destroying a turret. In the first 3:30 minutes of the game, the outer turrets show a shield, which takes a long time to push. However, you can gain a bit of gold each hit from the ally minions, which can help more! Focus on the enemies Siege/Cannon minion. This is especially for the Marksman since you'll need a little boost in the game! When pushing after the first 3:30 minutes of the game, you should be careful and check the mini-map if any enemies are approaching near the turret. Also, be aware of the turret warnings said by the announcer and clear them as well."

      "title": "Initiate a team fight.",
      "content": "Initiate a team fight. This is an important factor for heroes such as Wanwan, Hanabi, Karrie, and Popol and Kupa since they have skills that can make enemies retreat quickly. You should be wary of the surroundings and let your Tank check the bushes for any quick ganking. On the early game, team fights should be handled by someone else due to low mobility and durability. Remember that assisting and doing your own kills can earn you valuable gold, so take advantage of ganking well!"

      "title": "Rely on your tank.",
      "content": "Rely on your tank. Tanks can buy their own Roaming Equipment so you can level up quicker in the game. Also, you should try to lure them into your side for the first few minutes of the game so you can avoid feeding."

      "title": "Upgrade your Marksman emblem",
      "content": "Upgrade your Marksman emblem . Many heroes may need a tune-up in the game, so this can help on most. Focus on getting more sections for different heroes! For the third section, you will unlock Weakness Finder. Enemies hit with your basic attack have a 20% chance to reduce their movement speed by 90% and their attack speed by 50% for 0.5 seconds."
