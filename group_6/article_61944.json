      "content": "Choose a location. If you have a very small dog, you can bathe him in a laundry or kitchen sink. You can bathe larger dogs in showers or bathtubs. If it’s not too cold outside, you can even bathe your dog outside. If you bathe your dog in a bathtub or sink, the bottom will get slippery when it’s wet. To help calm your dog and give him traction, put a towel on the bottom of the tub or sink. You can also use a rubber bath mat or nonslip adhesive pads. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Choose a confined location, if possible. Your dog may get anxious or upset during his bath and try to escape. Shut the bathroom door if you use the bathtub. If you’re washing your dog outside, make sure to do it in a fenced area so your dog can’t run away.

Make sure to remove any tangles or matted areas. If your dog has any ticks, you may want to see a vet to get them removed. Or you can remove it yourself . If your dog has sticky substances (e.g., paint, tar, pine sap) stuck in his fur, rub them with petroleum jelly or vegetable oil and let it sit for 24 hours. A liquid dish soap may also do the trick."

      "content": "Gather all the supplies you’ll need. Once you start the washing process, you’ll want to have everything you need close to hand. You will need towels, cotton balls, dog shampoo, treats, and a washcloth or sponge. If you don’t have a hose or detachable showerhead, you will need a bucket or other vessel for rinsing. Uncap your shampoos and other bottles so that you don’t have to do that while keeping a wet dog in check. If your dog tends to be nervous in the bath, you may want to have a helper. The helper can help keep your dog steady while you wash him."

      "content": "Get the temperature right. Dogs are sensitive to hot water just like you are. Check the water temperature before you bathe your dog. It should be warm, but not hot. Water that’s too cold can give your dog a chill, which is especially dangerous for puppies. If you’re bathing in a sink or tub, fill it to about your dog’s knees with warm water."

Instead, wet him from the neck back. Make sure his coat is fully saturated. This can take awhile for dogs with especially thick coats. If you have a hose or detachable showerhead, use it to spray your dog. Make sure the water pressure isn’t too high, or it could startle him. If you use a bucket or pitcher to wet your dog, make sure to avoid pouring water over his head.

      "title": "Apply the shampoo.",
      "content": "Apply the shampoo. If your dog’s coat is very thick or long, you may want to pre-mix some shampoo with water in a small cup. This will help you get an even lather throughout his coat. For dogs with short coats, just pour a strip of shampoo down the body. Massage the shampoo into his coat. You do not need to use a washcloth or sponge to apply the shampoo. In fact, it’s a better idea to use your hands as you lather up the shampoo. This way, you can check his body for any unusual signs, such as bumps or inflammation. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Do not apply shampoo to your dog’s head or face. If his face is dirty, use a damp washcloth to gently wipe away any dirt.

Don’t clean inside his ears with a washcloth; this can get the ears too wet and promote infection. Some dogs have a skin infection on their chins called furunculosis, which looks like small pimples or red bumps. If your dog has this condition, you should consult with your vet to see how to properly clean the area. Your vet may suggest a disinfecting shampoo or ointment. If your dog has folds in his facial skin, make sure to use the washcloth to clean in between them."

[11] X Research source Lay the towel over your dog's back and pat him dry. Don’t rub the towel, as this can cause matting in long-haired breeds. Remember that your dog’s natural instinct will be to shake himself dry, so be prepared for some splattering. [12] X Research source Some people may use hair dryers to dry their dog’s fur. Keep the heat setting on low or cool to avoid burning your dog. Never point a hair dryer at your dog’s face.#Comb out your dog’s coat. If your dog has very long or shaggy fur, you will want to comb it out while it’s wet to avoid it tangling. You can use a detangling mist to help this process."

      "title": "Clean your dog’s ears.",
      "content": "Clean your dog’s ears. Remove the cotton balls from your dog’s ears. You should clean his ears of excessive earwax to help avoid irritation or infection. You can use a specially formulated ear rinse such as Vetericyn Ear Rinse. You can also use witch hazel, hydrogen peroxide, or a mixture of equal parts organic apple cider vinegar and purified water. Apply some of the ear cleaner on a cotton ball. Do not use cotton swabs. You could damage your dog’s eardrums if you insert them too far. Rub the cotton ball around the inside of the ear. Check the cotton ball for waxy residue. Once you don’t see any more residue on the cotton ball, your dog’s ears are clean. You can also use a soaked cotton ball to clean the dog’s outer ears (the large flappy bits are called the pinna ). Try not to pour or spray the solution directly into the dog’s ears. Many dogs don’t like this, and you want to avoid as many negative associations with bathtime as possible. If your dog has hairs growing from his ear canal, consult your vet. Some breeds can develop tangled ear hair, which can lead to ear infections.

      "title": "Clean off tear buildup.",
      "content": "Clean off tear buildup. Some dogs have a condition called epiphora, which occurs when your dog’s tears overflow onto his face. [15] X Research source This is very common in brachycephalic breeds such as many terriers and chihuahuas. Colloidal silver is commonly recommended, as it is safe to use around the eyes. It comes in spray or liquid drops form. Apply colloidal silver to a clean cotton ball and wipe your pet’s eyes. Dabbing a bit of coconut oil beneath the eyes where the tear stain “tracks” are can help keep the skin from getting irritated. Many pet supply stores sell tear stain cleansers and even pre-saturated pads. These can be easy to use. Just make sure that the product is marked hypoallergenic and that it doesn’t contain the substance tylosin tartrate. This antibiotic is not approved for use on dogs or cats. Some breeds, such as poodles and shih-tzus, have a condition called distichiasis, where their eyelashes grow inward rather than outward. This can cause eye irritation and excessive tearing. If you notice that your dog has frequent tear buildup, consult with your vet. It may be nothing more than a result of his facial shape, but it is always better to be safe. [16] X Research source Do not use hydrogen peroxide, apple cider vinegar, makeup remover, human eye drops, or milk of magnesia to clean your dog’s eyes."

      "title": "Choose the right shampoo.",
      "content": "Choose the right shampoo. A mild shampoo formulated for dogs is the best idea. Look for a shampoo that has a neutral pH balance, around 7. Avoid artificial fragrances and colors, as these can also irritate your dog’s skin. [20] X Research source You should never use human shampoo to wash your dog. Dogs’ skin has a different pH balance than human skin, and human shampoo can disrupt that balance. Disrupted pH balance can foster bacteria, parasites, and viruses. [21] X Research source Oatmeal shampoo is a good basic choice for most dogs. If you're not sure what to use, it's a safe shampoo to start with. If your dog has a skin rash or other condition, he will often scratch, which will further irritate his skin. Tea tree shampoo can be helpful for some skin irritations. Avoid getting the shampoo into his mouth, as tea tree oil is toxic when consumed. Consult with your vet to determine what shampoo to use for a dog with skin conditions. Some shampoos can help prevent flea infestations. Look for shampoos containing pyrethrin, pyrethrum, or citrus oil."

Some dog groomers offer to “express,” or squeeze, the anal sacs during cleaning. If your vet approves and you know how to do it safely, it's okay to try doing so at this point. Otherwise, leave them alone. If your dog has inflamed or irritated anal sacs, consult your vet. [22] X Research source"

You can help him learn to associate baths with positive experiences with a few simple tricks. [23] X Research source If your dog is terrified of the bath, place your dog in an empty tub (or wherever you wash your dog). Don’t run water yet.
