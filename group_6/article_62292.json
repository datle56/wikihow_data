      "content": "Flush down some active dry yeast to feed the beneficial bacteria. Naturally-occurring bacteria are essential to breaking down solids in a septic tank. Adding yeast (a bacteria) and sugar (a bacteria food source) every 3 months or so can help maintain your septic tank’s bacteria count. Here’s the “recipe” for this treatment: [1] X Research source Dissolve 3 Tbsp (18 g) of active dry yeast and 2 c (400 g) of brown sugar in 5 c (1.2 L) of warm water. Flush the dissolved mixture down your toilet at a time when you’ll have limited water usage for at least 3 hours afterward. (For instance, do it before going to bed or leaving for the day.)"

      "content": "Feed the tank’s bacteria rotten tomatoes as another option. Yes, this sounds like a strange thing to send down your drain for septic tank maintenance. That said, rotten tomatoes contain enzymes that help break down solids and support beneficial bacteria. Every 3 months or so, try one of the following: [2] X Research source Place 3-4 rotten tomatoes into a large zip-close bag and use your hands to mash them into a slightly-chunky puree. Flush this down your toilet in 2 batches. Cut up (or use a zip-close bag to mash) 3-4 rotten tomatoes and send them half of a tomato at a time down your garbage disposal. Keep the water running the whole time and for a good minute or so afterward. Note: Some septic system experts recommend severely limiting (or even completely avoiding) the use of a garbage disposal if you have a septic tank.

      "content": "Consider the arguments for and against commercial treatments. While such products are widely available and commonly used, expert opinions are split on the value of using commercial septic tank treatments such as Rid-X. Supporters say they’re an easy and effective way to add lots of beneficial bacteria to your septic system. Opponents usually say one or more of the following: There’s little scientific evidence that adding bacteria to your system helps (as opposed to protecting the naturally-occuring bacteria already in your system). Commercial treatments cost more and may not work any better than DIY bacteria treatments like active dry yeast. Commercial treatments may work too well, breaking down your tank’s solids into such small pieces that they end up flowing into your draining field and causing blockages and problems there.

      "content": "Stir the sludge (or have a pro do it) to break up clogs or thick layers. Professional pumpers employ stirring—usually with a long metal pole or similar tool—to break up the “sludge” layer of solids at the bottom of the septic tank so they can pump it out. Similar stirring may temporarily break up a blockage of sludge at the tank’s outlet pipe (which leads into the draining field). [7] X Research source However, the tank should be pumped ASAP at this point anyway, since the sludge layer should not be allowed to get within 12 in (30 cm) of the outlet pipe. [8] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If you need to resort to stirring as an emergency measure, open the septic tank lid, insert a long metal pipe—10 ft (3.0 m) long for an average residential tank—and break up the solid sludge at the bottom as best you can. Be sure to close the tank lid securely afterward. But have a pro do this job whenever possible."

During backflushing, some of the liquid sucked out of the septic tank is sprayed back into it in order to break up the solids for more effective removal. Backflushing won’t solve septic tank troubles on its own, but it does make pumping more effective at getting rid of sludge buildup. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Using a garbage disposal frequently or incorrectly: Generally speaking, it’s best not to even have a garbage disposal (let alone use one) if you have a septic tank. For starters, people tend to send things down the disposal (like meats, fats, and bones) that aren’t well digested by the tank’s bacteria. Also, even when bacteria-friendly foods (like fruits and veggies) are put in the disposal, they’re pulverized so small that they end up floating in the tank and may clog the outflow pipe. [13] X Research source If you do own a garbage disposal, use it sparingly and only for fruit and vegetable scraps."

It’s generally okay to use common household products (like toilet cleaners, laundry bleach, etc.) occasionally, but use only the minimal amount needed when needed. Here are some more tips for protecting your tank’s beneficial bacteria: [14] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Use regular soap instead of antibacterial soap—remember, you’re trying not to kill the bacteria in your septic tank! Don’t pour used paint or paint cleaners down the drain, and avoid rinsing your brushes in the sink. Use natural cleaners, like baking soda and vinegar to clean sinks, tubs, and toilets, instead of chemical-laden commercial products. Skip the chemical drain cleaners and use options like a plunger or boiling water to unclog a toilet or sink ."
