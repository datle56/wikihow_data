If you're leading a group discussion or project, seek input from people of all genders and make sure everyone gets a chance to contribute."

      "content": "Build economic empowerment by giving people financial tools. Many people are frightened of money, investing, and business because they don't understand it and don't have the tools to manage it on their own. Intuitive, easy-to-use tools take the fear out of finance and help people make better financial decisions.

The clean neighborhood might empower them to take other steps to improve the health and safety of their community.

[25] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source For example, recognizing and learning about cultural holidays empowers those cultures. Teaching people to respect cultural traditions even if they don't share them empowers those cultures to maintain their traditions and see their value.
