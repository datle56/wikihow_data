      "content": "Try taming your hair before sleeping. For those with medium to long hair, this might mean braiding your hair or tying it back so that it doesn't have a chance to travel around your head during sleep. You could also consider adding some leave-in conditioner for keeping the hair in better shape. [1] X Research source Hair can be braided damp or dry. If you braid it when damp, you will have wavy hair in the morning. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wrap the head before sleeping.",
      "content": "Wrap the head before sleeping. If you don't like braiding or wearing the hair in a ponytail, wrapping is another option. Use a thin summer weight scarf or a bandanna to wind your hair into place. Ensure that the hair does not move before tying a knot at the front of your head. Don't tie the knot on the back or side, as you don't want to lie on the knot. Using a toweling cap is another option in place of a scarf. The cap should have firm but not tight elastic."

      "content": "Brush or comb your hair when you get up in the morning. While self-evident, it's an important start to taming the mess. If you have problems getting the hair brushed or combed, use spray-in conditioner to ease the knots and tangles out. Give each section of hair five to ten brushstrokes. If you plan on wearing your hair down, finish up with a little hair gel or a touch of hairspray. [3] X Research source Brush your hair with a boar bristle brush while the hairspray dries to keep the flyaways at bay."

      "content": "Avoid using heat where possible. It's a vicious cycle––you add heat to try to get the hair into good condition, only to find it dries and gets flyaway, then add more heat to tame that, and so on. If you must use heat, always use heat protectant on your hair as well."
