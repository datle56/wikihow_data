      "content": "Obtain a cord set with the same electrical rating and number of slots as the receptacle. If purchasing a cord set by matching the electrical rating of the receptacle; remembering the slot pattern will not matter, as they are standardized. Most hardware stores and nearly all home supply centers offer cord sets for electric ranges and dryers with a choice of either 3 or 4 conductors for under $25 or so. These cord sets may look similar, but are not interchangeable due to different electrical ratings. Dryer cord sets are 240V/30A and range cord sets are 240V/40A for use in the U.S. & Canada."

      "content": "Connect the cord set to the terminal block at the rear of the dryer. The cord set selected should have only 3 wires (line 1, line 2 and neutral; no ground wire). The center wire of this cable is the neutral wire and the outer wires are the \"hot\" line 1 and line 2 wires. These hot wires connect to the outer 2 connections the power terminal block of the dryer, does not matter which is which as long as one hot is connected to each of the outer terminal connectors."

      "title": "Notice that the center wire (neutral wire) of the cord set goes to the center connector.",
      "content": "Notice that the center wire (neutral wire) of the cord set goes to the center connector. Since in this case the neutral serves as a neutral and a ground connection, a jumper conductor (ground strap) is also connected to the center terminal and to the frame of the dryer. A green wire could also be used to connect the center connector to the frame of the dryer."

      "title": "Understand color coding of conductors in the cord set.",
      "content": "Understand color coding of conductors in the cord set. If the dryer cord does have colored wires, white is the neutral wire to the center connector, the red and black wires are the hot line 1 and line 2 wires which connect to the 2 outer connections of the dryer terminal block. Don't forget the ground strap or green wire jumper from the center connector to the dryer frame."
