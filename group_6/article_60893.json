      "content": "Lack of detail could be a sign of a fake profile. Most dating apps and sites ask you to fill out a questionnaire that’ll give more information about you on your profile. Fake profiles and scammers will most likely leave parts of their profiles blank, claiming they forgot to fill them in or didn’t have time to. [2] X Research source If their name, age, and location are the only thing filled out, chances are they’re fake. Check to see if they’ve linked their social media accounts to the page. Real profiles tend to plug their Instagram or Snapchat in their bios."

      "content": "Chances are they’re hiding something if they upload a single selfie. Fake profiles and romance scammers will try to make realistic-looking profiles with a seemingly harmless profile pic.

      "content": "Fake profiles are made to catfish, so they won’t bother making friends. Look the person up on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. If they’re a fake dating profile, chances are they’re fake across all platforms. Do they have a good number of followers, or are they following an absurd amount of people? You can tell a profile is fake if the people following them don’t seem legit themselves. [5] X Research source Notice if they have followers in common across all platforms. Friends usually follow friends on all social media. Check to see if they’re tagged in any of their followers' posts."

      "content": "Claiming they’re stuck abroad is a common scam fake profiles use to get money. Maybe they say they’re on a business trip and don’t have enough money to get back home, or they can’t access their bank account in a different country. This is their way of guilting you into giving them money, and it’s a major red flag.

      "content": "Fake profiles might be controlled by a bot or someone from another country. Grammatical and spelling errors will litter their profile and messages because of wacky code or from writing in a second language. It’s common for someone to make a grammatical mistake every once and a while, but these could be common occurrences for a fake profile. [8] X Research source Think about what common errors you make when texting a friend. Is the person behind the profile making the same errors, or are theirs much worse? Look out for generic messages, too. They may send something like, “Hello, My name is…”"

      "content": "Links are a popular phishing scam, so don’t click on them. Perhaps they send a link asking you to take a look at their new website, or one they claim is a funny video. Links can easily be disguised to contain malware, spyware, and viruses, so think before you click. [9] X Research source Ignore their message, or, better yet, try finding another profile to connect with.

They’ll ask for your email, details about where you work, phone number, and surname. Getting information about you can help them hack into your accounts. [10] X Research source If you’re not sure if they’re fake but want to give them your phone number to find out, set up a Google Voice account. This will give you a separate phone number that’ll forward all messages to your real phone number, and the profile won’t have a clue the number isn’t truly yours! Asking for money or your financial information is a big red flag if you’re looking for a sugar momma or daddy.

Chances are they’re not who they say they are if they’re not willing to meet you in-person, especially if they claim to live nearby. If they’re serious about a relationship with you, they’ll want to meet up and will have nothing to hide. [13] X Research source They might lie and say they’ve suddenly been sent overseas, have to travel for work, or need to visit a sick family member. Watch out for sob stories.

If they look like a model, have a thriving career, and seem to have no flaws, they may be a work of fiction. Listen to your gut and notice if they seem too perfect. This could all be a glamor to get something out of you. [15] X Research source A fake profile may claim to be famous, rich, or even royal. If you Google their name and nothing pops up, they’re definitely not a celebrity. Search for them on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google for information on their career. If they’re telling the truth, chances are they have a LinkedIn account tied to their job."
