      "title": "The water creates an airtight seal around the butter.",
      "content": "The water creates an airtight seal around the butter. Your butter bell comes in 2 ceramic pieces. The top piece has a lid with an upside-down bell on the bottom, and the base looks like a cup. Check the fill line on the inside of the base, which is usually about a third of the way up from the bottom, and add water up to the line. [1] X Research source Butter bells work because the water prevents any bacteria in the air from getting into the cup and turning your butter sour."

    {
      "title": "Soft butter will stick to the inside of the bell easier.",
      "content": "Soft butter will stick to the inside of the bell easier. Take a stick of butter out of your fridge and leave it at room temperature so it can soften, which will probably take around 30 minutes. [2] X Research source If you want to soften butter more quickly, you can cut it into smaller pieces, pound it out with a rolling pin, or heat it in a bowl over warm water. [3] X Research source If you try using butter that came right out of the fridge, it’ll be harder to pack down and could fall out of the bell."

      "title": "Packing the butter tightly gets rid of air pockets.",
      "content": "Packing the butter tightly gets rid of air pockets. Use a butter knife to cut the stick of butter into smaller pieces so they’re easier to load into the bell. Push all of the butter down to the bottom of the bell with a spoon as tightly as you can. [4] X Research source If any air pockets are left in the bell, it could contain bacteria that make your butter taste sour."

    {
      "title": "Submerging the rim of the bell keeps your butter fresh.",
      "content": "Submerging the rim of the bell keeps your butter fresh. Hold the top piece by the handle so the bell points down and slowly set it on the rim of the base. The rim of the bell will go underwater and protect your butter from contamination. [5] X Research source Your butter won’t touch the water when you put the top on."

    {
      "title": "Your butter will stay soft and spreadable without it spoiling.",
      "content": "Your butter will stay soft and spreadable without it spoiling. Set the butter on your counter or dining table so it’s within easy reach. Anytime you need a pat of butter, take the top piece off of the butter bell and use a knife or spoon to scoop some out. [6] X Research source Avoid keeping your butter bell in direct sunlight since it could melt the butter inside."

    {
      "title": "Bacteria could grow in the water over time.",
      "content": "Bacteria could grow in the water over time. Since crumbs and other food particles might fall into the water from the butter, take the top piece off and dump the water out from the base. Give the base a quick rinse before adding new water up to fill the line and putting the top back on. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Butter will start to spoil after about 30 days.",
      "content": "Butter will start to spoil after about 30 days. Your butter will stay fresh for a few weeks after you pack it into the bell. [8] X Research source If you aren’t able to use all of the butter in time, scoop out and throw away whatever you have leftover. Just wash and dry the butter bell before you use it again."
