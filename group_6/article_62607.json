      "content": "Create a professional invoice . If you write bills for payment often, you may want to create an invoice template you can modify each time you send a new one to a client. This is especially useful for contractors or other people who perform ongoing services. You can create an invoice template using your favorite word processing software or by searching for a template online. [2] X Research source An invoice includes a header with your name (or your business name), your address and phone number, and your company logo, in addition to a detailed account of services rendered, payment owed, and payment instructions. Invoices are usually created electronically, numbered, and saved to a computer. This way you always have a copy of the invoice and don't have to worry about losing a piece of paper. Be sure, however, that you also back up your files using a file storage service, such as Google Drive or Dropbox. That way, if the hard drive on your computer crashes, you still have backup copies of your invoices. Choose a numbering system that makes it easy for you to organize your records. One option is to use the current date, so \"INV123116\" is the invoice you prepared on December 31, 2016. If you prepare more than invoice on the same day, you can add the vendor's initials."

      "title": "Pick up an invoice book.",
      "content": "Pick up an invoice book. Invoice books are available at office supply stores. They contain forms with spaces for services rendered and payment information. Each time you need to write a bill for payment, you fill in the blanks. Invoice books are useful for people writing bills for items they have sold. For example, if you sell homemade cakes, it might be easier to write out a bill for payment instead of creating an invoice on the computer each time you make a sale. Choose an invoice book with a layer of ditto paper underneath each blank bill so that you and the customer both get a copy. You're still going to want safe storage, though. Be sure to keep your copy of the invoices in a fire-proof box."

      "content": "Use an online payment system. PayPal or Square both allow you to send invoices. [3] X Research source There is a fee for this service (2.9% + 30Â¢ per invoice as of January 2017), but the ease of paying electronically may lead to more reliable payments. From within your PayPal account, select the \"Send & Request\" menu option at the top. Then, select \"Create and Manage Invoices.\" Finally, click on the \"Create\" button to create a new invoice. You'll need to know the email address of your client for the \"Bill To:\" section of the invoice. PayPal or Square will send the invoice to the account with that email address."

      "content": "Number the invoice, if necessary. You'll number the invoice sequentially according to how many transactions you've had with the client. For example, if you've sold cakes to the same client on three different occasions, the invoice for the third sale should be #3. If you're using invoice slips that you purchased at an office supply store, the invoices will already be numbered. If you're using accounting software or PayPal, the invoice will also be automatically numbered."
