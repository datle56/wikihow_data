      "content": "Vanish Mode lets you send messages that disappear. When you have Vanish Mode enabled in a chat, you and the recipient can send messages to each other normally. However, if you or the other person leaves the chat or disables the mode, all messages sent in this mode will disappear. In Vanish Mode, you can't copy, save, or forward any messages. When you and the recipient leave the chat, Vanish Mode will delete messages on both sides. When either party enables or disables Vanish Mode, the other person will be notified. No one else on Instagram outside of your chat will be notified. Additionally, either party can take a screenshot or screen recording during Vanish Mode, but the other will be notified. The Vanish Mode feature may be unavailable in Japan and some European countries."
