It looks like a group of silhouetted profile icons to the left of your profile name and picture. The icon is green if Family View is active. Enter your PIN when prompted. Only the person who created the Family will have the PIN, so if you don't know it, ask. Click Ok when you enter the PIN and Family View will be disabled. Enter Family View again by clicking the same icon again. [1] X Research source Family View allows parents to control how a child interacts with and uses Steam.
