To send money to yourself via Venmo, you would need two Venmo accounts with different contact and bank information. Venmo doesn't allow you to have multiple accounts, so making a second Venmo account to move money between your own bank accounts is risky."

Wire transfers are a secure way of sending large amounts of money between bank accounts, but you will need to know the routing and account number of the bank account you want to transfer to. You'll also need to know the name and contact information of the account owner. There are a few options you can use to wire money to someone else: Bank-to-bank wire transfers : Many banks offer wire transfers. You can initiate one in-person or on your bank's website or app. Each bank will have different wire fees, but they can range between free to $50. [13] X Research source Wire transfer services : You can use a third-party wire transfer service like Western Union to wire money to another account. You can usually go to a wire transfer service in-person, call the service, or use their website or app to begin the wire transfer. Wire transfer fees can vary depending on where you're sending money to, how much money you're sending, and how you're paying for the transfer."

However, mobile deposits under a certain dollar amount are usually available immediately. Have the recipient check their bank's mobile check depositing policy to see how much money they can get instantly if they deposit a check via mobile phone. Alternatively, if your recipient's bank doesn't have instant mobile deposits, they can cash the check at a bank, credit union, grocery store, convenience store, or gas station. Your recipient can then use that cash at an ATM or their bank to deposit into their account instantly. Note that most stores won't be able to cash large checks, and banks may request additional information if you attempt to cash a big check."
