      "title": "Understand why people impersonate police officers.",
      "content": "Understand why people impersonate police officers. Police officers are afforded a lot of power in order to enforce the laws of a particular state. With that power comes the ability to wear a uniform, carry a firearm, and arrest people should the situation arise. Criminals, who could utilize this perceived power to inflict harm, are always looking for a way to commit crimes without getting caught. Police impersonators often do what they do in order to commit violent crimes, including murder, rape, and burglary."

      "content": "Know how people impersonate police officers. Impersonating a police officer is actually a lot easier than it may seem. With the advent of the internet, anything that can be sold will be. [1] X Research source A lot of authentic looking police gear can be found on auction sites, which often allow the sale of police identifiers so long as there is a profit. [2] X Research source One study found that a simple online search produced police badges for sale from almost every state, city, and county in the United States. [3] X Research source Impersonators often buy uniforms, badges, utility belts, and vehicle accessories (e.g., lights and decals). People can even impersonate officers by simply introducing themselves as someone with police authority."

      "title": "Identify who is at risk of being victimized.",
      "content": "Identify who is at risk of being victimized. Police impersonators are often looking for anyone who seems exposed and easily fooled. This means that younger people, as well as the elderly, are most at risk to be victimized by police impersonators. With that said, criminals often commit crimes of opportunity, meaning they may impersonate a police officer in order to commit another crime against anyone that presents an easy target in the moment."

      "title": "Recognize the illegality of police impersonation.",
      "content": "Recognize the illegality of police impersonation. Impersonating a police officer is a crime in and of itself. Most laws prohibit a person from identifying themselves as an officer, producing a badge of authority, wearing a uniform with the intent to impersonate an officer, and creating a vehicle that looks like a police vehicle. However, dressing up in a police costume for fun, for example during Halloween or for acting purposes, is not prohibited by law."

      "title": "Listen for the person's knock and announce.",
      "content": "Listen for the person's knock and announce. When a police officer comes to your door, they are usually required to knock and announce their presence. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source In addition to knocking, police are supposed to state their purpose for being there and announce that they are officers of the law. [6] X Research source Impersonators may or may not know about these rules, and therefore an impersonator may not knock and announce themselves as an officer. If someone in a police uniform knocks on your door and does not state their purpose for being there, do not open the door."

    {
      "title": "Resist the urge to open the door.",
      "content": "Resist the urge to open the door. Even if someone in uniform knocks and announces their presence, do not immediately open the door. Ask the person outside to describe the purpose of their visit, and start a dialogue without opening the door. If it is a real officer, they should have no problem explaining their visit and having a conversation through the door until you can verify their identity. If the person at your door is an impersonator, once you open the door, the barrier between yourself and the impersonator will be gone. Once this happens, the impersonator can get inside where they may want to commit a crime."

      "title": "Look at the person's uniform.",
      "content": "Look at the person's uniform. While talking to the person through the door, examine the uniform they are wearing. [7] X Research source The clothes themselves should be clean and unwrinkled. Uniforms with stains and uniforms that do not fit properly are good indications of a fake. Also, look for a hat, which is a requirement for police officers in many, but not all, areas. The uniform will always include a badge, name tag, and service tags. The badge will be made out of metal and will never be plastic or flimsy. Service tags indicate the years of service an officer has had on the force. Look for a utility belt with all of the tools of the trade. [8] X Research source These tools include a flashlight, firearm, handcuffs, taser, bullet magazines, and pepper spray. The utility belt itself is usually made of woven leather. All officers will carry a radio, so be sure the person you see has one. Try to identify the officer's citation pad."

      "content": "Ask the person to show their badge and other identification. Once you have examined what the person is wearing, or while you are doing so, ask to see the officer's identification. A trained officer should comply with this request promptly and professionally. [9] X Research source The officer should have a badge, identification card, and even a photo ID. [10] X Research source While an impersonator may be able to fake a badge, it is much more difficult to fake a photo ID and police identification card. If the person cannot show you these things, they may be impersonating an officer."

      "title": "Call the police if you have any doubts.",
      "content": "Call the police if you have any doubts. If you have any doubt after examining and speaking with the officer, call the police. [11] X Research source Dispatchers will know whether an officer has been sent to your home and if they are currently there. [12] X Research source The dispatcher will send out a real officer if there is any doubt as to what is unfolding. Real officers should never be upset if you choose to call the police to verify their identity. This verification process is easy and pain free for the officer, so they should be happy to let you make the phone call. If anyone asks that you not call the police, they may be impersonating an officer."

      "content": "Know where you are at all times. While you are driving, understand where you are. This includes what city you are in, what road you are driving on, and what direction you are going. [13] X Research source If you get pulled over by a vehicle that looks like a police vehicle, you can use the information about your location throughout the rest of your interaction. If you have to call the police, knowing where you are located will help you explain the situation to the dispatcher. If you are looking at the person's vehicle, knowing where you are will help you identify the markings on the vehicle in order to ensure they match your location. For example, if you get pulled over in Los Angeles, you want to make sure you aren't being pulled over by a New York police car."

      "title": "Listen for the vehicle's siren.",
      "content": "Listen for the vehicle's siren. When an officer begins the process of pulling you over, many departments, but not all, require they turn on an audible siren. [14] X Research source Listen for the siren and determine whether it sounds legitimate. While different police forces may use different sounds, try to familiarize yourself with those sounds so you can spot improper ones. Police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances all use different sounding sirens. Impersonators may not know this and may accidentally install the wrong siren."

      "title": "Look at the person's vehicle.",
      "content": "Look at the person's vehicle. One of the easiest ways to spot a police impersonator is to examine their vehicle. [15] X Research source If it looks older or is not running in good condition, it may not be a real police car. [16] X Research source Look for the reflective decals on the sides and the hood of the car. [17] X Research source These decals should clearly identify the vehicle as a police vehicle and should include car numbers, a police shield, and police department identifiers. Identify the warning lights on the police car. Most police cars are equipped with a number of lights that flash colors to warn people of their presence. Police lights are often red and blue. Beware of single white lights or green and yellow lights behind the grill. Read the officer's license plate. Real police units utilize specialized license plates that identify the vehicle as a police vehicle."

[20] X Research source Pulling over where people are nearby can help disincentivize a police impersonator from committing a crime against you. Also, if you are in a well lit area, you will be able to examine the person and their actions better. If you do this, a police impersonator will often drive right by you because they will not want to risk getting caught."

[23] X Research source If the person puling you over is an impersonator, you do not want to let them gain access to you or your vehicle, which is why you should not open your door or roll your window down all the way."

When someone reaches out to you, look at their profile and analyze their personal information. [30] X Research source A real police officer will have no problem stating who they work for and where they work. On the other hand, an impersonator will often try to hide their true identity.
