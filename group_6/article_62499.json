[7] X Research source This is particularly common if the two of you have been together for a while. It's normal for couples to slack on giving each other compliments after they've been together for years. If she's missing that, she might look for it from someone else.

[9] X Research source In this situation, she might try to defend herself by saying that there weren't any emotions involved, it was just sex. Be careful about seeing this as an opportunity to open up your relationship.

This might sound a bit passive-aggressive, but sometimes people feel trapped in a relationship where they're not feeling the love anymore and they just don't know how to talk about it. In this situation, she might have thought that cheating would be a good way to get you to leave instead. [11] X Research source If she was cheating for this reason, she typically wanted to get caught.

      "content": "She becomes more emotionally distant. This is often a sign of emotional cheating, in which she's simply more emotionally (if not physically) intimate with someone else. At the same time, it can also happen if she's having a sexual relationship with someone else. She just doesn't seem as emotionally connected to you as she once did. [13] X Research source It might also be that she comes across as cold. If you feel as though she just doesn't care about you as much as she used to, it might be because she's more emotionally invested in someone else."

      "content": "She isn't interested in having sex with you. If she's having sex with someone else, you might notice that your marital bedroom goes dead. It might be because she's worried that you'll somehow discover she's cheating if the two of you get sexually intimate, but it could also be simply that she's getting her sexual needs satisfied elsewhere. [14] X Research source This assumes that the two of you were sexually intimate on a regular basis before. It's really more about a change from the usual routine than anything else. If you previously didn't have sex much, the opposite can be true. Her being suddenly interested in having sex with you a lot could mean that she's cheating on you."

      "content": "She goes out alone or with friends a lot. She might suddenly seem to have a much more active social life than she used to, or start talking about hanging out with new friends who you haven't met. It could be that she's simply building a new social circle, or it could be that she's using these new friends to cover up her cheating. [15] X Research source She could also simply be lying to you about who she's with and what she's doing, so that's something to keep in mind as well. If she really is going out with friends, ask if you can meet them or if you can hang out with them sometime. Although it's perfectly healthy for her to have her own friends and interests, it's a bit suspicious if she refuses to even let you meet them."
