      "title": "Choose a topic or community.",
      "content": "Choose a topic or community. Duplicate servers are unneeded as they introduce competition and easily separate discussions. It is best to choose a unique topic or community for your server. For example, if someone has already created a server on \"wikiHow\", and you were going to create a server on that, you might narrow the server to \"wikiHow editors\"."

There are numerous permissions that can allow the role to manage the Discord server, from deleting posts to kicking users to being the priority speaker in voice chat. The most powerful permission to give is \"administrator\" as that will give the role the ability to manage all server settings. Only give the roles with this permission to other server managers."
