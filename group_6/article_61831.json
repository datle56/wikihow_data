      "title": "Choose the tank you want to main.",
      "content": "Choose the tank you want to main. Since tanks can't rely on the same situation, you need to select one to main for. Epic players and above have to rely on the Draft Bans for some heroes, and it can be confusing if you get your hero banned. If you want to rely on Crowd Control, you should use Tigreal, Gatotkaca, Ruby, or Belerick. If you are focused on supports, use Lolita, Minotaur, Hylos, or Uranus. If you're focused on a strong playthrough, use Barats, Hilda, Alice, or Grock. If you are stuck on what to main, check the Meta and see if a hero gets popular quickly."

      "title": "Try to be close to your Marksman.",
      "content": "Try to be close to your Marksman. Despite being squishy for many reasons, your Marksman can deal massive amounts of damage at once. You should be used as a shield to manage and earn damage. If your Marksman is a jungler or decides to get important stuff first, you should go to the Red Buff and attack it before it reaches one HP bar. Try going to the bushes while your marksman clears a lane. This will make sure sudden ganking doesn't occur."

      "content": "Quick-chat your allies. Teamwork can help with anything and the system can tell what you want to see. Communications can start a team fight to attack the Lord! Don't spam the quick-chat multiple times, as it can annoy certain players or can call you a troll."

      "title": "Join teamfights when necessary.",
      "content": "Join teamfights when necessary. Since tanks aren't prone to kill enemies quickly, you should gank when needed. Use your skills to make a big difference when trying to push the lane! Jump in when necessary. Avoid losing HP for doing your own battle while everyone else retreats."
