      "content": "Know your terminology. Linear equations have distinct components. The variable is the symbol (usually a letter like x or y) for a number you do not yet know. The constant is a number that remains consistent. The coefficient is a number before a variable, which is used to multiply it. [1] X Research source For example, in the linear equation 2x + 4y = 8, x and y are variables. The constant is 8. The numbers 2 and 4 are coefficients."

A system of equations with two variables can be written as follows: ax + by = p cx + dy = q Any of the constants (p, q) can be zero, with the exception that each equation must have at least one variable (x, y) in it.

To rewrite a linear system, you use A to represent the coefficients matrix, C to represent the constants matrix, and X to represent the unknown matrix. [3] X Research source The linear system above, for example, can be rewritten as a matrix equation as follows: A x X = C."

If you have two matrices, A and C, which looks like this: You can create an augmented matrix by putting them together. The augmented matrix would look like this: [4] X Research source For example, consider the following linear system: 2x + 4y = 8 x + y = 2 Your augmented matrix would be a 2x3 matrix that looks like this:"

To solve a 2x3 matrix, for example, you use elementary row operations to transform the matrix into a triangular one. Elementary operations include: [5] X Research source swapping two rows. multiplying a row by a number different from zero. multiplying one row and then adding to another row."

[6] X Research source For example, say you have a matrix that looks like this: You can keep the first row and use it to produce zero in the second row. To do that, first multiply the second row by two, as follows:"
