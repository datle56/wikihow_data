      "content": "Focus on your punching technique to improve power and endurance. Good punches are efficient punches, transferring power to your opponent with grace and ease. While you should work on training your speed and endurance, better technique will always lead to a better boxer. While doing the following drills, focus on: Leading with your elbow. Think of throwing your elbow at your opponent, not your wrist. Staying compact. You don't want to flail or move your body unnecessarily. Keep your non-punching hand close and your legs sturdily underneath you. Letting your arms rest and move during breaks. When you're not punching, leave your arms loose, or \"breathing,\" so that they rock comfortably with your body. Don't try and clench and hold them rigidly-- it will only tire you out faster.

You hit with a regular, circular motion, keeping your hands and the bag moving. This is one of the best ways to build your endurance, connection, and coordination with your hands. Run the speed bag for 3-5 3-minute sessions, resting 30 seconds between each interval."

      "content": "Hit the heavy bag for 3-minute intervals 3-5 times each training session. The heavy bag (the enormous hanging bag for punch training) is going to become your best friend. You want to hit it for 3-5 minutes, punching like you would in a fight. However, make sure you're not just standing there trying to hit. Stay on the balls of your feet, keep moving like in a real fight, and stop occasionally to duck, dodge, and block, like you would in a real fight. In general, the more like the real thing you can make it, the better the workout will be.

This forces you to focus in on a moving target."

No matter what your style, mix in 2-3 days of strength training every week, cutting down to 1 on fight weeks. Luckily, boxing is so muscle intensive that you will be making gains each time you spar, fight, or shadowbox as well, so strength training should not be the focus of your workouts. Aim for big, multi-muscle exercises to build the most muscle the fastest. Some good exercises to try include: Body weight : If you can't go to the gym, are under 16 years old, or just would rather not lift weights, there are plenty of great exercises to try: Push-ups , close-handed and wide stance. Dips Do front and side planks. Try body-weight rows, or inverted rows. Pull-ups and chin-ups. Weight lifting: Focus on smooth, fluid technique. You want to move both up and down with control for the safest, best results. Rows, seated and standing Bench press Shoulder raises and flies Bicep curls. [4] X Research source"

It is just like normal sparring with a partner, but you want to throw punches at 75% of your normal speed. This is the best way to work up your opposite hand, focus on techniques or moves that you don't have down yet, and build up confidence in the ring. Since you have to react to a live fighter, even at a slow pace, this is a great way build essential skills. Focus on coordination -- follow through on your punches, keep your feet moving, and focus on hand positioning in all circumstances.

      "content": "Do interval training 2-3 times a week. The classic long runs seen on Rocky are not actually great training for boxing. Boxing is about short, sustained bursts of high energy, and the best way to train for this is interval training. Intervals are when you alternate high energy, quick sprints with short rest periods. As you get fit you can shorten the rest periods by 10-15 seconds, improving your gains even more. A good starter workout would be: 1-mile warm up at slow, easy jogging pace. Six 600m sprints, resting for 1 minute between each. You want to be running at roughly 75-80% of your top speed. .5 mile slow, easy recovery jog at the end.

Use it on days where you need to recover, especially after 2-3 straight days of intense workouts. Longer, slower runs are also best in the days leading up to a fight, as you don't want to be sore and tired when you step in the ring. Run for 30 minutes to an hour at a nice, comfortable pace, and stretch before and after. [9] X Expert Source David Engel Muay Thai Instructor & Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. Many trainers recommend doing your runs first thing in the morning, giving you time to refuel and rest for the skills workout later on. As you jog, keep your hands in defensive position, occasionally throwing mock punches, to get your arms warmed up. This is why most boxers call running \"roadwork.\""

You should aim to fit 15 minutes of jump rope into every workout. Start with the basic jogging technique, alternating feet as you spin the rope. As you improve, try alternate, more technical foot patterns: Jump with both feet together. Cross your hands. As the rope is coming down, past your nose, cross your wrists over each other, then uncross them once the rope is passed your feet. Move as you jump. \"Walk\" forwards, backward, and side to side by hopping around as you jump."

To be a better boxer, you need to train with good form so that you don't think about your feet during a fight. When working on footwork, focus on: Staying on the balls of your feet. These are the \"knobs\" right before your toes. This makes pivoting, moving, and shifting much easier. Keep your spine straight. Avoid hunching or leaning back. This keeps your center of gravity even and allows for smoother movement. Relax your upper body. You want loose shoulders and pecs. [10] X Research source"

This is the best way to train into fighting shape without worrying about injuries or taking punches. However, you need to be focused on getting the most out of it. Keep your feet moving, alternate between throwing punches and blocking, and keep the intensity up. Most importantly, make sure you time each \"bout\" to last the same time as a standard round -- 3 minutes for amateur fighters. [13] X Research source Focus on your movement around the ring. Keep active as you move, dart, and dance. The hardest part of shadowboxing is the mentality. You need to convince yourself to practice with intensity or you're not going to get a lot out of it."

Perform a few each day, and try to work up to higher amounts over time. Focus on a slow, even motion both up and down for the best workout. While they are difficult at first, try to start with at least 10 a day, gradually working up. The differences between pull-ups and chin-ups are your grip and the muscles used. For pull-ups, both palms face away from you, hands shoulder-width apart. They work your back, shoulders, and core, focusing on your back.
