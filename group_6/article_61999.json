      "content": "Pull your sweater over a button-up blouse for a polished look. Go with a sweater that either matches your button-up for a minimalist vibe or contrast the colors to create a more dynamic look. Try to stick to neutral-tones, like cream, grey, and tan, for professional outfits and save bright colors and patterns for more casual settings. Cropped sweaters with bright patterns look great over matching, single-color button-ups. [2] X Research source For example, a white cropped sweater over a white button-up looks polished and professional in a work setting. A black cropped sweater over a white button-up is still suitable for a professional environment, but the contrast pops and can work great for more formal social situations. A bright blue sweater over a blue button-up in a slightly different shade is a great, eye-catching look if you're going out on a date or with friends. This look also works well at school."
