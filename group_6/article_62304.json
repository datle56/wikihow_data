      "content": "A patterned dress looks great when you’re out in the summer sun. Sundresses come in so many different lengths and colors, so try a few on to see what looks best on you. Keep in mind where you’re going for a walk so you don’t wear anything that could drag on the ground or easily snag. Wear a floppy hat or a pair of sunglasses to keep the sun out of your eyes. A pair of flat sandals, sneakers, or espadrilles are great options to help you stay comfortable."

You can either leave your tank untucked for a casual look or tuck it into your skirt if you want to look a little more put together. Accessorize with a chunky necklace to draw your date’s eye to you. If you’re worried about the temperature dropping, bring a jacket or sweatshirt with you. You can always tie it around your waist if it’s too warm."

      "content": "This athletic style fits tight and shows off your body. Since you’re staying active during your date, it makes sense to wear an outfit you’d normally work out in. Any tight, breathable fabric works well, so try out options like a sports bra with a crop-top hoodie, a tank top, an athletic tee, a cute windbreaker, leggings, or yoga pants to look stylish on your date. [4] X Research source Since athleisure clothes don’t have a lot of pockets, bring along a small purse or a fanny pack to hold the rest of your things. Rock a pair of matching sneakers or trainers with your outfit to finish off your look."

      "title": "You’ll stay cool and comfortable if you’re hitting the hiking trails.",
      "content": "You’ll stay cool and comfortable if you’re hitting the hiking trails. A more strenuous hike could make you sweat more, so dress in breathable moisture-wicking athletic clothes. Try out a cute form-fitting shirt or tank top with a light sweatshirt or jacket layered over it in case you get cold. Any breathable pair of shorts or athletic leggings look great and complete your outfit. For summer hikes, make sure you bring a hat and some sunscreen. If you’re going on a difficult trail, wear hiking boots so you have more traction. For a flat, easy trail, sneakers are a great pick. Avoid wearing cotton clothes since they take a long time to dry if they get sweaty."

Accessorize with some jewelry, like bracelets or a belt. Put on a pair of sneakers to finish your outfit. Layer a leather jacket on top for a really cool, classic look.

      "content": "Go for this relaxed, athletic look when it starts to get colder outside. Choose a fitted sweatshirt that hugs your body since it will look a little nicer than if it were baggy. Rather than wearing a loose pair of sweatpants, stick with joggers since they’re a little tighter on your leg and will accentuate your body. If you want to coordinate your whole outfit and look put together for your date, try out a matching tracksuit. Put on a pair of tennis shoes or trainers with your outfit so you’re ready to walk around."
