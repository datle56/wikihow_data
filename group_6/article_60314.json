If someone's bold enough to make up gossip about you then they probably do it to others as well, which means they will eventually lose credibility. Don't say \"Well she...\" say something like \"Those things aren't true, but I'll let you make up your own mind about so-and-so.\" Gossiping people are looking for others to share the gossip with. If they see that you are staying neutral and not playing their game, they will eventually stop approaching you with their gossip."
