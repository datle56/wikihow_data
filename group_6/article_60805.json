Try hanging out with friends without her more frequently or telling her you're going to run some errands on your own for the day. If she doesn't have a problem with it, you may not even need to have a full-blown conversation about space with her.

How’d you feel about that?” “It’s been a long day, so I’m just going to play video games by myself for a little while.” “I have some things I wanted to get done today. Why don’t you go ahead and run those errands without me.”"

[4] X Research source “I love seeing you right when I get home, but sometimes work stress makes it tough to have a nice conversation. I’d really appreciate having some me-time for a half-hour after work to help me decompress.” “I feel like we have such a strong relationship, and I love where we’re at. I’ve let some of my other friendships slip away in the meantime, so I’d really like to find more time to reconnect with them.” “You mean the world to me, and I feel that it’s important to have time to ourselves every now and then.

[5] X Research source “When I say ‘space,’ I mean that I’d like to carve out more free time to focus on my hobbies.” “I’d like to have a few nights every now and then to go out and get to know my work colleagues.” “I need an hour or two of quiet time every day so I can read without getting distracted.”"

      "content": "Your girlfriend will be more understanding if she knows why you need it.

Use “I” statements to describe how you feel since it puts more emphasis on your emotions and less on your partner. [6] X Research source “I feel drained at the end of my work shift, so I just need a half hour to relax and unwind after. Is that something we can work on?” “I feel a little left out of the loop when I don’t get the chance to see my friends during the week.” “I feel like I don’t have a lot of creative energy unless I can brainstorm alone, so sometimes I need more space to work on a project.”"

      "content": "Your partner will be more open to the idea if you tell them the benefits. While your girlfriend might think asking for space means the end of the relationship, it can actually make your bond a lot stronger. When you have time apart, you’re actually able to miss each other and grow as individuals, which can make you both more interesting partners. Mention these to your girlfriend so she sees the good that can come from taking a little more time apart. [9] X Research source “Just think, while I’m off doing my thing, you can finally have time to read through those books that you’ve been eyeing up lately.” “I know our friends are really important to us, so I want to make sure we maintain those connections too.” “If we’re not together all the time, think of all the fun stories we’ll have for each other the next time we see each other!”"

[12] X Research source If she asks about why you’re just bringing this up, say “Our relationship is getting more serious and I want to make sure we’re both happy and our needs are being met.” If she asks you for something you’re uncomfortable with, say “My personal space is really important to who I am. Is there any way we can work through this in a way that works for both of us?” If she wants to know how you’ll balance your time, try “What if we planned one night each week where I can see my friends without asking permission first? Would that work for you?”"

[13] X Research source “I’ve felt a little overwhelmed again recently, so taking 20 minutes or so after work to unwind is really important to me right now.” “I feel like my boundaries aren’t respected when I ask for personal space recently. Can we talk about it for a bit?” “Can we chat again about personal space? I haven’t felt like I’ve been getting enough recently.”"
