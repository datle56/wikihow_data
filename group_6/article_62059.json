[5] X Research source An organism might have many different parts, but if you use a microscope to zoom in close enough, all those parts are made up of individual cells."

      "content": "Every living organism is made up of one or more cells. If you put any organism under a microscope, you’d find it’s made up of cells, the same way a house might be made up of bricks. An organism can be just a single cell, or it can be made up of many different cells, but cell theory suggests that a living organism cannot be less than a single cell. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Cells come from other cells through cellular division.",
      "content": "Cells come from other cells through cellular division. This means that new cells are created by other preexisting cells, which give the new cells everything they need to become fully functioning cells. [7] X Research source At the time, some biologists thought that new cells might spontaneously come into existence, but cell theory eventually argued against this, saying instead that cells come from other cells.

      "content": "Robert Hooke first observed and named cells in 1665. Thanks to the invention of the microscope, biologists could now take a closer look at living things. Hooke looked at bits of corks and other plants and found that they appeared to be made up of little compartments. He called these compartments “cells” because they looked like the little rooms or cells that monks in a monastery live inside. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered blood cells in 1673. Even though microscopes still weren’t powerful enough to take a clear look at cells, the Dutch microscopist Leeuwenhoek used the technology of the day to discover that animal blood also contains cells. This led to a rush of research in the scientific world—scientists found out that many living things were made of cells, but they couldn’t quite figure out exactly what cells were or how they worked.

      "content": "Robert Brown discovered cell nuclei in 1833. 200 years after Hooke, the Scottish botanist Robert Brown looked through a more advanced microscope and found that every plant cell he looked at contained a nucleus, which suggested that cells themselves were made up of smaller parts. [11] X Research source This began a flood of information about what cells actually looked like and how they worked."

Then, Schwann and Schleiden got together and, using everything they had learned and discovered about cells, created the first 2 pillars of cell theory: cells are the most basic building blocks of living things, and all living things are made of cells."

      "content": "Rudolph Virchow created the third part of cell theory in 1858. While studying how diseases spread, Virchow proposed that diseases come from changes happening to normal cells. He used this theory to develop another theory: that all cells come from other cells. [13] X Research source The third pillar of cell theory was established."

      "content": "Cell theory changed and developed as technology advanced. Better microscopes and an expanded understanding of how cells work led many later scientists to add some points to classic cell theory in order to better describe what cells are and how they work. There are a number of important ideas in modern cell theory, but the main 3 are: cells pass DNA to new cells, cells of the same species are made of the same stuff, and energy flow happens inside cells.

Viruses, however, are not considered living organisms, and they don’t reproduce the same way cells do. For this reason, viruses also aren’t considered cells. [15] X Research source"
