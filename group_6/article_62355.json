      "content": "A whirlwind romance is a relationship that happens quickly and moves fast. Think of it as love at first sight. Whirlwind romances occur when 2 people get together faster than they can properly get to know each other. Some call it true love or a match made in heaven, while others call the premise foolish, silly, or even dangerous. [1] X Research source Some alleged celebrity whirlwind romances include Taylor Swift and Matt Healy, Kaley Cuoco and Ryan Sweeting, and Jennifer Lawrence and Cooke Maroney. To compare, in traditional slow-burning relationships, couples gradually get feelings for each other over time rather than all at once."

      "title": "You're officially together right away.",
      "content": "You're officially together right away. In a whirlwind romance, there’s no time to lose. You’re falling head over heels for each other, so you’re quick to call one another partners and become an exclusive couple. This step typically happens after your first date. Keep terms like “boyfriend” and “girlfriend” off the table until after you’ve had a handful of dates. This way, you can get to know your potential partner and see if you mesh before telling the world."

      "content": "You see them multiple times a week. If you’re in a whirlwind romance, chances are you're with your partner all the time. There’s rarely a moment when you’re apart! Creating space between you and your partner can be healthy for your relationship. Make sure to spend time with friends and family alone without them. Taking time for yourself helps you process the relationship on your own terms.

      "title": "You’ve already met their family.",
      "content": "You’ve already met their family. It’s rare for new relationships to meet the parents right away. But if you’re in a whirlwind romance, you likely already have. You’ve probably had deep conversations with them that surpass a friendly greeting. This is a telling sign that things may be moving too fast in the relationship. [3] X Research source Aim to wait at least 3 months before meeting your partner's parents and introducing them to yours. This way, you can know if the relationship is one that’ll last before bringing them into your inner circle. In some instances, you may meet their family quickly when you’re not in a whirlwind romance, especially if you’re still a teen. For instance, giving your partner's family a friendly \"hello\" at the grocery store or local baseball game."

      "title": "You’ve already said “I love you.”",
      "content": "You’ve already said “I love you.” Emotions run high in a whirlwind romance, and a couple can easily say the “L” word before they actually mean it. If you’ve just met someone and they start confessing their undying love for you, it’s likely a whirlwind romance. Avoid saying “I love you” unless you genuinely mean it. Quick confessions of love can be instigated by lust, not true affection. Get to know your partner on an emotional and physical level before whispering those life-altering words."

      "content": "You make future plans together. It may be a red flag if you start talking about marriage and children right away. While discussing what you both want out of a relationship is important, planning a future together after just meeting is often a sign of a whirlwind romance. The future may sound too good to be true, which usually indicates lustful feelings. [4] X Research source Get to know your partner before making too many commitments. If you do want kids in the future, that’s great, and there’s no shame in sharing, but maybe avoid asking them to make that happen before you know who they are inside and out. [5] X Research source"

Then, evaluate the relationship—is this someone you can see yourself with long term?

There are risks in every type of relationship; however, you’re more likely to make irrational decisions in whirlwind romances.
