      "content": "The zodiac signs are based on our view of the constellations from Earth. From our perspective on Earth, it looks like the sun passes in front of different constellations. This is actually an illusion due to the way the Earth orbits the sun. [1] X Research source Your zodiac sign (also called a star or sun sign) is determined by which constellation the sun appears to be in at the time you were born. [2] X Research source For instance, between May 13th and June 21st, the sun appears to be in the constellation of Taurus, so if your birthday falls in that date range, your zodiac sign is a Taurus."

      "content": "Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn are earth signs. Each zodiac sign is associated with one of the four elements: fire, water, air, or earth. The earth signs—Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn—are often the most sensible, reliable, and grounded members of the zodiac. If you’re an earth sign, you likely appreciate routine and structure, persevere to meet your goals, and are a natural leader. [3] X Research source Earth signs are also classified as feminine or passive (along with water signs, while fire and air signs are masculine or active). Business and finance are industries where Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn thrive. One thing to watch out for—earth signs can be materialistic.

[5] X Research source The earth element is closely connected to the physical senses and is receptive, rather than aggressive, but that doesn't mean it's weak. The earth element is strong, enduring, and peaceful. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Earth’s symbol is ⊕. There are many interpretations of this symbol. Some say Earth’s symbol represents a globe divided into the 4 directions of a compass by meridian lines. [9] X Research source Others believe the circle represents the spirit while the cross represents the mind and body. Still others liken the Earth to the physical body, including your bones and teeth, while some people maintain that Earth represents life."

      "content": "Earth is always 180 degrees from the sun in your natal chart. The Earth represents your physical location and dharma, or sense of purpose. It’s the mirror image of the sun, in the same degree but the opposite sign. If your sun sign is in Aquarius, your Earth sign is in Leo, and vice versa. If your sun sign is in Pisces, your Earth sign is in Virgo, and vice versa. If your sun sign is in Aries, your Earth sign is in Libra, and vice versa. If your sun sign is in Taurus, your Earth sign is in Scorpio, and vice versa. If your sun sign is in Cancer, your Earth sign is in Capricorn, and vice versa. If your sun sign is in Gemini, your Earth sign is in Sagittarius, and vice versa."
