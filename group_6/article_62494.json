      "title": "“Why, thank you” conveys being mildly surprised but thankful.",
      "content": "“Why, thank you” conveys being mildly surprised but thankful. By itself, “Why” refers to a cause or reason for something. However, when used as an interjection in “Why, thank you,” the why takes on a different meaning; it becomes an exclamation of mild surprise and pleasure. Saying “Why, thank you!” is like saying, “I’m surprised but happy—thank you!” For example: [1] X Research source Them : “Here, I thought you might like this book.” You : “Why, thank you! I’ve been wanting to read it!” In the English language, interjections (like “Why,” “Well,” “Oh,” or “Ah”) are brief remarks that express an emotion rather than a meaning. That’s why the word “Why” indicates emotions of surprise and gratitude in “Why, thank you,” but it means something else by itself."

      "title": "Say “Why, thank you” when someone pleasantly surprises you.",
      "content": "Say “Why, thank you” when someone pleasantly surprises you. Since the “Why” indicates light surprise, try using “Why, thank you” when someone surprises you with a compliment, thoughtful favor, or gift, and you’re flattered by the gesture. You can express thanks and happiness in a short, sweet statement with just a simple interjection. [2] X Research source Them : “Wow, I really love your hair today. It looks great!” You : “Why, thank you! That’s so sweet of you to notice.” You could also use an interjection like \"Well\" to indicate surprise by saying, \"Well, thank you!\" However, \"Why\" is more common."

      "title": "Use “Why” as an interjection to avoid sounding abrupt.",
      "content": "Use “Why” as an interjection to avoid sounding abrupt. In addition to conveying emotions, interjections are independent of the words around them. You don’t need them to complete a statement, but you can use them to elongate your statement slightly and make it feel more genuine (if you’re worried about sounding stiff or rushed). [3] X Research source For example, say someone buys you a coffee for a surprise morning treat. You want to say thanks, but you’re worried a plain “Thank you!” might feel stilted and awkward. Instead, you could draw the statement out slightly by saying, “Why, thank you!” to help it feel more natural. Depending on the emotion you want to convey, you can use other interjections with “Thank you” too. For example, “Ah, thank you!” can imply surprise or excitement, while “Aww, thank you!” conveys approval—like saying you think something is sweet."

    {
      "title": "“You’re welcome!”",
      "content": "“You’re welcome!” A simple “You’re welcome” is a totally appropriate response to someone saying, “Why, thank you,” just like it is for any other expression of gratitude. It’s a common shortening of the phrase “You are welcome,” which simply acknowledges another person’s thanks in a polite manner. Other ways to say “You’re welcome” include: [4] X Research source You’re so welcome! You’re very welcome! You’re most welcome!"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Sure thing!”",
      "content": "“Sure thing!” “Sure thing” is a short, informal response that’s best to use when you’re being thanked for something that didn’t take much effort. It’s like saying your help was a “sure thing,” meaning you were very willing to do it. For example, if someone thanked you for telling them what time it was, you might respond with, “Sure thing!” [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "“No problem!”",
      "content": "“No problem!” “No problem” is another phrase that should be used in response to doing things that didn’t take much effort or difficulty on your part. Saying “No problem” is like telling someone that helping them was no problem for you and you weren’t inconvenienced in the least. Other ways to say it include: [6] X Research source No worries! It’s nothing. Not at all! Don’t mention it."
    },
    {
      "title": "“My pleasure!”",
      "content": "“My pleasure!” “My pleasure” is a warm, friendly way to say “You’re welcome” to someone because it means you were happy to help out. It tells the other person that you enjoyed doing something for them and weren’t put out by it at all. Other ways to say “My pleasure” include: [7] X Research source Happy to help! Glad I could help! Pleased to help."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Anytime!”",
      "content": "“Anytime!” Use “Anytime” when you want the other person to know you’re open to helping them again. It’s a friendly way to encourage people to reach out to you in the future if they need a hand!"

    {
      "title": "“It’s the least I could do.”",
      "content": "“It’s the least I could do.” Use “It’s the least I could do” in situations where you feel like you could do even more to help someone that you’ve already done. Additionally, use it in situations where you feel your offer of help should’ve been implied or expected (because they needed it badly, you’re close to them, and so on). [8] X Research source For example, if someone else does you a huge favor and you offer to do one in return, you might say, “It’s the least I could do,” to convey that you feel like you’re in their debt."

      "title": "Yes, you should use a comma in “Why, thank you.”",
      "content": "Yes, you should use a comma in “Why, thank you.” When interjections are used at the beginning of a statement, they’re typically followed by a comma (or, in some cases, and exclamation mark). That’s because commas offset the interjection from the rest of the sentence. Thus, “Why, thank you” is grammatically correct, while “Why thank you” is incorrect. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Both phrases express polite appreciation and gratitude.",
      "content": "Both phrases express polite appreciation and gratitude. There’s almost no difference between “Thank you” and “Why, thank you.” The only real difference is that “Why, thank you” is more commonly used to express slight surprise in addition to gratitude, while “Thank you” doesn’t naturally imply surprise (although you can use “Thank you” even when mildly surprised, and vice versa). [10] X Research source Them : “Surprise! I bought us both lunch today!” You : “Thank you! You’re the best.” You : “Can you pass me the salt?” Them : “Sure, here you go.” You : “Why, thank you!”"

      "title": "“Why, thank you” is more old-fashioned than formal.",
      "content": "“Why, thank you” is more old-fashioned than formal. While it’s definitely polite and appropriate for most casual and formal or professional situations, “Why, thank you” isn’t necessarily more formal than a simple “Thank you.” Rather, adding “Why” as an interjection before a “Thank you” may be seen as a more old-fashioned way of speaking (although plenty of people still do it). [11] X Research source In fact, some people add \"Why\" to \"thank you\" and other phrases (like \"Why, yes!\") in a playful or comical way when they want to pretend they're old-fashioned or fancy."
