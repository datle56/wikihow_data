A rash and a runny nose are likely the first things you'll notice. If you have an EpiPen , use it immediately before calling an emergency number, such as 911 in the US. Be on the lookout for the following symptoms: [2] X Trustworthy Source American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology National professional organization of allergists, asthma specialists and immunologists that focuses on supporting and publishing research Go to source Tightness in your throat or trouble breathing Nausea or vomiting Dizziness or lightheadedness Abdominal pain or diarrhea Rapid heart rate"

      "content": "While this isn't an emergency, seek medical treatment within 24 hours. It's normal to get some swelling and redness around a bug bite, especially immediately after you get bit. But any swelling, pain, or redness is typically confined to the area immediately around the bite. If you have more generalized pain or a spreading rash, medical treatment will help. [3] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source For example, suppose you get a bug bite on your calf. Within an hour, your entire leg hurts and you can't put any weight on it. You also have a rash spreading from your calf over your whole leg. This is a reaction a doctor needs to look at. If your symptoms get worse, not better, an hour or two after the bite, call your doctor and have them look at it. You might also go to an emergency or after-hours clinic if you're really concerned about it (or if you're in a lot of pain)."

      "title": "Raise the area with the bite above the level of your heart.",
      "content": "Raise the area with the bite above the level of your heart. Elevating the area causes blood and fluid to flow away from the bite, which can reduce inflammation. A cold compress will work even better if you're able to elevate the bite at the same time.

If the bite is on your torso, however, it might not be possible to effectively elevate it."

      "content": "An expanding or bull's eye-shaped rash isn't an allergic reaction. A normal reaction to a tick bite is a small, red bump, less than 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) in diameter. If the rash grows larger within 1-3 days after the bite, or develops the characteristic bull's eye shape, get treatment for Lyme disease. [12] X Research source Lyme disease is usually easily treated with a round of antibiotics, but it's better to get started with that as soon as possible. Keep in mind that a normal tick bite reaction can last several days or even weeks after the initial bite, but it won't grow any bigger. It's the expansion that you need to look out for. Draw a line around the outside of the redness with a pen or marker so you can easily see if it's expanding."
