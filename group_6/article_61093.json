      "content": "A new moon is symbolic of rest and intention-setting. The beginning of the lunar cycle, new moons are believed to be an excellent time to listen to your intuition, explore your heart’s desires, and set intentions for the future. [1] X Research source With no light in the sky, consider a new moon a clean slate—wipe stress off your plate, if only for an hour, by indulging in some well-deserved TLC. What to Do: Sit down with a good book, watch a movie, take a bubble bath, or do anything to help put your mind at ease and wind down. Then, once you’re relaxed, tap into your deepest desires and goals by asking questions like, “What do I want most from my life?” Examples of intentions to set include, “I will have saved enough money for a new car by this September” or “I will be in a loving, fulfilling relationship by the end of this year.” Taking a nature walk during the new moon may be an excellent way to soak up all the quiet, nurturing feminine energy flowing through the air."

[2] X Research source What to Do: Meditate for at least 15 minutes , and ask yourself questions throughout, like, “What steps could I be taking to accomplish my dreams?” or, “What is it that’s stopping from moving forward with my goals?” If fear of failure is holding you back, remember that putting yourself out there and trying is the true measure of success. People like Walt Disney, Oprah Winfrey, and more failed many times before accomplishing their dreams—it was their refusal to give up that got them to the top."

[5] X Research source What to Do: Celebrate all the good in your life by scheduling a fun night with your best friends , purchasing yourself something you’ve wanted—essentially, do whatever would bring you the most joy!

For example, if you’ve been dealing with a negative friend, it might be time to let that relationship go to move towards a more positive future."
