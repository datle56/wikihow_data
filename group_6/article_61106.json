      "content": "Hackers can be traced, but not easily. Unfortunately, there are no simple ways to trace a phone hacker without getting help from law enforcement. However, if you are concerned your phone is hacked but you don't want to call the police right away, you can try these steps: Contact the developer of an app you don't remember installing. Navigate to the App Store or Google Play Store page of the app and click App Support (iOS) or Developer Contact (Android). You can use this information to contact the developer to ask for more information, or you can provide this information to the police if you decide to contact them. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source Delete any apps you don't remember installing and change passwords for accounts connected to your device. This includes banking passwords, your Apple ID or Google account passwords, email passwords, and social media passwords, as a hacker could compromise these. Factory reset your Android or iPhone . If you are worried there is an app on your device that is tracking you, the easiest way to get rid of it would be to completely factory reset your phone. Make sure you keep your phone's operating system up to date after you factory reset, and don't install any apps that you don't trust to prevent your device from getting hacked again ."

      "content": "You should not retaliate against a hacker without help from police. If you can recover your account information, you should still report any hacking incidents to the police, as hacking is illegal. Even if you are able to figure out who is hacking you, that information would be valuable in an investigation, and retaliating against a hacker (also called \"hacking back\") may not be legal depending on where you are located. [4] X Research source Always be sure to research laws for your state/region and country, as well as municipal laws. If you get critical information about your hacker, such as contact information, this information should be used in a police investigation."
