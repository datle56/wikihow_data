      "content": "Consider your headband options. When you’re wearing a headband with your hair down, virtually any style will work. You can opt for a traditional horseshoe style headband made of plastic or metal or a stretchy fabric headband, and you can choose a thin headband for a delicate look or a wide headband for a bolder look. [1] X Research source Embellished headbands, such as those with large bows or flowers attached, work very well when you’re wearing your hair down. You can find all headband styles in a variety of colors and patterns, so it’s easy to find an option that will match your outfit. Consider the proportion of your face when you get a headband. For example, if you have a rounder face, you may want to choose an angular headband. [2] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO® Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 31 December 2019."

      "content": "Brush through your hair to remove tangles. To ensure that your hair looks neat when you place the headband, you should brush it before hand. Brush your hair all the way down to the ends so it’s smooth and entirely free of tangles. [3] X Research source You may prefer to use a wide-tooth comb to brush through your hair because they don’t tug at your hair as much as a brush does. If you aren’t happy with the natural texture of your hair, you can use a flat iron to straighten your locks or curling iron to add curls or waves after you brush it."

      "content": "Decide whether you want a part or not. After you’ve removed any tangles from your hair, you can choose to add a part or not before you put the headband on. If you don’t want a part, just comb your back and away from your face. If you want a part, choose a side and carefully comb your hair over to that side. [4] X Research source Wearing a part with a headband typically looks best if you have bangs. After parting your hair, place the headband right where your bangs separate from the rest of your hair for the most flattering look."

      "title": "Place the headband on your hair.",
      "content": "Place the headband on your hair. Once your hair is neatly combed and parted as you want, slide the headband into over your hair. Position it so it rests approximately ½ inch (1.27 cm) from your hairline, and adjust your hair as you like, such as pulling it over your ears or pushing it behind them. [5] X Research source If you have bangs, you can use the headband to push them back and hold them off your face or you can pull the bangs loose from the headband, depending on the look that you prefer."

      "content": "Choose the appropriate headband. When you’re wearing a headband with an updo, choosing the right style is key. When you’re going casual, it’s best to choose a thin, delicate headband that won’t overwhelm your look with your hair all pulled up and back. If you’re wearing your updo to a formal event, pair it with an embellished headband that features pearls, rhinestones, crystals, or other beads for a more sophisticated look. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Pull your hair into your favorite updo. After you’ve selected a headband, brush your hair and pull it up into your chosen updo. You can opt for a simple top knot bun, a fancy French twist, a sophisticated chignon, or whatever style you prefer. [7] X Research source It’s often easier to do an updo if your hair has some texture to it. That’s why it’s best to start with hair that hasn’t been washed in a day or so. If you have washed your hair, use some dry shampoo or a texturizing spray to add some texture."

      "title": "Add the headband to your hair.",
      "content": "Add the headband to your hair. Once your hair is pulled up into the updo, place your headband in your hair. As with a ponytail or braid, you don’t necessarily have to position it just behind your hairline. Depending on the design of your headband, you may want to push it forward to create a tiara effect or push it back further so the embellished details are closer to the updo itself. [8] X Research source If you’re wearing a fabric or stretchy headband with your updo, you may way to use a few bobby pins to pin the band in place at the sides of your head or the nape of your neck to secure it."

      "content": "Spritz your hair with hairspray to keep it in place. It’s easy for strands of hair to slip loose from an updo, so it’s a good idea to use hairspray before you leave the house. Opt for a flexible hold spray, though, so you hair won’t feel stiff or crunchy."

      "title": "Find a complimentary headband.",
      "content": "Find a complimentary headband. When you’re pairing a headband with a ponytail or braid, the look tends to be more casual. Look for a bohemian-inspired headband to coordinate with the more relaxed style, such as one that features artificial flowers or leaves. A woven or feathered headband also works well with a ponytail or braid."

      "content": "Gather your hair back into a ponytail or braid it. Once you’ve settled on a headband, pull your hair back into the ponytail or braid of your choice. Use a hair elastic or clip to secure your hair, and apply some flexible hold hairspray if you’re concerned that it might come loose. [9] X Research source You can pull your hair into a traditional ponytail at the middle of the back of your hair, opt for a high ponytail at the crown of your head, or go for a low pony right at the nape of your neck. A side pony also looks cute with a headband. You can also put your hair in pigtails if you aren’t a fan of ponytails. French braids look especially good with a headband, but you can do your any braid that you like, such as a traditional rope or fishtail braid."

You don’t necessarily need to position it ½ inch (1.27 cm) from your hairline as you would with your hair down. Depending on the placement of your pony or braid, you may want to push it further back in your hair. [10] X Research source You may want to pull some strands of hair free from the headband around your face for a softer look. You can also pull your bangs free if you prefer."
