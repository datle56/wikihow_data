      "content": "Tease and flirt with the girl to let her know that you’re crushing on her. If you’re crushing on a girl and she doesn’t know it yet, Valentine’s Day is the perfect time to let her know. Start off with a message that’s a little vague so she questions who you’re talking about and continues the conversation. After a little bit, come out with the truth and tell her how you feel. “You want to know who I want as my Valentine? Reread the first word of the question 😉” “I told Cupid about someone I have a crush on. Have you seen him yet?” “I think someone you know likes you. I’ll give you a hint, their name is spelled M-E.”"

      "content": "Get a little cheesy with a classic Valentine’s poem. You’ve probably seen this poem a million times, but you can change the last few lines to make your own unique message. Whatever you write at the end of the poem, try to make it rhyme so it sounds super cute when she reads it out loud. You can even change the setup to make your poem a little more unique. [1] X Research source “Roses are red, violets are blue, there’s no one I’d rather spend Valentine’s Day with than you!” “Roses are red, violets are blue, if you didn’t know, I have a crush on you! Happy Valentine’s!” “Roses are red, daffodils are yellow, would you like to spend Valentine’s with this fine fellow?”"

      "title": "Send something short and sweet with emojis to sound extra flirty.",
      "content": "Send something short and sweet with emojis to sound extra flirty. You don’t need to write the girl a long and sincere message to let her know that you’re interested. Sometimes, the best texts are quick and casual so you can keep the conversation light. Throw in a few romantic emojis, like hearts or kisses, so your message comes across clearer. [2] X Research source “V-Day? More like U + ME Day 😘” “XOXO Happy Valentine’s!!” “U and me are meant to be ❤️”"

    {
      "title": "Let the girl know that you miss her and want to spend the day with her.",
      "content": "Let the girl know that you miss her and want to spend the day with her. Maybe the girl you’re talking to lives far away, or maybe you aren’t able to see her when Valentine’s rolls around. If you’re thinking about her and wish you could hang out, wish her a good day and say something sweet to get her attention. Some other things you could try saying are: “Even though we’re not together this Valentine’s, I’m still thinking of you.” “I’d love to see you today, but at least I can say Happy Valentine’s here!” “I don’t know how I can survive Valentine’s Day without seeing your face.”"

      "title": "Share your favorite romantic song to show her how you really feel.",
      "content": "Share your favorite romantic song to show her how you really feel. If you have a favorite love song or you know the girl’s favorite band, wish her a happy Valentine’s and link it in your text. When she listens to the song and hears the lyrics, she’ll get the impression that you’re trying to tell her how you feel without directly saying it to her. Some good songs you could try include: [3] X Research source “A Thousand Years” by Christina Perry “Adore You” by Harry Styles “I Really Like You” by Carly Rae Jepsen “Perfect” by Ed Sheeran “All You Need is Love” by The Beatles “All of Me” by John Legend"

      "content": "A quick compliment will make any girl feel warm and fuzzy inside. Girls love a little bit of flattery, so wish them a good day and say something special about her. You could compliment her looks or a trait you appreciate about her. Just make sure you don’t come off too strong, or it might make her uncomfortable. [4] X Research source “You always warm my heart! Happy Valentine’s!” “You know how to take my breath away. Happy Valentine’s Day 😊” “Happy Valentine’s! You’re such a light in my life!”"

      "content": "Ask your crush directly so she knows your intentions. It can be a little scary admitting you like someone, but there’s no better day than Valentine’s to shoot your shot. Take a deep breath, and just let the girl know what you’re feeling and that you want to get together. She may appreciate the courage it took and say yes. [5] X Research source “Truth is, I’ve been thinking about you a lot recently. Would you be my Valentine?” “I’ve had the biggest crush on you all year. Do you want to be my Valentine?” “I’d love to have Valentine’s dinner with you. Want to?”"

      "title": "Show your crush you want to be more intimate this Valentine’s season.",
      "content": "Show your crush you want to be more intimate this Valentine’s season. Flirt a little bit by telling her something you wish you could do together. It’s okay to mention some things you want to do physically, but you should probably only say something risqué if you’re already pretty close with the girl you’re texting so you don’t make her feel uncomfortable. [6] X Research source “I’d put my phone down if it meant I could hold your hand this Valentine’s.” “I’ve never had a Valentine’s kiss, and I can’t think of anyone else I’d want it to be with.” “I can think of a few ways we can make this Valentine’s Day a little special 😉😉”"

      "content": "Reference a couple from a movie or TV show to say you love her. Think of a reference that you and the girl can both bond over, whether that’s a real or fictional relationship. When you mention their names, the girl will immediately visualize you and her as the perfect pair for one another. [7] X Research source “You’re the Bonnie to my Clyde.” “Would you be the Archie to my Veronica?” “I love you more than Jack loved Rose.”"

Even if you exchange actual gifts with the girl, let her know that she’s enough to make you happy this Valentine’s Day. Make references to gifts you’d normally give on Valentine’s, but make her the center of attention so she sees how much she means to you. [8] X Research source “You don’t have to get me anything today. Spending time with you is the only thing I wanted.” “I didn’t ask for a lot this Valentine's, but you’re number one on my list!” “I don’t need any chocolates or candy. You’re already sweet enough.”"

[9] X Research source “You’re the best part of my life, and I’m so happy I get to be your Valentine.” “There’s no one I’d rather be in love with than you. Happy Valentine’s, honey.” “You make my heart so full, I just can’t help loving you!”"

Valentine’s is a great day to take your girlfriend out or plan something romantic, so give her a hint about what you plan on doing. You can come right out and tell her what you’re doing or act a little coy if you want to keep it a surprise. “Happy Valentine’s, hon! Hope you didn’t make any dinner plans cuz I’m taking you out 😘” “Can’t wait to see you tonight! I’ve got a special surprise for you 😉” “There’s no one I’d rather spend this night with than you 💕”"
