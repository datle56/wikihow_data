After washing your hair, use a round brush to style and dry your bangs at the same time. Wind your bangs around the brush and move the blow dryer back and forth over your bangs as you twirl the brush. Keep doing this until your bangs are dry. This will help to give your bangs extra volume and keep them together. [2] X Research source Make sure to keep the blow dryer moving to prevent the heat from damaging your hair. You may also want to use the dryer on low heat to minimize heat damage. Heat protectant products can also help to minimize heat damage on your bangs, but use these products sparingly as they can be oily and this will lead to bang separation."
