      "title": "ISTG stands for “I swear to God” in texts and on social media apps.",
      "content": "ISTG stands for “I swear to God” in texts and on social media apps. This is a casual phrase that many people use both online and in real life (imagine someone exclaiming “I swear to God!” when they’re frustrated or emphasizing a point). Even though the phrase includes “God,” its meaning and uses aren’t considered religious. ISTG is sometimes typed out as “I s2g” or just “s2g.” [1] X Research source “If he doesn’t answer my next call then we’re breaking up istg!” “Istg Ms. Hearney gives more homework than any other teacher.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use ISTG to show you’re serious or not joking about something.",
      "content": "Use ISTG to show you’re serious or not joking about something. Include ISTG at the beginning or the end of a sentence where you’re telling someone something shocking or surprising. This shows that you’re being serious about whatever your news is (which can be hard to tell over text sometimes). [2] X Research source “ISTG I just passed four cars full of clowns on the highway just now lol” “Everything at Starbucks is half off today istg!!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Show that you’re annoyed or exasperated with ISTG.",
      "content": "Show that you’re annoyed or exasperated with ISTG. Add ISTG to a text or post describing something that genuinely irritates you, similar to how you might exclaim “I swear to God!” out loud when something negative catches you off guard. It shows that you’re truly annoyed or upset with something (or someone) and possibly looking to vent to a trusty pal. [3] X Research source “It is too dang hot outside istg! 🥵” “Why can’t I go on ONE vacation without getting sick!? ISTG!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Send ISTG to emphasize a point or amplify a promise to someone.",
      "content": "Send ISTG to emphasize a point or amplify a promise to someone. When you need someone to believe what you’re saying or that you’ll follow through on a promise, use ISTG to get your point across. Use it when you’re guaranteeing you’ll do something positive (“I’ll be at your party, istg!”) or when you may have to enforce a boundary or negative consequence (“Istg you’ll be grounded if you aren’t home by curfew”). [4] X Research source “I promise I’ll get there extra early to help set up, ISTG!” “istg if you all don’t start taking this vacation planning seriously, I’m out!”"

    {
      "title": "Believe someone when they text something surprising followed by ISTG.",
      "content": "Believe someone when they text something surprising followed by ISTG. If they included ISTG in their message, it may mean they thought you wouldn’t believe their news without it (especially if they’re relaying something silly or out of the ordinary). So, take them at their word and reply with something that acknowledges the unbelievable or surprising nature of their story like “That’s crazy!” or “Wow, no way!” Them: “I just found out I’m Valedictorian of my class istg!” You: “Omg no way! Congrats!! 🥳” Them: “ISTG I saw my ex like 3 different times today, it was weird” You: “Ugh really? That’s crazy, I’m sorry you had to bump into them so much!”"

      "title": "Empathize with someone who’s using ISTG in frustration.",
      "content": "Empathize with someone who’s using ISTG in frustration. If a friend or family member is stressed out and messaging you, send them a comforting message or a reassuring compliment to lift their spirits and help them get through their issue. Alternatively, try telling a joke or sending a fun meme or GIF to make them chuckle and feel better (if a joke is appropriate for the situation). Them: “Istg I have too much to get done before tomorrow! 😞” You: “You’re such a hard worker, I know you’ll get it all done!” Them: “Ugh the line for the new rollercoaster is like an hour long! ISTG!” You: “Deep breaths! Save that adrenaline for the ride!”"

      "content": "Acknowledge someone's promises or boundaries when they use ISTG. If the sender uses ISTG to emphasize that they’re being honest about following through on a promise or consequence, believe them and let them know you understand. Use a lighthearted tone if they’re talking about something positive (like a promising to help with a party), or a heavier tone for more consequential topics (like breaking up or canceling an event). Them: “Istg I’ll actually be able to come to book club this month!” You: “Yay! Looking forward to seeing you there!” Them: “I can’t keep lying to mom and dad for you, istg” You: “Okay okay, I’ll tell them the truth next time I’m home.”"

    {
      "title": "Use OMG (“Oh my God”) to express surprise or frustration.",
      "content": "Use OMG (“Oh my God”) to express surprise or frustration. Like ISTG, OMG isn’t really a religious phrase when it’s used in everyday conversation. Use it in place of ISTG when you’re surprised or annoyed by something, or send it by itself as a standalone interjection. OMG is one of the most common and recognizable slang acronyms. [5] X Research source “This is so annoying, omg!” “Omg I just found out Greg got fired!”"

      "content": "Try ONG (“on God”) or FR (“for real”) to show you’re being serious. Swap in either of these acronyms for ISTG when you want to emphasize that you’re not joking about something. Typically, you’ll see these at the end of a sentence rather than the beginning. Like ISTG and OMG, using ONG doesn’t carry a religious meaning.
