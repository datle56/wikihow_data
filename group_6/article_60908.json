      "title": "Use a blacklight to detect sperm stains.",
      "content": "Use a blacklight to detect sperm stains. Switch off the lights in the room and hold the blacklight over the material. Guide the light down the fabric and see what appears—in many cases, sperm lights up underneath the lamp. The stain itself may be yellow, blue, or some other color, depending on the exact light that you’re using. [1] X Research source A blacklight, also known as a Wood’s lamp or UV-A light, shines ultraviolet light over a given surface. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that a blacklight isn’t a 100% conclusive way of identifying sperm stains. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Bodily fluids like urine and blood also look bright beneath a blacklight.

      "content": "Transform your smartphone into a blacklight if you don't have one. Start by covering the LED camera light with a strip of transparent tape and coloring over the lens with a blue permanent marker . Layer another piece of tape on top and color it in with the blue marker again. Then, stick an extra section of tape over top and shade over the lens with a purple permanent marker . Your homemade blacklight is now ready to go! [5] X Research source This DIY trick is much more useful than a blacklight phone app. While these apps simulate a blacklight, they don’t actually mimic the effects of one."

      "title": "Get more definitive proof with an at-home test.",
      "content": "Get more definitive proof with an at-home test. Use an at-home semen detection kit to test the stain that you spotted under the blacklight—it’ll test the fabric for acid phosphatase (AP), an enzyme found in semen and vaginal stains. Just keep in mind that this test isn’t completely conclusive, since AP is also found in various bodily fluids. [6] X Research source You can also use an at-home Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test to narrow down your results, but this isn’t totally conclusive, either. If you’re really curious about the stain’s contents, send a fabric sample to a private laboratory for testing."

      "content": "Clean any fresh sperm stains from regular fabric with cold water. Grab your soiled garments or sheets and stick them under a stream of cold, running water. Steer clear of warm or hot water, though, as this can make the semen stain permanent. Here are some stain removal tips for other materials and surfaces: Wool and silk: Soak the garment or sheet in a mixture of water and delicate detergent before sticking it in the washer or hand-washing it. Carpet: Dab over the stain with a detergent-soaked sponge. Then, go over the surface with a clean sponge and blot the carpeting dry with paper towels. Mattresses: Go over the semen stain with a moist sponge and an upholstery-grade stain remover . Then, blot away any leftover cleaner with a sponge. Dry off the spot-treated section of the mattress with several paper towels. Upholstery: Dab at and soak up the stain with a wet cloth. If the sperm stain still doesn’t go away, spritz over the area with an upholstery cleaner . Then, dry off the surface with paper towels. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Treat dried stains with an enzymatic pre-treatment cleaner . Use a bristled brush to scrape away as much of the leftover stain as you can. Once the fabric is mostly clean, soak it in a mixture of water and an enzymatic pre-treatment cleaner. Then, stick the item in the washing machine afterward or wash it as you usually would. [11] X Research source Opt for a biological detergent when you’re washing the fabric. If the item is made of silk or wool, soak it in a mixture of water and delicate detergent. Then, stick it in the washer or hand-wash it as usual."
