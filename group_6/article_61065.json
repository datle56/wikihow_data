      "content": "Fold the shemagh into a triangle. With the shemagh completely open, match one corner with the corner diagonally opposite from it, folding the square in half and into a triangle. This particular tying method is a good option if you want to use the shemagh to protect your head and face from cold winds or hot sun."

    {
      "title": "Drape the shemagh over your forehead.",
      "content": "Drape the shemagh over your forehead. Pull the folded edge of the shemagh over your forehead, positioning it somewhere between your hairline and your eyebrows. The excess material should drape over the top of your head and down the back, not in front of your face. If you have tied a bandana in the past, then a good way to think of this initial position would be to act as though you are preparing to tie a really large bandana. The two ends of the shemagh should be about equal for this style, so position the folded edge with the middle resting on your head."

      "title": "Wrap the right side under your chin.",
      "content": "Wrap the right side under your chin. Pull the right side around to the left so that it wraps completely under your chin. Pull the end over your shoulder and toward the back of your head. Hold this end in place with your left hand while working with the left side to prevent it from loosening. A shemagh needs to be fairly tight in order to be effective."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the left side over your face.",
      "content": "Wrap the left side over your face. Grab the leading or folded edge of the left side with your right hand and pull it all the way across your face, toward your right side. Unlike the right side of the shemagh, this left side should drape across your nose and mouth, not under your chin. Pull the right end over your shoulder and toward the back of your head, as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie the two ends at the back of your head.",
      "content": "Tie the two ends at the back of your head. Use a tight overhand or double knot to secure the shemagh in place. This knot should be at the back of your head, roughly around the back center, and it must be tight enough to keep the shemagh on your face. Do not tie the knot so tightly that you make it difficult to breathe or turn your head, but make sure that the material is taut against all parts of your neck, face, and head."

    {
      "title": "Adjust as needed.",
      "content": "Adjust as needed. Adjust the shemagh as needed so that the material covers the top of your head and lower half of your face without covering your eyes. After this step, the shemagh is complete. One major advantage of this wrapping style is its versatility. You can pull the bottom off your face to create a simple headwrap, or you can pull both the bottom and top portions down so that they sit around your neck, creating a scarf. [3] X Research source"

This particular tying method is a good option if you want to use the shemagh to protect your head and face from cold winds or hot sun. It's especially good if you also want to protect yourself from breathing in sandy or debris-filled air."

The excess material should drape over the top of your head and down the back, not in front of your face. [5] X Research source Choose a point roughly three-quarters of the way along the folded edge. There should be more material on the right end than on the left. If you have ever tied a bandana, a good tip would be to hold the shemagh over your forehead as though you were getting ready to tie a really large bandana."

      "content": "Wrap the longer side over your head. Continue to wrap the longer end of the scarf by bringing it up and over the top of your head. The edge should drape completely over your head, and the end should roughly meet the end on the opposite side. One hand should still be holding the first end taut against the side of your head while your other hand maneuvers this second end around."

After this step, the shemagh is complete. A primary disadvantage of this wrapping style is that the shemagh cannot be easily pulled down off the head and turned into a scarf. This is a secure wrapping style, however, and provides your head with greater protection than the traditional or casual wrapping style mentioned here."

As you bring the shemagh around your neck, hold the ends up to keep the material taut against your face. For this style, you should not tie the shemagh behind your neck. Instead, the two ends should only cross over each other once. While still keeping the two ends secure and taut, bring each end back over the shoulder opposite its original side so that both are positioned over your chest. Do not let go of the ends yet."
