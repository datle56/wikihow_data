This could mean that your grades at school are so-so until suddenly you blossom and outstrip many of the other kids in one set of exams. Maybe you were able to connect what you were doing in school to some goal later in life. Or, you were able to use what you were learning about to somehow make your life better in the moment.

[7] X Research source Robinson, K., &amp; Aronica, L. (2009). The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything (Reprint edition). Concordville, Pa.; Norwood, Mass.: Penguin Books.

Or, you could try looking for new lines of work that might meet the important human need for passion. Social late bloomer. When everyone else was racking up their firsts, the idea of making new friends and dating was foreign, perhaps terrifying, to you.

Equally important is our ability to form interpersonal attachments with other people.

By experimenting with the limitations of your environment you can challenge your insecurities. In doing so, you can discover new possibilities for your life. [9] X Research source Schrage, M. (1999). Serious Play: How the World’s Best Companies Simulate to Innovate (1 edition). Boston, mass: Harvard Business Review Press.

Go to source Experiment with these life conditions by pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone. For example, imagine you spend most of your time either alone in your home or isolated in an office at work. You’ll be quite unlikely to develop a capacity for traits like physical health or sociability. This will be true even if these traits are part of your genetic makeup. To move beyond these limitations, you might join a weekly physical exercise class. Or, you could just commit to going on more walks in the park. Either way, experiencing a change of scenery or pushing your body to do something new can open you up to new emotions and ideas about what’s possible."

We often hold ourselves back from reaching our potentials because of unrealistic ideals about who we should be. [14] X Research source These could come from your childhood, perhaps from your parents’ expectations. Even a quick comparison of facebook pages can create unrealistic expectations about life. Instead of worrying about doing the \"right thing,\" try focusing on what you truly enjoy. [15] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. Try taking a class or workshop in something you haven't tried before, even if you're not sure you're good at it. Exploring potential passions is just as important as finding something you excel at. [16] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. Whatever the source of these perceptions, it’s important to challenge them when you feel they are holding you back. When they arise, take a deep breath and focus on what you can do in the present moment to make your life better. Try grounding your expectations for the future in your perceptions of the present moment. Focus on the process of building towards your goal as opposed to the end outcome itself. For example, imagine you have the thought that you need a new friend. Consider how you might go about achieving this goal starting in the present moment. Can you just make a new friend by willing it, or will you have to talk to a new person first? Perhaps simply surrounding yourself with new people is a necessary first step."

This means we are all going to develop according to different rhythms and paces. People meet supposed developmental milestones at different rates and in their own ways. [17] X Research source The late 20s is the time many peoples’ brains and bodies stop developing at the relatively steady rate they had before. Nonetheless, the body retains a certain plasticity throughout life. This creates a potential for sometimes dramatic changes in personality and behavior, even later in life. [18] X Research source Doidge, N. (2007). The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science (1 Reprint edition). New York: Penguin Books. No two bodies will develop according to the same rhythms and trajectories. That means it’s ok for you to reach cultural and biological milestones at different points in your life than others. It might even be ok sometimes to not even reach them at all. Puberty, for example, can begin within a broad range of ages. [19] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It will often vary depending upon factors like race, body fat composition, and stress. There’s no point trying to force your body to reach puberty before it’s ready. You'll just put undue pressure on yourself to be something you’re not.

Your tendency toward reflection and control may mean that others achieve their goals faster than you. But, because you take the time for careful thought, when you get an opportunity you may be more able and ready to take the helm. Practice creative writing. If you find yourself at home more than you’d like, or are just looking a way to spend some time, try practicing creative writing. This could be in the form of poetry or prose. Either way, creative writing can be a great way to tap into your creative side. [23] X Research source This can help you blossom into something unexpected. Try making art or music.

If your children or another family member can learn from your experiences, you will have made life better for someone else. Keep a daily journal. Journaling can be a great way to explore your emotions and allow them to flow more freely into your everyday life. [25] X Research source Don't try to force your writing into a particular structure. Instead, write down anything that comes into your mind. Sit down and start free associating--you might be amazed at what comes out through your fingertips. This can also be a good way to encourage introspection and deep thinking. Keep an \"ideas book\" handy. Keep a notebook in which you write down your ideas, perhaps next to your bed or in your bag. This can help you in moments of indecisiveness or faltering confidence. Whenever ideas strike you, write them down. Late bloomers are often full of ideas, sometimes so many that they don't know what to do with them. You may be wading in indecisiveness when an idea comes to you. But, that idea has significance and may be useful later on when you come back to it."
