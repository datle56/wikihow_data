Don't let one category limit how you see her—one of the biggest things you shouldn't do to a sigma woman is tell her who she can be. You might conclude that sigma females come off overly confident and confrontational due to their readiness to speak up in any situation. However, this confidence also shows great independence and ability to stand up for herself when being belittled. This trait is nuanced, and can encompass both humbleness and self - awareness. A sigma female's confidence should never be interpreted as passive-aggressive or \"bossy\" behaviour."
