      "title": "SWT stands for an honorific phrase that follows “Allah.”",
      "content": "SWT stands for an honorific phrase that follows “Allah.” SWT, or subhanahu wa ta’ala , is a phrase you say in Islam after the name of God, Allah سبحانه وتعالى. It means “Glory to Him, the exalted,” or “Glorified and exalted is he.” [1] X Research source Muslims use this phrase to honor their creator and help remember that Allah سبحانه وتعالى is above all else and all understanding. While Allah سبحانه وتعالى is often referred to by the male pronoun “he,” Allah سبحانه وتعالى is not male, and should not be thought of as a man (or any kind of person). The word “Allah” encompasses everything—it cannot have a gender, nor can it be plural. As is said in Qu’ran 42:11, “There is nothing alike unto Him, and He is the hearing, and the seeing.” [2] X Research source Many descriptions of God (across religions) get assigned the male pronoun in English translation since that has historically been the preferred “general” pronoun.
