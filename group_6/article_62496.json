If things aren’t good between him and her, you may end up getting pulled into all kinds of drama and conflict. If you’re looking for a peaceful, stress-free relationship, a guy with kids may not be able to offer you that. [1] X Research source He may even be the perfect guy, but if his ex is showing up all the time and causing chaos or trying to pick fights with you, it may not be worth it to you. If his ex isn’t around anymore or they’re on super good terms and she’s mature, this may not be a particularly big deal."

      "content": "A guy with kids will likely be looking for a long-term partner. If he’s a single father, he’s likely dating because he’s looking for “the one.” If you’re just trying to casually date around and keep things relaxed, he’s unlikely to be on board. Things may work out for a little while, but your wants not matching up with his needs can lead to conflict and heartbreak. [2] X Research source On the other hand, if you really are just looking for a quick fling, he may be up for that. Some single dads don’t feel like they have the time for a full-time relationship. If that kind of arrangement is okay with you, go for it! Alternatively, this can be a good thing depending on what your goals are. If you’re looking for Mr. Right and he’s trying to find a life partner, it could be a good thing that he’s looking for something serious."

      "content": "A guy with children will always put his children’s needs before yours. Children will be his number one priority. This is a good thing—you probably wouldn’t want to date a guy who neglected his children for a new girlfriend—but it does mean that you won’t be the most important thing in his life. If you’re the kind of person who likes to feel like they’re the most valuable person in a guy’s life (which is totally okay), dating a guy with kids may not be the right thing for you. [3] X Research source If he does make you his number one priority, it could mean he isn’t really a good dad and that may be a red flag. If you’re super secure in who you are and you don’t necessarily need the guys you date to obsess and fawn over you, this may not be a problem. In fact, some people like dating guys with kids because it means they get more alone time!"

Depending on the age of his children and how often his ex has the children, this can range from “slightly annoying” to “dealbreaker” levels of frustrating. If it really annoys you when someone interrupts your time with your boyfriend, a guy with kids can make things hard for you. [4] X Research source Don’t feel bad about wanting to be left alone. If you’re dating a guy with kids and you’re tired of the kids getting in the way, it’s totally normal to be annoyed. If you’re the kind of person who values their alone time, or you’re really good at going with the flow, this may not be a barrier at all."

A guy with children won’t be able to take a random weeklong road trip, or that sexy midnight rendezvous you wanted to pull off as a surprise.

At the same time, if you want a mature, level-headed guy who knows how to handle responsibilities, a man with children may be absolutely perfect for you. Some guys with kids will take every opportunity they have to do something interesting in their spare time. If you’re still yearning for adventure and he’s one of those guys who can’t wait for the babysitter to show up so the two of you can go have fun, it may not be a big deal!"

On the more obvious side of things, you may feel envious of his ex and worry about him and her getting back together. However, you may even find yourself getting jealous of his children! As ridiculous as it may seem now, seeing your boyfriend giving so much attention to someone else can be extremely difficult if you’re the kind of person who tends to be a little jealous. [7] X Research source It’s totally normal to be jealous when you’re in a relationship, so if you’ve ever dated a guy with kids and you felt this way, don’t be too hard on yourself. You’d be surprised how common this is. If you don’t have a tendency to get jealous, this is probably a non-issue for you."

Want to openly flirt by saying something dirty? Not around his kids. You’re going to have to self-regulate a little more often than you would if you were dating a guy with no children. This may not be a big deal right now, but when it gets to the point where you’re spending time around his children, it might be hard to cope with.

If you’re still trying to hold on to some of your youthful, late-night, party-time energy, it could make things extremely difficult for the two of you to build something together."
