      "content": "To warm up their voices for the day It might seem unbelievable, but researchers believe that birds chirp early in the morning to prepare their voices for singing. As it turns out, birds usually start their chirping at a slower tempo and a narrower range of pitches. By the time the sun rises, they’re singing faster, using a wider pitch range, and singing more difficult tunes! [1] X Research source Vocal exercises also help male birds better impress females with their songs during the day."

      "title": "It’s a quieter time to sing",
      "content": "It’s a quieter time to sing The bustling of other animals and humans tends to pick up after the sun fully rises. So, birds likely find that all their important chirping is more effective in the morning when their environment is still quiet. In fact, as noise pollution increases in cities, birds often start chirping earlier than normal. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Audubon Society Nonprofit environmental organization focused on conservation, citizen science, and public science education Go to source As noise pollution increases, light pollution usually does too. So, increased light from growing cities can also cause birds to start chirping earlier. Researchers used to believe that birds sang in the morning because the cooler temperatures carried their voices farther. After running tests, they discovered that their voices went just as far in the morning as the afternoon. However, increased noise pollution does explain why morning might be the best time to sing."

      "title": "To attract a mate",
      "content": "To attract a mate This is one of the most common reasons behind a bird’s early morning chirping. What you might not know is that the majority of birds you hear in the morning are males! Their songs let female birds know where they are and that they’re available for courting. Females judge a male’s attractiveness by his singing, so it can be quite a lot of pressure so early in the morning! [3] X Trustworthy Source National Audubon Society Nonprofit environmental organization focused on conservation, citizen science, and public science education Go to source Early morning singing also acts as a sort of competition between males. A male bird wants to sing as loud and clear as possible to show female birds that he’s a stronger, more healthy bird than his rivals. Morning chirping is usually the loudest and most frequent in the spring. This is when most bird species start breeding."

      "title": "To mark their territory",
      "content": "To mark their territory A male bird's morning song is also his way of telling other male birds to back off. The competition for a mate can be intense, so his calls let rival males know that his area is claimed. His beautiful chirps and trills are also a signal that he’s ready to fight if his territory is invaded. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "It’s too dark to hunt for food The first thing that a bird usually wants to do when they wake up is fill their belly with food. The only problem is that it’s still too dark to hunt. So, birds might chirp so early because they don’t have anything else to do! [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Most birds start chirping about 1 hour before sunrise.",
      "content": "Most birds start chirping about 1 hour before sunrise. Depending on the season, this means that birds start chirping between 4 to 6 am. And despite the early hour, their singing is louder and more frequent than at any other time of day. This is actually why birds’ morning songs are known as the dawn chorus! [6] X Research source However, when each bird starts singing depends on the species. Some birds start an hour or 2 before sunrise, while others wait until the morning is closer. Birds usually stop chirping once the sun rises over the horizon. The bright light signals to them that it’s time to start their day. The dawn chorus is so popular among birders that there is an international day to celebrate it! On the first Sunday in May, bird enthusiasts wake up extra early to listen to and witness the beautiful birdsong."

      "content": "Blackbirds, robins, and thrushes are usually the earliest risers and singers. Not much later though, other birds like finches, warblers, cardinals, sparrows, and pheasants join in. Luckily, you don’t have to go far to hear these birds, as they are common in most residential areas. [7] X Research source If you want to attract more birds into your yard, it’s super easy! Just research the types of birds native to your area and provide them with a suitable birdhouse and seed . Adding a birdbath to your yard is another simple way to invite more songbirds into your yard."
