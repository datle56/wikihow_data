If it’s your first time, add one drop of grapefruit seed extract. Add up to four drops if you’ve tried it before and it hasn’t irritated your nasal passages. [3] X Research source Use bottled distilled water or tap water that has been boiled for three to five minutes and cooled until it’s lukewarm. Never use untreated tap water to irrigate your sinuses.

If you don’t already have one, you can find a nasal irrigation device online or at your local drug store. [6] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Neti pots, squeeze bottles, and nasal bulbs are all effective options, but they each have pros and cons. Squeeze bottles and bulbs can be more effective because they expel the solution with pressure, while the solution just gently flows out of a neti pot. However, if you squeeze the bulb or bottle too hard and spray the solution too forcefully, you could damage nasal and throat tissues. [7] X Research source"
