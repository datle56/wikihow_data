      "content": "Rinse the rosemary under running water and pat it dry. Place the rosemary bunch in a colander and pour running water over it. You can also rub the sprigs with your hands under the water to help loosen any dirt or leftover debris from the garden. Transfer the washed rosemary to a tea towel and gently pat it dry. If you don’t plan to use your rosemary immediately, Cigliano says that you can keep “fresh rosemary…for a couple of days in the refrigerator or easily dry it by hanging it with kitchen twine or a food safe rubber band.\" [1] X Expert Source Ollie George Cigliano Private Chef & Food Educator Expert Interview. 30 August 2021."

      "title": "Trim off individual sprigs.",
      "content": "Trim off individual sprigs. Use a pair of sharp scissors or a knife to cut single sprigs of rosemary from the bunch. Remove the sprigs at the bottom where they grow out from the larger bunch. You can also trim off and discard any large pieces of stem that have no needles."

      "title": "Use your fingers to strip the needles off of each sprig.",
      "content": "Use your fingers to strip the needles off of each sprig. Pinch the tip of the rosemary sprig and use your other hand to wrap your fingers around the stem just below the tip. Apply gentle pressure and slide your fingers down the stem to strip off the needles. Transfer the needles to a cutting board and discard the stems. [2] X Research source Instead of discarding the stems, you can also hang them up to dry and store them to use as a skewer for any vegetables or meats that you plan on barbecuing. When you want to introduce rosemary directly into your recipes, it’s best to use the individual needles rather than the full sprig. However, you may want to leave some sprigs intact—full sprigs of rosemary are great for finishing, garnishing, and adding flavor to certain dishes. You can either add the sprigs after cooking to finish a dish or cook roasts, soups, and other meals with full sprigs of rosemary and remove the sprig before serving."

      "title": "Chop the rosemary needles finely.",
      "content": "Chop the rosemary needles finely. Gather the needles into a small pile on top of your cutting board. Place a sharp chef’s knife in position above the pile, with the tip down and the handle slightly lifted. Place your hand that’s not holding the knife onto the spine of the blade. Rock the knife back and forth over the rosemary in a slicing motion. [3] X Research source Continue to perform this motion, gathering the pile back together as needed. Keep chopping the herb until your desired texture is reached. In general, most recipes call for finely-chopped rosemary as it can have a spiky texture when left in large pieces. If you’re not using the rosemary right away, you can store fresh rosemary in a resealable bag for up to two weeks in the fridge."

Coat your meat or fish with the mixture and cook or grill it as usual. [6] X Research source Alternatively, try stuffing meat with whole sprigs of rosemary, roasting proteins garnished with sprigs, or mixing in diced rosemary to add flavor to any dish. Cigliano recommends rosemary as a particularly excellent pairing with \"poultry, lamb, chicken, eggs, fish, and pork.\" [7] X Expert Source Ollie George Cigliano Private Chef & Food Educator Expert Interview. 30 August 2021."

Sorbet is a frozen dessert made from fruit juice and sugar, and when you make your own homemade sorbet, you can use any juice you like and add any extra flavors you want. Lemon sorbet is an ideal base to add rosemary to because lemon and rosemary are often paired together in other dishes. [14] X Research source Start making a simple lemon rosemary sorbet by preparing your ice cream machine according to its instruction manual. Then, heat 1.5 cups (350 mL) water, 1 teaspoon (1 g) of diced rosemary, and 1 cup sugar (200g) in a saucepan.
