      "content": "You’re walking on a treadmill to increase your stamina. In Genshin, there’s a Stamina System that helps with dashing, charged attacks, climbing, gliding, and swimming. To increase your stamina in-game, make treks to oculi. Once you get used to this pattern, you’ll probably slip into the pattern of thinking about journeying to oculi while you’re exercising or taking a daily walk. Hey—at least you’re staying active, right?! [1] X Research source Since you can also increase in-game stamina by eating food, you might start snacking throughout the day for bursts of energy."

      "content": "You’re watering flowers to turn on the “Bloom” reaction. When you combine “Dendro,” a special plant-based element, with “Hydro,” the water element, you enable “Bloom,” an Elemental Reaction that makes an explosive Dendral bomb. Throughout the day, you might hydrate the plants in your house in an attempt to make some earth-based explosives. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "You pick Genshin mats in real life. “Mats” is short-hand for “materials,” and there’s definitely a whole medley of mats you can collect in Genshin Impact. For instance, you might collect anything from weapons and talismans to masks and bait. You can gather mats to cook, forge materials, furnish your home, or garden. In your everyday life, you might pick up random objects, like books or a pencil, in an effort to fill up your inventory and make a neat gadget or tool. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "You start dreaming about winning the 50/50. If you’re super into Genshin Impact, it’ll probably start seeping into your dreams. 50/50 is a really cool toss-up in Genshin Impact because you can’t really lose when it comes to getting more characters in Genshin Impact—either you’ll get a banner character (like Cyno or Yae Miko) or a standard 5-star character (like Jean or Diluc). Since this is such an enticing prospect, when you go to sleep, you might fantasize about snagging one of these coveted characters."

      "content": "You make daily commissions and resins part of your routine. Genshin Impact sure knows how to incentivize you to play every day and farm extra exciting goodies! Daily commissions are doled out if you log in to play 4 times a day—you’ll be rewarded with up to 40 primogems. If you go to your guild, you’ll collect 10 primogems on top of that! As for resins, you’ll scoop up these resources when you defeat bosses or overcome challenges. [4] X Research source Resins will help you access rewards, like Character Ascension Materials and Talent Materials, so they’re great to gather: you can carry up to 120 Resin at a time."

      "content": "You have 10/10 balance playing Genshin on the subway or bus. TikTok’s been joking about people who are so addicted to Genshin Impact that they’ve got to sneak in all the play time they can get. When they’re in the car (as a passenger!) or any form of public transportation, they don’t get dizzy—in fact, they’re rooted in place and calm as can be as they fight monsters and collect loot. [5] X Research source TikTokers also praise “GeForce Now,” a type of software that boosts the performance and aesthetics of Genshin Impact on a mobile phone: it’s so crisp and smooth that it looks just like what you’d see on a gaming PC.

      "content": "You’ve mastered the art of playing Genshin and eating. Sure, we all have to eat, but for a real Genshin addict, mealtime is no excuse for skipping boss raids and quests for artifacts. If you’re determined to feed your obsession over Genshin Impact, then you’ll bring your phone to the table and pour all your focus into it. After all, you only need one hand to shovel food into your face, and leveling up your character is way more important."

The next step is a bit harder, so brace yourself—tell everyone the astronomical amount of time you’ve spent on the game: maybe it’s upwards of 1,000 hours! Then, share how much cash you’ve dropped on your addiction. For example, maybe you spent some dough on pack bonuses here and there, but it actually added up to $3,000 USD altogether. What’s important is that you’re honest!"

Now, it’s time for your origin story about how you got started with Genshin Impact Some TikTokers edit their videos so it fades to gray as they walk down memory lane. They’ll explain how everything started innocently enough: for instance, they randomly scrolled through gaming forums and saw people talk about how great Genshin Impact was. Based on all the praise, they decided to give it a go. This segment foreshadows how a gaming addiction was bound to happen. [8] X Research source"

Whether you’re ashamed or just plain obsessed with Genshin Impact, it’s okay to speak your truth.

To curb your cravings, go cold turkey from all video games, which might give you the urge to leap into the world of Genshin Impact. Right now, take a break from the way gaming hijacks your brain’s reward center and floods it with dopamine, a feel-good hormone. You’ll probably go through a period of withdrawal, but it’ll be worth it to regain control of your life. Plus, it’ll get easier to resist the siren call of video games as time goes on. [9] X Research source If you can stomach it, delete the game from your computer altogether. Unplug your computer; you might even want to hide the power supply so you have no way to power up your gaming machine. Uninstall Genshin Impact from your phone so you can’t slip up and leap back into it."

Once you speak about what is bothering you, positively reframe whatever you bring up. For example, if you say, “I am hopelessly addicted to Genshin Impact,” reexamine that belief and declare, “I am perfectly able to play less Genshin Impact or even give it up altogether. I have a lot of willpower!” Your new attitude might help you feel better right away. [11] X Research source"

Some gamers are really tongue-in-cheek and don’t take it very seriously when they say they’ve got a Genshin Impact addiction. They ham it up and post a fake confessional video, then throw a curveball at the end by announcing they’re not a quitter and will always grind as hard as they can on Genshin Impact. Some people will say what’s next on the horizon for them. For example, they might declare, “Genshin Impact taught me one thing … when you want to give up … try again. The next time you go to that domain, you never know. You might get that nice Crit Rate substat that you’ve always wanted…” If you have the same unending love of Genshin Impact and it isn’t negatively impacting your life, play it to your heart’s content!"
