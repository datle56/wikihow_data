Keep the mandoline perpendicular to your shoulders so the raised end is closest to you to get the most control while you’re slicing. [1] X Research source Make sure to use a clean cutting board since the food you’re slicing will drop down onto it. Some mandolines have a container under the blade to catch the food as well. Avoid setting the mandoline parallel to your body because it’s more likely to slip or sit unevenly while you use it."

      "content": "Trim large or uneven foods into small pieces with flat edges. If the food you’re cutting is oblong or round, cut it into smaller pieces that have a flat edge. That way, you have better control of the food while you’re slicing it and ensure the pieces are cut to a uniform size. [2] X Research source Keep one end of the food rounded so it’s easier to hold onto."

      "title": "Place the food inside the mandoline’s hand guard.",
      "content": "Place the food inside the mandoline’s hand guard. Almost all mandolines come with a hand guard shaped like a bell or cylinder so you’re less likely to cut yourself. Place the food inside of the hand guard so the flat side faces down. [3] X Research source If your mandoline doesn’t come with a hand guard, private chef Andrea Lawson Gray recommends wearing a mesh cut-resistant glove to protect yourself from cuts. Even if your mandoline has a hand guard, she suggests putting on a glove for added protection. [4] X Expert Source Andrea Lawson Gray Private Chef Expert Interview. 10 February 2022.

      "title": "Slide the food back and forth across the blade.",
      "content": "Slide the food back and forth across the blade. Hold onto the top of the hand guard with your dominant hand and hold the mandoline’s legs down with your other. Set the food at the top of the mandoline and push it down toward the blade to start slicing. Slide the food back up to the top and repeat the up and down motion until you’re finished slicing. [5] X Research source Keep the food pressed against the side of the mandoline for extra support. If you’re cutting dry, starchy foods like potatoes, lightly wet the mandoline with some water to help the food slide more easily. Apply light and even pressure as you’re using your mandoline slicer so the pieces all have the same consistent size. When the piece of food is too small to run through the mandoline, finish slicing it with a knife so you don’t risk hurting yourself."

If you want your slices to be thinner or thicker, private chef Andrea Lawson Gray says to look for an adjustment dial on the side or bottom of the mandolin. [6] X Expert Source Andrea Lawson Gray Private Chef Expert Interview. 10 February 2022. Turn it and test a few slices of food to see how thick they are. Many mandolines also come with different blades to swap out if you want to cut your food into different shapes. [7] X Research source If you want to make straight cuts and even slices, then the original straight blade works best. To cut your food into thin strips or matchsticks, use the julienne blade. If you want to make crinkle or waffle cuts in your slices, install the crinkle blade. How you remove and change the blade on a mandoline depends on the brand and style, so refer to your model’s instruction manual."
