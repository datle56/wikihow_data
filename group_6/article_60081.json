      "content": "Write a closing. This is considered polite and professional when signing any type of business related letter or document. Closing lines should offer help, repeat an apology, or reference a future event. Some examples include: [2] X Research source I appreciate immediate attention on this matter. We hope to continue relying on your valued input as a customer. I once again apologize for inconveniences this may cause. If you require further information, don't hesitate to ask.

      "content": "Format your letter correctly. For a business letter it is very important that you format your closing correctly, but don't worry. It's easy. Enter one return or one print-size space between the last line of your letter and the letter closing to format your signature appropriately. This should be flush with the left margin in block formatted text, or centered below the body of the letter in line with the date in modified block format. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add a complimentary closing.",
      "content": "Add a complimentary closing. This is typically a one or two words that follow your formal closing. Choose an appropriate closing for the letter you're writing. The closing of business letters should be professional and respectful. Depending on the purpose of the memo or letter and the person who'll be receiving it, different closings may be more appropriate than others.The complimentary close begins with a capital letter and ends with a comma. No other word listed in the closing should be capitalized. [4] X Research source Include something like: Respectfully, Respectfully yours, Sincerely, Best wishes, All the best, Warm regards, Consider to whom you're writing. A Senior Vice President of a company may require a more formal closing (\"Sincerely\") than the Sales Representative you play basketball with (\"Cheers\"). Consider the purpose of the letter. A company memo introducing new policies will deem a more formal closing than a note of congratulations to a colleague who was recently promoted (\"All best\"). Try using something like \"best regards,\" or \"best wishes,\" if the recipient is your close contact. \"Yours sincerely\" is better reserved for when you know the recipient whereas \"Sincerely\" is typically used if you do not know the recipient.

Indent to keep your text flush with the complimentary closing and type your name. Include any titles like Miss, Mrs., Ms. before your name. [6] X Research source The signature line may include a second line for a job title or position (like Course Director) if appropriate. It is always best to write the first name in full.

      "content": "Use a basic letter closing. You have more freedom to get casual and even a little silly if you are writing a personal letter to someone you know very well. Use your best judgment and work within the bounds of your relationship and the reason for your letter to choose the best closing. Any of the following should work fine: Love, With love, Yours, Your friend, Take care, Best wishes, Peace and love, Thinking of you,"

      "content": "Write an intimate sign-off (optional). If you're writing to a lover, ending words can be even more intimate. A genuine, personable closing helps the letter sound like it came from you, not a store-bought greeting card. The right phrase might even improve your relationship. Follow the sign-off with your initials or signature. Consider these: Love always, Yours forever, Affectionately yours, Longing to see you, Patiently yours, Your darling,"

      "title": "Sign the letter under the closing.",
      "content": "Sign the letter under the closing. Unlike a business letter, in a personal letter you do not need to type your name to make it legible and formal, assuming the person is familiar with you. Simply sign your name by hand directly under the letter closing. Use your first and last name when signing. If you know the person well, it's okay to sign with your first name only. Sign with your first and last name if you’re writing to someone you’ve never met face to face. Use your first name or nickname on letters to friends or business associates who know you."

      "title": "Add a postscript for a more personal touch.",
      "content": "Add a postscript for a more personal touch. Sometimes postscripts are included as a way to lighten a letter's tone with a joke, or to playfully flirt with the recipient. Since postscripts are usually just a sentence or two, they can be used as a way of including information without the pressure of writing an explanation. Take these, for example: \"P.S. I already finished off the box of chocolates. Please send more supplies.\" \"P.S. Oh, I forgot to mention one thing: I'm madly in love with you.\""
