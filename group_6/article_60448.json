      "content": "Stop and ask yourself if your worries make sense. Jealousy is really a reaction to fear or anxiety. Next time you start feeling jealous, think about where those feelings are coming from, and try to look at them logically. Are you jumping to conclusions about your partner’s behavior? Do you have unreasonable expectations about how they should act in a relationship? [1] X Research source For instance, maybe you get upset whenever your SO works late, because a previous partner used that as an excuse when they were being unfaithful to you. Ask yourself, “Do I have good reason to think the same thing is happening now? Is there actually any other evidence that they’re cheating?” In some cases, you or your partner might have legitimate reasons to feel jealous or insecure. Ask yourself if your partner is honest and respectful with you, and vice versa. If not, it might be time to step back and rethink whether the relationship is really working. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Resist the urge to act on or obsess over those thoughts. Jealous thoughts and feelings are normal, and there’s no way to totally prevent them from happening. However, by noticing these thoughts and allowing them to happen without judging, pushing them down, or acting on them, you can make them a little less powerful. Just think to yourself, “I’m feeling jealous again,” or “There’s another one of those insecure thoughts.” [3] X Research source Try imagining the jealous thoughts flowing through you. Don’t try to force them to go. Just breathe deeply and picture them being carried off down the stream of your thoughts until they disappear. Alternatively, write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal or a private document on your computer. Putting your worries down in writing can make them feel less urgent and overwhelming. When you feel jealous, don’t react by angrily confronting your partner, trying to spy on them, or going through their phone for “evidence.” Those sorts of behaviors won’t make you feel better—they’ll just create more tension and hard feelings in your relationship.

      "content": "Brainstorm ways to deal with your triggers once you identify them. Jealousy often comes from a place of insecurity inside yourself, but certain situations or thoughts tend to set those feelings off. Next time you feel jealous, write down the situation and the exact thoughts and feelings you’re having. Look for patterns that help you understand the underlying issues behind your jealousy. [5] X Research source For instance, maybe you get jealous whenever you see your SO conversing with someone attractive. You might notice that you have thoughts like, “I’ll never be that good-looking.” This might mean that the source of your jealousy is actually insecurity about your own attractiveness—not anything your SO is doing. Once you have an idea of what’s causing the jealousy, you can work on addressing it (for instance, by challenging unrealistic or negative thoughts about yourself)."

Instead of taking those feelings out on your partner or letting them fester, look for ways to unwind and soothe yourself. Next time you feel jealous, try something like: [6] X Research source Meditating. Doing mindful meditation is especially good for helping you notice and deal with negative thoughts and feelings that might contribute to jealousy. Going for a walk or getting some exercise. Working on a creative project or hobby. Talking to a supportive friend or family member. Reading a book or watching a favorite TV show or movie. Listening to peaceful music."

      "title": "Let your partner know if you feel insecure about something.",
      "content": "Let your partner know if you feel insecure about something. But make sure to do it in a gentle, non-accusing way. Explain why you feel the way you do and ask for some assurance that everything is okay between you. Ask them to do the same if they start feeling insecure. If each of you knows what the other is feeling, you’ll understand each other better—which will make it easier to offer reassurance or talk about ways to address the problem. [7] X Research source Say something like, “Hey, sometimes I feel a little insecure when you spend so much time texting your coworker. I know it’s probably nothing, but I’d just like a little reassurance that there’s nothing going on between you two.” Likewise, if you’re bothered by your partner’s jealous behaviors, don’t hesitate to let them know. Try saying, “I feel really uncomfortable when you keep calling while I’m out with my friends. Can we talk about what’s going on?” [8] X Research source When they respond, actively listen to what they have to say and really make an effort to understand it. Don’t interrupt or try to contradict or minimize what they’re saying, even if you don’t agree."

[9] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. For instance, instead of saying, “You’re always looking at other women!” try something like, “I felt really sad and insecure when I saw you looking at her that way.” Try the same technique if your partner is the jealous one. Instead of, “You’re so suspicious all the time, why don’t you cut me some slack?” try something like, “I get really uncomfortable when you grill me about what I’ve been doing at work. Can you please try to give me the benefit of the doubt?”"

Likewise, snapping at an insecure partner won’t put them at ease. When you talk to your partner about jealousy, look at it as a conversation rather than a confrontation. If you feel your temper rising, stop and take some deep breaths, or take a break and try again later. [10] X Research source You could say something like, “I think we’re both starting to get tense, and I don’t want this to turn into a big argument. I’m going to go for a walk and clear my head. We can talk more later.” If you’re having trouble calming down in the moment, try taking 3 deep, slow breaths. You can also try counting to 10 backwards or focusing on something you can feel, see, smell, or hear.

      "content": "Compassion and empathy will help you build trust. Jealousy is often irrational. If your partner is jealous, it can be really hard to understand where they’re coming from. It can be equally hard to understand your SO’s behavior if you’re the one feeling jealous or insecure. Do your best to try to imagine the situation from their perspective, though—not only will you understand them better, but you might identify changes you can make in your own behavior. [12] X Research source For instance, ask yourself where your jealous partner’s feelings might be coming from. Did they have a bad experience in a past relationship? Have you ever hidden things from them or lied about something, even if it was something minor? If you’re jealous, think about how your behavior comes across to your partner. Are you constantly checking in on them or grilling them about what they’ve been doing? How would you feel if they did the same to you?"

[13] X Research source Say something like, “I know you feel really anxious when I’m out late, and I totally get it. I care about you a lot and want us to be able to trust each other.” If you struggle with jealousy, say something like, “I realize that it gets on your nerves when I keep asking questions like this. I’m trying hard to be more trusting, and I hope you can be patient with me while I work through these feelings.”"

But being transparent and open with each other will go a long way towards keeping jealousy at bay. Be open about your feelings, avoid lying to one another, and be ready to own up if you do make a mistake. [14] X Research source Talk to your partner about setting some accountability ground rules that you can both agree on. For example, you might promise to call each other if you’re going to be out late, or agree to check in occasionally when you’re spending time with friends. [15] X Research source Avoid lying to your partner about things, even if you think the truth might upset them. You’ll set a good example with your honesty and help them see that they can trust you to tell the truth. You can also set reasonable expectations about how you and your sweetheart behave with other people. For example, you might both agree not to follow exes on social media or make flirty comments to other people. [16] X Research source"

Think about what kinds of behaviors you will and will not tolerate from your SO, and ask them to do the same. Be gentle and respectful, but also firm. [18] X Research source For instance, you might say, “I’m just going out to have a couple drinks with my friends from out of town. I’ll call you to check in when I get to the bar, but I can’t keep texting back and forth all evening.” Respect your partner’s need to have outside relationships and time away from you. Ask them to do the same for you."

Find time to do fun things together, have deep conversations, or even just hang out in the same space while you both work on something. The more positive interactions you have, the more secure you’ll both feel in the relationship! [19] X Research source It can be hard to find one-on-one time when you’re both really busy, so be intentional about it. Try setting aside a time at least once a week to do something together. Even when you’re not doing anything special together, look for ways to show appreciation and affection for your SO. For example, give them a kiss or squeeze their shoulder when you walk by, leave them a little note to say “I love you,” or take a moment to thank them for something nice they did."

      "content": "Sometimes, jealous behaviors can become toxic or abusive. Occasional jealousy or insecurity is normal. But if it gets out of hand, it can become really harmful. Take a good, honest look at your partner’s behavior (or your own). If you see any warning signs, have a serious talk with your partner about it. If they’re not willing to listen or work with you, it may be time to move on or get outside help. There may be a problem if: [20] X Research source You feel like your partner tries to control who you can spend time with, or vice versa. Your partner expects you to check in with them constantly, or you expect them to do so. You and/or your SO are always suspicious of one another or refuse to give each other the benefit of the doubt. One or both of you acts possessive or gets angry easily. One or both of you feels the need to spy on the other or check the other’s emails or texts."

If jealous feelings are putting a huge strain on your relationship and nothing seems to be helping, talk to your loved one about seeing a counselor together. An experienced and objective therapist can help you understand what’s causing the problem and find healthy ways to work through it. [21] X Research source If your partner won’t go to therapy with you, consider going on your own. You can still learn valuable coping skills that might help you deal with your own jealous feelings, cope with your partner’s behavior, or decide if it’s time to move on. You might also find it helpful to vent to a close friend or family member about what you’re going through. Just talking to someone sympathetic and getting an outside perspective can be a big help.
