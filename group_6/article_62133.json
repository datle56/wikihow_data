      "content": "“Natty” a.k.a. “natural” athletes don’t use performance-enhancing drugs. Some athletes use steroids, hormones, and other substances to increase their overall fitness beyond what is naturally achievable for the human body. [1] X Research source Natty athletes, on the other hand, avoid these substances, relying solely on their training and natural athletic ability. [2] X Research source Performance-enhancing substances may help athletes achieve greater strength, speed, and endurance. They can also help bodybuilders put on more muscle. Many sports ban these substances since they give athletes an unfair advantage over their competition."

      "title": "Being “natty” is a badge of honor among weightlifters.",
      "content": "Being “natty” is a badge of honor among weightlifters. Natty weightlifters pride themselves on achieving results through discipline and hard work alone. Since they don’t rely on drugs or artificial substances, they take full credit for every ounce of muscle they gain and every pound of weight they lift. They sometimes view people who use performance-enhancing substances as cheaters. [3] X Research source Natty athletes, including weightlifters, may follow extremely strict diets and workout regimens to achieve their desired results. Athletes who use performance-enhancing substances, on the other hand, may achieve similar even greater results with the same effort—but at the cost of being labeled “not natty.”"

      "content": "A “natty physique” doesn’t always come with big muscles. A natty weightlifter who trains hard and eats a balanced diet will slowly build muscle. But they won’t necessarily look huge or “shredded”—meaning they won’t always have a low body fat percentage. [4] X Research source Weightlifters who use performance-enhancing drugs may develop massive muscles and a very low body fat percentage."

      "title": "Some gym goers lie about being natty.",
      "content": "Some gym goers lie about being natty. Steroid use is more common than you might think, even among casual weightlifters. Social media influencers may claim to be natty, for instance, despite maintaining unnaturally large muscles and low body fat for months at a time. These “fake natties” can cause unrealistic expectations of what normal, healthy bodies look like. [5] X Research source Even many professional weightlifters are not natty. Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example, has acknowledged using steroids during his bodybuilding career. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Natty bodybuilders rely solely on training and diet to gain muscle.",
      "content": "Natty bodybuilders rely solely on training and diet to gain muscle. They closely track their calories and macronutrients—protein, fat, and carbohydrates—to ensure they’re getting the right nutrients for muscle growth. They eat extra calories to gain weight and work out frequently to ensure the weight comes from muscle, not fat. [7] X Research source Natty bodybuilders also combine weightlifting and cardiovascular exercises, like running, to keep themselves as lean as possible. In most cases, they aim to change their weight slowly and steadily to keep their natural hormone levels in check."

      "title": "Natty bodybuilding is much safer than using substances.",
      "content": "Natty bodybuilding is much safer than using substances. Performance-enhancing substances can wreak havoc on the body. Anabolic steroids, for instance, can cause side effects like acne, sleep problems, abnormal hair growth, changes in libido, liver damage, mood swings, and even nerve damage from needle use. Natural bodybuilders don’t have to worry about these side effects. [8] X Research source Bodybuilders who stop using anabolic steroids may also suffer from withdrawal symptoms like fatigue, depression, and decreased strength."

      "title": "Experienced natty weightlifters can’t put on new muscle easily.",
      "content": "Experienced natty weightlifters can’t put on new muscle easily. New weightlifters will gain muscle rapidly, but these “beginner gains” don’t continue forever. Over time, a natty weightlifter will plateau, and additional muscle gains may take months or years. [9] X Research source Weightlifters may use steroids to overcome this plateau and build muscle indefinitely."

      "title": "Natty bodybuilders can’t get as big as steroid users.",
      "content": "Natty bodybuilders can’t get as big as steroid users. Without steroids and performance-enhancing substances, natty gym goers can’t pack on muscle to the same degree as professional bodybuilders. However natty weightlifters can still develop excellent physiques and superior strength with extensive training and a good diet. [10] X Research source The exact natural limit of a natty bodybuilder’s size depends on their genetics, age, training, diet, and other factors."
