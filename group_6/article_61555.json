      "content": "Learn what Bluetooth does. Bluetooth is a wireless connectivity tool that allows you to \"pair\" your devices so that they can interact with each other. For example, you can pair a headset with most smartphones, allowing you to talk without touching your phone. You can pair a gaming controller to a computer or console so you don't have to worry about the cord. You can send music to a Bluetooth-enabled speaker from your smartphone or laptop without having to connect them, or set up a home theater system without running speaker wire everywhere. Bluetooth has a maximum range of about 30 feet. Bluetooth transfer speeds top out at about 24 Mbps."

      "content": "Check if your devices are Bluetooth-capable. Bluetooth has been around for a long time (about 20 years), and is the market leader in wireless connectivity. Chances are that your wireless device comes with Bluetooth support. The big exception to this is desktop computers. While nearly all laptops will have Bluetooth built-in, most desktops do not include it. You will need to purchase a Bluetooth dongle and enable it if you want to connect your desktop computer to Bluetooth devices. Many modern cars now have Bluetooth capabilities, allowing you to pair your phone while you are driving. Virtually every smartphone is able to pair with Bluetooth devices. Many newer printers are Bluetooth-capable, and can print wirelessly across the room."

      "title": "Pair your Bluetooth devices.",
      "content": "Pair your Bluetooth devices. In order to use Bluetooth technology, you must connect your devices to one another wirelessly, also known as \"pairing\". The pairing process varies from device to device, but generally you will have one device that is \"listening\", and then the secondary device gets put into pairing mode. For example, if you are pairing a headset to a phone, your phone would be in \"listen\" mode, and the headset would be put into \"pairing\" mode. The phone would then \"discover\" the headset, and the connection would be established. Follow the instructions provided with your Bluetooth devices to complete the pairing process. In most cases, you will be required to perform a series of specific steps that will result in the pairing of your devices. When pairing devices, you typically will be asked for a PIN before the connection is made. If a PIN was never set, the default is usually 0000 . Pairing typically only needs to be done once. AS long as Bluetooth is enabled on the devices, future connections will happen automatically."
