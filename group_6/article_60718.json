      "content": "Grab everything you might need to shower after gym class. Your school might provide some things for you, but in general, it’s a good idea to bring your own hygiene products with you. Before you go to sleep, pack a bag full of things like: [1] X Research source Body wash Shampoo (if you’re washing your hair) Face wash Deodorant Clean clothes Flip flops Pads or tampons (for showering on your period)"

      "content": "Take a large towel with you to avoid using a skimpy one. If your school locker room has towels for you, you’ve probably noticed that they aren’t the best (or the biggest) around. Grab a towel and take it with you to the locker room so you can keep everything covered up. [2] X Research source Taking your own towel isn’t strictly necessary, but it can really make you feel more at ease during the entire process."

      "title": "Get to the locker room before everyone else for a head start.",
      "content": "Get to the locker room before everyone else for a head start. If you’re nervous about showering in front of others, ask your coach or your teacher if you can leave class a couple of minutes early. If you can do that, you might even be able to shower and get dressed before the other students come trickling in. [3] X Research source Not every coach or teacher will let you go early, but it doesn’t hurt to ask. Once you get undressed, and make sure you have everything you need, you’re free to jump in the shower. Don’t actually jump though, you might slip and fall. Get in the shower slowly and carefully."

      "title": "Keep your towel close by so it’s within reach.",
      "content": "Keep your towel close by so it’s within reach. Head over to the showers and place your towel on the hook that’s just outside the shower curtain. That way, when you’re done showering, you can simply reach outside and grab your towel without stepping out of the shower. [4] X Research source If your school’s showers don’t have shower curtains, pick a corner shower that’s far away from everyone else. You might not be able to hide completely, but a corner shower is much less exposed than one in the center."

      "content": "Shower in under 5 minutes to get out of there quickly. Now is not the time for a luxurious, long shower: the goal here is to get in and get out. If you can, skip washing your hair and just focus on your body. Quickly rinse, suds up, and then rinse again. [6] X Research source If you do want to wash your hair, consider bringing a 2-in-1 body wash and shampoo product. That way, you have less to carry, and it will make your shower go faster."

      "content": "Quickly dry off behind the shower curtain to avoid walking around naked. When your shower is done, turn off the water, but don’t exit the shower area just yet. Reach for your shower and grab it, then bring it inside of the shower stall to dry your body. [7] X Research source This also saves you from dripping water all over the locker room, which can be annoying for the other students."

Wrap it tightly around your chest or your waist, and keep one hand on it so it doesn’t fall down. [8] X Research source Or, buy a terry-cloth towel with Velcro on top to keep your towel in place. You can even use your towel to cover yourself as you get dressed at your locker. Put on your underwear and pants without taking the towel off, then quickly put on a bra or a shirt before pulling the towel off all the way."

Be sure to apply some deodorant—your fellow classmates will thank you. [9] X Research source You can use colognes or body sprays if you’d like, but try not to go overboard. In general, you only need 2 to 4 spritzes of spray."

Your classmates are probably going to be showering and getting dressed at the same time as you are, and they most likely aren’t super stoked about it, either. While you’re in the locker room, be respectful of others, and don’t stare or make comments about anyone’s body. [11] X Research source In general, just treat other people in the locker room like you’d want them to treat you (which mostly means ignoring each other until everyone’s fully dressed)."
