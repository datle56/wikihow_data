      "content": "Vacuum, sweep, or lightly shake the rug free of debris. All kinds of debris end up between the intricate threads of a rug. So, before removing the rug cover and tossing it into your washer, do your machine a favor and vacuum or shake the rug free of any loose crumbs, dirt, dust, and anything else that may be lingering. [1] X Research source Use a low suction/low power and high pile height setting. Push along the rug away from you, and lift the vacuum off the cover before bringing it back toward you. Avoid the edges and corners since these get easily damaged. [2] X Research source Some Ruggables, like the re-jutes, outdoor rugs, doormats, and rubber mats, are easier to sweep or shake. Vacuum tufted, flatwoven, or plush rugs."

      "content": "Place the rug cover into the washing machine. Remove the Ruggable rug cover from the pad by lifting the fabric from one corner and peeling it off. Give the cover another shake and place it inside an appropriately sized washing machine. [3] X Research source Ruggable recommends placing Runners, 2x3, 3x5, 4x6, 5x7, and 6’ rounded rugs inside washers with at least 2.2 cubic feet. [4] X Research source Put 6x9, 8’ round, 8x10, and 9x12 rugs in washers with at least 3.8 cubic feet. 10x14 rugs are only suitable for washers with at least 5.5 cubic feet. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Machine-wash on a cold, delicate cycle with non-bleach detergent. Fill the detergent compartment on your washing machine with mild, non-bleach detergent , or place a detergent pod into the tub. Adjust the machine’s settings to cold water and use a delicate cycle to keep the rug in tip-top shape. [6] X Research source You can also use Borax or other antifungal compounds on Ruggables. [7] X Research source Avoid using fabric softener, though, as it may affect the rug's texture. [8] X Research source If you’re washing a doormat or rubber mat, use a garden hose with soap and water to clean the surface."

      "title": "Dry the cover on low heat or air dry.",
      "content": "Dry the cover on low heat or air dry. Once the Ruggable is clean, place the cover in the dryer and select the lowest heat setting available. Alternatively, hang and air-dry the cover in a sunny area with good ventilation. [9] X Research source It can take one to two days to air dry your Ruggable, depending on the weather conditions and the cover size. [10] X Research source If you have a plush Ruggable, hang dry it for the best results. Or, use a delicate tumble-dry or air-fluff setting. Flatwoven, plush, faux hide, bath mats, and tufted rugs can be dried on low heat or air-dried. Re-Jute, doormats, shag, and outdoor rugs can only be tumble- or air-dried. Rubber mats should only be air-dried."

If you have any physical debris on your rug—like a melted chocolate bar—remove the extra mess with your hands, a spoon, a dull knife, or another appropriate tool. Take a color-safe cloth or paper towel to soak up excess liquid or similar messes. [11] X Research source Blotting helps prevent the spreading of the stain."

Combine the mixture with a fork or whisk until bubbles form. [12] X Research source If you’re using a spray bottle, shake the closed bottle to combine. It’s always best to treat the stain as quickly as possible."

      "content": "Lay a dry towel over the damp area to speed up the drying process. A dry towel over the damp area can help absorb the excess moisture from the rug. Add pressure with your foot or hand until you no longer feel more moisture coming up. If it’s still damp, use another dry towel and put a heavy object on top for 30 to 60 minutes. [15] X Research source If you’re cleaning flat woven, plush, faux hide, bath mats, and tufted rugs, toss them in the dryer on low heat. Re-Jute, doormats, shag, and outdoor rugs can only be tumble- or air-dried. Rubber mats should only be air-dried."

Purchase an enzyme-based or oxygen-based stain remover , which work best on Ruggable products. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and apply the solution to the affected area. For powder stain removers , soak the stained area in a mixture of the powder and room-temperature water for a few hours or overnight before washing. [16] X Research source Alternatively, use a carpet spot cleaner on the affected area. Let it sit for 10 minutes. Sprinkle a thick layer of baking soda over stubborn spills, like oil."

Add another 2 US tbsp (6.0 tsp) baking soda and 1 c (16 US tbsp) vinegar into the washer and machine wash on cold, using a normal cycle with mild, non-bleach detergent. Dry on low heat or hang dry.

Use a vacuum on a low suction setting or sweep the pad. [19] X Research source"
