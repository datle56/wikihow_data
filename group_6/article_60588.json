      "content": "Understand what subdividing property means. Subdividing property means dividing it into several parts. Land owners typically subdivide their property into multiple residential units. This usually increases the value of the land. [1] X Research source When the land is subdivided into more than one lot, each lot is then sold to one or more buyers. This is more profitable than keeping the property as one residential unit. Smaller residential lots may be easier to sell than larger pieces of land. This increases the overall value of the land."

      "content": "Evaluate the risk of subdividing your property. Subdividing property is commonplace among land developers, builders, real estate agents and other professionals. However, if you are new to the process, it can be risky if you don’t do your due diligence. Evaluate a number of preliminary items to determine whether your property is even eligible for subdivision. You could waste a lot of time and money designing and applying for a subdivision when your property isn’t even eligible. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider the size and scope of your plans.",
      "content": "Consider the size and scope of your plans. The complexities associated with subdividing property increase as the property size increases. It is less complicated to subdivide a smaller piece of property (one that is less than an acre in size) into only two plots. Larger projects are more complex. Once you start planning to divide properties that are larger than an acre into three or more plots, things get much more complicated. [3] X Research source Other factors that complicate subdivision of property include whether the lot fronts an existing public road and whether you intend to build new roads, utilities and other infrastructure. Depending on the site design and layout, a subdivision project can easily escalate into a full-scale community development project. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Check for restrictions.",
      "content": "Check for restrictions. Make sure there are no local ordinances, neighborhood covenants or deed restrictions that may block your plans. A title search will identify any of these problems as well as the existence of any outstanding liens or other claims on the land. [5] X Research source Find a title company. Your real estate agent or lender can recommend one with whom they usually work, or you can get recommendations from peers. The title company does the title search to make sure that the seller has the legal right to sell the property. [6] X Research source Once the title company verifies the validity of the title, they will release a title-opinion letter that states their findings. The title company will also issue title insurance. Title insurance protects the buyer should previous owners or debtors state they have a claim on the property. [7] X Research source During the title search, the title company scrutinizes old deeds to verify that the seller is the only owner of the property. The title search also uncovers any unpaid debts on the property, such as taxes, liens or loans. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Estimate the impact of the market on your subdivided property.",
      "content": "Estimate the impact of the market on your subdivided property. Make sure there is a market for lots in your area. Sell them at a price that makes sense. Research the market and other properties in the area to determine a lot size, layout and price that is marketable in the area. [9] X Research source Consult a trusted real estate agent with local experience for advice on this matter. Get input from other builders who have worked in your area. Understand that the location of your property impacts its current value and how it might appreciate. Study the values of properties that are currently on the market in the area and others that have sold in the recent past. [10] X Research source For example, if you are planning to subdivide property to build residential homes, determine the home and lot size that will carry the highest value in your location. If most homes that sell in the area are smaller or are on smaller lots, don't elect to build large, expensive houses on big lots. They won't sell for nearly as much as they might in a more upscale neighborhood. An appraiser won't be able to assign a value to a home that's any higher than the highest home price in the location. So it's wise to research the market and begin with an appropriate size and price in mind. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Understand zoning and other requirements. Even if there are no ordinances, covenants or other restrictions stopping you from subdividing the land, local zoning, subdivision and property-development laws may affect your plans. Every municipality and county has its own zoning regulations, lot- and building-size restrictions and requirements pertaining to open space. Research these laws before investing in any plans to subdivide the property. It is possible to apply for zoning variances, which may be granted if your request is deemed reasonable. [12] X Research source Contact the municipal planning and building department of the township or municipality to learn the property's zoning category. If you cannot find the information there, research local laws on websites such as State and Local Government on the Net or the Municipal Code Corporation (Municode). [13] X Research source Zoning and local rules may affect the way the property can be used. The neighborhood might be classified for single-family residential, multi-family residential, transitional, or a mixed use such as residential plus commercial. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Confirm that all of your lots will be properly serviced.",
      "content": "Confirm that all of your lots will be properly serviced. You will not be able to sell the properties if they do not have access to public roads and utilities such as water, sewer and power. Confirm that these utilities are available for your lots and that they can handle the added capacity of the new residences you plan to build there. [15] X Research source This process is sometimes referred to as site development or technical due diligence. It is the process of evaluating the availability of and options for key utilities and infrastructure at the building lot like power, water, sewer and communications. [16] X Research source If you are buying a finished lot for sale, your agreement with the builder will cover these services. If you are buying a vacant or undeveloped lot outside of a neighborhood or established city limit, you will have to make plans for getting power, water, sewer and communications services to the property. [17] X Research source Electric and gas power can be brought to the property by the power company. Don't rule out alternative or green sources of power: solar, natural gas, propane, heating oil or even geothermal. [18] X Research source Even if sewer and public water are available for a parcel of land, you may have to make arrangements to extend these services to the structures you plan to build. Consider alternatives like wells, and rainwater containment and filtration systems. Public sewer service is not always available. In these cases you may have to install a septic system. [19] X Research source Plan to wire appropriately for the types of communications systems you want to install, such as high-speed Internet, telephone and cable television. [20] X Research source Costs for site development can add up significantly. These costs include fees and permits and will vary depending on site and soil conditions, your development plans, and local fees and permitting costs. [21] X Research source The town or state may also charge you impact fees. These help communities pay for schools, infrastructure and other public costs associated with adding new homes to the community. Impact fees can conceivably be quite high. [22] X Research source"

The plan will specify how the land is to be divided, including the number and size of subdivisions. The design should also illustrate how roads will reach the properties. [27] X Research source Hire a firm that employs civil engineers, land surveyors and environmental consultants with experience in your area. They will begin by studying the topography of the land and identifying critical resource areas that cannot be developed. They will use this information to draft approximate property lines. Then they will review local bylaws and present you with concept sketches that show you options for development of the site. Open-space subdivisions conserve open space with shorter roads and reduced lot frontage. Mixed-use developments include residential, business and recreational areas. Affordable housing developments not only help low-income people to purchase a home, but they can also turn sites with difficult constraints or little design potential into lucrative properties. Senior housing combines open space with accessible recreation and condominiums. It can be a way to attract new residents to an area without overburdening the schools. Once you choose the subdivision you want, the design firm will work with you to survey the land, delineate wetlands, design drainage and control erosion."

[29] X Research source [30] X Research source Once you have your subdivision plans all put together, go to the local planning board and schedule a pre-lodgement meeting. Bring your certificate of title and your subdivision plans. Show how big the property is, and identify areas for open spaces, existing and new houses, driveways and car parks. Urban planners on the council will review your proposal to make sure it meets local planning policies and guidelines. Don't be surprised if they make recommendations for you to adjust or refine your plans. If necessary, meet with your team of architects, land surveyors and development planners to rework the plan to meet the council's recommendations. Once you have met the above requirements, it is time to lodge your application. The township or municipality will accept your application and go through the process of approving it. This process can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months. Track your application by communicating with the council frequently to see if they have questions or need more information."
