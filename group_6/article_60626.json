      "title": "Find a Desert Temple.",
      "content": "Find a Desert Temple. Minecraft randomly generates worlds, so there's no foolproof way to find a temple. However, you can start by finding a desert biome; these are characterized by cacti, sand, sandstone, and small, dead bushes. If you want to skip this part, try looking online for Desert Temple seeds. There are plenty of seeds that will spawn you right next to or very close to one of these structuresâ€”some may even include multiple temples! If you want, find a seed with lots of desert temples. Then recreate that map/seed and go into creative mode. Write down the coordinates of important things in the real world, then go back to your survival world in Minecraft. Now you know where to find important buildings and treasure!"

      "content": "Enter the temple. Be careful; there could be various monsters inside, taking refuge from the sunlight. Add some torches, just to be safe, and check around so that nothing will sneak up on you. It's good to have a strong sword or bow on you when you enter."

      "content": "Be careful as you proceed. At the bottom of the room under the temple, there is a pressure plate; landing on it will activate 9 TNT, which will almost certainly kill you if you have bad armor. [1] X Research source There are a couple of ways to safely get to the bottom: Spiral stairs: place blocks along the sides of the room, each lower than the next, until you reach the bottom. Avoid stepping on the pressure plate once you get there. Mining down: choose a block adjacent to the opening of the chasm and mine down until you reach the floor."
