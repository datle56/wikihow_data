      "content": "Memorize the shifting pattern for your car. If you cannot see the pattern physically, check the knob on top of the shifter to see where the gears are located. Many manual transmission cars will be in an H-shaped pattern with the odd-numbered gears on top and the even-numbered gears on bottom. [1] X Research source For instance, in many cars, first gear is directly above second gear, third gear is to the right of first gear and directly above fourth gear, and fifth gear is to the right of third gear and directly above reverse. Neutral position may be indicated with the letter N. Otherwise, your car is in neutral as long as your shifter isn’t in any other gear."

      "content": "Use your right hand to change gears. Manual transmission cars require you to actively switch between the gears. Keep your right hand on the shifter so you’re prepared to change gears. [2] X Research source Avoid using your phone or adjusting the radio when you drive a manual transmission. Focus on shifting gears and on the road in front of you."

[3] X Expert Source Ibrahim Onerli Driving Instructor Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. Avoid holding your foot on the clutch, or else you could wear it down and make it more difficult to shift as your car ages. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Start in neutral with the parking brake engaged. Since manual transmission cars don’t have a parking gear, the vehicle should already be in neutral with the parking brake on. Check to make sure the shifter is set to neutral and your parking brake is on. [5] X Research source If the parking brake isn’t engaged, your vehicle will roll. Most cars have a light on the dashboard signifying if the parking brake is activated."

Use the shifter on your right side to transition into first gear. [7] X Research source On a standard 5-speed car, the first gear is located to the left and up on the gear shift. Otherwise, check the top of your shifter to see if it has a guide to where the gears are located."

You’ll feel a rocking movement on the pedal when the clutch disc tries to catch once your engine hits the right speed. [9] X Research source If you run at lower RPM, your vehicle will stall and you will have to start your car again. When you feel the clutch disc trying to catch, this is known as the “friction point.”"
