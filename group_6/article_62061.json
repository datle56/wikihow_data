      "title": "Travelers who miss flights due to cancellations or delays get priority.",
      "content": "Travelers who miss flights due to cancellations or delays get priority. When travelers request standby flights after their original flights were canceled, or after missing a connection due to delays, the airline will place those travelers’ names at the top of the standby list. If there are open seats on another flight to the same destination, those names will be called first. [1] X Research source If other travelers ask to be added to the standby list, their names may be called next, assuming there are still seats available."

      "title": "You’re more likely to get standby on flights with plenty of open seats.",
      "content": "You’re more likely to get standby on flights with plenty of open seats. Airlines only allow standby passengers if there’s room on a flight. Full flights are a no-go, but if there are several open seats, you might get lucky and nab one. [2] X Research source The number of open seats on a flight can vary depending on the airline, route, the day of the week, or even the time of year."

    {
      "title": "The higher you are on the standby list, the more likely you’ll get a seat.",
      "content": "The higher you are on the standby list, the more likely you’ll get a seat. After adding your name to the standby list, you’ll wait at the gate until the non-standby passengers finish boarding. The staff will call names in the order they were added. So if there are six names on the list but only three open seats, you’re much more likely to get a seat if you’re one of the top three names. [3] X Research source Sometimes, you may still get a standby seat if your name is lower on the list. For example, a couple traveling together may turn down the last standby seat because a second seat is not available. When this happens, the staff will continue down the list until someone takes that seat."

    {
      "title": "Some airlines prioritize first class and business class travelers.",
      "content": "Some airlines prioritize first class and business class travelers. Paying more comes with lots of perks, including dibs on open seats. For example, United Airlines’ official policy is to give standby seats to first class and business passengers before economy class passengers, even when an economy class passenger makes the request first. [4] X Research source First and business class passengers pay large sums of money for this special treatment."

    {
      "title": "Airlines prefer to give standby flights to their most loyal customers.",
      "content": "Airlines prefer to give standby flights to their most loyal customers. Airlines with frequent flyer programs reward their members by giving them standby seats before other passengers of the same airline class. In other words, if two economy class passengers are on a standby list, but one is a member of the airline’s loyalty program, the member will usually be offered a seat before the other passenger. [5] X Research source This may not apply to passengers of different airline classes. For example, an airline might prioritize a non-member first class passenger over a frequent flyer economy passenger since the first class passenger likely spent much more for their seat."

    {
      "title": "It’s easier to get standby seats on less popular routes.",
      "content": "It’s easier to get standby seats on less popular routes. Planes on busy routes fill up fast, especially if they fly to major airports and popular travel destinations. But less busy routes aren’t so packed, so open seats are easier to come by. [6] X Research source In some cases, less popular routes have fewer flights, so getting a standby seat may still be challenging."

    {
      "title": "It’s harder to get a standby seat during peak travel seasons.",
      "content": "It’s harder to get a standby seat during peak travel seasons. Airlines are stretched thin during the holidays and popular vacation months. Everyone is trying to fly and planes are often filled to capacity. Getting a standby flight could be difficult, especially if other passengers are given priority on open seats. [7] X Research source Flight cancellations and rebookings are also more common during peak travel seasons. When this happens, open seats may be given to passengers from canceled flights."

      "title": "You’re more likely to get a standby seat Monday-Thursday.",
      "content": "You’re more likely to get a standby seat Monday-Thursday. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are the busiest days for most airlines, and flights are more likely to be fully booked. The first four days of the workweek, Monday through Thursday, tend to be slower. [8] X Research source During peak travel seasons, any day of the week could be busy."

      "title": "Arrive at the airport early.",
      "content": "Arrive at the airport early. Most airlines only allow standby for earlier flights to the same destination. Check online for a list of earlier flights, then arrive a few hours before those flights. Add your name to the standby list using at the airport, or via the airline’s website or mobile app. [9] X Research source Give yourself enough time to go through airport security as well. Check your airport’s website to determine how long it typically takes to go through security."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid checked bags.",
      "content": "Avoid checked bags. Stick with carry-on luggage that you can bring on the plane. Since standby flights aren’t guaranteed, the airline won’t know where to send you checked bags until shortly before the plane departs. [10] X Research source Some airlines even prohibit standby passengers from checking bags to avoid complications. If you’re at the airport and have already checked a bag, notify an airline agent at the airport before requesting standby. If you are still permitted to fly standby, ask the agent what will happen to your checked bag. For instance, you can ask, “Will my bag arrive at my destination on a separate flight?”"

      "title": "Travel solo.",
      "content": "Travel solo. It’s easier to get one standby seat than multiple seats. If you’re traveling with family, friends, or a partner, not all of your names may be called from the list. Simplify things by signing up for standby when you’re traveling alone. [11] X Research source If everyone you’re traveling with gets a standby seat, you may have to sit separately from each other since open seats may not be together."

      "title": "Be polite to airline staff.",
      "content": "Be polite to airline staff. It may sound obvious, but courtesy goes a long way when asking someone to help you. Be respectful and patient when asking to be added to the standby list, or when asking about updates and wait times. This applies to speaking with airport staff, airline agents at the gate, and customer service representatives over the phone. [12] X Research source If you aren’t offered a standby seat on the specific flight, politely ask the staff if there are other flights available. Remember that airline staff have no control over which names get called or which flights have available seats."

      "content": "Wait patiently in case your name is called at the last minute. Sometimes, a flight crew will fill a standby seat minutes before the plane departs. Pay close attention as names are called, and be prepared to get up and immediately board the plane if you hear your name. [13] X Research source Bring something to do while you wait such as a book, music, or a laptop or tablet for watching shows and movies."

Your reservation must fall into one of these categories to be eligible for standby. [14] X Research source Additional rules apply: Standby is available to passengers traveling nonstop (in either direction) between Anchorage and Fairbanks, Seattle and Portland, or Seattle and Spokane. Your ticket must be eligible for a same-day confirmed flight change, and there must be no seats available on your desired alternate flight. This applies to First Class, Main Cabin, and MVP Gold Member Mileage members. “Saver fare” tickets are not eligible for standby."

[15] X Research source You don’t have to pay additional fees to modify your reservation. If your alternate flight is more expensive, you may have to pay the difference in cost. This also applies to travel packages that include hotel rooms, car rentals, or other add-ons.

Your new flight must depart on the same day, have the same number of stops, and take off and land at the same airports as your original flight. Any passenger can standby for an earlier flight. Standby for later flights is only available to AAdvantage members, the airline’s loyalty program.

Regular standby is available free of charge, but seats on specific flights are not guaranteed. This option is only available to passengers flying within the United States, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands. International flights to Canada, the Caribbean, or between New York’s JFK Airport and London Heathrow, are eligible for same-day confirmed changes, but not free standby. Other international flights may not be eligible for either option. Complementary standby, including confirmed same-day changes, are available to active military personnel, passengers who purchase “unrestricted” tickets in any class, certain AAdvantage members, and members of some partner airlines like Alaska Airlines and JetBlue."

Passengers can pay for a “same-day confirmed” flight change, which guarantees them a seat on any Delta flight to the same destination, as long as it departs on the same day. Complimentary same-day standby places passengers on a standby list for an earlier flight to the same destination, though seats aren’t guaranteed. [17] X Research source The fee for a “Same-day confirmed” starts at $75 per ticket, though the cost may be higher depending on your flight and ticket type. The fee is waived for Diamond, Platinum, and Gold Medallion members (Delta’s loyalty program). Complimentary standby passengers who do not get a seat on an earlier flight must board their original flight. Passengers with refundable tickets may be able to change their flight for no extra fee. Basic economy tickets are not eligible for same-day confirmed changes."

[18] X Research source There are some important rules to keep in mind regarding accruing miles and requesting standby flights: Miles can be accrued by taking Frontier flights, or by making purchases with the Frontier Airlines World Mastercard. [19] X Research source Your standby flight must depart earlier than your original flight, and have the same number of stops, or fewer. For example, if your original flight was nonstop, your standby flight must also be nonstop. You can change your flight’s destination to a different “sister city” that’s in the same region as your original destination. For example, you can change your destination from Milwaukee, WI to Madison, WI. A complete list of sister cities is available on Frontier’s website . Additional fees may apply when changing your destination to a sister city."
