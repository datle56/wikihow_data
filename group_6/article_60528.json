      "content": "Select containers that are specifically marked for gasoline. You can’t store gas safely in just any container. Look for a container that is labeled “gasoline” (or “petrol”), with appropriate warnings and information about the container’s capacity and safety features (such as spill-proof caps or flash arresting screens). [1] X Research source Check the label for safety certifications (such as UN/DOT or UL) or indications that the container is approved by agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency. Most gasoline containers are red, which is meant to serve as a visual indicator of the flammable nature of the gas."

      "content": "Buy standard plastic gas cans for use around the home. For basic home use, such as filling your lawnmower or home generator, you can use the plastic gas cans available in most automotive or home supply stores. These cans are designed to meet a wide range of safety and quality standards, and are generally safe if used properly. Plastic consumer gas storage cans are designed to be child-resistant, leak-proof, and safe for the environment. They must meet strict national and international safety standards."

      "content": "Use OSHA-approved safety cans if you’re storing gas at work. If you’re planning to store gasoline in your workplace, your containers will need to meet stricter standards than they would for home use. In the U.S., the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires that you use OSHA-approved safety cans. [2] X Trustworthy Source US Occupational Safety and Health Administration U.S. government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards Go to source These cans must: Have a capacity of 5 gallons (19 l) or less. Have a built-in flash arresting screen. Have a spring-closing lid and spout cover. Be designed to relieve internal pressure safely if the can is exposed to heat or fire. Be approved by a testing laboratory such as Factory Mutual Engineering Corp. or Underwriter’s Laboratories Inc., or a federal agency such as the Bureau of Mines or U.S. Coast Guard."

      "content": "Get UN/DOT approved safety cans for use in commercial vehicles. If you need to transport gasoline containers in a commercial vehicle in the U.S., you’ll need a gas container that is approved by the Department of Transportation. The DOT approves gas containers that meet United Nations standards. These containers may be plastic or metal, and will be marked with a UN logo. Many countries follow UN requirements for the storage and transportation of gasoline. For a detailed breakdown of the UN’s packaging and labeling standards, see Chapter 6.1 of this UN publication on the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods: https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/danger/publi/adr/adr2013/English/VolumeII"

      "content": "Choose containers with a capacity of no more than 5 gallons (19 l). While capacity requirements may vary depending on your location, most fire codes specify that portable gasoline containers should hold no more than 5 gallons (19 l) of gas. [3] X Research source In some places, there are even greater restrictions on the capacity of plastic gas containers versus metal ones. Check your local fire code to find out about capacity regulations in your area."

      "content": "Keep the container on the ground as you fill it. Placing your container on the ground can help prevent gas fires caused by static electricity. Never fill the container while holding it in your hand or while it is sitting in your vehicle. Place the container a safe distance (at least 5 ft or 1.5 meters) from your car as you fill it."

      "title": "Fill the container slowly and carefully.",
      "content": "Fill the container slowly and carefully. Filling your container too fast can result in splatters, spills, or a dangerous buildup of static electricity. Keep your hand on the gas nozzle at all times while filling, and make sure you are in control of the flow of gas into your container. Always keep the nozzle of the gas pump in contact with the edge of the container opening."

      "title": "Stop when the container is no more than 95% full.",
      "content": "Stop when the container is no more than 95% full. Overfilling your container can increase risk of spills and overflow. Gasoline may expand in the container if it’s exposed to heat, so leaving a little empty space at the top is also important for preventing pressure buildup. Some plastic gasoline containers have a strip of translucent white plastic along one side so that you can easily see how full your container is."

      "content": "Place the container upright in your vehicle in a shaded, stable location. Don’t put the container in your trunk or in a spot where it will be exposed to direct sunlight. Make sure the container is not lying on its side or in danger of tipping over during transport. If you notice any splashed or spilled gas on the outside of your container, let the container sit until the gas has evaporated before you put it in your car."

[4] X Research source The interior of a car can become extremely hot. Never leave your gas sitting in your car for longer than absolutely necessary. Driving with a container of gas in your car also puts you at risk of illness from inhaling gas fumes, so it is best to minimize the amount of time the container stays in your vehicle with you.

While regulations may vary from one area to another, many fire codes specify that you cannot keep more than 25 gallons (95 l) of gas in one place. Typically, the stored gas must also be divided up into smaller storage containers.

Keep your gasoline containers away from windows, and never leave them sitting outside in direct sunlight."

      "content": "Dispose of gasoline after 12 months or when you see signs of oxidation. If stored properly, your gasoline can potentially stay good for up to a year. [10] X Research source If your gas has been sitting in a container for a few months, pour some of it into a glass jar and look at it next to a sample of fresh gasoline. A darker color may indicate that your gas is starting to oxidize, and should be disposed of. Adding a fuel stabilizer can extend the shelf life of your gas by a few months. Do a search for “hazardous waste disposal facility near me” or call your local waste management agency to find out how to dispose of old gas. [11] X Research source Never dump gasoline outdoors or into a sink or storm drain. This can create fire risks, harm the environment, and potentially contaminate water sources in your area."
