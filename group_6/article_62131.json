      "content": "Mm is a shorthand way of saying “yes.” You know how “mm-hmm” is a quick, noncommittal way of saying “yes” (or expressing agreement) to something? [1] X Research source Think of “mm” as an abbreviated version of this expression, like the short hum you might give during an in-person conversation rather than saying “yes” outright. Person A: “Hey bro, can I vent to you about something?” Person B: “Mm” Person A: “I think the party at Tiff’s this weekend is gonna be a blast!!” Person B: “Mm”"

      "title": "Mm can be a quick way to say “I agree.”",
      "content": "Mm can be a quick way to say “I agree.” “Mm-hmm” can be used to express agreement—so, it’s not a huge stretch to assume that “mm,” its shorthand form, can also be used to agree with someone, too (in a more noncommittal way). Person A: “Pineapple on pizza is a culinary treasure” Person B: “Mm” Person A: “It’s sooo frustrating when my sister always interrupts me on the phone” Person B: “Mm”"

      "title": "Mm can indicate sarcasm.",
      "content": "Mm can indicate sarcasm. Just as “mm-hmm” can be used in a sarcastic way, a quick “Mm” could also indicate a sense of sarcasm and uncertainty. Person A: “There’s no way any cat in the universe is cuter than Mittens” Person B: “Mm yeah sure” In this case, the sender in question would probably add a little more pizzazz to their message to show that they’re being sarcastic."

      "title": "No, “Mm” isn’t an acronym.",
      "content": "No, “Mm” isn’t an acronym. Neither of the Ms in “Mm” stand for anything, so it definitely isn’t an acronym. It is , however, an abbreviation of “Mm-hmm.”"

      "title": "Continue saying whatever you were intending to say.",
      "content": "Continue saying whatever you were intending to say. “Mm” is typically said by someone who’s going with the flow of the conversation rather than sharing their own piece. If someone sends you a quick “Mm” over text, just continue along with what you were originally discussing. Person A: “Have you ever tried red velvet donuts before?” Person B: “Mm” Person A: “Aren’t they amazing???” If you aren’t totally sure what the other person means by “mm,” don’t be afraid to ask! It’s easy for the meaning of a text to get lost in digital translation."

      "content": "Millimeter Outside the context of a text conversation, “mm” typically stands for “millimeter,” or 0.001% of a meter (within the metric system). [2] X Trustworthy Source National Cancer Institute An agency in the National Institutes of Health focused on cancer research and patient support Go to source Chances are, though, your texting partner would only use “mm” to represent “millimeter” if they were already discussing measurements and such topics in your text conversation. “My new bed frame won’t fit in my room, even though I measured ahead of time. I must’ve been like 1 mm off…”"

      "content": "Make me Some netizens may use “mm” as a snarky way to refuse a request within a text conversation. Rather than agreeing to the original appeal, the person says “make me” (or “MM”) instead. Person A: “Do you mind taking out the trash?” Person B: “You’ll have to MM”"

      "content": "Music Monday In some social media circles, you might spot “#MM” attached to some posts, which typically signifies “#MusicMonday.” If you see someone making a music-related post on a platform like Instagram, #MM likely stands for “Music Monday” rather than the standard “yes” or “I agree” meaning."
