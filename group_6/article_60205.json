The next step is to find a way to keep \"-4x\" on one side and to keep the constants (whole numbers) on the other side. To do this, you'll have to do the \"Additive Inverse,\" finding the opposite of +7, which is -7. Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation so that the \"+7\" on the same side as the variable term is canceled out. Just write \"-7\" below the 7 on one side and below the 15 on the other so the equation remains balanced. [2] X Research source"

Subtracting 7 from +7 on the left side of the equation will leave no constant term (or 0) on the left side of the equation. Subtracting 7 from +15, on the right side of the equation, will leave you with 8. Therefore, the new equation is -4x = 8. [3] X Research source -4x + 7 = 15 = -4x = 8"

To remove the -4 in -4x, you'll have to divide both sides of the equation by -4. Right now, the x is being multiplied by the -4, so the opposite of this operation is division and you'll have to do it on both sides. [4] X Research source"

The constant is -3, so you'll have to take its opposite, +3, and add this constant to both sides of the equation. [6] X Research source Adding +3 to the left side of the equation, -2x -3, will give you (-2x -3) + 3, or -2x on the left side. Adding +3 to the right side of the equation, 4x -15, will give you (4x - 15) +3, or 4x -12. Therefore, (-2x - 3) +3 = (4x - 15) +3 = -2x = 4x - 12 The new equation should read -2x = 4x -12"

As long as you isolate it, you'll still get the same answer. Let's take the problem, 11 = 3 - 7x. To solve it, your first step will be to combine the constants by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation. Then, you'll have to divide both sides of the equation by -7 to solve for x. Here's how you do it: [8] X Research source 11 = 3 - 7x = 11 - 3 = 3 - 3 - 7x = 8 = - 7x = 8/-7 = -7/7x -8/7 = x or -1.14 = x"

The principle for solving this type of equation is the same: use arithmetic to combine the constants, isolate the variable term, and then isolate the variable without the term.

Here's how you do it: [9] X Research source x/5 + 7 = -3 = (x/5 + 7) - 7 = -3 - 7 = x/5 = -10 x/5 * 5 = -10 * 5 x = -50"
