      "content": "Supermoons enhance and deepen your emotions. In astrology, the moon represents your underlying emotions. Your moon sign, for example, represents your inner self (including your emotions, feelings, and natural instincts). When a supermoon occurs, you'll feel these emotions with more intensity. [1] X Research source Repressed feelings or desires may come to light during a supermoon. You may experience more tension or passion in your relationships. You may feel a surge of intuition and want to manifest something in your life."

      "content": "A supermoon also takes on the energy of the zodiac sign it's in. Each supermoon is ruled by where it falls on the zodiac calendar. The ruling zodiac sign gives each supermoon its particular \"flavor\" based on the main qualities of that zodiac sign. If the supermoon is in your zodiac sign, these effects are even more powerful. [2] X Research source To find out what sign the moon is in, use a website like Deluxe Moon or a free app like My Moon Phase. If the supermoon is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), you may feel particularly confident, passionate, ambitious, and impulsive. If the supermoon is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), you may feel extra grounded and in tune with the physical world. If the supermoon is in a water sign (Cancer, Pisces, Scorpio), expect to feel extra sensitive and deeply connected to others. If the supermoon is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), your mental energy and desire to socialize may be unusually strong."

      "content": "The supermoon's amplified energy can deepen your spiritual practices. The moon (especially the full moon) has always played a significant role in spiritual practices because of its strong connection to our emotions, dreams, and intuition. Many believe that a supermoon's magnified energy can enhance spiritual practices. For example, your rituals and spells may be more effective, and it's also a powerful time for self-reflection, journaling, and personal growth."

      "content": "Do a manifestation ritual to take advantage of the heightened energy. This is an auspicious time to perform any full moon ritual , especially a manifestation ritual, since the supermoon's energy is abundant and intense. Start by setting a clear intention for what you want to manifest and then write that desire down on a piece of paper. When you're done, store the paper in a safe place. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Process and release emotions that aren't serving you. Emotions are already running high, so it's a great time to acknowledge and release them. Try journaling about any negative thoughts and emotions you're experiencing during a supermoon. You can also write down what you want to release on a piece of paper and then burn it. Imagine yourself letting go as the paper goes up in flames. [4] X Research source"

Just place your crystals outside in a safe place and leave them overnight so they can absorb the moonlight. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "A supermoon happens when the moon orbits close to Earth during a full moon.",
      "content": "A supermoon happens when the moon orbits close to Earth during a full moon. Astronomers refer to this point on the moon's orbit as perigee. When the moon reaches perigee, it appears much larger than usual. From Earth, a supermoon can look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon. [6] X Research source A supermoon is usually about 224,000 miles (360,000 km) or closer to Earth. The farthest point in the moon's orbit (called the apogee) is about 253,000 miles (405,500 km) from Earth. Some astronomers only refer to the closest new moon and full moon as supermoons, but many publications consider a moon a supermoon as long as it gets close to perigee (within about 90% of the closest point).

      "content": "The term supermoon was coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle. Historically, supermoons have been thought to influence seismic activity on earth, increasing the risk of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions (this myth has since been discredited by scientists). The supermoon does, however, increase the pull of ocean tides. Since the moon is closer to earth during a supermoon, its gravitational pull is stronger. This contributes to higher tides than usual. [11] X Research source Though the term supermoon was originally coined by an astrologer, the term has since been adopted by scientists and astronomers. [12] X Research source"
