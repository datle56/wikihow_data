Follow the signs leading to Piazza Garibaldi where you can either board the local Circumvesuviana train or take a faster metropolitan train. [1] X Research source The Circumvesuviana train usually takes around 35–40 minutes to reach Pompeii, and has a stop right outside of the ruins. The metropolitan train takes around 24 minutes, but the nearest stop to the Pompeii ruins is about a 10-minute walk."

      "content": "Board the Circumvesuviana at Piazza Nolana for if you prefer to sit down. Since Napoli Centrale is the main station in Naples, it can get pretty crowded and make it hard to find a seat on the train. While you could stand for the whole trip, Piazza Nolana is only a 10-minute walk from Napoli Centrale and it’s where the Circumvesuviana train line begins. If you get on the train there, you’re more likely to find somewhere to sit on the train before people from other stations board. [2] X Research source The metropolitan train line doesn’t run to the Piazza Nolana station."
