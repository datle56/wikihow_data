      "title": "Rinse out and hang up your Norwex cloth after each use.",
      "content": "Rinse out and hang up your Norwex cloth after each use. Even if your cloth doesn’t seem to need a wash, rinse it thoroughly under warm water. [1] X Research source This helps keep grime from sticking to the cloth’s fibers. Vigorously rub the cloth against itself to loosen up any dirt, then fully wring it out. Hang it up to dry somewhere ventilated, like a towel rack. The notable exceptions here are lightly used dust cloths and dry mops. If you don’t want to do the whole rinsing and drying process, just use a rubber brush or vacuum to collect the dust or hit the cloths over the side of something (like a railing). Rinse out wet mops after every use. [2] X Research source Always hang up your cloths after rinsing them out. Wet Norwex cloths can grow mildew and get stinky when they’re balled up or left in a heap."

      "content": "Hand-wash gently used cloths with dish soap and warm water. If your Norwex picks up a light layer of dirt, hand wash it with hot water by rubbing a drop of dish soap into the cloth. [3] X Research source Then, rinse it out until the water runs clear. Don’t leave any soap residue behind—it gums up the fibers and leaves the cloth less absorbent. Wash your face cloths this way after every use, then wash them with your regular laundry about once a week. While studies have shown no difference between the antimicrobial properties of Norwex AntiBac cloths (which contain silver) compared to normal microfiber cloths, Norwex claims it is especially important to fully rinse AntiBac cloths, since the soap residue can interfere with the silver. [4] X Research source Norwex has their own brand of dish soap , but other soaps without added lotions work fine, too."

      "title": "Machine wash your cloths on hot with fabric softener-free detergent.",
      "content": "Machine wash your cloths on hot with fabric softener-free detergent. Wash your Norwex cloths by themselves if you can, or with like-colors and low-lint items (think jeans, t shirts, sheets—nothing fuzzy or covered in pet hair) if you can’t. Use Norwex detergent or another filler-free laundry detergent and never use fabric softener or bleach. Immediately machine wash your cloths after cleaning high bacteria surfaces, like toilets, floors, and anything that has touched raw meat. If you can’t do a load immediately, hand wash the cloths, then hang them over the lip of your washing machine to dry. You can hang the cloths anywhere, just as long as they can’t be mistaken for clean/gently used cloths. Hot water opens up the fibers and allows them to release more of the stuck gunk. If you accidentally used fabric softener, don’t panic. Follow the deep cleaning instructions below to get rid of all the softener and get your cloths back to normal."

      "title": "Deep clean your cloths with laundry booster.",
      "content": "Deep clean your cloths with laundry booster. Boil 1 gallon (3.8 l) of water and take it off the heat. Mix in 1 scoop (30 ml) of Norwex Microfiber Laundry Booster (or a similar powdered enzyme booster ) and soak all of your cloths in the water for 30-40 minutes, stirring regularly. Rinse the cloths in hot water until the stream runs clear. [5] X Research source It may take more than one round to clean your cloths. If you don’t want to repeat the soaking and rinsing process, machine wash the towels with a scoop of enzyme laundry booster after the first soak. Pretreat serious stains with a gentle stain pretreatment spray before throwing them into the wash."

      "title": "Use your dryer on a low heat setting or line dry your Norwex.",
      "content": "Use your dryer on a low heat setting or line dry your Norwex. Norwex dries quickly, so it doesn’t need to be in the dryer for long. Use a low-energy, low-heat setting, without dryer sheets. If you’d rather line dry your cloths, hang them where air can touch both sides, like over an oven handle, drying rack, or clothesline. The longer you dry Norwex cloths, the more staticky they'll get. Overdrying cloths doesn’t hurt them, but it does make them stick to the rest of your laundry. Use a dryer ball in lieu of a dryer sheet to help prevent static—using dryer sheets may permanently ruin your Norwex cloth. Dry the cloth as soon as possible after washing to prevent odors from forming."

      "title": "Only use water or Norwex products with your cloths.",
      "content": "Only use water or Norwex products with your cloths. Since soap gums up their fibers, Norwex products are only meant to be used with water or specialized products. Steer clear of cleaners, oils, polishes, waxes, etc., unless they were made by Norwex. This is actually one of their main selling points—you don’t need any chemicals to get stuff clean. [6] X Research source The one exception is the microfiber sponge, which can be used with any lotion-free dish soap."
