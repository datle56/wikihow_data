      "content": "Pisces and Virgo are a sexual match made in heaven. They’re directly across the zodiac wheel from each other and have a strong mutual attraction (opposites attract, after all!). Intuitive Pisces can sense Virgo’s sensuality underneath their rational exterior, and both signs can let go with each other and experience the full range of passionate, emotional sex. [1] X Research source Pisces has a fear of getting too close to someone physically. Patient Virgo can help Pisces put their worries aside (the reward is worth the wait)."

      "content": "Cancer and Virgo enjoy safe intimacy and genuine connection. Virgo is a cold sign, [2] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. but emotional Cancer knows how to thaw them out and help them open up. Touching and kissing are important to them both and the more they understand each other, the stronger their sexual bond becomes. Both of these signs get pleasure from pleasing the people they care about, meaning neither partner will go unsatisfied. Cancer feels at home in water and Virgo needs to be absolutely clean. Playing together in the shower or bath is a great way to have fun together."

      "content": "Sensual Taurus will lavish Virgo with attention and tenderness. Taurus is ruled by Venus and tends to be more sensual than sexual—they’re definitely the touchy-feely type. [3] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. They know how to make Virgo relax and appreciate the beauty of sex, which is just what the perfectionist Virgin of the zodiac needs. This earth sign duo is perfect for first sexual encounters. The Bull can be a lazy sign, and Virgo has to make it easy for Taurus to be with them. The key is sensuality—Taureans like eye candy, touch, and lots of warm hugs and offers of massages.

      "content": "Virgo and Scorpio build a safe, emotional relationship through sex. Like Virgo, Scorpio wants to be very cautious and observe carefully before they engage. [5] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. They’ll surprise each other with how deep their feelings are, and once they realize this, they’ll have a hard time separating. Virgo wants to share an emotional life with someone, and Scorpio wants to be the only partner Virgo will ever love. Scorpio is one of the most sexually active signs in the zodiac. This might be overwhelming for Virgo at first, but if Scorpio can slow down and be patient, the two will enjoy their time in bed together."

      "content": "Capricorn and Virgo can have a great sex life when they relax. They have a tendency to be stiff and procedural even though they get along well—Virgo is very careful and cautious, [6] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 23 December 2021. while Capricorn is practical about the people they love. [7] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. However, it’s the way that neither sign takes sex lightly that makes them cherish each other. They both feel very deeply and show their emotional connection through sex. Mutable Virgo will bring variety to the bedroom. When these signs trust each other, even cardinal Capricorn will learn to enjoy new things."

      "title": "Virgos move at the same pace when it comes to sex.",
      "content": "Virgos move at the same pace when it comes to sex. As a mutable sign, they're also open to changing things up to spice up their sexual relationship. However, they look for flaws in one another which makes it hard to get together in the first place. They're the consummate bachelors or bachelorettes of the zodiac because nobody's perfect enough. [8] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. Two Virgos in bed might not feel relaxed with each other and they could motivate each other to become more critical. The silver lining is they’re good communicators that can overcome many problems together. When Virgos focus on creativity and living in the moment without noticing every single detail, they can build a comfortable sex life together."

      "title": "As two mutable signs, Sagittarius and Virgo can have a lot of fun.",
      "content": "As two mutable signs, Sagittarius and Virgo can have a lot of fun. They’re likely to feel a sexual attraction to each other soon after meeting. They run into problems with their elements—earth signs don’t want to take risks, whereas fire signs like Sagittarius throw themselves into new things. Virgo might end up feeling pressured to do uncomfortable things by Sagittarius, who will be put off by Virgo’s practicality. They can make it work if they give each other space to be who they are. Commitment is another rough spot for these two. Virgo wants a long term emotional partner, but Sagittarius is the most non-committal of all the signs.

      "content": "Hotheaded Aries is too restless for the slower, reserved Virgo. Aries is extremely impatient and they want immediate gratification. [10] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 23 December 2021. This doesn’t gel with Virgo’s need for patience and stimulating foreplay. Aries seems ill-mannered and inconsiderate in this pairing, making Virgo even less willing to stick themselves out there. This compatibility can improve if Aries works to be more patient, understanding, and communicative with their Virgo partner."

      "title": "Gemini and Virgo suffer from an extrovert vs. introvert complex in bed.",
      "content": "Gemini and Virgo suffer from an extrovert vs. introvert complex in bed. Gemini is free and uninhibited compared to Virgo, who’s slow to open up and carries some shame around sex. Virgo needs constant reassurance (something a Gemini is unlikely to give naturally), while air sign Gemini needs to be intellectually engaged. Without a sense of freedom or amusement, Gemini becomes disinterested very quickly. [11] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. Gemini and Virgo are both ruled by communicative Mercury. If they can find a way to really understand each other, they can improve their compatibility. Gemini is as non-committal as Sagittarius, which doesn’t work with Virgo’s need for emotional stability. Gemini always wants to have everything and they rarely settle for one person.

      "content": "Virgo struggles to make Leo feel confident and special enough in bed. Leo wants to show off and to dramatically express their love and have it returned. [13] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 23 December 2021. This passionate nature doesn’t leave much room for rational Virgo to feel safe or heard. In general, these two have a hard time agreeing on what sex should be like and finding a strong emotional connection. If Virgo can go with the flow, they can have a physically satisfying relationship with Leo. However, they’re both unlikely to find the emotional security they need."

      "title": "Venus-ruled Libra is a far cry from Virgo’s shy and practical sexuality.",
      "content": "Venus-ruled Libra is a far cry from Virgo’s shy and practical sexuality. As a fast-paced air sign looking for their spiritual match, Libra will be driven crazy by Virgo’s fear of opening up and more conservative approach to sex. At the same time, Virgo will be disappointed that Libra won’t provide their fairytale match and will see only flaws (and as a cardinal sign, Libra is not apt to change easily). Earth and air signs don’t mix well together often, and Virgo and Libra are no exception. When Libra slows down and approaches Virgo diplomatically, there’s a chance these two can find a rhythm together."

      "title": "Aquarius and Virgo probably won't even start a sexual relationship.",
      "content": "Aquarius and Virgo probably won't even start a sexual relationship. Aquarius is often way too eccentric, fast, and weird for Virgo. This air sign is emotionally frozen, too. [14] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. This isn’t good news for Virgo, who needs some emotional connection before relaxing into sex. Virgo’s meticulous nature and tendency to overthink in bed would begin to annoy Aquarius, who doesn’t have the patience to reassure their partner. If mutable Virgo can be flexible with Aquarius and Aquarius can look at Virgo’s over-attentiveness as a gift, then these two can improve their compatibility."
