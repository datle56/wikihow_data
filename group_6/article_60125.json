      "title": "Your toes should slightly touch the front liner of the skate.",
      "content": "Your toes should slightly touch the front liner of the skate. The liner is the material along the inner toe of your skate. Ideally, your toes should lightly touch or graze this material without feeling cramped and stuffed. If your toes don’t have a lot of wiggle room, try going a size up. If you can’t feel the liner at all, grab a smaller pair of skates instead. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Your heels should be firmly planted in the back of the boot.",
      "content": "Your heels should be firmly planted in the back of the boot. Point your foot at an upward angle and tap the backmost wheel on the ground a couple of times to anchor your heel into place. Then, check that your skates are completely laced and strapped up. [2] X Research source Get on your feet and raise each skate off the ground—if your heels are rising up or jiggling around, switch to a smaller size. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Your feet should feel comfortable when you bend into a squat.",
      "content": "Your feet should feel comfortable when you bend into a squat. You’ll spend a lot of time squatting into your knees as you skate around. As a final test, lower your center of gravity so your knees are in line with your toes. Ideally, you should feel secure, steady, and comfortable in this position. [4] X Research source If your skates feel loose or wobbly, try a lower size. It might help to keep your rollerblades on for 10-15 minutes when you first try them on. This way, you can make sure that they don’t hurt your feet. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Be careful whenever you size up your rollerblades.",
      "content": "Be careful whenever you size up your rollerblades. Rollerblades are like an extension of your feet, so balance and security are key. Your feet should feel really comfortable and snug in the skate without jiggling around. [6] X Research source Some people suggest buying rollerblades that are 1 size larger than your normal shoe size. [7] X Research source You can definitely try this, but make sure that the skates still feel snug, comfortable, and not too loose. If you’re in-between shoe sizes, pick a pair of skates that feels most comfortable and snug on your feet."

      "title": "Size down if you’d like a snug fit.",
      "content": "Size down if you’d like a snug fit. Some skaters will go down half a shoe size to make sure their skates fit really securely. You don’t have to do this, though! At the end of the day, focus on finding a skate that matches your exact foot size. [8] X Research source Experienced skaters looking for really high-performance skates might prefer sizing down by a half size. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Reference your foot length for a more accurate fit.",
      "content": "Reference your foot length for a more accurate fit. Your foot length is an exact measurement from the base of your heel to the tip of your longest toe. While your shoe size and foot length can be similar, some people opt for a larger, roomier size for their everyday shoes, which doesn’t accurately represent how big or small your foot really is. [10] X Research source Foot length is usually measured in centimeters."

      "title": "Grab a ruler and measure the length of your foot sketch.",
      "content": "Grab a ruler and measure the length of your foot sketch. Line up 1 end of the ruler with the very end of your heel. Then, measure all the way over to the end of the longest toe. Jot down this measurement in centimeters, so you can easily compare it to different sizing charts. Rollerblade sizes aren’t universal across different brands, so having a centimeter measurement on hand can be really helpful."

      "title": "Sometimes, but it depends on the brand.",
      "content": "Sometimes, but it depends on the brand. Unfortunately, there’s no universal, one-size-fits-all chart for rollerblades. Some brands match closely with your regular, go-to shoe size. However, some other brands may be a size lower than your usual shoe size. [11] X Research source To be safe, always check the sizing chart on the brand’s website."

      "title": "Lace up the skates and secure all the straps.",
      "content": "Lace up the skates and secure all the straps. Pretend that you’re about to hit the streets and go for a skate. Tie up your laces as securely as you can, and make sure that your straps are snug. You won’t get an accurate feel for your skates when they’re super loose. [13] X Research source Your skates should feel snug, but they shouldn’t be messing with your circulation at all."

      "content": "Not usually, but you can easily work around this with an ankle bootie. A bootie is a type of sock that goes around your heel and ankle, but not the base of your foot. Over time, a bootie helps your skate adjust to the curvature of your feet, leading to a more comfortable skate down the line. [14] X Research source You can get a single ankle bootie online for less than $20."

      "content": "Yes, women can buy men’s rollerblades. Women with especially wide feet may not feel comfortable with a standard women’s rollerblade. In this case, try on a pair of men’s skates that match your foot size, and see if those feel more comfortable. [15] X Research source With US skates, men’s shoes are 1 size lower than women’s. For instance, a woman with US size 11 feet would be a men’s size 10."
