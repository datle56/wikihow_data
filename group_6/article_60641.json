If you signed up online, you can usually have the SIM mailed to your house or pick it up at your carrier's store (if they have one). Your phone most likely takes a specific size of SIM card, so check which SIM card size your phone uses before buying one. If you aren't sure of the SIM card that you should use, you can usually take your phone into a carrier store and have them evaluate it for you. They may even install the SIM card themselves!"

Android phones tend to have SIM card slots in different locations depending on the manufacturer and model, so it's best to research your specific model of phone to determine where the SIM slot is. Does your Android have a removable battery or back panel? This is not common anymore, but some newer models, such as the Samsung Galaxy XCover series, Moto E6 series, and BLU VIVO X5, do. [3] X Research source . If you turn your Android over and see a removable back cover, your SIM is likely under that panel. [4] X Research source You may need to remove the battery to find it. If your Android doesn't have a removable battery or back plate, the SIM tray will be a removable tray on one of the sides or button of the phone. The tray is only a few millimeters wide and has a hollow hole on one sideâ€”this hole is used to eject the tray. Look on all edges of your phone or tablet for the small hollow hole to find the SIM tray. If you're using a modern Samsung Galaxy A-series model or Google Pixel 4, your SIM tray is on the upper-left side of the phone. The Samsung Galaxy S21's SIM slot is on the bottom of the phone, while most other S models have slots on the left side. The OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro have SIM slots on the bottom edge of the phone."
