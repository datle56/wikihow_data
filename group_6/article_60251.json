      "title": "It means to speak in a way that is beautiful or expresses emotion.",
      "content": "It means to speak in a way that is beautiful or expresses emotion. Poetry uses lots of expressive and vivid language to create an image in the reader’s head. Speaking poetically refers to speaking in a way that is like poetry or like a poet would speak, such as using clever turns of phrase and metaphors. [1] X Research source If someone uses metaphors and flowery descriptions, such as, “Her eyes were like chains that held me captive” you could say they were speaking poetically. Speaking poetically can also mean you’re describing something really beautifully. For instance, you could say something like, “I need his love like I need the very air I breathe.”"

      "title": "Pack as much meaning as you can into your language.",
      "content": "Pack as much meaning as you can into your language. Poetic language uses “figurative” language as opposed to “literal” language. Figurative language uses poetic devices like metaphors to convey more than the words themselves mean. To use poetic language, choose words and phrases that add more meaning and emotion into what you’re saying. [2] X Research source For instance, when Martin Luther King Jr. said, “I have a dream,” he didn’t mean he actually had a dream, but a hopeful vision for the future. If you’ve ever heard someone say something like, “I love you to the moon and back,” or “Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get,” they’re using poetic language."

      "title": "Prose with poetic elements makes it more beautiful.",
      "content": "Prose with poetic elements makes it more beautiful. Prose is a form of writing that uses a standard form and structure (think of a regular paragraph of text). By incorporating poetic elements such as metaphor, simile, rhyme, alliteration, and striking imagery, you can make your prose even more beautiful. For instance, you could take an ordinary sentence like, “Jane went to the park and had lunch” and turn it into something like, “Jane sauntered over to a rusty park bench and munched on a juicy roast beef sandwich.”"

      "title": "Use the structure of the poem to read it out loud.",
      "content": "Use the structure of the poem to read it out loud. Poems use line breaks, rhyme, and other devices to help you read it the way it’s intended. Line breaks are designed for you to read the poem in a specific tempo and cadence. Rhyme schemes also help you read the poem in a specific way and put emphasis on the rhyming words. Read the poem using the structure and devices the poet used to write it. Some poetry, such as prose poetry, may be designed to be read just like you would a normal paragraph. Other poetry, such as spoken word, is designed to be interpreted by the speaker."

      "title": "Read your poem out loud to other people for feedback.",
      "content": "Read your poem out loud to other people for feedback. Once you’ve written your poem, read it out loud to hear how it sounds so you can make changes to tighten it up. When you feel confident and good about it, try reading it out loud to someone else such as a friend or a teacher. Ask them what they thought of it and if they have any thoughts about what you can do to make it sound better. It can take lots of time and multiple revisions to create a great poem. Be patient and keep at it!"

      "title": "Choose a topic you feel passionate about.",
      "content": "Choose a topic you feel passionate about. Spoken word poetry is meant to be really emotive and powerful. One way to make your poetry stronger is to focus on things that you personally feel very strongly about. Use topics, events, and stories that you have a strong emotional connection to, which will make your poetry feel more genuine and expressive. [3] X Research source For instance, if you’re passionate about the environment or equal rights, use them in your poetry! You can also choose something from your personal life, such as someone you love or something emotionally powerful that you experienced."

      "content": "Use repetition and wordplay to create a flow. Poetic devices like rhyme and meter can play a big role in spoken word poetry, but you can really kick yours up to the next level with some high-quality wordplay. Additionally, use repetition to drive home specific points and infuse your poetry with even more emotion. In spoken word poetry, the way the poem sounds is just as important as the words you use. [4] X Research source Include a clever mix of imagery, emotions, and interesting sounds. For instance, you could use rhyme, repetitive sounds, and metaphors and say something like, “I use similar similes as a way to get you to like me.”"
