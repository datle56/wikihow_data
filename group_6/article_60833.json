      "title": "The AirPod Pros packaging doesn’t look very vibrant.",
      "content": "The AirPod Pros packaging doesn’t look very vibrant. Take a look at the product picture on the box of the AirPod Pros. Do the colors seem crisp, or do they seem dull and gray-toned? Counterfeiters can cut corners on packaging, which is especially apparent when compared to genuine Apple products. [1] X Research source Even the shrink wrap can be a clear distinguisher between legit AirPod Pros and fake ones. Real AirPod boxes have a distinct plastic seam along 3 sides of the box, along with a specialized pull tab (marked with an arrow) on another side. If the shrink wrapping doesn’t follow this layout, the item is likely a counterfeit."

      "title": "The charging case is missing technical info.",
      "content": "The charging case is missing technical info. Legitimate AirPod Pros have technical details printed along the back of the case directly below the metal hinge. In gray ink, it should read “Designed by Apple in California” as well as “Assembled in Vietnam” or “Assembled in China.” If the text is missing or discoloured, the AirPods are likely counterfeit.

    {
      "title": "The AirPod documentation is incorrect.",
      "content": "The AirPod documentation is incorrect. Check the packaging for a distinct user manual that comes with your earbuds. The manual should include instructions for your exact model of AirPod Pros, and shouldn’t be for generic AirPods. If the manual seems suspicious, the product is probably a fake. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Certain features are missing from the AirPod Pros.",
      "content": "Certain features are missing from the AirPod Pros. AirPod Pros sport special features, including noise-canceling and transparency modes (allowing you to listen to outside noise). Chances are, a fake set of AirPods won’t have these unique features, which is easy enough to test if you already have the AirPod Pros in hand. [4] X Research source Noise-cancelling and transparency modes are different settings you can toggle on your AirPod Pros. To switch between these modes, press and hold your fingertip on the sensor along the stem of the AirPod—you’ll hear a special “chime” sound when the mode switches over. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "The serial number is missing, mismatched, or illegitimate.",
      "content": "The serial number is missing, mismatched, or illegitimate. Some counterfeiters won’t bother to include a serial number, which can be checked along the inner portion of the AirPods case lid. Other counterfeiters might include a serial number in the case, but print a different number on the AirPod Pros themselves—this is a key sign that the product is fake. [6] X Research source Important note: Some counterfeiters work around this by including a legitimate serial number on the AirPods. To cross-reference this number, visit Apple’s official coverage checker . Make sure that all the info lines up with your AirPod Pros, including the date you bought them. You might have to wait a few days before Apple’s database updates, though."

      "content": "The AirPod Pros and case seem to be low-quality. Counterfeit AirPods are, understandably, less high quality than the real deal. If your AirPods are uncomfortable to wear, have a poor battery life, or don’t seem to be assembled or designed very well, they might be fake. [7] X Research source Keep in mind that refurbished AirPod Pros might not be in perfect condition when you order them."

If the AirPod Pros case has a different type of charging port (like a micro USB), it’s probably a fake. [8] X Research source"

[11] X Research source After hitting play, quickly take out your AirPod Pros to see if the test stops or continues. Fake AirPods will continue along with the Ear Tip Fit Test, while legitimate AirPod Pros will halt the test.

Fake AirPod Pros don’t have great sound quality; so, you might hurt your ears after cranking up the volume to hear your audio better. Inexpensive fakes also won’t feel super comfortable in your ear and may cause ear pain in the long run. To top it all off, counterfeit earbuds aren’t designed to manage different types of sound frequencies, which can lead to migraines and headaches. [13] X Research source"
