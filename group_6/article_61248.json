      "content": "Be on the lookout for sudden, acute pain in a swollen toe. If the pain seems to come out of nowhere, this may be a symptom of a gout attack. Gout is a very painful form of arthritis that normally occurs on your big toe. It's caused by an excess of uric acid in the body, and if you suspect that you have it, you should see a doctor as soon as possible. You’re more likely to develop gout if you eat a diet rich in meat and seafood; consume large quantities of alcohol regularly; are overweight; or have a family history of gout. If you develop gout in one of your toe joints, the skin around that joint may also become red and shiny. However, this is not always the case. Your toe may also feel stiff and a little bit hot to the touch."

      "content": "Take note if you begin to feel pain or swelling in the ball of your foot. This could be a sign of capsulitis of the second toe, a condition that causes the ligaments surrounding the joint near your second toe to become inflamed. In addition to swelling at the base of this toe, it may also feel like there’s a marble or pebble under the ball of your foot when you walk. [4] X Research source The main cause of capsulitis is just having abnormal foot mechanics that are typically the result of how your foot is shaped. For example, when your foot is shaped so that excess pressure is placed on the ball of your foot, this can lead to capsulitis. Watch out that you don't incorrectly diagnose your toe pain as capsulitis. Turf toe, also known as soccer toe , can feel similarly uncomfortable in a nearly identical location. You should consider scheduling an appointment with a medical professional if you suspect one of these injuries is the cause of your pain."
