      "content": "It depends on the material, but you’ll need to remove the hooks first. Before you do anything, take a look at the tag on the curtain to see if they’re dry-clean only. Many curtains are made out of washable fabric, but you’ll need to remove any hooks attached to the grommets, which are the small eyelets or holes at the top of the curtains. Simply slide the hooks out of the grommets and set them aside so you can replace them when the curtains are clean. [1] X Research source If the tag says dry clean only, well, the curtains need to be dry cleaned in order to avoid damaging the fabric! [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If the tag doesn’t say how you can wash the curtains, try looking them up online on the manufacturer’s site to see if they list any instructions. Some curtains may have weights attached to the bottom to keep them hanging straight that also need to be removed."

It’s totally fine to wash curtains with grommets in the washing machine, as long as you set your machine to the delicate wash cycle, which will help prevent potential damage. [3] X Research source"

If the curtains aren’t dry clean only, you can toss them into a standard washing machine to give them a good cleaning. Set the water temperature to the coldest possible setting and choose the delicate spin cycle to avoid damaging or warping the material.

      "content": "Yes, but they need to be dried on a low-heat setting. Curtains, in general, need to be dried on a low-heat setting to avoid damaging or discoloring the material. Grommets are often made of metal, so it’s especially important that you machine-dry them on low heat so they don’t heat up and potentially singe the fabric of the curtains.

      "content": "Wipe them down with a damp chamois cloth. Curtains made out of specialty fabrics such as velvet are delicate, but you can still spruce them up in between dry cleanings. Take a chamois cloth, which is a special leather material, dip it in hot water, and wring it out really well so there isn’t any excess liquid. Gently wipe down the curtains to remove any dust and dirt from the material without risking any damage or discoloration.
