      "content": "Identify a binary compound. The simplest type of ionic compound is made from exactly 2 elements, 1 metal and 1 non-metal. Their name is always written as 2 element names, plus the -ide suffix attached to the second name. [1] X Research source Examples of simple binary ionic compounds include potassium oxide and sodium phosphide. If the \"-ide\" suffix doesn't follow a single element name, see instructions for polyatomic ions . For example, \"oxide\" is a simple oxygen ion, but \"hydroxide\" and \"peroxide\" are polyatomic."

      "content": "Look up the 2 elements on a periodic table. The first word of the name refers to the metal ion (the positively charged cation ). [2] X Research source You can find this element on the left side of the periodic table. The second word, ending in -ide , refers to a non-metal ion (the negatively charged anion ). Find this on the right side of the periodic table . For example, potassium oxide is a combination of potassium (chemical symbol K, atomic number 19) and oxygen (O, atomic number 8). Notice that the -ide ending is not part of the element name. You're just looking for an element with the same beginning (in this case ox- )."

      "title": "Find the charge of each ion.",
      "content": "Find the charge of each ion. In these simple compounds, it is easy to predict the charge of each ion. Each element in a particular column of the periodic table always forms an ion with the same charge: [3] X Research source The Group 1 elements Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs gain a charge of 1+ (written simply as + ). The Group 2 elements Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba gain a charge of 2+ . The Group 13 element Al gains a charge of 3+ . The Group 15 elements N and P gain a charge of 3- . The Group 16 elements O and S gain a charge of 2- . The Group 17 elements F, Cl, Br, and I gain a charge of 1- (written as - )."

      "title": "Balance the charges.",
      "content": "Balance the charges. It’s crucial to balance the charges in order to write ionic compounds correctly. Electrical forces hold together ionic compounds, pulling the positive and negative ions together. Taken as a whole, the ionic compound is electrically neutral, meaning it has a total charge of zero. (If it had a different charge, it would pull in another atom.) Find the number of atoms of each element that combine to \"cancel out\" each other's charge and make a neutral compound. [4] X Research source For example, potassium oxide is made up of potassium ions K + {\\displaystyle K^{+}} and oxygen ions O 2 − {\\displaystyle O^{2-}} . This means that 2 potassium ions (total charge 2+) balance out the charge of 1 oxygen ion (charge 2-). Here's a shortcut: the first ion's charge (ignoring + or -) tells you the number of atoms of the second ion, and vice versa. For example, aluminum fluoride is made of A l 3 + {\\displaystyle Al^{3+}} and F − {\\displaystyle F^{-}} ions. The charge of A l 3 + {\\displaystyle Al^{3+}} is 3, so there are 3 F − {\\displaystyle F^{-}} atoms. The charge of F − {\\displaystyle F^{-}} is 1, so there is 1 A l 3 + {\\displaystyle Al^{3+}} atom."

      "title": "Write your answer as a chemical formula.",
      "content": "Write your answer as a chemical formula. Write the 2 chemical symbols in the same order they appear in the compound's name (metal then nonmetal). After each chemical symbol, write the number of atoms as subscript ( l i k e t h i s {\\displaystyle _{like\\ this}} ). If there is exactly 1 atom of an element, you do not need a number. There is no need to write the charges. [5] X Research source For example, potassium oxide has 2 potassium atoms and 1 oxygen atom. The chemical formula is K 2 O {\\displaystyle K_{2}O} . Aluminum fluoride has 1 aluminum atom and 3 fluorine atoms. The chemical formula is A l F 3 {\\displaystyle AlF_{3}} ."

      "title": "Simplify if possible.",
      "content": "Simplify if possible. Ionic compound formulas are always written in the empirical formula, meaning they’re written with the minimum number of atoms required. If you could balance out the charges with fewer atoms, rewrite the formula. This is the same process as reducing fractions . For example, barium sulfide is made of B a 2 + {\\displaystyle Ba^{2+}} and S 2 − {\\displaystyle S^{2-}} ions. Using the shortcut above, the barium ion's charge (2) is equal to the number of sulfur ions, and the sulfur ion's charge (2) is equal to the number of barium ions. This gives us the formula B a 2 S 2 {\\displaystyle Ba_{2}S_{2}} . However, you don't need this many atoms to balance the charges. Write the 2 numbers as a fraction and simplify: 2 b a r i u m a t o m s 2 s u l f u r a t o m s = 1 1 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2\\ barium\\ atoms}{2\\ sulfur\\ atoms}}={\\frac {1}{1}}} , so the correct formula is B a S {\\displaystyle BaS} ."

[6] X Research source Unlike other elements, they can form more than one type of ion. When a transition metal is part of an ionic compound, a Roman numeral is included to specify which ion is involved. [7] X Research source For example, copper sometimes forms an ion with a charge of +1, and sometimes with a charge of +2. Copper (I) chloride and copper (II) chloride are 2 different ionic compounds. The Roman numeral tells you which copper ion is part of the compound."

Each element of this type only forms 1 ion. To find the charge of that ion, look it up in a textbook or chemistry website, or memorize the group rules . [9] X Research source For example, chloride is the name for a chlorine ion. Chlorine, like similar group 17 elements, forms ions with a charge of negative one.

The net charge of the ionic compound is always zero. To balance out the 2+ charge from a C u 2 + {\\displaystyle Cu^{2+}} ion, you need 2 C l − {\\displaystyle Cl^{-}} ions (2 ions x -1 charge per ion = -2).

For example, O H − 1 {\\displaystyle OH^{-1}} is a polyatomic ion made from oxygen and hydrogen ions. [10] X Research source Each polyatomic ion has its own special name. O H − 1 {\\displaystyle OH^{-1}} is called \"hydroxide.\" O H − 1 {\\displaystyle OH^{-1}} is not an ionic compound, because it does not have a net charge of zero. It is a single ion, which can combine with ions of the opposite charge. Some elements can form polyatomic ions by themselves. For example, \"peroxide\" is the O 2 2 − {\\displaystyle O_{2}^{2-}} ion. It contains 2 oxygen atoms, but has a total charge of -2. (This is different than oxide, the \"standard\" oxygen ion, which has one atom with a charge of -2.)"

[13] X Research source For example, to balance O H − 1 {\\displaystyle OH^{-1}} and M g 2 + {\\displaystyle Mg^{2+}} , compare the charges. It takes two -1 charges to balance out one 2+ charge. This means there are two hydroxide ions and one magnesium ion."

In the case that more than one of a certain polyatomic ion is necessary to balance the charge, the entire formula for the polyatomic ion is enclosed in parentheses and the numerical subscript is placed outside the parentheses. This shows that the subscript applies to the entire polyatomic ion. [14] X Research source For example, magnesium hydroxide has the chemical formula M g ( O H ) 2 {\\displaystyle Mg(OH)_{2}} .
