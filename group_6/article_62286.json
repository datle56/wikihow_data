      "content": "Get it out into the open as soon as possible to avoid resentment. If you and your roommate have to live together for a while, talking about any issues will make it much easier. Make a plan to talk to your roommate ASAP to avoid making the problem worse. [1] X Research source It’s your living space too, and you’re allowed to bring up any issues that you’re having with your shared home."

      "title": "Focus on how you feel to avoid making your roommate defensive.",
      "content": "Focus on how you feel to avoid making your roommate defensive. When you’re describing the issue at hand, try not to assign any blame or make it sound like your roommate is at fault. Instead, talk about how you’ve been feeling and what emotions you’re going through lately. [2] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. For instance: “When your boyfriend is over all the time, I feel like I can’t relax in my own space.” “Having your boyfriend over 24/7 makes me feel like I’m living with 2 roommates instead of 1.”"

      "title": "Make it clear why you have an issue with their boyfriend being over.",
      "content": "Make it clear why you have an issue with their boyfriend being over. Maybe he eats your food, hogs the bathroom, or takes over the communal space in your home. Whatever it is, spell it out clearly so that your roommate knows exactly where you’re coming from. For example: [3] X Research source “It’s not that I don’t like Jeremy, because I do. But when I’m trying to get ready for work and he’s in the shower for 45 minutes, it makes me a little angry.” “When we buy groceries, we only buy them for 2 people. When Henry is over all the time, we run out of food way faster, which isn’t fair to me.”"

      "title": "Let your roommate know what you are and aren’t okay with.",
      "content": "Let your roommate know what you are and aren’t okay with. Maybe you’re fine with their boyfriend coming over 2 or 3 times a week, but not every night. Or, maybe it’s okay for him to stay over whenever, but he can’t eat your food or hog the bathroom anymore. It’s up to you to decide your boundaries, but make sure your roommate knows what they are. [4] X Research source “Could we limit how often your boyfriend stays the night? Maybe you could go to his place every other day instead of always being here.” “If he’s going to eat our food, he needs to contribute to the grocery bill. I can’t afford to feed an extra person.”"

T here might be reasons why their boyfriend is over so often or why your roommate doesn’t love going to his place. Listen to your roommate and try to understand them, but don’t back down about setting your boundaries. [6] X Research source Make eye contact and nod along as your roommate talks so they know you’re listening. Try to practice reflective listening skills, where you repeat back what your roommate is saying to make sure you understand.

      "title": "Come to a conclusion that you can both live with.",
      "content": "Come to a conclusion that you can both live with. You might not get exactly what you want, and your roommate might not, either. However, you can both throw out suggestions and come up with an agreement that works for the both of you. You don’t have to be best friends at the end of this, but you do have to live together still. [8] X Research source For instance, if your roommate wants their boyfriend over every day but you’d prefer twice a week, you could compromise and say he can come over every other day. If your roommate wants your boyfriend to have free rein of the house but you’d rather he not be in the common areas, you could make a schedule where he’s allowed to hang out in the living room a few times a week instead of every day."

      "content": "Agree on how often the boyfriend is allowed to be at your place. You might suggest that their boyfriend only comes over every other day, or that he only spends the night on weekends. That way, you can get some much-needed time away from him, and your roommate knows that he’s still welcome within reason. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Suggest that the boyfriend pay his share if he’s living with you two.",
      "content": "Suggest that the boyfriend pay his share if he’s living with you two. If he’s over almost all the time, he’s essentially a second roommate. If your roommate doesn’t want to limit how often their boyfriend stays over, suggest that he start contributing to rent and utilities. That way, if he uses the hot water or eats some of the food, he’s actually paying for it. [10] X Research source Say something like, “I’m fine with him coming over, but I think he should start contributing to the bills. He uses the living space as much as we do, so he should probably pay a portion of the rent.” You could also suggest that he contributes to bills, like household items or cleaning supplies."

      "title": "The rules that you two agree to can be tricky to enforce.",
      "content": "The rules that you two agree to can be tricky to enforce. If you do come up with a solution together, consider writing them down and signing them at the bottom. That way, there’s no confusion on what was said, and you and your roommate can refer back to the rules anytime there’s a disagreement about them. [11] X Research source For instance, the rule about significant others might be, “Can only spend the night on weekends. Cannot eat food from the shared pantry.”"

      "title": "If you and your roommate can’t work it out, a mediator can help.",
      "content": "If you and your roommate can’t work it out, a mediator can help. If you’re living in a college dorm, talk to your RA about helping you and your roommate talk things out together. If you’re in an apartment, ask a friend or a loved one to help you come up with solutions. Fighting with a roommate isn’t easy, and outside support can help make things go a little smoother. [12] X Research source If things really blow up, you can always ask your landlord about the rules around guests in the lease. Many leases specify that guests (or people who aren’t on the lease) can only stay the night 2 to 3 times per week."

      "content": "Unfortunately, some roommates just aren’t a good fit. If you’ve talked things over with your roommate and they insist on having their BF over all the time, it might be time for you to start planning an exit strategy. Take a look at your lease to see how long you have left—if you can’t wait that long, weigh the cost of breaking your lease early. [13] X Research source If you’re living in a dorm, you can request a room transfer via your RA."
