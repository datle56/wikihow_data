      "content": "Step sideways along the bottom 3 in (7.6 cm) of the tiles. The bottoms of the tiles overlap with the tiles below them, so they’re better able to support your weight. The middle and tops of the tiles don’t have any supports underneath them, so they can break easily if you apply too much pressure. [2] X Research source Don’t jump or move quickly between the tiles since you could break them if you step down too hard. Leave about 1 centimetre (0.39 in) between your foot and the edge of the tile. While it’s supported by the tile beneath it, it’s more likely to chip off if your feet overlap it."

      "title": "Step on two tiles at once.",
      "content": "Step on two tiles at once. This helps reduce the weight you put on each tile. [3] X Research source If your tiles are curved, put your toes on the peak of one tile and your heel on the peak of another. Never put both feet on the same tile. It will apply too much pressure and likely cause it to break."

      "title": "Distribute your weight evenly and keep your center of gravity high.",
      "content": "Distribute your weight evenly and keep your center of gravity high. Walk normally on the roof without lowering your center of gravity. Each time you step, apply pressure slowly to the foot you’re keeping on the roof. [4] X Research source Walk diagonally up and down the roof to help keep your feet parallel to the ridge (peak of the roof) and to make it easier to step on two tiles at once. If you’re afraid of falling off the roof, have vertigo, or have bad balance, you’re more likely to lower your center of gravity and break a tile. You can use one of your hands to steady yourself and “bear crawl” on the roof, but consider hiring someone else to do your work for you."

      "title": "Avoid stepping on broken tiles and water channels.",
      "content": "Avoid stepping on broken tiles and water channels. Inspect the tiles that you want to step on to see if they have any cracks or damage. Avoid putting pressure where the tiles intersect side by side (the water channel) or where you notice damage. Stepping on broken tiles can also increase the chance that you’ll slip and fall. [5] X Research source If a tile has been cut in any way (like where two planes of the roof meet) don’t walk on it. The cut makes the tile weaker."

      "title": "Avoid walking on parts of the roof where two planes meet.",
      "content": "Avoid walking on parts of the roof where two planes meet. Only walk on the ridge, or peak, of the roof if it’s supported by concrete. If your ridge is reinforced, you’ll be able to see the mortar under the tiles. [6] X Research source Don’t walk on the hips (corners where two planes of the roof meet), because the tiles are often cut and more prone to cracking. The tiles on the hips aren’t always secure, either, and you could risk slipping if one becomes unstuck. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear a tool belt and shoes with a strong grip. The biggest risk of walking on a roof is sliding off. [8] X Research source Keeping your hands free helps you steady yourself on the roof. Wear rough pants, like jeans, to increase your traction. If the pitch of the roof is very steep, avoid walking on it at all costs."

      "title": "Spread your weight out over two rafters.",
      "content": "Spread your weight out over two rafters. When you’re on an old roof, you run the risk of breaking battens, or the beams that hold up the tiles. Check under your eaves to see how far apart the rafters are. When you walk on the roof, keep your feet as far apart as the rafters are spaced. [9] X Research source This helps you make sure you’re always either on a rafter or straddling a rafter, which helps take pressure off the battens. You can also check the rafters by looking at the ceiling of your attic. Nowadays, rafters are usually spaced 24 inches (61 cm) apart, but spacing is more variable with old roofs."

      "content": "Step on two tiles at once with your feet staggered between rows. Step on the lower third of the tiles, perpendicular to the tiles and parallel to the peak of the roof. [10] X Research source By keeping your feet at least one row apart, you reduce the stress on any individual batten. The bottom parts of the tiles are supported by the tiles beneath them, as well as the batten."

      "title": "Avoid any raised tiles or tiles out of line in the row.",
      "content": "Avoid any raised tiles or tiles out of line in the row. If a tile is raised, that means there’s something under it. If you step on a raised tile, it will break as it shifts over the object holding it up. [11] X Research source If a tile is out of line with the other tiles in its row, that means that it’s loose and can slip out from under you. Check for these tiles before walking across the roof."

      "content": "Walk up and down the roof with each foot on a rafter. If you’re not sure where the rafters are, place one foot on the edge of the roof (but not the hip, where the tiles come to a peak) and the other one rafter space away.

If you know how far apart the rafters are but aren't able to see them while you’re on the roof (or have a friend on the ground see them), start at one edge of the roof and walk over from there. You can measure the length between rafters with a tape measure. [15] X Research source There will always be a rafter at the edges of the roof. If the rafters are visible under the eaves, have a spotter on the ground to tell you where they are."

      "title": "Wait until the tiles are completely dry before getting on your roof.",
      "content": "Wait until the tiles are completely dry before getting on your roof. Tiles have a flat, smooth surface, so they don’t offer a lot of grip when you step on them. Once tiles get wet, they become even slicker and could cause you to slip and fall. If it rained recently or your roof is wet, wait 1-2 days for the tiles to dry before you stand on them. [16] X Research source Never get on your roof while it’s wet since it increases the likelihood that you’ll fall."

      "content": "Use a ladder to access your roof safely. Use a ladder that extends 3 feet (0.91 m) taller than the edge of your roof. Place the base of the ladder on level ground, ¼ of its height away from your home. As you climb the ladder , maintain 3 points of contact at all times so you’re less likely to lose your balance or fall down. [17] X Research source For example, if you have a 16 ft (4.9 m) ladder, you would place its base 4 feet (1.2 m) feet away from your home. Ask a helper to hold the ladder in place while you climb it so it’s less likely to fall down."

      "content": "Use a safety harness if you have a steep roof. Put your legs through the loops on the safety harness and tighten them around your thighs. Put the top of the harness around your waist and tighten it so it’s secure. Tie a rope around a sturdy object on the roof, like a chimney, or a Ridge Pro hooked over the ridge of your roof. [18] X Research source You can buy a safety harness online or from a home improvement store. You can also make a harness with ropes . While you don’t need a safety harness for a roof with a gentle slope, you can still wear one to reduce the risk of falling down. If you don’t have a chimney or sturdy object on your roof, slide 2-3 tiles on your roof up so you can access the rafters underneath. Screw a harness anchor onto the rafters and tie the rope to it."
