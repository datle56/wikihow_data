For example, if you're playing with three people, count from A to K in your mind, accenting every third number: \" A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 ...\" and so on. the bolded numbers are the ones that you're supposed to play, and the other two are the ones that your opponents play. It's easy to see that the cards will come to you in this order: A 4 7 10 K 3 6 9 Q 2 5 8 J, then back to A."

You should either memorize these sequences, or be able to figure them out quickly in your mind, by counting as in step 2."

      "content": "When you have to lie, choose the card that comes latest in the sequence. For example, there are four players, it's 9's to you, and you have only A's, 6's, and K's. what do you play? Well, look at the four-player sequence. K's are coming up on your next turn, so hold on to your kings. That way you can play them without having to lie. (See step 1). Neither 6's nor A's are coming up very soon, but 6's are coming a bit sooner, so you would be wisest to get rid of your A's. Who knows, by the time you get to 6's, you may be almost out of cards."

Especially if it's late in the game, chances are someone has all four of them. If so, it doesn't matter what you do, they'll call BS anyway, if they're still awake. So you're kind of screwed. If you're pretty sure that one person has two 9's and another has the other two, then you can play up to two non-9's. If someone has three 9's, you can play only one. This is only a guideline. Exactly how many you play will depend on several things, like whether your opponents call BS all the time, or very rarely, how big the pile in the middle is, how close you are to winning, etc. [1] X Research source"

If you mess with your cards too much, people will suspect. Put your cards down in a clean stack, so no one can tell how many cards you've put down. Also, be sure to put the extra cards down underneath your four-of-a-kind; that way, if someone calls BS, you may be able to get away with just turning over the four legit cards. If you're still caught, exclaim that you made a mistake and you actually meant to put only four cards down. This trick can work with three-of-a-kind, or even with a pair, but the fewer cards you're claiming the more noticeable the extras will be."
