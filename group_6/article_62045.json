      "content": "Flash tattoos are pre-drawn tattoo designs ready to be booked. These designs are meant to be tattooed quickly and efficiently. Tattoo artists typically have illustrations of the design either in a folder or posted on their website or social media. They’re generally smaller, repeatable designs, but sometimes might be larger and only tattooed once. [1] X Research source Unlike custom tattoos, which you typically design with the artist, flash is designed without client input. Sometimes, though, artists are willing to tweak designs to fit the client’s needs. Generally, flash tattoos also come with a pre-determined size and price. For example, a 5-inch tattoo for $200. Usually, flash tattoos are cheaper than custom tattoos."

While there are countless flash designs, there are generally 3 overarching types: [2] X Research source Market Flash: these are popular designs that are repeated for multiple clients. Some common designs include hearts, butterflies, infinity signs, and roses. They’re typically small and unshaded. Collector Flash: these are unique designs created by a specific artist. Designs vary from artist to artist and depend on their interests and style, and they may be more intricate than other forms of flash. Collector flash may be tattooed only once or for multiple clients depending on the artist’s preference. Traditional Flash: these are classic designs in the American Traditional tattoo style. They use bold lines and a limited color palette and have been tattooed on many people throughout the decades. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "The term “flash” might come from when tattooing was illegal.",
      "content": "The term “flash” might come from when tattooing was illegal. Because these pre-made designs could be done “in a flash,” artists would set up their station and tattoo as many people as they could before the cops arrived. Artists kept their designs in a briefcase so they could close up and disappear before getting caught. [4] X Research source Another theory is that the term originated with the circus in the mid-to-late 1800s. Artists hung their designs on walls or displayed them in “flash racks” for clients to choose from. Alternatively, the term could come from the fact that the designs look “flashy.” [5] X Research source Some also claim that the term originated with sailors who would arrive in a town for a day and want a tattoo that could be done “in a flash.” [6] X Research source Tattoo artist Lew “the Jew” Alberts introduced flash to New York in the early 1900s. Some other early flash artists include George Burchett, Christian Warlich, and Sailor Jerry. Their work often included symbolic meanings, and while those meanings might not be as significant to clients today, American Traditional flash is frequently inspired by their work. [7] X Research source Sometimes, tattooers traded and sold flash sheets with each other as a way of networking."

      "content": "You can usually get one sooner than a custom tattoo. Since most flash tattoos are pre-designed, pre-sized, and pre-priced, you and your tattoo artist can skip the consultation and designing process. In many cases, flash designs can be tattooed on a walk-in basis with no appointment necessary. [10] X Research source Not all tattoo artists take walk-ins. Be sure to contact your artist beforehand to make sure they have time to take you. Some artists even have flash days, in which they dedicate a whole workday to tattooing flash designs rather than custom work.
