You see them around often, but you don’t make a ton of effort to hang out with them or get to know them. That might sound like a bad thing, but actually, having acquaintances is important! Studies show that people feel happier when they interact with people they only know casually.

      "content": "A friend is someone you have a deeper connection with. When you’re friends with someone, you know more about them than just the surface level—you’ve opened up to each other at least a little bit, and you’d like to learn more about them over time. [2] X Research source You probably also make more of an effort to spend time with a friend rather than an acquaintance, although this isn’t always a marker of your relationship. If you’re both super busy, you can still maintain a friendship with someone without seeing them very often."

You might only see them when it’s convenient, like when you’re at work or together at school. You probably say hi to each other and exchange pleasantries, but you might not ask them to hang out with you outside of that. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "You know some things about them, but not much. You probably know the basic facts: where they work, where they live, and who their partner is.

This probably doesn’t feel too awkward, since you’re both exchanging info with each other. Friends get to know each other on a deeper level than acquaintances do, so you’ll probably talk more about these things over time. You might ask your friend things like, “How are you feeling today?” or, “How are you really doing?” [7] X Research source Ask yourself things like, “How much do I trust this person?” and, “How comfortable do I feel around them?” There are also different levels of friendships.

If you grab them a coffee on the way to work, they’ll buy you lunch that day.
