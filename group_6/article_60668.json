      "title": "Tadpole brows are eyebrows shaped like tadpoles.",
      "content": "Tadpole brows are eyebrows shaped like tadpoles. Tadpole eyebrows are full at the start of the brow, but are followed by a pencil-thin trail, making them look like tadpoles. These are typically caused by over-tweezing and because tadpole eyebrows aren’t currently on trend, most people do not choose the shape intentionally. [1] X Research source While tadpole eyebrows aren’t currently trendy, they were popular in the 90s, alongside extremely skinny eyebrows. It’s possible they could come back in style."

      "title": "Use a brow growth serum.",
      "content": "Use a brow growth serum. Brow growth serum works similarly to eyelash serum, as it helps bulk up and create fuller coverage for your brows. Many experts say the best way to promote healthy hair growth is to choose a product with ingredients like keratin and soy proteins. Apply the serum before bed to promote growth while you sleep.

      "title": "Tweeze in the direction the hair is growing.",
      "content": "Tweeze in the direction the hair is growing. One common tweezing mistake is removing the hair from the wrong direction. Each hair is connected to a blood vessel, and if that vessel is ruptured, the hair won’t grow back. To prevent this, pull the skin tight with one finger and pluck the hair in the direction it’s growing, usually upward or toward the temple, rather than straight out. [3] X Research source It’s probably best to stop tweezing your brows altogether until the hair starts to grow back. Then, make sure to tweeze them lightly to prevent getting tadpole brows again. Trimming your brows monthly can also promote healthy growth."

      "title": "Map out your ideal brow shape.",
      "content": "Map out your ideal brow shape. Because your brows are unique to you and your face shape, your ideal eyebrow shape will likely be different from someone else’s. Visit an eyebrow expert to get your brows mapped professionally, or try it yourself by following these steps: [4] X Research source First, follow a straight line up from the edge of your nose to find where your brows should begin. This helps balance your eyes and slim your nose. Then, follow a diagonal line from the outside of your nose across the middle of your eye to determine where your brow is naturally the highest. Then, follow a diagonal line from the outside of your nose to the outer corner of your eye to determine where your brow should end. Having the correct length helps create proportion on your face. Once you’ve mapped your ideal brow shape, outline the top of your brow by connecting the 3 points you found, then outline the same shape along the bottom of your brow. This will ensure your brows look thicker and help avoid the tadpole shape."

      "content": "Use micro-point brow pencils. Micro-liner pencils allow you to create realistic fullness in your brows. Flick the pencil in the same direction as your hair growth and leave a little space between each stroke to make it look like real hair. [5] X Research source Brow pencils create a blendable color that adheres to the skin rather than the hair. Some other products that may help prevent or fix tadpole brows include eyebrow powder, eyebrow nourishing oil, and brow soap. In general, apply these wherever your brows are too thin."

      "content": "Brush the hairs upward for a fuller look. To get fluffier-looking eyebrows, brush them upward with a dry spoolie brush , then apply a clear gel and brush them in place. [6] X Research source Leave most of the hairs brushed up for a feathery look and brush the tail-end down to taper them into a point."

      "content": "Gradually increase the intensity of your brow pencil. To create a natural, non-tapered brow look, apply your brow pencil with an ombre approach, following the direction of your hair growth. [7] X Research source Use lighter strokes at the head of the brow and gradually add more strokes as you approach the tail end. Remember to use fine strokes to create a natural-looking shape."

      "content": "Use brow gel to give your eyebrows texture. Fill in the desired shape of your brows, then add a fiber-based brow gel to give it some dimension. [8] X Research source Backcomb the gel through your brows from the end to the start, like you’re teasing your hair. Then, move in the opposite direction and brush your hairs upward from start to arch and in the direction of your hair growth from arch to end. This will help define your arch ."

      "content": "Consider microblading, if all else fails. If your hair isn’t growing back to your liking or you don’t want to draw your brows on every day, microblading might be your best option. Microblading is a cosmetic tattooing technique that permanently draws on realistic looking hairs. Because this is so permanent, do your research beforehand to make sure it’s something you want to commit to, and choose a trustworthy salon to do the procedure. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Overplucking or over-tweezing",
      "content": "Overplucking or over-tweezing Overplucking is the most common cause of tadpole-shaped brows. Typically, people may overpluck their eyebrows in an attempt to fix a mistake, only to realize they made it worse. Over-tweezing also damages the hair follicle, which can prevent the hair from growing back. [10] X Research source Solution: in this case, it’s probably best to stop plucking your brows for a while and see if the hair grows back on its own. This may also be a good time to apply a brow growth serum. If you want to fill them in in the meantime, use an eyebrow pencil to draw on your preferred shape."

      "content": "Hair loss conditions If you have an autoimmune disorder like alopecia, eyebrow psoriasis, or eczema, it could cause your eyebrows to thin, which in turn may give you tadpole brows. Thyroid issues and other hormonal problems may also cause your brows to thin. [11] X Research source Solution: If you have an underlying condition, it’s probably best to talk to your doctor to see if there are any solutions. For example, your doctor may prescribe corticosteroids to help treat symptoms of alopecia, eczema, or psoriasis."

      "content": "Aging As you age, you may experience hair loss, which also affects eyebrow growth. This could cause your brows to thin out at the edges and create the appearance of tadpole brows. Anti-aging brow solutions may help prevent this, if this is the case. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Solution: Brow powder can make your arches look thicker. Pull the skin taut with one hand and use the other to dust on the powder with a stiff, angled brush. Use light, feathery strokes, then brush the hairs up with a spoolie brush to blend the powder."

Chronic stress can release cortisol, which is a stress hormone that can damage the brow follicles and cause hair loss. [13] X Research source Solution: Using eyebrow makeup and applying brow serum may help your brows’ appearance, but finding a coping mechanism that works for you might be the best way to solve the underlying issue. While different methods work for different people, some common coping mechanisms include taking deep breaths and meditating ."

      "content": "Genetics Sometimes, tadpole brows may occur naturally depending on your genetics. They may be especially common if you have sparse-looking or pointed-arch eyebrows. [14] X Research source Solution: In general, if your brows are thin because of genetics, there’s not much you can do to get them to grow naturally. In this case, your best bet may be to apply eyebrow makeup to cover them, or if you want a more permanent solution, consider microblading or permanent makeup."
