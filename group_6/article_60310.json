      "content": "Please consider an alternative to spying. Never throw around false accusations and never judge your current lover by what people in your past did to you. Only resort to monitoring someone's device usage if these tips fail and your suspicions are not simply based on jealousy, but reasonable suspicion. It is always better to be upfront and simply ask to see your significant other's phone. Same thing applies when wondering who your child is texting. Have a conversation about your trust issues, insecurities, suspicions doubts or concerns before resorting to spying on someone. Always be respectful and mindful of someone else's privacy. Talk to your child about appropriate cell phone use. Do not be afraid to set limits such as when they can use their phone and regularly monitor their web and text behavior. There is nothing wrong with a parent that is trying to be completely aware of his/ her child's phone and internet activities. [3] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source Set up a time to sit and talk with your significant other without any distractions. Set aside a couple hours for just the two of you. Use that time to discuss any concerns, doubts or fears that you have. You could also try writing them a letter in advance and then arrange a meeting in a neutral location (if that would be easier for you). Do not be judgmental or condescending, and never jump to conclusions or hurl unproven accusations at them. That will simply push the person away. They will not view these issues as simple concerns that you have (that you two can work through). They will instead view your hostility and accusations as proof that you do not trust them, at all. Just express how you feel and what actions led you to feel this way. Maybe they are not cheating, but their texting to another person might make you feel uncomfortable. Surely, if they are indeed not hiding anything, then they'll understand your honest concerns. They would likely be more than willing to let you see what you wish to see. Keep in mind, information can be deleted and people do lie. You should still always attempt to talk with your partner. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Search their phone when they're busy or distracted. This is the most simple means of spying on a person's phone. Wait for a time that they set their phone down due to being in a hurry. If they have to rush to leave a room or run an emergency errand. You must then quickly read text messages and search their call/web history, and if time permits check social media as well. Most times, if someone is doing something dirty behind your back they will delete the messages/ calls that could prove it. If you have a chance to get the device when they are busy, distracted, or caught off guard then they may have not had a chance to wipe away evidence, yet. So act quickly, and be smart. If you find anything, screenshot the evidence, send it to yourself, then store it in a private protected folder or print it out, to be kept safely in a lock box. Always make sure to delete the screenshots and messages that you send to yourself."

      "title": "Ask for their password.",
      "content": "Ask for their password. Many smartphones have passwords and are pin or pass code protected, rendering them otherwise inaccessible. In relationships, suspicions tend to arise when their significant other has a password on their mobile device that you don't know. Simply ask for the password, your reason being: in case you have to use their phone during an emergency or when yours is inaccessible. Dead, no service, etc. If they have nothing to hide they will usually gladly and freely offer the information, If not, certainly seek other means of obtaining actual proof, before accusations. Do not delete any texts, call logs, or other data. Not only will this provide evidence of your spying, but can be considered theft and lead to criminal charges. Try to leave no trace of your spying, this can be difficult but always remember to mark messages you've read as unread and to close tabs that you've opened (that they haven't.) View and scan the target phone's web history, texts and all calls visually at first. Only visually. If you must take notes for memory, take mental notes only or capture \"screenshots.\" Then send the screenshots to yourself, always be sure to delete the screenshots and messages that you sent! (The screenshot method is effective.) Do not create a paper trail by writing anything down, ever! Even if you intend to throw out any notes, you run the risk of being implicated in a privacy violation. Capturing the screenshots and sending them to yourself via text or email is a much safer method of visual note taking and viewing. It also makes it much harder for anyone to track (delete at will), So long as you delete the screenshots and messages that you send!"

      "content": "Simply ask to borrow the phone. Again, If they're up to no good then they more than likely take the time to regularly delete any incriminating evidence i.e. texts, calls or instant messages. Try this trick out: Intentionally leave your phone at home or claim that it is dead or malfunctioning. This gives you the perfect opportunity to ask if you can borrow theirs. Use it to make a call or send a message. This may catch them off guard and unprepared, with evidence still on the phone. They will probably seem antsy and reluctant to give it to you if there is something incriminating on the phone. Do feel free to walk away for some privacy, especially if you are pretending to make a phone call, or you need to use the rest room or even need to check an account balance. Open internet tabs that would interest you and do not close them. This will assert to them that you were using the phone instead of snooping through their stuff. Be aware that if you are caught, there may be personal, as well as legal implications. If they act strange, and seem very nervous, be suspicions. If he/she suddenly says they need to do something first on the phone, \"real quick,\" you watch them, closely. They may be deleting evidence. If they flat out refuse, that's weird and seems like they definitely have something to hide. Go straight to method 3 in that case. You should never refuse your spouse or significant other your phone. That looks bad, it sounds bad, and it is bad. How could you ever trust that?"

      "content": "Check her phone while she is sleeping. Though any evidence is probably deleted at this point, it never hurts to check, especially when you're deeply troubled. Only resort to this if any of the other options have been unavailable. Be aware that if you are caught, there may be personal as well as legal implications against you. Read on: If caught, unless you are afraid the other person may become verbally or physically violent, be honest as to why you are searching the texts. People often send texts without thinking, and they can be construed in ways other than their original meaning. You can also play this off as \"checking the time\" or saying that your own phone is dead, or you couldn't sleep and wanted to search the web a bit. Have a fall back plan (open links on the web to something you're interested in; this will make it seem like you were just browsing the internet). [5] X Research source If you find something incriminating, always allow the other person to clear--up any misunderstandings. If you still mistrust them, try method 3. If you find incriminating evidence of adultery you should think about contacting a lawyer, if you are married."

These are discrete programs that upload, copy or forward all history from the phone to a secure server that can be accessed by your personal phone/computer. These programs include monitoring of placed and received calls, texts, url's, picture messages; sometimes email services and application data. Some apps also offer tracking options that use geolocation data to send updates on that person's location or if they go outside a designated area. You can monitor the phones whereabouts by it emitting regular GPS signals at specified intervals, (so long as the target device has GPS location turned on.) [7] X Research source Some apps are hidden, however others require them to be downloaded on both parties' phones. While cellphone spyware programs are legal, you must either obtain permission from the person's phone you wish to monitor, or the phone (and number) must be under your name. You can bypass this by informing them that you'd like to install a security monitoring program on their mobile device, just as you have on yours. They will more than likely consent. You have not lied or done anything illegal (they agree to have the application installed). Furthermore, if the device you wish to monitor is a prepaid device, you can log into the providers website (or access an application on the phone) and add your name on the account or change account names entirely. If you do not feel comfortable doing so, you can pay to have their service refilled a few times using your own credit/debit card. You already have a card associated with the account, so having your name on it shouldn't feel like such a bad thing after you take this step. [8] X Research source These programs automatically save all texts, phone calls, and pictures, so even if something has been deleted off the phone it will be saved in a secure server online for you to view at any time. This type of spyware only works on smart phones, requires the user of the phone has internet access either through their cellular data network or WiFi. Some are completely free, most offer free trials and sometimes charge a for a monthly subscription. [9] X Research source"
