      "content": "See a dermatologist to get a prescription and ask questions. For most tretinoin creams you'll need a prescription, with only Differin available over the counter (in the United States). However, it's still a good idea to talk to a dermatologist about the effects, risks, and benefits of tretinoin cream if you want to use it over the counter. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Tell your doctor if you think you might be allergic to tretinoin cream. Also tell your doctor if you have a fish allergy, as Altreno can cause a reaction. Mention if you have other skin conditions like eczema, keratosis, or skin cancer. Also mention if you are pregnant. You can also buy weaker retinoids over the counter."

      "content": "Start with a lower concentration cream to see how your skin responds. Tretinoin cream is available in concentrations from 0.01% to 0.1%. Start with a concentration on the weaker side (0.01% or 0.025%) to see how your skin reacts over the course of several weeks. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your skin reacts well, you can ask your doctor for a stronger concentration. One study suggests that there is no significant difference between lower and higher concentrations, except more irritation from higher concentrations. You will most likely see results from using a low concentration tretinoin cream. Start with a low concentration and gradually increase it if needed."

      "content": "Wash your face with mild cleansers and moisturizers. Before applying the cream, your face should be cleansed. Use a gentle cleanser without alcohol. Avoid exfoliating your skin. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can use other acne treatments while using tretinoin, such as salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide cleansers and toners. There is debate about whether you should apply moisturizer before or after tretinoin cream. Try both and go with whatever feels best."

      "title": "Let your face dry completely before applying the cream.",
      "content": "Let your face dry completely before applying the cream. Ideally, give your skin at least 20-30 minutes after washing and moisturizing to dry.

      "content": "Apply a pea-sized amount in a thin layer over your whole face. Be careful not to use more than a pea-sized amount, as too large of a dose will be extremely irritating on your skin. Use your fingertips to spread the cream in a thin layer over your whole face.

      "content": "Use the cream every other day for the first 2-6 weeks. Although daily application is recommended for the strongest results, it can be beneficial to let your skin adjust to this medication by starting off applying it every other day before bedtime only. The less you irritate your skin, the more effective tretinoin cream will be, so it's best to let your skin adjust gradually. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your skin has a bad reaction to tretinoin, or tretinoin in combination with another product, reduce your usage to once every 3 days or stop using it entirely for a week."

      "content": "Avoid other topical medications and harsh skincare products. While acne cleansers are fine to use, it's important not to mix tretinoin with other topical acne medications, as this can cause a bad reaction with breakouts and pain. You should also avoid skincare products that contain alcohol, spices, lime, or menthol in them, as these can irritate your skin while you're using tretinoin.

Use a generous amount of cream sunscreen to double up on moisturizer while protecting your skin from sun damage.
