Twin flames are like magnets being pulled together, so it's likely that your twin flame will feel compelled to find you, too. You might even have consistent dreams of a stranger you feel oddly connected to—twin flames will always find a way to contact each other, even through the astral realm! [1] X Research source Remember, your twin flame doesn’t have to be romantic! Unlike a soul mate, a twin flame can be romantic or platonic—the key is immediately feeling a deep connection to them. If you’ve been seeing numbers like 1010 or 111, these are angel numbers that suggest your twin flame may be on their way. Be open to meeting new people by getting out on the town. Have fun with your loved ones in social settings like parties or events—you never know what magnetic stranger you might encounter."
