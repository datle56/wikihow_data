      "content": "Yes, if the ATM supports cardless transactions. As long as the ATM supports Samsung Pay and you've linked an eligible debit card to your digital wallet, you can make cardless transactions at thousands of ATMs around the world. Just look for the contactless symbol on an ATMâ€”it looks like a hand holding a card next to several curved lines. As long as your debit card can be linked to Samsung Pay and the issuing bank supports withdrawals at ATMs through digital wallets, you can withdraw funds at any ATM that supports cardless Samsung Pay transactions. If an ATM only has a card entry slot or slider, you won't be able to use Samsung Pay at that ATM."
