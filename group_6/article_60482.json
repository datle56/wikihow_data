      "title": "All senders are legally obligated to provide an opt-out option.",
      "content": "All senders are legally obligated to provide an opt-out option. In the United States, the 2005 Junk Fax Prevention Act requires all fax marketers to provide a way for receivers to opt out of future faxes. Usually, they will provide an opt-out telephone number, but sometimes they will provide a fax number, a website, or an email address. In some cases, calling an opt-out number will not work. This typically occurs when the fax marketers are deliberately breaking or ignoring the law."

      "content": "See if it has a feature that can block certain numbers. Consult your fax machine's user manual and search for a way to block incoming numbers. Look around on the fax to see if the sender included his sending fax number. If the sending number is not included on the fax, then you can use the *57 method to trace unwanted calls. However, you will first need to set up the *57 service with your service provider and there will be limitations on tracing the number, such as only tracing numbers in your local service area."

      "content": "In the world of fax, there doesn't exist such a thing as a master \"Do Not Fax\" list. If someone sends you fax advertisements and if you never gave them express permission to send advertisements, you can file a complaint with the FCC. In turn, the FCC will fine them for violating junk fax laws. You can send complaints to the FCC by phone call, by email, by fax, by written letter, or by using the FCC online complaint form."

      "content": "Fax-to-email software automatically converts all received faxes into emails. These are then forwarded to your email address. By using such software, you can delete junk faxes and only print out the faxes that are important. If your main concern with junk fax is the waste of paper and ink, this can be a great solution."

      "content": "Annoy the fax senders so they stop bothering you. One common method of discouraging fax spammers is to fax a few sheets of black construction paper to the fax number that spammed you. This will quickly use a lot of their toner, forcing their machine to shut down until the toner is replaced. Unfortunately, this method will have no effect if the fax spammer is using fax-to-email software. If they are, they will simply see black emails in their inbox."

      "content": "Turning off your fax machine is the last resort. A temporary solution to the issue of junk fax is to simply turn off your fax machine when you aren't expecting any faxes."
