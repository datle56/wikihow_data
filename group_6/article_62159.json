      "content": "True Tone is a display setting that adjusts your screen's white balance. White balance establishes the true color of white on your screen, and from this baseline, the tones of all colors are measured and displayed. On your iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer, True Tone will automatically adjust the white balance of your display to match the ambient light around you. According to Apple, this leads to a \"more natural and accurate, paper-white viewing experience.\" [1] X Research source"

      "content": "True Tone uses special sensors in your device to measure ambient light. Apple says True Tone uses advanced, multichannel sensors that are built into your device to measure the light around you. On your iPhone, iPad, or Macbook, the sensor can be seen next to the front-facing camera (or webcam, for Macbooks). Some users state that True Tone helps with eye strain, but the intended purpose of True Tone is to properly display colors on your device. This is especially helpful for people who work in creative industries who rely on accurate digital representations of colors."
