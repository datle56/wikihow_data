However, you can avoid curling your legs toward your chest, which shortens the psoas muscles and causes pain during the day. You can also stretch your psoas in bed before and after you sleep.

      "content": "Band supported leg lower exercise Personal trainer and strength coach Brendon Rearick says this exercise includes “a hamstring stretch on one side” and “a psoas stretching activation of the opposite side leg, so you're killing two birds with one stone” and increasing “both flexibility and stability.” Sit on the bed with your legs straight out in front of you. Put your left foot inside an exercise band and hold two sides of the band with your hands. [5] X Research source Lie on your back with both legs together, sticking straight up. Hold the exercise band looped around your left foot, breathe in, and lower your right leg down to the bed as you breathe out. Repeat 2 to 3 times, then switch legs."

Kneel on your right knee and place your left foot in front of you, bending your knee. Place your left hand on your left leg for stability. Personal trainer and strength coach Brendon Rearick says to make sure “your rib cage and pelvis are stacked on top of each other.” Rearick also recommends “pressing down your hands either into a stick or a bench or a wall.” That way, you’re less likely to use your spine to stretch, which can cause injury. Lean forward, shifting your body weight to your left leg. You’ll feel a stretch in your right thigh. Hold for about 30 seconds, then switch legs and repeat."

      "title": "Sitting for long periods can cause your hip flexors to feel tight.",
      "content": "Sitting for long periods can cause your hip flexors to feel tight. Spending time parked in a chair, sitting in a car, or curled in bed without stretching regularly keeps your psoas in a shortened position for longer than they should be. [17] X Research source To combat tightness, take 5-minute breaks every 20 minutes to stretch and walk around. When your muscles shorten, it means they’re weaker and unable to extend all the way when you go to exercise. This can put you at risk for joint and back pain, strains, and other injuries. [18] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Personal trainer and strength coach Brendon Rearick doesn’t recommend using a foam roller to stretch your psoas because they lie “underneath many vital organs.” Instead, he recommends “hiring a physical therapist or a massage therapist” who can “release that muscle tissue for you.”"
