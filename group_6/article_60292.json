      "content": "Look for increased crying and whining. Healthy newborn puppies should cry very little. In fact, they should spend most of their time either sleeping or eating. If you notice your puppy crying or whining frequently, be sure to take it to your veterinarian. [1] X Research source Increased crying is a common symptom of most neonatal problems. If a puppy is crying, it may be overheated, becoming ill, experiencing pain, or not getting enough to eat."

      "title": "Notice a decrease in appetite.",
      "content": "Notice a decrease in appetite. Puppies nurse frequently throughout the day. If you notice that any of the puppies are not nursing regularly, this may be a symptom of a larger problem. The puppies may be ill, have a digestive disorder, or be unable to nurse properly. Be sure to visit your veterinarian if you observe a decrease in appetite by any of your puppies. [2] X Research source This may be a symptom of hypothermia as well. Pups younger than six days old are unable to shiver and regulate their body temperature properly. A pup suffering from hypothermia will be unable to nurse or digest its food. You can help with this by keeping a heat lamp above your whelping box . The dam lets down her first milk, called colostrum, right after the puppies are born. This milk is thicker than regular milk and full of antibodies, which provide passive immunity. It is very important that all the puppies in the litter get this milk to be healthy and grow."

      "content": "Note any weight loss. Depending on the breed, a healthy newborn puppy can weigh between 4.2 and 22 ounces (120 to 625 g). In its first few weeks, a healthy puppy should gain 5 to 10 percent of its birth weight each day. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Weigh your puppies twice a day and take them to the veterinarian if they are not gaining weight normally or are losing weight. A failure to gain weight or a loss in weight can be a symptom of poor nutrition, an infection, or a congenital disorder like hypoglycemia. Be sure to talk with your veterinarian about what healthy weight gain should look like for pups. A loss in weight may also be the result of nipple guarding by larger puppies in the liter."

      "content": "Spot a change in sleep patterns. When they are not nursing, newborn puppies should spend most of their time sleeping. If you notice that any of your puppies are not sleeping regularly or seem restless, be sure to take them to the vet. They may be suffering from an infection of some sort or not getting their nutritional needs met. [4] X Research source Be sure to check your newborn pups every few hours to make sure that they are sleeping and eating normally."

      "title": "Notice if the puppy sleeps away from the rest of the group.",
      "content": "Notice if the puppy sleeps away from the rest of the group. A healthy puppy will sleep in a group with its siblings and close to its mother. This helps the pups regulate their body temperatures and facilitates feeding. However, if a pup is sleeping away from the rest of the group, it is likely that the mother has pushed it away for some reason. The puppy may have a congenital issue or the mother may not have enough milk to feed all of the pups and has decided to sacrifice this puppy to save the litter. If a puppy has become separated from the litter, have your veterinarian examine the pup. It may have a congenital disorder that will limit its quality of life. In that case, your veterinarian may suggest euthanizing the pup. If the mother is unable to feed all of the pups, you may be able to successfully feed the pup yourself."

      "title": "Pay attention to the mother's behavior.",
      "content": "Pay attention to the mother's behavior. Often, the declining health of puppies is a result of the mother's actions. Maternal neglect is a common cause of health problems in newborn puppies. A mother may not lie with her pups and warm them. She may also refuse to nurse her pups or not have enough milk to feed them all. Large breed dogs sometimes clumsily step on their pups or smother them with their large bodies.

      "content": "Look for diarrhea and vomiting. If your puppies are suffering from a bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection, the puppies will experience diarrhea and vomiting. This is a common symptom of most types of infections, particularly canine herpesvirus, parvovirus, and intestinal parasites. Be sure to visit your veterinarian immediately if your puppies experience any diarrhea or vomiting. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States.

Go to source There is a high mortality rate for puppies suffering from canine herpesvirus and parvovirus. Parvovirus has a characteristic smell that most owners find extremely unpleasant. Dogs with parvovirus also often have blood in their diarrhea. Parvovirus is highly contagious, so call your vet immediately if you suspect your puppy may have it."

      "content": "Check for a fever. If your newborn pups are suffering from an infection, they will run a fever. The healthy range for a dog's temperature is between 99.5 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 and 39.2 degrees Celsius), with anything over 103.5º F (39.7° C) considered a fever. You can rectally take your puppies' temperature or an ear thermometer; however, that method is less reliable. [7] X Research source"

These are all symptoms of an infectious agent causing respiratory complications. If your puppies exhibit any respiratory issues, take them to your veterinarian immediately.

      "title": "Spot any physical birth defects.",
      "content": "Spot any physical birth defects. Some newborn puppies have abnormalities in their skulls, hearts, mouths, and anuses. These can include such things as cleft palates, deformations of the spine, or missing limbs. [9] X Research source Certain abnormalities can make it difficult for them to nurse properly or generally be healthy. Sometimes puppies are born with a closed anus, which means they cannot defecate. Check each puppy's anus to make sure your puppy is normal. If not, take it to the vet for surgical correction as soon as possible. Birth defects may also cause the mother to reject or even kill the pups. Be sure to talk with your veterinarian about the best course of action for pups with birth abnormalities. If your puppy suffers from a heart abnormality, it may struggle to gain weight, have trouble breathing, and be generally lethargic. Certain abnormalities can be treated if caught early.

      "title": "Be on the lookout for genetic disorders.",
      "content": "Be on the lookout for genetic disorders. Newborn puppies often suffer from genetic disorders. These can range from cognitive issues to metabolic complications that severely limit a puppy's quality of life. A puppy suffering from a genetic disorder will likely have difficulties nursing and properly gaining weight. However, they may also prevent behavioral issues, like aggression or sleeping away from the group. Be sure to talk with your veterinarian about the best course of action for any pups with genetic disorders. [11] X Research source For example, newborn puppies can sometimes develop juvenile hypoglycemia, a genetic disorder that is particularly prevalent in toy breeds. This makes it difficult for your puppy to properly gain and maintain a healthy weight. Newborn puppies should also open their eyes around 7 to 10 days after birth, their ears should open around 2 weeks after birth, and their teeth should start coming in around the third week."

      "title": "Check for environmental complications.",
      "content": "Check for environmental complications. Newborn pups are extremely vulnerable to environmental factors like toxins or fluctuations in temperature. Because they are unable to regulate their body temperatures, they are susceptible to hypothermia and hyperthermia. Chemicals and toxins in their bedding or in the nearby environment can also harm puppies, poisoning them and affecting their health. If your puppies struggle to nurse, gain weight, and cry a lot, they may be experiencing a complication due to an environmental factor. [12] X Research source The skin of newborn pups is thin and readily absorbs chemicals in the environment around it. This can result in flaky or dry skin and hair loss. Be sure to wash all bedding in gentle cleaners that leave no odor. Make sure that you keep your dog's whelping box in a climate-controlled location to avoid any extreme temperature fluctuations."
