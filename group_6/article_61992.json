      "content": "Polka-dots are a go-to if you are going for a retro look. Go for tights with small polka dots, large polka dots, or polka dots in a variety of colors. You can also find tights that look almost like polka-dots, but are actually cute, little hearts. Polka-dot tights are casual enough for any occasion, but they’re also pretty easy to dress up. [1] X Research source Pair polka dot tights with a flowing retro skirt. It won’t be a problem if you have a Marilyn Monroe moment with tights on! For a very casual look, wear polka-dot tights with a jean skirt. Don’t worry, you won’t look like you’re stuck in 2007 as long as the tights don’t cut off at the ankle."

      "title": "Stripes aren’t just for tigers, but they can make you feel just as fierce as one!",
      "content": "Stripes aren’t just for tigers, but they can make you feel just as fierce as one! There are all kinds of stripes, like skinny, thick, vertical, or horizontal. If you’re looking for an elongated look, tights with vertical stripes would be the way to go. For a fun and colorful look, choose tights with thick, multi-colored stripes. [2] X Research source Try out striped tights with a shimmer or glitter for an extra element of fun. Mix your patterns by pairing striped tights with patterned skirt for a look quirky enough to match your personality."

      "content": "You can put roses and sunflowers out on your table, or wear them on your tights. You can find floral tights in a variety of colors and patterns—from large daisies to small, overlapping roses. Add a touch of femininity to a plain T-shirt and denim skirt, or go for a whimsical look by pairing floral tights with a flowing skirt. Your legs will look like the coolest and prettiest garden ever. [3] X Research source Wear tights patterned with large daisies with a denim skirt and converse sneakers. Pair a short, flowing skirt in a light color with tights patterned with small roses."

      "title": "Colored opaque tights are the easiest way to add some fun to your outfit.",
      "content": "Colored opaque tights are the easiest way to add some fun to your outfit. They are really easy to find, fairly cheap, and you can choose about any color. If you’re having trouble choosing a pair, think of your favorite color, and go for that. Your legs could look even better than ever in bright purple. You can pair colored tights with just about any skirt, whether it’s a short denim skirt or long wool skirt. [4] X Research source Wear a pair of hot pink tights with a black miniskirt and chunky boots for a fun, edgy look. Go for a pair of oxblood tights with a floral skirt and ankle boots."

      "content": "Fishnets are the quintessential sexy tights. They are the perfect choice for a bold look on a night out. Wear classic fishnets, oversized fishnets with large holes, or nude fishnets for a retro look. Any type of fishnets are the right fishnets if they make you feel confident. Pair fishnets with a black miniskirt and stilettos, or ballerina flats if high heels aren’t your thing. [5] X Research source Wear a pencil skirt with fishnets and platform heels for a look that says “sexy, but also very smart.”"

      "content": "Suspenders aren’t just for the stereotypical “nerd” look, especially when worn on the legs. You can have the look of wearing suspenders with knee-highs without actually having to deal with the suspenders. This option is probably a lot cheaper as well, so it’s a win-win situation. Look for a pair of sheer tights with an opaque stripe down the middle, forming the appearance of suspenders. This is a great choice for an elegant and sexy look. Wear these tights with a skirt short enough to show off the suspender effect and make your partner (or crush) go crazy."

      "title": "Patterned tights aren’t only fun or edgy, they can also be great for a night out.",
      "content": "Patterned tights aren’t only fun or edgy, they can also be great for a night out. A simple pattern can act as the interesting part of your outfit if you’re too tired or lazy to accessorize after a long day. The pattern could be small hearts, or a simple floral pattern on one part of the tights. If you’re feeling edgy, go for tights with small skulls. Pair the tights with a solid-colored skirt of any color. Black is probably the easiest color to match a pattern with though. [6] X Expert Source Susan Kim Professional Stylist Expert Interview.

      "content": "Black, opaque tights are the simplest choice to add a dressier element to your outfit. Plus, black tights make just about anyone’s legs look great. Wear these tights with a pencil skirt, pleated skirt, or long, flowing skirt. Avoid a denim or short skirt unless you work in a super casual environment. If so, lucky you! [7] X Research source Other dark colors can be very tasteful as well, like dark grey and navy blue. Test the tights by stretching them out with your hand to make sure they will be opaque."

      "title": "Nude tights are a subtle and versatile option.",
      "content": "Nude tights are a subtle and versatile option. Wear nude tights with a knee-length skirt and matching blazer. Accessorize with a patterned shirt to feel like the most stylish person in the office. [8] X Research source Nude tights are also a good option to hide imperfections on your legs. Don’t worry, we all have them."

      "content": "Gray tights don’t have to be drab and boring. In fact, they are a great choice if you’re wanting to recall your schoolgirl days. Wear gray tights with a high-waisted, plaid skirt if you really want to work a schoolgirl look, even at the office. Just be sure to wear a fairly long skirt so you don’t get sent to the principal, or really, the boss. If you’re wanting gray tights in a thicker fabric, choose cashmere or a similar material."

      "title": "Freezing in sheer tights isn’t always worth it.",
      "content": "Freezing in sheer tights isn’t always worth it. Wool tights are stylish and warm, and in the end, smart. You can wear plain wool tights, or ribbed wool tights. Choose black or gray wool tights for the office. Pick out a pair of red or purple tights if you work in a casual and creative office environment. [9] X Research source Avoid wearing thin material, like chiffon, with wool tights. The types of fabric just don’t look right together. Wear a fabric that is made of a material just as thick or thicker than the wool tights. A wool skirt would, of course, work well with wool tights. While fashion boots work well with this look, wool tights can also be a great option if you're looking for a way to wear flats in winter. The thicker material can help keep your legs warm in the absence of taller footwear."
