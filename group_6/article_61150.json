This is most useful for users whose library consists mainly of purchased tracks and ripped CDs. If you have music from other sources (online downloads, CDs that are now gone, etc.), or are trying to share music with a friend, see one of the following sections."

You can't use iTunes to import the tracks unless you had previously transferred your iTunes library from your old computer to your new one . Connecting your iPod to a new computer will prompt you to erase everything on the iPod. Most of the third-party programs also allow you to transfer files from iPod Classics."

You can also choose to select tracks manually and copy only the selection to the computer. Not all programs will import the copied tracks directly into iTunes. If that's the case, or you want to use the songs in another media player, you'll need to copy them to a location on your computer (such as your Music folder), and then add that folder to your iTunes library. Sometimes the file names of the songs will be changed when copying them off your iPod. iTunes or other media players will still be able to read the metadata information on the songs and properly label them. The import process will likely take a while, especially if you are copying thousands of songs."

When you use this method, you won't be able to tell what song is what until you add them to a media players library. This is because the song files are renamed when they're added to your iPod's library. This method is useful for transferring songs that you didn't purchase from iTunes to a new computer or a friend's computer. It is also useful for retrieving your songs when nothing appears on your iPod. This method is not very useful for people trying to extract a single song or just a few out of hundreds. This is because the songs will not have legible file names, so finding the exact song you want will be difficult, if not impossible. This will NOT work for iPod Touches, iPhones, or iPads. Use the method above for those devices."
