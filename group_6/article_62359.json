      "content": "The white rose was used by fighting factions in 15th-century England. Back in the 1500s, warring royal families fighting for control of England supposedly used roses as symbols to represent themselves. The House of York was signified by a white rose, whereas a red rose symbolized The House of Lancaster, leading the conflict to be referred to many years later as “The War of the Roses.” Funny enough, historians suggest that the name “The War of the Roses” is actually inaccurate and was coined as recently as the 19th century. Allegedly, while The House of Lancaster used white roses as one of their many symbols, The House of York only became associated with the red rose after William Shakespeare, among others, wrote about the bloody battles between the two houses.
