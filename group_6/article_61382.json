The Root Chakra is LOM, then it goes VOM, then the solar plexus is ROM, heart is YOM, throat is HOM. Third Eye is SHOM, and then your crown is OM.\" She emphasizes that it's important to work your way through all the chakras at first \"because our energy is like a pyramid—you need a strong foundation to be able to receive information through [higher chakras].\" [2] X Expert Source Emily Christensen Spiritual Advisor & Founder of Rainbow Raaja Expert Interview. 11 March 2022.
