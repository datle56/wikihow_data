You will have developed a good knowledge of your industry when conducting your research, so should know how much you can expect to lease a product for, before you start buying up your inventory. Buying in bulk will reduce the unit cost and potentially increase the profit margin on each leasing contract you complete. Spending a lot of money establishing a large inventory can be a risky move for a start-up business when the future is unknown. You need to carefully consider the size of your orders and don't get in over your head. Excellent market research will help you decide on how much inventory to purchase in the first instance, but this is always an imprecise science. [8] X Research source"

Doing this can give you more financial breathing room while you work on establishing your business and its place in the market. Contacting suppliers at the end of month to see if they have excess stock at reduced prices is one way to do this. Try to ensure that termination clauses are built into your contract with the supplier so you can cancel a contract a point before it would otherwise end. For example, a termination clause might enable the contract to end after a year rather than after three. You can also ask to spread payments over the duration of a contract rather than paying for everything up front. [9] X Research source"
