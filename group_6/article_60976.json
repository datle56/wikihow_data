We were hanging out at Jen’s party last night. How are you?” You could also try, “Hi Kathy, it’s Harold. I’m so happy Frank introduced us to each other this weekend.”"

Be sure to mention some of the things you enjoy too so you can find something that you have in common. She’ll love that you’re showing some interest in her hobbies, and it gives her a chance to nerd out and chat about it. You could say something like, “ The Hunger Games are my favorite books too! What’s your favorite part of the trilogy?” You might also say, “It’s been so long since I played soccer haha. How long have you been playing?”"

      "content": "Poking a little fun keeps the conversation light and goofy. Every girl loves someone with a sense of humor, so try to show it off. Crack a joke about something she’s said or be a little sarcastic in your replies to take the edge off of the conversation. Reread your text before you send it to make sure it doesn’t sound mean or insulting. You could say something like, “Oh, you think you could take me on in arm wrestling? Try me 😉” or, “LOL are you suuure that’s what you meant?”"

      "title": "You don’t want to overwhelm her with texts.",
      "content": "You don’t want to overwhelm her with texts. Rather than sending a girl a wall of texts, look back through your conversation to see when she replies and how long her responses are. When she eventually replies, wait about the same amount of time before sending your message so it doesn’t seem like you were waiting for her. Try to make your text about the same length as hers so you put the same amount of effort into your conversation. You may have heard of waiting a few days to reply to make a girl want you more. However, this might make it look like you’re trying to play games with her head and could make her lose interest."
