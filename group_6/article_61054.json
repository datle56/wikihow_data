Don't worry if you aren't sure how many grounds to add, you can always add more to strengthen the coffee as it steeps. [4] X Research source The more coffee you add, the darker your paper will be. If you add much coffee, some tiny particles of it can stay on the paper, and if you draw or write on it, the pen can pick them up and get blocked. But it will still work for wrapping gifts or even for printing."
