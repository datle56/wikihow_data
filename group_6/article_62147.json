[9] X Research source Stand up for your friend or partner by cutting in when they find themself in an awkward or dangerous situation.

[10] X Research source Praise your friends on their achievements whenever you can. A good ride-or-die doesn’t shy away from offering compliments.

[11] X Research source It’s not antagonistic, just that you and your ride or die communicate effectively ; it’s why you’re so close. Of course, part of effective communication is setting boundaries for what kind of talk you will or won’t tolerate. Never tolerate someone who demeans or berates you."

They also know that you sleep with 3 stuffed animals, that you only brush your teeth once a day, and why there’s a strange mound of dirt in your backyard. But they’re your ride or die exactly because they’d rather die than spill even your tamest secret. [12] X Research source That said, some secrets just aren’t worth keeping. If your friend or partner does something dangerous or illegal, contact your guardian or the local authorities."
