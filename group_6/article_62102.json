    {
      "title": "Most often, HYB means “how you been?”",
      "content": "Most often, HYB means “how you been?” Send an “HYB” text or DM to casually start a conversation with someone you haven’t seen in a while to catch up. It works as a standalone message, or as a reply to someone’s story on apps like Snapchat or Instagram. [1] X Research source “Hey! Hyb?” “I miss you Jenny! Hyb?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Sometimes, HYB means “handle your business.”",
      "content": "Sometimes, HYB means “handle your business.” This is another way of telling someone to “deal with it.” Send a snappy HYB message when someone’s complaining about a frivolous problem or trying to shift responsibility for their mistakes or duties to you. This meaning is less common than “how you been” and might not be recognized right away. [2] X Research source “HYB, I’m not your mother!” “That mess is on you. HYB!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "HYB can also mean “hit you back,” too.",
      "content": "HYB can also mean “hit you back,” too. If you don’t have an answer for someone at the moment, send HYB to indicate you’ll get back to them later when you have more details. Include an estimation of when you’ll reach out if you have an idea, or if not, just remember to circle back! “I’ll hyb once I know my schedule for the week.” “I’m not sure if I can commit to the trip yet, can I hyb in a few days?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "HYB might mean “hell yeah, brother!” sometimes, but this is pretty rare.",
      "content": "HYB might mean “hell yeah, brother!” sometimes, but this is pretty rare. Send this when you want to express genuine excitement for something with your friends, or if you want to be a little sarcastic and mimic a red-blooded American who might say this with a Southern or Western twang. HYB sometimes means “hell yeah, b*tch!” in a playful way among friends, but save this meaning for people you know won’t be offended by the B word. “HYB!! I knew you’d get first place 🥇” Them: “Still on for the road trip next week?” You: “Hyb! Can’t wait to get on the open road and roam the Great Plains.”"

      "title": "Try sending WYD in place of HYB to ask what someone’s up to.",
      "content": "Try sending WYD in place of HYB to ask what someone’s up to. WYD means “what (are) you doing?” and is a way to ask what someone’s up to right now instead of how they’ve been lately, like with HYB. Just beware that WYD has a flirty or sexual connotation sometimes if you’re sending it to someone you don’t know well. [3] X Research source “Hey, wyd? Wanna check out downtown?” “Wyd? I’m bored here all by myself 😏😉”"

      "title": "Ask “what’s up?” with WSP, “sup,” or “w/u.”",
      "content": "Ask “what’s up?” with WSP, “sup,” or “w/u.” WSP represents the consonant sounds from the phrase “wassup,” which is what “what’s up” sounds like when you say it fast. [4] X Research source This is also where “sup” comes from. [5] X Research source Use any of these texting slang variations to start a casual text conversation with friends, family, or acquaintances (maybe not your boss, though!). “wsp? I miss you!” “Hey! w/u with you these days?” “Sup? Drinks tonight? 🥂”"

      "content": "Let someone know how you’re doing if they ask “hyb?” How much you want to share depends on your relationship with the other person. If it’s just an acquaintance, keep your answer on the shorter, lighter side. If you know the person very well, feel free to open up or mention more personal details—it all depends on what you’re comfortable sharing. To keep the conversation going, ask how they’re doing, too. Them: “Hey, long time no see! Hyb?” You: “Pretty good! I moved closer to the beach last month and have been loving it!” Them: “Saw your last post and thought of you! hyb?” You: “Hey! I’m alright, just been adjusting to my new job. What’s new with you?”"

If you get told to “hyb” or “deal with it” when you’re faced with a problem, accept defeat and come up with a way to solve your problem. Mention your solution to the person you’re texting, or go with a classic “Ugh, fine!” and leave it at that. If you’re at a total loss for how to deal with something, ask them for suggestions . Hopefully they’re able to help! Them: “It’s not my fault you forgot your lunch at home lol, hyb!” You: “Ugh fine, I’ll go buy something across the street.” Them: “People keep talking about your drama with Anna, you need to hyb before the whole school knows.” You: “How? She won’t talk to me!”"

      "content": "Follow up with someone who said they’d hit you back. If someone promises to text or message you later and it’s been a while, feel free to text them first and ask if they’ve got any updates since the last time you chatted. You never know what might be holding somebody up, so consider asking if they’re doing alright if they’re usually super responsive. “Hey, did you find out if you can make it to Max’s holiday party yet?” “Hi, haven’t heard from you in a bit! Everything ok?”"

      "content": "Keep the enthusiasm going if you get an excited “hell yeah, brother!” The sender is probably excited about something or doing a bit to make you laugh, so send something fun and lighthearted. A joke, silly emoji, wacky selfie, or a meme or link to a hype TikTok video are all great ways to keep the energy up! Them: “Hyb! This is gonna be a weekend for the books!” You: “Yeehaw! 🤠” You: “We still on for dinner tonight?” Them: “HYB!!” You: “ 👍 LFG!”"
