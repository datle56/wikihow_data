      "content": "Sync the camera to the computer and transfer the pictures. With most camera software, as soon as you connect the camera to the computer, something will pop up asking if you would like to sync the pictures to the computer. After that it's pretty self-explanatory. If nothing pops up or it was never supposed to pop up in the first place, find and open the camera software. Depending on the type of camera you have, you may need to follow a different set of instructions. Some cameras that are more complex, such as a GoPro, may be more challenging to connect other devices. Reader Poll: We asked 270 wikiHow readers if it’s easy to connect their GoPro to other devices, and 76% of them agreed that it can be difficult to get the GoPro to connect . [Take Poll]"

Some cameras allow you to transfer files but do not support writing changes to the memory card (i.e. deleting). In this case you may need to clean the card using the camera controls (most cameras have a button or a sequence of buttons to clear the card)."
