Dulcolax may be the right medication for you as long as your constipation is not accompanied by severe stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting. If you experience these symptoms, you may have a more serious condition and should not take Dulcolax. Contact your doctor instead. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Also avoid Dulcolax if you have a chronic stomach condition like Crohn’s Disease or ulcerative colitis. It can aggravate symptoms of these conditions. [4] X Research source You should also not take Dulcolax if you’re pregnant. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose tablets for a better taste or liquid for faster results. Oral Dulcolax comes in tablet and liquid form. Both are designed to relieve occasional constipation. Consider the advantages of each before choosing one. [6] X Research source Liquid works faster, and produces a bowel movement within 30 minutes to 6 hours. If you want faster relief or have trouble swallowing pills, liquid is a better option. Keep in mind that with liquid, you'll taste the medication, and this may be unpleasant. [7] X Research source Tablets work slower than liquid, and will take several hours to take effect. [8] X Research source Also with tablets you won't taste the medication, so if you find liquid medicine unpleasant this is a better option."

      "content": "Read the instructions for the recommended dosage. The standard dosage for adults and children over the age of 12 is one 5 mg tablet up to 3 times per day. For children between the ages of 3 and 11, the recommended dose is one 5 mg tablet once or twice daily, preferably at bedtime. The standard dosage for liquid is 5-10 ml for adults and children over 12, and 5 ml for children 3 to 11. Confirm this dosing on the packaging before taking the medication. [9] X Research source If you’ve never taken bisacodyl before, only take 1 tablet or 5 ml on your first dosage. Then if it doesn’t work well enough within 12 to 24 hours, take 2 tablets or 10 ml for your second dosage the following day. Do not give Dulcolax to children under 10 without direction from a doctor. Never give the medication to children under 4."

      "title": "Take the medicine at night before bed.",
      "content": "Take the medicine at night before bed. Dulcolax takes several hours to work. The recommended practice is taking the medication before bed so it can work overnight and produce a bowel movement in the morning. [10] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The medicine will still work if you take it during the day. If you know you’ll be home when the medicine works, then there is no harm in taking it earlier than bedtime."

      "content": "Swallow the pill whole with a glass of water if taking tablets. Do not chew or break up the tablet. It must be swallowed whole. Drink a full glass of water while taking it so there is enough liquid in your stomach to activate the medication. [11] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Dulcolax can be taken on an empty or full stomach. If medicine usually upsets your stomach, eating a little food can help prevent this. A piece of bread or some crackers is enough."

      "title": "Swallow all of the medicine right away if taking liquid.",
      "content": "Swallow all of the medicine right away if taking liquid. Don't take small sips at a time. This not only prolongs the time you have to taste the medicine, but it delays your body's absorption of the full dose. Give your body the full dose at the same time for the best results. [12] X Research source You can also dilute the liquid with water. Mix the dosage into a glass of water and swallow the entire mixture. [13] X Research source Milk inhibits Dulcolax from working. If you have a habit of drinking a glass of milk at bedtime, take your Dulcolax at least an hour before you do this."

Dulcolax takes several hours to work, so if you take it at bedtime then you should have a bowel movement in the morning. If you don’t have one all day, call your doctor. This could mean you have a blockage in your digestive system that requires medical attention. [14] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You don’t have to call your doctor if you have a subpar bowel movement that feels like you didn’t empty all the way.

Dulcolax suppositories work much faster than oral forms, and should produce a bowel movement within 15 to 30 minutes. [15] X Research source If you require immediate relief, this is your best option. If you are using Dulcolax to prep for a colonoscopy or medical exam, it will probably be in suppository form. Your doctor may prescribe suppositories in combination with oral laxatives as well to ensure your digestive system is clear."

Insert it again, making sure to push it as far as you can with your finger. Consider wearing rubber gloves for this step. If you don't use gloves, wash your hands thoroughly after inserting it.
