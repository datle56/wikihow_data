To wear the tool, just put the index and middle fingers of your non-dominant hand through the ring. Make sure the open side of the nose is closer to your fingertips. If the tool feels loose in your hand, put your ring finger in the ring as well. [1] X Research source Holding the tool so the nose is in your palm makes it easier to maintain your grip while you tie balloons, but you can try positioning the nose on the back of your hand if it feels more comfortable."
