      "title": "Bring together the outside bands.",
      "content": "Bring together the outside bands. These bands are curved on 1 side. Bring them together so that the rounded edges are facing out. This will form a rounded diamond shape where the knot will go. [1] X Research source For a 4-band ring, there will be 2 outside bands. For a 7- or 8-band ring, there will be 4 outside bands. Bring them together so that the 2 bands that curve in the same direction fit together. All 4 bands will make a diamond shape when they are lined up. The process is very similar for a 6-band ring. A 6-band ring will have either 2 or 4 bands that form a diamond."

      "title": "Rotate the inside bands so that they hang by the knot.",
      "content": "Rotate the inside bands so that they hang by the knot. Hold the outside bands together with one hand. Using the other hand, rotate the inside bands so that they are hanging from the outside bands by the bent knot part of the ring. [2] X Research source For a 4-band ring, 2 bands will hang down by the knot. For an 8-band ring, all 4 inside bands will hang. For a 7-band ring, 3 will hang down. For a 6-band ring, either 2 or 4 bands will hang by the knot, depending on the number of outside bands."

      "title": "Locate the band or bands with a groove and hold it firmly in place.",
      "content": "Locate the band or bands with a groove and hold it firmly in place. Depending on how many inside bands there are, 1 or 2 will have a groove in the knot. This groove will keep all of the other bands together. Hold them firmly with 2 fingers. [3] X Research source For a 4-band ring, there will be 1 grooved band. For a 7- or 8-band ring, there will be 2 grooved bands. For a 6-band ring, there can be either 1 or 2 grooved bands, depending on how many inside bands there are."

      "title": "Cross the 2 inside bands over each other by the knot.",
      "content": "Cross the 2 inside bands over each other by the knot. With the grooved ring firmly in place, cross the other inside band over the top of it. The band will fit perfectly into the groove. You will be able to see the X through the diamond created by the outside rings. [4] X Research source The inside rings will fit perfectly one over the other. If they don't align perfectly, try crossing them the opposite way. For an 8-band ring, one pair of bands will cross over the other pair. Treat each pair like it is a single band. For a 7-band ring, treat the smaller pair of bands as a single band, and cross the single, bigger band over the 2 smaller bands. [5] X Research source For a 6-band ring, treat any pair as a single band."

      "title": "Let go of the outside bands.",
      "content": "Let go of the outside bands. While you hold the inner bands firmly in place, let the outside bands fall to the sides. One of the outside bands will be on top of the other. [6] X Research source For an 8-band ring and some 6-band rings, let the 4 outside bands fall. For 4- and 7- and some 6-band rings, only 2 outer bands will fall."

      "content": "Thread the outside bands into place. Take the outside ring at the bottom and turn it towards you until the knot passes through the X. Then fit the rings together so that the bands line up. Repeat this process with the other remaining bands. [7] X Research source You may have to loosen the X for the bands to pass through. For 4- and some 6-band rings, you will need to turn 2 bands into place. For a 7-, 8-, and 6-band rings with 4 inside bands, turn one band at a time starting with the outermost band."
