      "content": "Dental treats break up plaque and tartar when your dog chews them. Choose from dental rawhide, sticks, bones, or biscuits. Check the label to ensure the chew is the best size for your dog’s weight. Give your dog up to one dental chew a day and be sure to supervise them as they gnaw on it. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Once the dental chew breaks apart, throw it away so it doesn’t become a choking hazard or splinter and harm your dog’s teeth and gums. When your dog gnaws on either a dental treat or toy, they scrape off the plaque and tartar on their teeth. All-natural dental treats have enzymes that promote dental health, and many dental treats contain ingredients that freshen your dog’s breath. Limit your dog to one dental treat a day to help them maintain a healthy weight. Give your dog a dental chew toy instead of a treat if they’re on a vet-recommended diet. Your pooch won’t even know the difference!"

      "content": "Dental wipes remove calcium that can harden into plaque or tartar. Crouch down by your dog, talking in a happy, excited tone, and place your finger on one of their teeth. If your dog is calm and relaxed, place a dental wipe over your finger and gently touch more of their teeth. Once your dog adjusts to the dental wipe, use it to rub each tooth in a circular motion. [3] X Research source After placing a dental wipe against your dog's teeth to let them adjust to it, praise them. Since dental wipes break down calcium, they also soften tartar, which is actually made up of calcium deposits that cling onto your dog’s teeth and can lead to health problems like gingivitis.

      "content": "Pet oral gel is specially formulated to remove plaque and tartar. Pet your dog and lightly touch the inside of their mouth. Once your dog adjusts to this, squeeze two drops of oral care gel onto your index finger and dab the right side of your dog’s mouth. Repeat this step on the left side. [5] X Research source Give your dog a gum massage to help stimulate blood flow if they allow it. An oral massage can also increase saliva production and help dislodge plaque. When you apply oral care gel daily, you may see results in as little as 30 days or less. You won’t need to brush your dog’s teeth if you use oral care gels like TropiClean Fresh Breath . Your dog’s saliva mixes with the oral care gel and activates ingredients that break down plaque and tartar. Oral care gel will also fight bacteria and freshen your dog’s breath.

      "content": "Dental spray removes plaque before it hardens into tartar. When your dog is calm and relaxed, spritz their gums and teeth with a dental spray formulated for pets. Your dog’s saliva mixes with the spray to create a film that dissolves the plaque and calcium in tartar. [7] X Research source Read the label on your dental spray and check the dose for your dog’s size. Use dental spray 30 minutes before or after your dog eats. Spray your dog’s teeth more often if they have advanced tartar buildup. A dental spray like HealthyMouth doesn’t contain alcohol or toxins and uses natural ingredients to reduce tartar and prevent gum disease. For maximum results, combine dental spray with daily brushing. If your dog is uncooperative and you can’t spritz into their mouth, apply the dental spray to their dog toys. The dental spray will combine with their saliva when they chew on the toys."

      "content": "Bones help knock tartar off teeth when dogs chew them. Choose a bone that’s large enough that your dog won’t swallow but small enough that they can easily chew it. Always supervise your dog while they nibble on bones. Once your dog can fit an entire bone or piece of bone into their mouth, take it away and give them a new one. [8] X Research source Raw bones are great for fighting tartar because they don’t splinter and won’t damage your dog’s teeth. Use the “knee cap” test to check if bones are soft enough for your dog—if you hit your knee cap with a bone and it hurts, it’s too hard for your dog to chew on. Keep an eye on your dog’s chewing behavior. They can fracture their teeth on a hard bone if they're an aggressive chewer."

Once you’ve finished with your preferred method of fighting tartar, reward your dog with a treat for being cooperative. Then, praise and pet your dog or play a round of fetch so they have positive associations with teeth cleaning. [9] X Research source Use an upbeat, energetic tone to motivate your dog and help them feel more excited about teeth cleaning. Give your dog the same compliments you give them for good behavior. For example, you can say, “Good boy!” or “Who’s the best doggo? You are!” Don’t give your dog more than the recommended amount of treats in a day – usually about 10% of their daily calories."

      "content": "The antibacterial properties of coconut oil help fight plaque and tartar. Put 1 tbsp (14 mL) of coconut oil on a soft-bristled “doggy toothbrush.” Brush your dog’s teeth in a circular motion for about 2 minutes. When you’re finished, praise your dog and give them a good, long scratch. [10] X Research source For best results, brush your dog’s teeth with coconut oil once a day. Avoid giving your dog a treat before cleaning their teeth to make the process easier. Play a fun game, like fetch or tug, so your dog gets excited for tooth brushings. Check with your vet before introducing coconut oil into your dog’s diet. If your dog carries a few extra pounds, try a different approach to oral hygiene. Add coconut oil to your dog’s food to help with tartar prevention."

      "content": "A dental additive helps keep the water free of tartar-causing bacteria. First, ask your vet if they recommend daily water additives for your dog. If they give you the okay, read the label of your dental additive and pour the suggested amount into your dog’s water bowl. [12] X Research source When your dog drinks water, the dental additive acts as a mouthwash that cleans their gums and teeth. Many dental additives are odorless, so your dog won’t notice anything different about their water. Clean your dog’s water bowl after each use to make sure it’s sterilized. Since a dental additive kills bacteria, it helps prevent tartar and mouth infections. Ask your vet if your dog has pre-existing conditions or is on medications that may interact with water additives."

      "content": "Most vets recommend an annual professional cleaning to fight tartar buildup. Tartar buildup can lead to gum disease, infections, tooth loss, and decay. These conditions are often painful and can affect your hound’s quality of life. If your dog shows signs of thick tartar buildup, schedule a dental appointment with your vet. They’ll give your dog a thorough cleaning under anesthesia to remove all the tartar. [13] X Research source Dogs need regular dental visits to maintain oral health, just like humans! If your dog develops tartar quickly, you might need to schedule a dental appointment every 6 months. Practice good oral hygiene between your dog’s regular cleanings to help prevent tartar buildup."
