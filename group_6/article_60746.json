Then, use the same control to tie the other end of the lead to a fence post, which keeps the frog in a certain area. Multiple frogs can be tied to the same fence post. Console controls: Mobile: Tap Leash PlayStation: L2 Xbox: LT Nintendo Switch: ZL Need a lead? Scavenge one from an Ancient City, Woodland mansion, or some Trail ruins, or make one using a slimeball and 4 pieces of string."

While holding one, lead the frog to a secure enclosure on your farm. Minecraft frogs can jump up to 8 blocks high, so it’s best to keep them in a secure enclosure with a roof."

While holding the slimeball, right-click, tap, or use the corresponding console button to feed the frogs—hearts will appear over them once they’re successfully fed. Make sure that there’s at least 1 block of air above the body of water; otherwise, the frogs won’t be able to lay eggs in it. You can get slimeballs by finding and killing slimes ."

Green frogs come from cold biomes (like a snow-covered mountain), orange frogs come from temperate biomes (like regular swamps), and white frogs come from warm biomes (like a savannah, desert, mangrove swamp, or jungle)"
