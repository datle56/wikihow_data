Use any type of detergent to wash your MyPillow, but know the brand recommends using half of the regular amount to reduce sudsing. [1] X Research source Because the standard amount of detergent to use during a load is around 1 1 ⁄ 2 fluid ounces (44 mL), cut it in half and pour it into your washing machine. [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source MyPillow recommends that you don’t use any fabric softeners during your wash cycle. If you’re using a laundry detergent bottle’s cap as a measuring cup, fill it halfway up to the “1 load” line and pour it into the machine."

Toss your pillow into the machine along with the clothes to help balance the load. [3] X Research source A front-loading machine is preferred since it’ll prevent your pillow from floating on top of the water. If you don’t have any clothes to wash, put your MyPillow in with a load of towels."

If you don’t have a second one to wash, set your MyPillow on one side of the machine’s drum and drop 2 or 3 large towels onto the other side so the machine stays balanced during the wash cycle. [4] X Research source If your washer doesn’t have an agitator in the center, place the MyPillow in the washer first and then weigh it down with a few heavy towels so it doesn’t float to the surface."

While some pillows are designed to be washed on the “delicate” or “gentle” setting, MyPillows are safe for any “regular,” “normal,” or “cotton” setting. [5] X Research source A “delicate” or “gentle” cycle uses slow spin cycles and limited agitation, which won’t clean your MyPillow as effectively as the faster regular cycle."

[6] X Research source Choose a “cold” setting if you prefer a more energy-efficient approach, or select a “warm” setting if you’d like to sanitize your pillow more thoroughly or eliminate stains. Avoid using a hot water cycle for cleaning your MyPillow because it could damage the foam inside"

If your MyPillow still feels excessively damp or wet at the end of the wash, add 1 or 2 more spin cycles to help remove as much water as possible. Depending on the type of machine you’re using, you can add an extra spin to the initial wash cycle, or run a separate spin cycle after the initial wash is done.

Even if there are just a few small spots that contain some moisture, toss the pillow back into the dryer for 10 to 15 more minutes. Keep checking and drying the pillow until it’s free of moisture.

Then, slide on a well-fitting pillowcase to prevent sweat, oils, and cosmetic products from transferring from your face to the pillow while you’re sleeping. [11] X Research source The manufacturers recommend using a 100% cotton pillowcase with your MyPillow.
