A sudden change in gas mileage could be a sign the compression stroke is failing. [4] X Research source The compression stroke is one of four strokes or events in the internal combustion engine to keep a car running. In this stroke, the intake and exhaust valves close, trapping air and fuel in the combustion chamber. If the compression stroke is faulty, the engine will use more fuel per mile."
