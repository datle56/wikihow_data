TikTok creators may also use \"DC\" to credit another creator when they use their dance moves in their own TikTok videos. In that regard, \"DC\" can also mean \"Dance Credit.\" The DC acronym can also have other meanings, including \"Don't Care,\" or in the context of gaming, \"Disconnect.\" It can also be a reference to Washington D.C."
