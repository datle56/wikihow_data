      "content": "WYO stands for “What you on?” over text and social media. Most often, “What you on” can be used interchangeably with phrases like, “What are you up to?” “How’s it going?” or “Are you busy?” WYO is essentially another way to ask someone what they’re doing and find out if they want to make plans or do an activity with you. You might see someone send this phrase when they want to hang out or simply catch up with you. [1] X Research source “WYO? Let’s hang out later! 🙏” “Wyo I’m soooo bored!! 😩” WYO first became a popular online acronym in 2015 and officially became a slang term when it was added to the Urban Dictionary website in 2017. “What are you on?” is a similar phrase to WYO but has a very different meaning; it’s used to tell someone they’re behaving erratically (and implies that drugs are the cause)."
