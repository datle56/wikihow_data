      "content": "Be aware of the two types of vitamin B12 supplements. There are two types of vitamin B12 supplements that you can take, cyanocobalamin and methylcobalamin.

Vitamin B12 supplements come in tablets, capsules, and liquid form. There is also a sublingual form that dissolves under your tongue."

      "content": "Look for vitamin B12 supplements derived from whole foods. When buying vitamin B12 supplements from health food stores or in the vitamin aisle of your local pharmacy, you should look for information on the label confirming the supplement is derived from whole foods. Though vitamins derived from whole foods may be more expensive, this will ensure the vitamin is of the highest quality.

      "content": "Check the label for independent seals of approval. Many supplements use independent labs to test their products and receive seals of approval for their quality. Look on the label of the supplements from seals of approval from Consumer Labs, the Natural Products Association (NPA), LabDoor, and the United States Pharmacopeia. You can also go directly to the websites of any of these independent labels to see if the manufacturer of the supplement is listed with seals of approval. However, if the supplement does not have any seals of approval, this does not necessarily mean the product is faulty. Getting checked and approved by an independent lab is completely voluntary for supplement manufacturers."
