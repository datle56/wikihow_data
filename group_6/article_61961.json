      "content": "Determine if your Roku model supports YouTube. With recent updates, all \"current-gen\" Roku devices can now add an official YouTube channel. This means every Roku device except the original Roku (which is released in 2010) can now add the YouTube channel. Note: Roku's model-naming system can be very confusing. The original Roku launched in 2010, and the Roku 2 launched in 2011. After the Roku 2 came out, they released a new Roku 1 and Roku 2 in 2013. This means that the Roku 1 and the original Roku are actually two completely different models. [1] X Research source If you have the original Roku from 2010, the only way to get YouTube videos is to install the Twonky channel, which requires a subscription."
