      "content": "Check for rapid pulse. Because cocaine is a stimulant, one of the common physical symptoms of cocaine use is a rapid heartbeat. In some cases, this may lead to cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), hypertension, and cardiac death. [12] X Research source A normal, healthy heart rate for most adults is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Note that heart rate can be affected by other factors not associated with drug use, including physical activity, air temperature, body position, emotional states, and even certain legal medications. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For this reason, heart rate alone should not necessarily be considered a definitive sign of drug use."

Crack is formed by mixing powdered cocaine with water and baking soda.

      "content": "Identify the signs of intravenous drug use. Some users inject cocaine intravenously, using a syringe. This is done to experience immediate effects of the drug but comes with its own set of risks, including endocarditis (heart inflammation), cardiovascular disease, abscesses/infections, and an increased risk of overdose. Intravenous drug use also greatly increases the chances of transmitting a blood-borne disease like hepatitis and HIV. Signs of intravenous drug use include puncture marks (called \"track marks\"), most commonly seen in the arm, and possible skin infections or allergic reactions caused by additives mixed with cocaine.

      "content": "Be aware of oral ingestion. One method of administering cocaine is by orally swallowing the drug. This produces fewer external signs of drug use than smoking, snorting, or injecting the drug, but it has been known to cause severe gangrene in the bowels and gastrointestinal tract due to reduced blood flow and GI sensitivity to the drug. [18] X Research source In cases of oral ingestion, the most visible signs will probably be the symptoms typical of stimulant use, including: agitation [19] X Research source unusual excitement [20] X Research source hyperactivity [21] X Research source suppressed appetite [22] X Research source paranoia [23] X Research source delusions [24] X Research source"
