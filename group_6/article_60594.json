The place values should always be aligned. Even if you are subtracting a 4-digit number from a 1-digit number. Since a 1-digit number only has ones, you will align this number with the digit in the ones place of the larger number."

To do this, subtract 1 from the digit in the tens place, and add 10 to the digit in the ones place. Make sure you cross out the original digits and write the new numbers after borrowing. [3] X Research source For example, if you are calculating 5 , 914 − 2 , 346 {\\displaystyle 5,914-2,346} , you will subtract 4 − 6 {\\displaystyle 4-6} in the ones place. Since 6 is larger than 4, you must borrow from the tens place. The 1 in the tens place becomes a 0, and the 4 in the ones place becomes 14. So now you will calculate 14 − 6 = 8 {\\displaystyle 14-6=8} . So the digit in the ones place of your answer is 8."

To borrow from the hundreds place, follow the same procedure you used when borrowing from the tens place. [4] X Research source For example, if you are calculating 5 , 914 − 2 , 346 {\\displaystyle 5,914-2,346} , you will subtract 0 − 4 {\\displaystyle 0-4} in the tens place, since you borrowed a ten when subtracting ones. Since 4 is larger than 0, you must borrow from the hundreds place. The 9 in the hundreds place becomes an 8 , and the 0 in the tens place becomes 10. So now you will calculate 10 − 4 = 6 {\\displaystyle 10-4=6} . So the digit in the tens place of your answer is 6."
