[2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Use a bowl to soak a finger or a basin to soak your feet. The water should be very warm but not so hot that it causes pain or discomfort. Acute paronychia can develop suddenly due to injury or exposure to harsh substances, unlike chronic paronychia, which is often caused by a fungal infection. Acute paronychia usually affects a single finger or toe due to a bacterial infection. Symptoms include redness, swelling, pus, and throbbing pain around your nail."

Your doctor will likely order a culture and other tests to accurately diagnose chronic paronychia and prescribe a medication, such as an antifungal, to fight the infection based on their findings. [13] X Research source While acute paronychia usually goes away within 5-10 days, chronic paronychia tends to take several weeks to heal with proper treatment. Typically, doctors prescribe a topical antifungal ointment, which you’ll apply to the affected areas 2 to 3 times daily. Always take any prescriptions according to your doctor’s instructions. Fungal and bacterial infections can coincide, so your doctor might prescribe both an antibacterial and antifungal treatment if this occurs. Keep in mind that fungal infections can take several weeks to clear."
