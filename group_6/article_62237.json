      "content": "In Vedic astrology, an aspect is the degree of influence a planet has in a house. A Vedic birth chart contains four squares and eight triangles, representing the twelve astrological houses. Each house is 30° long, and astrologers use this measurement to declare what planets have the most influence. An aspect, therefore, measures the degree of separation between two planets across houses. [1] X Research source Think of an aspect like the beam of a flashlight. If the planet is a flashlight, the light it gives off represents the amount of influence. The more planets and houses the light touches, the more influence a planet has. For example, if Mars is 17° in the 10th House and Jupiter is 6° in the 4th House, there’s an 11° separation between the planets. In Sanskrit, aspects are called Drishti, which means \"to see.\""
