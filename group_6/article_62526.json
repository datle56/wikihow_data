      "content": "A wings hairstyle is when the ends of the hair flip up and out at ear level. A wings haircut (also known as a mod haircut) is a popular men’s hairstyle with roots in the skateboarding, mod, surfer, and preppy subcultures. It's a shaggy, undone look that works for long, medium, and short hair, but the typical length is about halfway down the ears. The ends are styled to flip up and out (hence the name “wings”). [1] X Research source The “wings” style was first fashionable as a Victorian-era style. It resurfaced in the 1960s-1970s and became trendy yet again in the mid-late 2000s when Justin Bieber famously rocked the look. Since then, many other famous faces have worn the style, including Timothée Chalomet and Bradley Cooper. [2] X Research source The current incarnation of the look is based more on the way shaggy, layered hair naturally curls up under the edges of a ball cap (or head rag) after you wear it all day."

      "content": "A wings hairstyle works best for people with wavy hair. You can create wings with most hair types and textures, but the look is pretty tough to achieve if you have super straight or very curly hair. People with naturally wavy hair are the perfect candidates for wings because the style enhances their natural hair texture and they’ll have the easiest time styling their look. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask your stylist for a razored layer cut with feathered ends. Shag-style razor-cut layers are crucial for this look, and feathering the hair at the very ends encourages the hair to flip up easily. Razor-cut layers create the chunkier, more textured look that the hairstyle is based on. [4] X Research source Be sure to explain what you want to your stylist and bring a few reference photos so there’s no confusion. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Go with a shorter length if you want to create a preppy or mod vibe. Cropping your hair on the shorter side ensures your overall look is neat (rather than messy). Ask your stylist to cut the hair just above your ears or about halfway down your ears. For the back, get it cut straight across the nape of your neck. [6] X Research source For your bangs (the hair that falls over your forehead), the length is pretty much up to you. The typical approach is bangs that fall anywhere between the middle of your forehead to about your eyebrows. Ask your stylist to point cut or razor cut the ends so your bangs look soft (rather than creating a harsh line). [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Grow out your hair a little for a skateboarding or surfer look. If you’re going for this bedhead look, aim for length just below your ears (or longer if you’d like). The longer the length, the messier and more relaxed the style will look. When you reach the length you want, ask your stylist to razor cut layers into your hair and feather the ends. Bangs are usually about eyebrow length, but feel free to grow them a little past your eyebrows so they droop slightly over your eyes, then brush them over to the side for that relaxed surfer/skater look.

      "content": "Put on a baseball cap and blow dry the ends up for an easy technique. It doesn’t get much simpler than this and it’s a great solution if you’re pressed for time. Simply situate the ball cap over your damp hair so the ends naturally stick out and flip up over your ears. Place the blow dryer underneath the hair and dry it upwards to lock the style in place. Remove the cap and let the rest of your hair air-dry. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Blow dry the ends with a large round brush if you want more control. Distribute a small amount of styling cream or gel throughout your hair, brush the hair forward, and blow dry the top forward and down so the roots lay flat. Then, brush through the hair over your ears with a round brush and flick your wrist up when you reach the ends. Blow dry the ends wrapped in the brush until they’re completely dry so the hair flips up. [10] X Research source"

Once your hair is dry, you can add a little more bend in your wings and help the style stay in place all day by using heat styling tools . Use a curling iron or flat iron to shape the ends over your ears so they flip up more dramatically."

Rub a pea-sized amount of styling gel or pomade between your fingertips and run your fingers through your hair to distribute the product. For even more hold, add a little more product directly to the flipped up ends and twist them. You can also lightly mist your finished look with hairspray to lock in the style. [11] X Research source"
