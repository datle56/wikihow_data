      "content": "It’s the first step into accessing a wide range of services. Having fun isn’t hard if you’ve got a library card! You’ll need one in order to use your library to do things like borrow books and access online resources. It’s also super easy to get one—simply visit your local branch and ask for one. You’ll need some form of ID and proof of address to show that you live in the area and your librarian will be able to get you one right there on the spot.

Some libraries may allow you to request a library card online so check out their website to see if you can. For ID, you can use your driver’s license, government ID, or even a school ID. You can often use a utility bill or your lease to show your proof of residence. Insurance cards also qualify as valid ID. [3] X Expert Source Kim Gillingham, MA Master's Degree, Library Science, Kutztown University Expert Interview. 15 May 2019. If you don’t live in the area, you may be able to use a non-resident card or access library services as a guest. Talk to the branch librarian to see how you can do it. Minors will need to have a parent or guardian sign their application, though some libraries allow young adults (ages 16-17) apply for a card on their own with a valid ID.

      "content": "They can assist with research and help you locate materials. You might be surprised at just how much librarians can do. Sure, they can help you find any books, movies, or anything else you’re looking for. But they’re also actually trained research assistants and can help you look up information, access databases, or find materials you can use. All you have to do is ask and they’ll be happy to assist.

Librarians can also help you look for jobs, fill out applications, register to vote , and even file your taxes. Seriously, librarians are superheroes. If there’s something they can’t help you with, they can likely point you to someone or somewhere that can. They can also help you out with your homework, too!"

While libraries can plant the seeds of knowledge in people’s minds, they can also help you plant seeds of your own—literally. Some libraries keep a collection of seed packets that you can check out and take home to plant. Ask your librarian if your branch has a seed bank. If they do, take a look at what they’ve got and take home whatever you’d like to try to grow. You can try growing some veggies, herbs, peppers, flowers, or whatever you like! There might be a limit for how many seed packets you can take home."
