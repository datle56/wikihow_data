      "content": "The VSC light signals that the vehicle stability control system is activated. If the VSC light appears on your dashboard, it means that the system is working to help your vehicle maintain control and traction. The light should turn off as soon as the vehicle is back in line with the inputs of your steering wheel. This is completely normal and so long as the light goes away after a few seconds or minutes, you’ve got nothing to worry about. The system is working as intended. [1] X Research source If the VSC light won’t turn off, the system may need to be reset. If the VSC light is flashing, something is actively wrong with the VSC system. If the VSC Off light is on, you need to turn the system on using the VSC system button."

      "content": "Press the VSC button to turn the system on or off. Look for a VSC button next to the gearshift, on your steering wheel, or next to your steering wheel. You can tell if the system is off if you see a “VSC Off” light on your dashboard. If there are no lights on, the VSC system is active (which is normal). [2] X Research source Don’t see the letters VSC anywhere? Some makes don’t put “VSC” on the button. Instead, the button will display the back of a car swerving. This is your VSC button. If you still can’t find the button refer to your vehicle’s manual to find its location."

      "title": "The Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) system keeps your car stable.",
      "content": "The Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) system keeps your car stable. In Toyota and Lexus vehicles, the VSC system helps your vehicle maintain traction and keep the tires fully intact with the road by automatically cutting power and/or applying brakes to certain wheels. It helps minimize the odds of a crash, prevents your car from hydroplaning when it’s raining or snowing, and gives you a better sense of control on the road. The VSC isn’t doing anything most of the time, but it will kick on whenever your vehicle detects you may be losing control of the car. [3] X Research source The VSC system should be turned on all the time but not active all the time. If the VSC light is actively on for prolonged periods of time, the system needs to be reset. In very rare circumstances, you may want to turn the VSC off if your vehicle is stuck in snow or mud. Sometimes, the traction requirements for the automated VSC system can make getting out of a stuck spot more difficult. [4] X Research source The VSC system is only available on vehicles made by Toyota and Lexus. However, every other manufacturer has some version of this technology—it’s legally required on all cars these days. [5] X Research source Like the automatic braking system (ABS) and traction control, a car’s VSC system is automated. It’s always “on” but it’s not active unless something happens to trigger the system to activate."

      "content": "Yes, it's safe to drive with the VSC light on. If the VSC light pops on temporarily and then goes off, it’s completely safe to drive. It’s also okay to drive if the “VSC Off” light is on so long as you aren’t driving in heavy rain or on a dirt road. If you are, pull over and locate the VSC button. Press it to turn the system back on. [6] X Research source If the light is flashing, it indicates a serious issue with your vehicle’s VSC system. If you can, stop driving. If you can’t, go slow and be cautious."

      "title": "A flashing VSC light indicates a problem with the VSC system.",
      "content": "A flashing VSC light indicates a problem with the VSC system. You can continue driving if you feel like you have control of the vehicle, but go slow and take your time. Take the vehicle to a mechanic as soon as you can to get the issue inspected and repaired. [7] X Research source If possible, take the car to the mechanic at a Toyota dealership. They’ll have specialized training in the VSC systems. A flashing VSC light will almost always be paired with a check engine light and/or TRAC light (indication the traction control system is off). VSC issues are often caused by sensor failure, electrical problems, or differential issues. Repair costs will run $250-1,000 depending on the source of the issue."

      "content": "Press and hold the VSC button until the VSC Off light appears. Find the VSC button near your steering wheel or gearshift. Follow these steps to reset your VSC system if your VSC light is illuminated or seems to activate more often than it should: [8] X Research source Park your vehicle somewhere safe and flat. Press and hold the VSC button for at least 3 seconds. Release the VSC button once the “VSC Off” and “TRAC Off” lights appear. Wait a few seconds and press the VSC button again. Once the VSC Off and TRAC Off lights go away, you’ve successfully reset the VSC system."
