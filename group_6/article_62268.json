Don’t try to mask what you’re feeling or get over it too quickly, as that could cause you more pain in the long run. [1] X Research source If you need to take a break from the friendship, that’s okay too. There’s no timeline for how long it might take you to get over being rejected. Just let yourself feel what you need to feel for however long it takes. If you feel the pain is too intense, cry to get it off your chest. Have less contact with them than before. [2] X Research source Stop looking at their social media accounts for some time. [3] X Research source Focus on other activities and yourself. Get back to doing things you like and learn how to be only a friend again to this person. [4] X Research source"

If he still wants to be friends, you’re obviously doing something right!

Once he’s ready, he’ll text or call you to hang out again. [6] X Research source Sometimes guys say that they want to be friends so they don’t hurt your feelings. If he’s serious about keeping a friendship going, he’ll reach out to you."

      "content": "Hanging out one-on-one might be pretty awkward at first. When you two hang out again for the first time, get a few other friends to be there with you. It will help ease the tension and allow you to interact in a neutral setting. [7] X Research source You can tell your friends about what happened or you can keep it to yourself. If you're worried your friends might gossip, keep your feelings between the two of you."

      "content": "It's probably going to be a bit awkward at first no matter what. You both might feel a bit shy or embarrassed, and that’s okay! Try to accept that so you can move past it as fast as possible. Things will probably fall back into place pretty quickly! [8] X Research source"

If you need to talk about what happened before diving back into the friendship, that’s fine, but do it early on and in private. Don’t bring it up when you’re casually hanging out since that will probably be pretty uncomfortable for both of you. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "He’s the one who rejected you, and flirting can be confusing. Some guys are flirtatious by nature, while others might be actually interested but afraid to commit. Either way, it’s best to leave flirtatious behavior behind, even if he initiates it first. [10] X Research source Engaging in flirtatious behavior can give you mixed signals, and it might stop you from moving on."

You don’t have to get into a serious relationship—just try going out for coffee or hanging out at the park with someone new. The more you can focus your attention on someone else, the less you’ll feel for the guy who rejected you. [12] X Research source Of course, you should never get into a relationship if you aren’t ready for one. It’s perfectly fine to stay single for a while and focus on yourself."

If you’ve tried the whole friendship thing and you still have strong feelings for him, remaining friends will only hurt you. You can distance yourself slowly or let him know outright that it’s just too painful to stay friends. [13] X Research source You could say something like, “I know we said we wanted to stay friends, but I still have feelings for you. I need to take some time for myself so I can move on.” Keep the possibility of friendship open. You might be able to reconnect in the future when you no longer have feelings for him."
