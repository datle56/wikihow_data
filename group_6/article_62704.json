      "title": "On Snapchat, the X means that person is not on your friends list.",
      "content": "On Snapchat, the X means that person is not on your friends list. If you were friends on Snapchat with this person before, it likely means that they unfriended you. But if you haven’t ever had this person on your friends list, the X means that they’ve sent you a request that you haven’t accepted yet. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that an X icon does not mean this person has blocked you, it just means they’ve unfriended you. To find out if someone has blocked you, try searching for their name in the app. If they’ve blocked you, their username won’t pop up."

      "content": "You can message someone with an X icon, but it will say “Pending.” If someone isn’t on your friends list anymore, they can’t see your message until they’ve added you back. If you try to send them a Snapchat or a message, you’ll see a gray “Pending” sign underneath their name. [2] X Research source If they add you back, though, your messages will go through."

      "content": "Add the person as a friend on Snapchat. Click on the name of the person with the X icon. If they’ve requested to be your friend, Snapchat will give you the option to accept or reject the friend request. If they’ve unadded you, you can request to be their friend again by clicking +Add next to their username. [3] X Research source Once you accept their friend request (or they accept yours), the X icon will go away."

      "content": "Block the person on Snapchat. If you don’t know this person and you don’t want them in your friends list anymore, click on the X icon. From there, you can either block them on Snapchat or report their account. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "They were scared of hurting your feelings.",
      "content": "They were scared of hurting your feelings. Maybe they weren’t really feeling the conversation, but they didn’t know how to tell you. Or, maybe there wasn't any romantic attraction on their end, but they didn’t want to make you upset. People will often ghost others because it’s easier than having a tough conversation that might make you feel hurt or angry. [5] X Research source Respond to ghosting by remembering how awesome you are, then moving on. When someone unfriends you without even talking to you about it, it says more about them than it does about you."

      "title": "They’re afraid of commitment.",
      "content": "They’re afraid of commitment. Maybe they really did like you, but that was scary to them. If you two had been flirting or talking romantically for a while, they might have unfriended you because they weren’t ready for a relationship and they didn’t know how to tell you.

      "content": "They have a significant other. Yes, it’s true—when you suddenly see an X icon appear next to someone’s name, there’s a chance that they were caught by their romantic partner. People will sometimes pretend to be single online, but most people view that as cheating. They may have unfriended you to avoid a fight with their partner or because they got caught.

      "title": "It was a convenient way to stop talking.",
      "content": "It was a convenient way to stop talking. Technology, and especially apps like Snapchat, make it super easy to stop talking to one person and move onto the next. If you two have never met up in person or you’ve only talked IRL a couple of times, they may have ghosted you just because they don’t think of it as a real relationship yet. [8] X Research source Unfortunately, ghosting has become pretty common in today’s era of online dating and online friendships. To know you’ve been ghosted for certain, try reaching out one last time to see if they’ll respond."
