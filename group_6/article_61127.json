      "content": "Understand the most common behavioral problems in cats. Though every cat is unique and may have specific issues or specific bad behaviors, most cats act out in seven ways: [1] X Research source Avoiding the litter box or refusing to use the litter box . Marking furniture and other objects with their urine. Scratching furniture and other objects in your home. Your cat may also scratch you or others when play fighting. Acting aggressive towards other people or towards their owner. Acting aggressive towards other cats in the home. Displaying stress or anxiety. Acting fearful of objects or people."

      "content": "Bring your cat to the vet for a checkup to rule out any medical issues. Sometimes cats will respond act out or display behavioral issues because they are struggling with a medical issue. For example, your cat may refuse to use their litter box due to a urinary tract infection, or they may act aggressively towards you because they are experiencing physical pain that is not immediately apparent to you. Some cats become fearful of people or objects due to vision issues and over groom themselves due to hyperthyroidism. [2] X Research source Taking your cat to the vet for a checkup will help identify any medical problems that could be causing your cat’s bad behavior and treat it promptly so it does not worsen. If your vet gives your cat a clean bill of health, you can focus on issues in your cat’s environment that may be causing his bad behavior."

      "content": "Recognize any environmental causes for your cat’s bad behavior. Once your cat is cleared of any medical issues, you can consider why your cat might be displaying one or several of these bad behaviors. Look at his environment for any triggers of bad behavior, including: [3] X Research source A dirty or poorly kept litter box, which can lead to litter box avoidance. Another cat who is bullying your cat in the home, leading to litter box avoidance and aggression. A new cat in the home, which can cause your cat to urine mark. A new dog in the home can also cause your cat to act fearful or aggressive. A lack of scratching posts, which can lead to your cat scratching furniture and other objects in the home."

      "title": "Avoid physically or verbally punishing your cat.",
      "content": "Avoid physically or verbally punishing your cat. Physically or verbally reprimanding your cat is one of the least successful ways to correct your cat’s bad behavior. In fact, hitting your cat or yelling at them can lead your cat to act more fearful around you, be less willing to play with other people, and display more aggressive scratching and biting. Your cat will likely continue to act out when you are out of sight as they know they can perform the behavior without punishment if you cannot see them. [4] X Research source Physical or verbal punishment is generally ineffective, as short-term solutions to your cat’s issues and will not stop your cat from acting out. Instead, it will create a more stressful environment for you and for your cat. Though it can be hard not to yell or hit your cat when they do something bad, like urine mark your furniture or go to the bathroom on the carpet instead of the litter box, it’s important that you take a deep breath as an owner and try to use a more effective correcting technique."

      "title": "Practice deterrence and positive reinforcement.",
      "content": "Practice deterrence and positive reinforcement. Instead of punishing your cat, rather offer them a more preferable alternative to the object of their bad behaviour: [5] X Research source If your cat scratches your favourite couch or the side of your bed, it is probably because these items smell strongly like their favourite owner, and they are trying to mix their scent with yours. Deter this by placing a scratching post next to the area that they like to scratch. Scratching posts should be placed in 'social' areas in your house, where you spend a lot of your time. If they need some further encouragement, sprinkle some catnip onto the scratching post. Cats need at least one litter box per cat in the household. Litter boxes must be regularly cleaned. Failure to do so will result in cats going to the bathroom outside of the litter box, or fighting with one another due to increased tensions surrounding privacy - in a similar manner to siblings or couples who fight over bathroom time! DO NOT de-claw your cat. This is cruel and unnatural, and it will lead to a lifetime of pain and paw sensitivity for them. Instead, you can put sticky paper, aluminum foil, or heavy plastic carpet runners on areas that you would like your cat to avoid. This may be unsightly, but cats generally dislike walking on any of these textures. DO NOT attempt to deter a cat with smells, such as placing cloth or cotton balls soaked in citronella, perfume, air freshener, citrus, aloe, eucalyptus oil, and oil of wintergreen on objects or surfaces - this is irresponsible and can be extremely toxic to your cat. If you suspect that your cat has ingested or inhaled such substances, take them to the vet immediately. DO NOT attempt to deter a cat with tastes, such as placing certain foods on surfaces that your cat likes to chew on or scratch. These methods - such as bitter apple, citrus products, hot sauces, cayenne pepper, or aloe gel - can be toxic to your cat if they inhale or ingest it. Sound: Using noises that startle your cat can deter them from doing a behavior or going on a surface. However, loud sounds in close proximity, such as blowing a whistle, can damage their ears. Try to use clickers or a hand clap to startle them just as they are about to do something you consider bad behavior, and they will come to associate the behavior with a negative sound."

      "title": "Ignore your cat when they act out during a play session.",
      "content": "Ignore your cat when they act out during a play session. If you notice your cat engaging in rough or aggressive play, you can correct this behavior by withdrawing your attention from them, or giving them a large stuffed toy to take their frustration out on. Sprinkle the toy with some catnip to calm them. [6] X Research source Do this by walking to another room and closing the door. Wait until they calm down before you touch or address them. This will show your cat that their bad behavior is upsetting during playtime, and discourage them from acting out again."

      "title": "Practice good litter box hygiene.",
      "content": "Practice good litter box hygiene. If your cat is avoiding the litter box, it’s important that you practice good litter box hygiene to encourage them to use the litter box . This means scooping and changing the litter every day, thoroughly washing the litter box once a week, and making sure the litter box is appealing to your cat. Most cats do not like litter boxes with hoods or liner, as it can be uncomfortable for them, so avoid using a litter box with a hood or a liner. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Additionally, many cats dislike scented If there are multiple cats in your household, there should be a litter box for each cat, plus an extra litter box. Try to spread out the litter boxes so each cat has enough room and privacy to do their business. Look for a quiet area in the home where your cat can still look around and see if anyone is coming up behind her. Make sure the litter box is big enough for your cat to sit in comfortably and have one to two inches of litter in the box. Cats dislike litter boxes that are too deep with litter."

      "content": "Provide scratching posts and daily play sessions. Most cats act out due to boredom or under stimulation, so it is important that you commit to daily play sessions with your cat. Use a toy, or several toys, when playing with your cat to deter him from playing rough with your hands or arms. Focus his attention on the toys during the play sessions and switch up the toys each week so he does not get bored. [8] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Scratching posts are also good for deterring your cat from scratching furniture or other fabric objects. Place scratching posts in communal areas of your home or your cat’s favorite spots."
