      "content": "There’s evidence to show you can, but more testing is needed to say for sure. Most of the research on apple cider vinegar’s health and weight loss benefits comes from animal studies. These have been promising so far—many show improved metabolism and fat burning—but more testing in humans is needed. So far, human studies haven’t been conducted with large, controlled groups and the positive effects of apple cider vinegar haven’t been shown across diverse groups of people. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Many claim that apple cider vinegar can curb your appetite. When you consume apple cider vinegar before a meal as a drink or incorporate it into your food, like in a salad dressing, you’ll feel fuller and eat fewer calories. However, studies show that the largest reason for a suppressed appetite seems to be that the vinegar drinkers were slightly nauseated (the grosser they found the vinegar drink, the less they tended to eat). [2] X Research source There is some evidence that shows apple cider vinegar slows the rate at which food leaves your stomach—AKA, you’re literally fuller for longer. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Increased fullness after a meal can lead to lower blood sugar and insulin levels, too."

It makes predicting how long it takes for your blood sugar to rise after a meal difficult, meaning you’ll have problems determining when to take your insulin. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Since apple cider vinegar keeps food in your stomach longer, it could make gastroparesis worse if you take it with meals."

      "content": "In a Japanese study, people lost weight after drinking vinegar for 12 weeks. The study tested 144 obese adults who drank either 0, 1, or 2 tablespoons (0, 15, or 30 ml) of vinegar per day without changing their normal diet or activity levels. The group that drank 2 tablespoons lost an average of 3.7 pounds (1.7 kg) each, while the group that drank none actually gained 0.9 pounds (0.4 kgs). [13] X Research source The results indicate that vinegar can help with fat loss and decrease triglycerides (a type of fat) in your blood. Although the results are encouraging, the study did not study apple cider vinegar specifically and more studies are needed to confirm the results. Most diet and exercise programs result in more weight loss over a 12 week period than this apple cider vinegar regimen. [14] X Research source"

[26] X Research source About 5 or 6% of apple cider vinegar is acetic acid (the rest is water and small amounts of other naturally occurring acids). One tablespoon (15ml) of apple cider vinegar is only about 3 calories and has almost no carbs. Undistilled apple cider vinegar contains natural probiotics (to support your gut health and immune system) and antioxidants (to promote healthy cells)."

Any approach to weight loss that doesn’t include reduced calorie intake and increased exercise is not guaranteed to help you lose weight or burn fat.
