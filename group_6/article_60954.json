Unless you are trying to conduct a fire drill, let everyone in the home know that you will be testing the smoke detector so that they will not feel frightened when the detector goes off. [1] X Research source If your smoke detector is hardwired to a monitored security system, be sure to notify the security system's company that you are performing a test before you test the alarm. You don't want the fire department showing up at your door!"

      "content": "Ask someone to stand far away from the alarm. When testing an alarm, it will sound loud to you because you’re standing directly underneath it. However, it’s important to make sure that your detector is loud enough that anyone in your home can hear it, as it needs to be loud enough to wake even the deepest sleeper in the household. Ask someone to stand in the room farthest from the detector or outside the house to make sure it’s audible. [2] X Research source Wear ear protection when you test the smoke alarm. It's very loud, and you will be right next to it when you test it."

      "content": "Hold down the detector’s test button and wait for the alarm to sound. While many smoke detectors are equipped with a light that indicates the unit is receiving power, it’s important to actually test the alarm to make sure it will sound properly. Push and hold the test button on the front of the alarm for a few seconds. If it’s working properly, the alarm will sound, typically as a very loud, ear-splitting siren or repeated beeping. [3] X Research source If the alarm doesn’t sound when you press the test button or makes low, erratic sounds, the detector isn’t receiving power properly. For battery-operated smoke detectors, replace the batteries and try again. If it still doesn’t work, it may be time to replace the detector. If your detector is hardwired and the alarm doesn’t sound properly, call an electrician to check the wiring. If you can’t reach your alarm to push the button on your own, stand on a chair or ladder or use a broom handle to push the button. Some smoke alarms go into a \"programming mode\" if you hold the button for more than a second or two. If that happens, wait a minute for it to return to normal, and then press the test button briefly."

      "content": "Check the smoke sensor using an aerosol spray. In addition to making sure that the unit is receiving power, ensure that the detector’s smoke sensor is working correctly, too. Purchase an smoke detector tester spray and spray it towards the alarm according to the instructions on the can. The alarm should sound after a few seconds. If it doesn’t, the sensor may be worn out, in which case you’ll need to replace your detector immediately. [5] X Research source Purchase these aerosol sprays for a few dollars in a hardware or home improvement store or online. To turn off the alarm after testing, use a small hand-held vacuum to suck the test material away from the detector. Some detectors may also have a “silence” button that you can push to stop the alarm. Avoid waiting for the detector to turn off on its own, as this may drain the battery."

While some people may attempt to test their smoke detector by holding a candle or matches near it, most manufacturers specifically warn against using actual smoke to test smoke alarms. It is not only unnecessary and dangerous, but it can melt or damage the detector and contaminate the sensors, making them less sensitive to actual smoke in the future.. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Test your smoke detector at least once a month. Working smoke detectors are extremely important for keeping your family safe, so it’s important to test them regularly. Some even recommend testing your detectors each week. If you can’t, then be sure to plan a time each month to check each smoke detector. [7] X Research source Checking your alarm regularly means you are more likely to catch a malfunctioning detector quickly; thus, you are more likely to have a properly functioning detector when you need it. To efficiently check all the alarms in your house, set aside 30 minutes to an hour at least once a month to check them all at once rather than at different intervals. Most manufacturers recommend testing the detector every week or two. The push button test is sufficient for this. Use the aerosol test gas once per year to ensure proper airflow into the detector unless otherwise recommended by the manufacturers."

      "title": "Replace your smoke detectors every 10 years.",
      "content": "Replace your smoke detectors every 10 years. Smoke detectors can last about 10 years before they may become unreliable. Over time, the sensors in the detector may wear out or become contaminated by dust and other pollutants. Even if your alarm seems to be functioning properly, replace it after 10 years of use. [8] X Research source If you aren’t sure how old your smoke detector is, you can usually find out by removing the unit from the ceiling and looking on the back. The date of manufacture is typically printed on it. If you can’t find the date on the unit, then replace it to be safe. Some smoke alarms now incorporate automatic warnings when they have reached the end of their useful life—typically chirping, similar to a weak battery warning, but with other indications as well. Replace such units immediately, even if they aren’t yet 10 years old. If your smoke detectors are hardwired, be sure to shut off the electricity in your home before installing a new one, as wires could come loose and create an electrical danger. Alternatively, have a professional electrician install the unit for your own safety. Laws in your jurisdiction probably specify how one must dispose of outdated and unreliable smoke detectors. Check the rules that apply in your area, and dispose of old and unreliable detectors properly."

      "title": "Replace the alarm’s batteries once or twice a year.",
      "content": "Replace the alarm’s batteries once or twice a year. If you have a battery-powered detector, it is a good idea to replace the batteries up to two times per year, even if the detector is functioning properly. Regular battery changes help to ensure that your detector is ready to go if and when you need it. [9] X Research source If you have a battery-operated alarm, test it immediately after installing new batteries to make sure it is functioning. Resist the temptation to take the batteries out of your smoke detector when the batteries in your TV remote run out. People often do this and then forget to replace the detector batteries. Recycle old batteries appropriately . Never dispose of old batteries in the household trash unless they are regular alkaline, manganese, and carbon-zinc batteries, which are not considered \"hazardous waste.\" Decker suggests changing the batteries whenever you change your clocks for daylight savings time: “Typically, the motto is ‘Change your clocks, change your batteries.’ So, whenever there [is] a time change for daylight savings time, you want to change your battery, and that ensures that your smoke detector is going to be working correctly.”"

      "content": "Clean and vacuum your detector at least every 6 months. Follow your smoke detector’s manufacturer's guide to find out how to clean the unit properly. In general, though, remove the face of the detector and use a soft brush vacuum cleaner attachment to gently brush and vacuum the inside of the detector. Wipe down the outside of the unit with a clean cloth or wipe to remove buildup. Make sure to clean the vent openings to make sure airflow isn’t obstructed. [10] X Research source If you have the time, it’s a good idea to clean your smoke detector when you test it each month. If not, once every 6 months should keep it in working order. In the event of a fire, buildup on the detector could cause it to malfunction. Don’t use cleaners on the unit, as these may contaminate the sensors. Vacuuming or wiping away dust should be sufficient."

Make sure to install detectors on every level of your house, including your attic and basement, if you have them. This way, you’ll be more protected no matter where the fire starts. [11] X Research source To install a smoke alarm, screw the mounting base onto the ceiling or wall, place the smoke alarm into position, and twist it in, tightening it with a screwdriver as needed. Remember to put the batteries in! If possible, make sure your smoke detectors are interconnected, meaning if one goes off, they’ll all go off. This step is one of the best ways to alert your family and keep everyone safe, regardless of where they are in the house. Be aware that some smoke alarms are not designed for use at \"low temperatures\" that may be found in an attic. When installing smoke detectors in the basement, place them on the ceiling at the bottom of the stairs."

Your smoke detectors must wake everyone in the house, so place them in every bedroom and sleeping area as well as right outside of each sleeping area. The gases emitted by a fire can cause heavier sleeping, so installing alarms in these areas can save lives. [12] X Research source On levels without bedrooms, install smoke detectors in the living room and near the stairway leading to the upper level. This includes any areas where pets sleep, as well. If you keep animals in a barn or another building outside of your home, make sure the smoke detectors are installed somewhere you can hear them."

Decker says, “It is typical to not place [smoke detectors] where fresh air would prevent smoke from getting to the smoke [sensor] and causing it to trip.” Doors, windows, and ducts may have drafts or air movement, which could prevent the alarm from properly detecting smoke. Smoke detectors should be installed at least 3 ft (0.9 m) away from these areas. [15] X Research source This includes doors to the kitchen or a bathroom with a tub or shower."

Have everyone sit down together with a floor plan of your home and create a fire exit plan that everyone will be able to use in the event of a fire. Make sure that all members of the household have memorized the emergency number for the fire department. [16] X Research source Have at least two working escape routes out of every room. If you have a second floor, consider getting a life safety ladder that can hang from your windows. Include a meeting point outside of the home where everyone will go in the event of a fire. For example, to the neighbor’s driveway. Mark this location on your escape plan. Assign one person who will be responsible for helping anyone who would not be able to get out of the home on their own, like a baby, young toddler, or elderly family member. If you have young children, post the fire exit plan in their room to help them remember what the plan is. Make sure visitors know about your escape plans."

This way, everyone will know what to do in the event of a fire, and it will be less likely that someone will panic and forget the plan. Instruct each member of the household on what to do if they notice a fire, and adjust your plan as needed if it seems like it isn’t efficient. [17] X Research source For example, if someone notices a fire, they should yell or pound on the walls to alert other members of the household. Instruct family members to feel doors before opening them. If the door is hot, they should use an alternative route as specified in the fire exit plan. Explain that if there is heavy smoke, household members should crawl on the floor to avoid the heat and to reduce smoke inhalation."

      "content": "Ensure that doors and windows are not blocked. Inspect each door and window in your home. Are there objects that would make it difficult to get out of these exits in the event of a fire? If a fire happens, it’s important to have as many ways to get out as possible. If there are pieces of furniture or other objects that block doors or windows, move them to a safer location. [18] X Research source For example, don’t allow a tall, heavy dresser to block the window. If a fire happens, you or your loved one may not be strong enough to push it out of the way in time."

      "content": "Conduct an unexpected fire drill. Conduct a fire drill at least twice a year to make sure your family is prepared. Don’t tell anyone that you are setting off the alarm so that it will be treated like the real thing rather than as a drill. This approach allows you to see how everyone would react in the result of a real fire so you can make any needed adjustments to your plan. [19] X Research source Try to do this when everyone is home. Everyone should understand that they are not to try to bring their belongings with them. Once they have exited the home, no one is to re-enter under any circumstances unless officially authorized."

To help prevent this, have a fire extinguisher on hand and make sure everyone in your household knows how to use it properly. Contact your local fire department for tips on fire extinguisher maintenance and use. [20] X Research source When you’re cooking, stay in the kitchen so you can keep an eye on things, and turn off the stove if you need to leave the room for whatever reason, even just for a short period of time. In addition to cooking fires, Decker also says laundry fires are common: “I would say probably most often that is due to lint buildup. Empty [the] lint before each load because the buildup of lint builds up the heat and then the heat makes the lint catch on fire.”"
