These can be found at your local electronics store. Make sure you purchase a Bluetooth dongle that supports Bluetooth 4.0 or higher. Bluetooth 5.0 adapters are more expensive, but they offer greater range and speed. Bluetooth 4.0 adapters are more affordable and will work fine for most applications.
