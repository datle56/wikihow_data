Collect it all in one hand at the nape of your neck and use your other hand to wrap a hair rubber band around it as many times as necessary to keep your hair in a snug ponytail. Elastic rubber bands covered in fabric, with no metal to snag your hair are recommended to keep your hair healthy and avoid breaking, tangling and damaging your hair. [1] X Research source You can also try a silicone spray before brushing your hair hair into a ponytail to allow it to slide more safely through the rubber band. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Braid your ponytail into a three-part braid. Separate the ponytail into three even parts. Cross left over center, then right over center as far down the ponytail as you can until you are running out of hair to work with. At this point, move the ponytail holder down to the bottom of the braid to fasten. [3] X Research source You will need to add several wraps of the ponytail holder to secure this section , which will be thinner than the top of the braid. Keep your braid tight as you go along. If some hair is escaping the braid along the way, remove the braid up to that section to collect the hair back in, then continue down the length of the ponytail."

      "content": "Wrap your braid around itself to create a bun. Starting at the top of the braid, twist and wrap the braid over itself. Continue wrapping along the outside of the last turn as opposed to laying the braid on top of itself to create a nice bun. Push the end of the braid under the bun to hide the rubber band and unbraided tip. Secure this end with a bobby pin by pushing it through the end and into the secured hair along the scalp. The grooved side of the bobby pin should be facing toward your scalp. [4] X Research source Secure loose portions of the bun to your scalp with bobby pins until you get the shape you desire and it feels secure."

      "content": "Decorate your with bun. Use decorative hair accessories, flowers, or even antique hat pins. Push them into your braid in various places to add a little color, sparkle or character. You could also accessorize with headbands and head scarves wrapped around the top of your head or the bun. Try braiding ribbon as you did your braid, then wrapping the ribbon around the bun and tying it into place. This can add color and a little extra security to hold your bun in place, or wrap around any little “fly-aways” which are escaping the braid."

You will want strips about 3 times the length of your hair and 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide. [5] X Research source Curling your hair with a flannel rag instead of heat is a great way to maintain the health of your hair and prevent damage to your long locks. Cut as many strips as you would like to have as curlers in your hair. More curlers will make tighter curls, while using more hair in each curl will make the curls looser."

Hold the top of the section of hair and the rag in one hand like the top of a ponytail with a rag running alongside it. Wrap the hair around the rag until you reach an inch and a half of hair left to twist. [7] X Research source Be sure that you are wrapping the hair around the rag and not taking the rag around the hair. Wrapping the rag around the hair at this point will give you straight hair rather than curls. To get more spiral to your curls, twist the section of hair in one direction as you wrap it around the rag. Once you have completed wrapping the hair around the rag, you should not see the rag under the hair. The wraps of hair should be close enough that the rag is not visible between each wrap."

It is best to begin this entire process at least 24 hours before you want your style to be complete. At the very least, create your curls early in the evening, then sleep on them. Wrapped hair takes a long time to dry. The more hair you used in each section, the longer it will take to dry. If you need to speed up the drying time, you can sit under a bonnet hair dryer for an hour to finish off the process."
