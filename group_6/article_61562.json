[2] X Research source Grab the portafilter with a single or double-cup wall filter basket. Slip the portafilter (located on the right of the grinder) into the grind cradle beneath the hopper and nudge it forward to start grinding. [3] X Research source Fill the hopper as needed; its purpose is to store the fresh coffee beans. Select a wall filter basket based on how much espresso you're brewing—one shot or two. Medium or dark-roast coffee beans will give you a stronger taste and better hold up to cream and sugar than light coffee. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Tap the ground coffee before tamping and trimming. Carefully tap the portafilter against your hand or a flat surface to collapse the small mound of grounded beans. Then, grab your tamping tool (included with your machine) to pack the coffee firmly. Remove excess coffee with the included razor by twisting it in full circle for the perfect dose.

Then, insert and lock the portafilter by twisting it into the group head. Select a single or double shot to get started. Your espresso should have a thick honey consistency when it comes out. [6] X Research source A portafilter is a device with a handle that the machine pumps water into. A portafilter basket holds the coffee grounds and sits inside of it. The group head is on the grinder's right-hand side."

Then, on the right side of the machine, turn the steam dial to the steam icon (it looks like a cloud). Allow it to texturize until the jug is too hot to touch; it should take 5 to 10 seconds. This means the milk is at the right temperature. [7] X Research source Purge the wand by twisting the steam dial on the right side of the machine to remove milk buildup."

This differs from the \"Best Sold By\" date. Coffee beans are best after 5 days of roasting but 30 days at maximum. After 30 days, the coffee loses its flavor. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Adjust the grind size dial to fix the flavor profile. For the perfect cup of espresso, it should take 10 seconds before the coffee starts to flow and another 20 seconds for a shot to brew. If an espresso starts pouring at the 5-second mark, it's flowing too fast. This means it's under-extracted, and the grind size should be finer. However, if it flows too slowly, it's over-extracted, so increase the grind size by using the dial. [10] X Research source"

Fortunately, Breville designs machines like the Breville Barista Express to brew water at the perfect temperature. Water below 198°F (92°C) or above 203°F (95°C) can cause the espresso to taste sharp or bitter. [11] X Research source If your machine isn't getting hot enough, some users recommend pre-warming your espresso mug or running a little water to heat an empty portafilter.
