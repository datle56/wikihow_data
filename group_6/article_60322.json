      "content": "This issue is widely reported in 2016-2018 MacBook Pros. If you have a MacBook Pro 13\" or 15\" model released in 2016-2018, your computer might be one of the ones affected by “Flexgate.” You might notice an intermittent effect that looks like stage footlights at the bottom of your screen and other issues such as flickering or strange colors. Unfortunately, in many cases, your display will eventually stop working altogether. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Some more recent M1 models may also be affected. More recently, users reported having a similar issue with M1 MacBook Pro models released in 2019-2020. The problem seems to be mainly with 13\" MacBooks. It may take 2-3 years of use for the issue to appear."

      "title": "The problem is caused by damage to internal display cables.",
      "content": "The problem is caused by damage to internal display cables. The issue stems from the ultra-thin, flexible ribbon cables that Apple used to attach the Touch Bar to the display in these particular MacBook Pro models. Over time, repeatedly opening and closing the laptop puts strain on the cables, causing them to break. The backlight cable typically wears out first, which is what causes the stage light effect. While Apple claimed to have fixed this design flaw after the 2016-2018 MacBook Pro series was released by making the cable longer, more recent reports suggest it is still a problem with some later models. Since it can take a few years for the problem to show up, it’s unclear how widespread it might be in later MacBooks."

      "content": "The integrated cables mean you must replace the whole display. Unfortunately, fixing the stage light issue isn’t as simple as swapping in a new display cable. Because of how these MacBooks are designed, you’ll need to replace the entire display assembly, which can be quite expensive."

      "title": "Apple’s special repair program has ended.",
      "content": "Apple’s special repair program has ended. For a while, Apple was offering free repairs for certain models of MacBook Pro that were known to be affected by “Flexgate.” This program only applied to the 2016 13\" model. Unfortunately, this service is no longer available, so you’re unlikely to be able to get your display fixed for free. If your MacBook is still covered by AppleCare , AppleCare+, or your warranty, you may still be able to get a free or inexpensive repair."

      "content": "See a third-party technician if you’re out of warranty. If your MacBook is out of warranty or no longer covered by AppleCare, try taking it to an independent repair specialist. If possible, see a certified technician who is part of Apple’s Independent Repair Provider program. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Try one of these temporary fixes.",
      "content": "Try one of these temporary fixes. If you’re unable to get your display replaced (or don’t want to shell out for a whole new laptop), you can try a few alternatives. While these fixes may only be temporary, they could help your MacBook screen last a little longer. Try cleaning the hinge of your MacBook. Several Mac users report that the issue disappeared after they wiped down the hinge between the keyboard and screen with an alcohol wipe or a soft artist’s brush moistened with rubbing alcohol. Avoid opening your laptop too far. In some cases, the lighting effect won’t show up as long as you don’t open your screen past a certain angle (e.g., 90°). Opening it wider puts more strain on the damaged cables. Attach an external monitor to your MacBook. While this option isn’t ideal—especially if you want your Mac to be portable—it’ll work in a pinch. Get an inexpensive monitor and hook it up to your computer if the original display is unusable."
