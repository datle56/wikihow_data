      "content": "Ask them how bipolar disorder affects them. Bipolar disorder can manifest in people in different ways. Knowing how your partner typically experiences their symptoms can help you offer better support. Talk to them about how they usually experience both depression and mania. Say, \"Can you tell me about what you usually experience when you have episodes?\" It's also a good idea to read about bipolar disorder in general. However, keep in mind that your partner may not experience all of the listed symptoms. Similarly, they may have atypical symptoms that aren't listed. Make sure you're able to accept your partner with their condition and the behaviors it brings. For example, a manic person may engage in risky behaviors like promiscuity or substance abuse. Talk to your partner about your concerns before these issues arise."

They're likely experiencing intense thoughts and frustrating mood swings. Be a safe space for them to share these issues. [1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source You can still comment on what they say, but do it without judgment. You might say, “It must be awful to feel that way. I hope you know I think you're an amazing person.” Don't say something like, “Stop talking like that,” or “Don't be crazy.” This is unhelpful and can make the situation worse. Keep in mind that some people with bipolar disorder have trouble with relationships, so your relationship may feel one-sided at times. However, this is not true for everyone with the condition. Get to know your partner's habits. If your relationship starts to feel one-sided, talk to them so you can regain balance."

Keep in mind that your partner might tell themselves that you're only around because you feel obligated or are just that nice. Let them know that you're supporting them because you care about them. [2] X Research source Say, “I know you're going through a tough time right now, and I want you to know I'm here for you. You're so important to me and I will support you however I can.” Don't assume you know what they need or try to \"swoop in\" to help. Let them ask for help when they need it, and remember that you aren't a caregiver."

Other times, you might treat them to a surprise meal or run them a nice bubble bath. By doing nice things, you show your partner that you value them. Even better, you take off some of the pressure that can cause their bipolar disorder to worsen.

Instead, you might go for a long hike in the woods or go swimming in water that isn't crowded.

Because mania often makes people feel on top of the world, it can trigger impulsive behaviors, such as reckless spending, gambling, abusing drugs and alcohol, or increased sexuality. Your partner may not be able to see the consequences of their actions due to their bipolar disorder. If you notice them acting impulsively, offer reasonable alternatives and invite them to join you in a less impulsive activity. [7] X Research source For instance, let's say you and your partner go to the mall, and they start to pick up a lot of items they can't afford. You could say, “Hey, I'm sure this stuff would look great on you, but you already have so many nice outfits. I really think you should take a day to think this purchase over. How about we go get some frozen yogurt and talk it over?” Keep in mind that they may choose to continue with their impulsive behaviors anyway. If this happens, stick to the boundaries you've set with them. If you don't want to be around these behaviors, leave the situation.

As another example, during mania they might get really irritable or excitable. They could yell, “Leave me alone,” when you're just trying to help them stop impulsive behaviors.

Although you might enjoy the role of caregiver, it's harmful for both you and your partner to be in a co-dependent relationship. You deserve a life of your own. Maintain other friendships and take a break when you need it. [27] X Research source For example, keep a regular coffee date with a friend, keep up with your hobbies, or take a class by yourself. Co-dependent relationships occur when a person bases their entire identity around caring for another individual. In turn, the person who is cared for becomes dependent on the caregiver to have their needs met. It's harmful because the caregiver neglects their own life, while the individual being cared for struggles to improve. If you're worried you may be co-dependent, a therapist can help you set better boundaries and improve your relationship. You can work with a therapist on your own or as a couple."
