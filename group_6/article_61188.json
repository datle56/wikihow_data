      "content": "You can stop dry rot with boric acid if you catch it early enough. Boric acid is a powerful fungicide and can eradicate the rot-causing fungi as long as they haven't penetrated more than 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) into the wood. Sprinkle the boric acid over the rotting portion of your wood or timber and leave it there for 2–3 days. [1] X Research source Dry rot typically looks like puffy, white mold growing out of timber or other wooden surfaces. The rot occasionally “blooms” and produces cobweb-like strands that hang from the rotting wood or yellow-colored lumps of fungal growth. In serious cases of dry rot, you may notice that the wood simply crumbles away. [2] X Research source Purchase boric acid at a large hardware store or home-improvement store. Many large grocery stores also stock boric acid. Check in the store's cleaning or household-goods aisle."

      "content": "Use a trim router to remove the damaged wood. If the dry rot extends deeper than 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm), boric acid won't have much of an effect. You'll need to scrape away the rotted wood, which will take the rot-causing fungus with it. [3] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 24 September 2021. Place a bit into the trim router, then plug it in. Hold the router vertically over the timber and turn it on. Move it smoothly back and forth over the rotted area so the router gouges out all of the rotten wood. [4] X Research source You can purchase a trim router at a local hardware store. The tool comes with a variety of bits, so select the one best suited to the timber you're trimming."

      "content": "Epoxy dries solid to strengthen the damaged section. Follow the manufacturer's directions and mix together the various chemical components that form the epoxy. When it's reached a thick, putty-like consistency, smear the epoxy into the gouged-out section of wood with a putty knife. [5] X Research source Let the epoxy dry overnight for at least 6-8 hours. Keep any curious children or wandering animals away from the epoxy as it dries."

      "title": "Use coarse 80-grit sandpaper from a local hardware store.",
      "content": "Use coarse 80-grit sandpaper from a local hardware store. Once the epoxy has set and dried, slide the sandpaper across the dried epoxy several times until you've smoothed the material down to the same level as the surrounding wood. Work in smooth strokes and apply a consistent amount of pressure as you sand the wood. [6] X Research source If the timber or wood is in a part of your home where it'll be seen, you might want to go over the epoxy once more, this time with a 120-grit sandpaper. This will smooth it out further and make it look more finished."

      "content": "Any wooden beams or supports near a leak will be susceptible to dry rot. In most homes, leaks occur near water spigots or behind appliances. If you're aware of a leak in your home, turn off the water to the specific pipe that's leaking. [7] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 24 September 2021. Then contact a plumber to come to your home and fix the leak as soon as possible. [8] X Research source Even if you're not aware of any leaks, it's smart to check through your home on a monthly basis and make sure that pipes tucked away beneath your sink or behind your washing machine aren't leaking."

      "content": "Open the windows and doors in the room with the wet timber to encourage airflow. If you have wet wood in your home, it's crucial that you dry it out as fast as possible to prevent dry rot from infecting the wood. [9] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 24 September 2021.

[10] X Research source Purchase box fans at a hardware store or a home-improvement store near you."

      "content": "In chilly or wet months, moisture can accumulate in rooms that aren't well heated. This leads to dry rot. So, at the beginning of your wet or cold season, check the heater in every room of your house (including the basement!) and make sure it works. If your home is centrally heated, check all of the air vents in your home at least twice per winter to make sure they're blowing out hot air and not obstructed. [11] X Research source If you have electrical heaters in your home and 1 isn't working, contact a local electrician. Ask them to pay a visit to your home and repair the malfunctioning heater."

      "content": "Treating exposed timber with a borate wood preservative will ensure that it's rot-proof. If you're concerned that timber may get infected with dry rot in the future, your best bet is to coat the exposed ends of the wood with a liquid borate preservative. Dip a small 2 in (5.1 cm) paintbrush into the container of liquid borate. Use short, even strokes to paint a thick layer of the borate preservative onto whatever timber you'd like to treat. [12] X Research source Borate—another term used for boric acid—is a powerful fungicide that's sold at most hardware stores."
