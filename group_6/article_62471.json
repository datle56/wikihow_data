      "title": "Clogged airflow",
      "content": "Clogged airflow If you've ever taken a pull from your Elf Bar and seen no vapor despite the tiny bead of light telling you the device is working, it's likely due to airflow blockage. A common issue with vapes is clogging due to debris like dust, lint, or e-liquid. The device can't draw in enough air to produce vapor when airflow passages are blocked. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "E-liquid saturation",
      "content": "E-liquid saturation To receive nicotine, the vape's e-liquid has to saturate the wick inside the atomizer. Inefficient saturation can affect the quality or lack of vapor. Continuous use can lead to a burning taste over time. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "title": "Battery malfunction",
      "content": "Battery malfunction Elf Bars are drawn-activated, meaning each inhale powers the device and triggers the coils to burn. The battery may be drained or low if you last used your vape a while ago or stored in direct sunlight. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Inauthentic device",
      "content": "Inauthentic device Fake Elf Bars are a common problem in the vaping world since they’re cheaper to build. Fraudulent companies don’t adhere to the same safety or quality regulations as legitimate companies. Fortunately, Elf Bars come equipped with an authentication label on the side of the box. These labels feature 5 security features. Scan the QR code on the side of the box to receive a link to Elf Bar's security screen to confirm its authenticity. [4] X Research source The 5 security features include anti-stripping, anti-counterfeiting patterns, fluorescent ink, holographic laser security thread, and micro text. You can also manually insert the 18-digit security code beneath the QR code if your phone's scanner is not working."

      "title": "Charge your Elf Bar with a USB-C cable.",
      "content": "Charge your Elf Bar with a USB-C cable. It may seem obvious, but check that your device is charged. Most Elf Bars don't come with a charging cable included. However, many of today's electronics use Type C cables, so borrow one from another device. Plug the Type C side into the bottom of your vape and the USB end into an AC adapter. [5] X Research source If you suspect an issue with charging, try a different power source or use another USB cable. An Elf Bar typically takes an hour to charge fully. The LED light on the device will disappear. Rechargeable disposables: BC1600, BC3000/3500/4000/5000, BC5000 Ultra, BB3000/3500, LB5000, CR5000, 4600/5000, TE5000.

      "content": "Clean the airflow vents with a toothpick. If you're an avid vaper, your vape probably goes with you everywhere. It gets tossed in your pocket, a tote bag, and lost in your sheets. It's easy for the small airflow vents to get filled with dirt, crumbs, and lint. Take a toothpick, Q-tip, or a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol to free any debris or e-liquid build-up.

      "content": "Shake or hit the device against a flat surface. Back in the day, when a TV started to act funny or a Nintendo 64 game cartridge wouldn't work, you'd smack the device. For some vape users, hitting or shaking their vape against the palm of their hand or the leg works! This may knock internal connections in place."

      "title": "Add more e-liquid, if possible.",
      "content": "Add more e-liquid, if possible. Although many Elf Bars are disposable, you can add more e-liquid. Push the mouthpiece side to side with your fingers until it pops off. Inside, you'll see a battery and a cotton pad. Gently soak the cotton pad with e-liquid until it's fully saturated. [9] X Research source Pop the mouthpiece back on top when satisfied. Use a flat-head screwdriver to get a better grip."

      "title": "Use high puff count vapes.",
      "content": "Use high puff count vapes. If you're a heavy vaper, there may be better choices than opting for an Elf Bar 600 since it only has a puff count of 600. A vape's lifespan is measured in puffs, meaning the amount of inhalations you can take before it's \"out.\" Generally, these measurements are approximate and can vary depending on how you smoke.
