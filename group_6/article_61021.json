      "title": "Add 2 tablespoons (16 grams) of icing sugar to the frosting.",
      "content": "Add 2 tablespoons (16 grams) of icing sugar to the frosting. Measure the icing sugar into the bowl of frosting. Don’t worry about packing the icing sugar into the spoon. - Just add 2 loosely packed tablespoons (16 grams). In some countries, icing sugar is called powdered sugar or confectioners sugar. This method will make the cream cheese frosting sweeter as it is adding extra sugar to the mixture."

    {
      "title": "Mix the icing sugar into the frosting.",
      "content": "Mix the icing sugar into the frosting. Use a spoon to combine the icing sugar and the cream cheese frosting. Stop mixing the frosting as soon as the ingredients are mixed, as over-mixing can cause the frosting to become runny and less sticky. If you do over-mix the frosting, place it into the fridge for 1 hour to harden."

      "title": "Add an additional 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (16 grams) of icing sugar, if necessary.",
      "content": "Add an additional 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (16 grams) of icing sugar, if necessary. If the frosting is still not thick enough, mix in an extra 2 tablespoons (16 grams) of icing sugar. Continue to add portions of icing sugar to the frosting until it reaches your desired thickness. It is best to add small amounts of icing sugar at a time, as this stops the frosting from accidentally getting too thick."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store the frosting in the fridge for up to 5 days.",
      "content": "Store the frosting in the fridge for up to 5 days. Transfer the frosting into an airtight container to stop it from absorbing the other smells in the fridge. If you don’t have an airtight container, use a sealable bag instead. Write the date on the container to help yourself remember how long it has been in the fridge for. If you want to use the frosting at a later date, place the airtight container into the freezer for up to 3 months."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add 1 tbsp (25 g) of cornstarch if you don’t want to sweeten the frosting.",
      "content": "Add 1 tbsp (25 g) of cornstarch if you don’t want to sweeten the frosting. One of the great things about cream cheese frosting is that it isn’t as sweet as other types of frosting. Cornstarch is a good way to thicken the frosting without increasing its sweetness. Mix 1 tablespoon (25 grams) of cornstarch into the frosting. If it is still too runny, add a little more. Continue to add cornstarch until you are happy with the texture. [1] X Research source Avoid adding more than 1/2 cup (62.5 grams) of cornstarch per 8 oz (226 grams) of cream cheese. Adding more cornstarch than this can impact the taste of the frosting. In some countries, cornstarch is called corn flour."

      "title": "Refrigerate the frosting for 1 hour to thicken it without adding extra ingredients.",
      "content": "Refrigerate the frosting for 1 hour to thicken it without adding extra ingredients. Cream cheese will vary in thickness depending on the temperature. Transfer the frosting into an airtight container to stop it from soaking up other smells, and then place it into the fridge. The cool air will harden the fats in the cream cheese and butter, and make the icing thicker. [2] X Research source If the cream cheese is still too soft after 1 hour, leave it in the fridge for a further 30 minutes. If the cream cheese frosting gets too hard, simply leave it at room temperature to soften."

      "title": "Add a small amount of meringue powder to quickly thicken the frosting.",
      "content": "Add a small amount of meringue powder to quickly thicken the frosting. Add 1 tablespoon (7 grams) of meringue powder to the frosting per 8 oz (226 grams) of cream cheese. Mix the meringue powder into the frosting until it is evenly dispersed. If the frosting is still not thick enough, add an extra 1 teaspoon (2.3 grams) of meringue powder. [3] X Research source Purchase meringue powder from a speciality cooking or baking store. This option is really effective if you want to pipe the frosting onto a cake as it helps the mixture to hold its shape."

      "title": "Mix 1 tbsp (14.2 g) of soft butter into the frosting to make it creamier.",
      "content": "Mix 1 tbsp (14.2 g) of soft butter into the frosting to make it creamier. The fats in the butter will help to thicken the cream cheese frosting and will add a rich and creamy taste. Mix the frosting with a spoon until the butter is completely dispersed in the mixture. [4] X Research source Continue to add soft butter to the frosting until you are satisfied with its taste and consistency. If your butter is hard, simply leave it at room temperature for 1 hour to soften."

      "title": "Add 2 tsp (5.2 g) of arrowroot powder if you want a flavorless thickener.",
      "content": "Add 2 tsp (5.2 g) of arrowroot powder if you want a flavorless thickener. Arrowroot is similar to cornstarch but it has very little flavor, which makes it perfect for adding to frosting. Measure the arrowroot powder into the frosting and then mix it with a spoon until the mixture is thoroughly combined. [5] X Research source If the mixture is still too runny, add another 2 teaspoons (5.2 grams) of arrowroot powder."
