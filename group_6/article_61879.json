When you request to download a ZIP file of your \"Followers and following\" data from Instagram, you'll be able to see everyone you've requested to follow who hasn't yet accepted your request. You'll also see a general list of everyone you've asked to follow recently. Requesting a download has been the only way to view a list of people you've requested to follow on Instagram for a while, but the process has recently changed. We've detailed the updated step-by-step process below. Depending on how much data you request, it can take anywhere from several minutes to 30 days to receive your files. You can speed up the process by only downloading information about the people you requested to follow instead of all your Instagram data.
