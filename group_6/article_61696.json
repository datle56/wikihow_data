      "content": "Candy XL is used like regular Candy. The difference is that you start using Candy XL after you hit level 40 , which is the former level cap. In June 2022, Pokémon GO's level cap was raised to 50, and after level 40 you must start using Candy XL to power up your Pokémon. Just like regular Candy, Candy XL is tied to your Pokémon's evolution chain, so a Charizard will use Charmander Candy XL."
