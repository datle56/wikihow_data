      "content": "Happiness and positivity Sunflowers famously track the sun as it moves across the sky (in other words, they’re heliotropic ) which many interpret as seeking light, joy, and positivity.

      "title": "Fertility and abundance",
      "content": "Fertility and abundance At their best, sunflowers tend to tower above other plants, growing taller than even a human person. They take all the sun, soil, and rain given to them and turn it into an overflowing bounty, with hundreds of seeds per flower. That’s why sunflowers are often symbols of fertility, harvest, and abundance. Similarly, sunflowers can be a symbol for femininity and nurturing, just like how the sun nurtures these gorgeous flowers."

      "title": "Strength",
      "content": "Strength It takes a lot of strength to hold up the tall stalks and heavy “heads” of a sunflower, but sunflowers manage it every day. Many people admire this quality, and choose to get a sunflower tattoo to remind themselves to stand tall in the face of difficulty, and to know that those who persevere will be rewarded. Aztecs regarded the sunflower as a gift to Huitzilopochtli, the god of sacrifice and war. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix and match colors to get an unexpected sunflower remix. We all know sunflowers are yellow, but your tattoo doesn’t have to be! Have fun with the colors of your sunflower. Maybe yours is red to symbolize joyful passion, or purple to symbolize regality and refinement. Or, a rainbow sunflower can remind you that even after the rain, the sun comes to nourish the plants and put on a show. Remember that yellow, and other lighter colors, tend to fade faster than others when tattooed on your skin. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a wilted sunflower to subvert expectations. We usually expect to see strong, straight, and vibrant sunflowers, so opting instead for a wilted or discolored sunflower can send a compelling and unexpected message.

      "title": "Add words to make a statement.",
      "content": "Add words to make a statement. If you want a more customized tattoo, consider adding text! Whether it’s cursive, typewriter text, or another font, a simple message like, “Seek the sun” or, “Always in bloom” can add that much more meaning to your ink. Think of a quote or saying that speaks to you, and request it alongside your sunflower. You might also add, “Standing tall,” “Sunchild,” or even the name or initials of someone close to you."

      "title": "Pick an art style that speaks to your aesthetic.",
      "content": "Pick an art style that speaks to your aesthetic. Choosing a tattoo style can influence both your sunflower’s look and its meaning. For example, an American Traditional tattoo features bold lines and bold colors, and lends a classic feel to your sunflower. A watercolor tattoo, though, is much looser and can feel more organic and free-flowing. [8] X Research source A realistic sunflower tattoo can capture the flower’s beauty as it might look in real life. A new-school sunflower can have fun with cartoony influences and give your tattoo more character. A black-and-white sunflower can add a more somber or understated feel to an otherwise vibrant plant. A pointillistic sunflower adds loads of visual intricacy and appeal."

      "content": "Choose your sunflower’s placement to enhance its meaning. Where you place your tattoo on your body can also alter its meaning and significance. For example, a sunflower over your chest can signify keeping happiness and warmth in your heart, while a sunflower on your hand might symbolize spreading positivity. A sunflower behind your ear can be a secret reminder to look for the good in everything. A full or half sleeve of sunflowers can imitate a garden, symbolizing growth and abundance. A sunflower on your legs or feet can symbolize staying rooted to the earth and growing strong."
