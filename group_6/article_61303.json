Place a check mark next to \"Block all incoming connections\" to block all connections except those that are mandatory for your computer to operate properly. The connections your computer will still run are crucial to network configuration services. This setting will block and prevent all sharing functions, such as screen sharing and file sharing, which are features built into your Mac's \"Sharing System Preferences\" pane. Place a check mark next to \"Automatically allow signed software to receive incoming connections\" if you want to give applications with valid certificates full access to your network at all times. This will eliminate any prompts you receive from these applications requesting permission or authorization. Place a check mark next to \"Enable stealth mode\" to have your computer ignore requests from unauthorized software that try to probe or discover your computer. Press the \"plus\" or \"minus\" buttons to add or remove specific applications to or from the firewall."
