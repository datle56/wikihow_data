      "content": "Introduce yourself and tell why you took the trip. Share if your trip was business or pleasure and whether or not you took your family.

    {
      "title": "Tell what room type you stayed in.",
      "content": "Tell what room type you stayed in. This might be particularly helpful as readers are selecting which reviews to continue reading."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be concise and descriptive with your review, and use proper spelling and grammar.",
      "content": "Be concise and descriptive with your review, and use proper spelling and grammar. Give advice to the travelers such as providing details that you wish you would have known before you went on the trip. Give information about the property that can't be found on the website. Tell if there are a restaurant or two right next door, so meals were relatively inexpensive, or share that it was in a secluded location and you could only eat at the expensive hotel restaurant."

    {
      "title": "Provide information specific to your trip, such as if you had a nice concierge or if the maid created animals out of the towels each day.",
      "content": "Provide information specific to your trip, such as if you had a nice concierge or if the maid created animals out of the towels each day. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Include photographs if the site allows it.",
      "content": "Include photographs if the site allows it. The old adage is true that a picture can be worth a thousand words, especially if it shows unsavory conditions that no hotel guest should be subject to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include information about the location that you stayed in.",
      "content": "Include information about the location that you stayed in. List major attractions that it was by, be honest about how far it really was from the beach, or tell if you had to pay an arm and a leg in cab fare to get to the hotel from the airport."
    },
    {
      "title": "Share about the amenities.",
      "content": "Share about the amenities. Tell if the pool was really as big as it appeared in the photographs, write about if the bed was comfortable or if you felt like you were sleeping on thin mattresses, or mention the quality of the television set and the cable options available."
    },
    {
      "title": "Discuss the services offered by the property.",
      "content": "Discuss the services offered by the property. Write about how courteous or rude the staff was, whether the staff was timely in handling requests, and definitely comment about how clean the maids got the room."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on the big picture.",
      "content": "Focus on the big picture. A small error such as forgetting to bring new shampoo and conditioner can be forgivable if your overall experience was wonderful. Write to the overall stay, and don't get hung up on minor, irrelevant details."
