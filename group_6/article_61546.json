Hit the “Limit to Key” box to set the autotune to limit the pitch adjustment to the key that you selected previously.

Play around with the slider tool and try different levels until the track sounds the way you want. [3] X Research source The pitch correction will raise low-pitched portions of the track while maintaining a realistic and natural sounding voice for higher-pitched sections. A strong original recording will make autotuning the track easier."

This sound is popular in hip-hop and can be used to completely transform a vocal track. Hit the play button to listen to the track with the pitch correction turned all the way up. [4] X Research source You can adjust the pitch correction slider as high or low as you want."
