      "title": "Most Aquarius women appreciate direct communication.",
      "content": "Most Aquarius women appreciate direct communication. If you messed up and you really aren’t sure how to fix it, reach out and simply ask her. Make sure you’ve already apologized, though, or she might not take your question super well. You could say something like: [1] X Research source “I know I messed up, and I’m sorry. Is there anything I can do to fix this?” “I really love you, and I don’t want to lose you. Can you tell me what I can do to make things right?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to her honestly about what you want.",
      "content": "Talk to her honestly about what you want. Aquarius women love it when they can talk openly and freely with someone, and they’ll appreciate it when you do the same. Don’t hold anything back, and try to let her in emotionally as much as you can. It will bring you two closer and hopefully rekindle your relationship. [2] X Research source Say something like, “You’re the best woman I’ve ever known. I got scared of our relationship, which is why I pushed you away, but I don’t want to do that anymore.” Or, “I realized I wasn’t prioritizing time with you, and that’s not okay. I shouldn’t expect you to rearrange your schedule just to hang out with me.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Aquarius women appreciate commitment.",
      "content": "Aquarius women appreciate commitment. If you really want to make your relationship work, let her know that she’s the only woman for you. Tell her that there’s no one else like her, and really assure her that she comes first for you. If you can do that, you’ll be much more likely to reconcile with her. [3] X Research source This is especially important if you did something to lose her trust, like talk to other women behind her back. Since commitment is so important to Aquarius women, it can be tough to come back from a betrayal like that. Say something like, “You’re the only woman for me, and I know that now. There’s no one else I’d rather be with.”"

    {
      "title": "She might need some time to work through her emotions.",
      "content": "She might need some time to work through her emotions. Aquarius women value their alone time, and they usually don’t appreciate being bombarded with phone calls or texts. If you can’t get ahold of her right away, that’s okay—she might just be taking some time for herself. [4] X Research source You can still reach out once or twice, but try not to overwhelm her with messages or voicemails. That will only push her away more."

      "title": "Of all the signs, Aquarians value friendship the most.",
      "content": "Of all the signs, Aquarians value friendship the most. Don’t focus too much on getting back into a relationship with her—instead, treat her like you’d treat a really good friend. If you can show her that you’re a stand up person even when you two aren’t necessarily together, she’ll be much more likely to take you back in the future. [5] X Research source You might ask her how work is going, listen to her problems, offer to help out with errands, or simply do fun activities together. It also helps if you two have mutual friends. That way, you can hang out platonically in a group so she can see just how good of a friend you are."

      "title": "Make an effort to change, and show off those changes.",
      "content": "Make an effort to change, and show off those changes. Once you’ve realized what you did wrong, do a few solid, concrete things to work on improving yourself. Don’t be super obvious about telling her, but let her know about all the stuff you’re doing to better yourself as a human being. She’ll probably appreciate that you’re making an effort, although it’s not a guarantee that she’ll take you back afterward. [6] X Research source For instance, if you had trouble opening up to her, you might go to therapy to learn how you can be more emotionally connected to other people. If you didn’t have a ton of time for her, you might improve your work-life balance so you have a lot more free time throughout the week."

    {
      "title": "Show her that you love her by doing things for her.",
      "content": "Show her that you love her by doing things for her. Doing an act of service means doing things for her, like cooking her a meal, filling up her car with gas, or even watering her plants. Aquarians are especially drawn to people who will sacrifice time for them, so try to volunteer with her or attend a protest with her for a cause she cares about. Try to find little ways you can help her out in her daily life to show her that you really care about her. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "A lot of Aquarius women get tired of the same old routine.",
      "content": "A lot of Aquarius women get tired of the same old routine. If you had been together for a while and things were getting a little stale, work on doing something crazy or out of the box. Plan a surprise road trip, book a tropical vacation, or play hooky from work to hang out together. The more you can mix up your routine, the better. [8] X Research source A lot of Aquarius people really love to travel. If you can afford it, try flying off to a new country or exploring a place you two have never been before."

      "title": "She’ll appreciate your intellect more than anything.",
      "content": "She’ll appreciate your intellect more than anything. Aquarius women really value intelligence, even in a romantic relationship. If you’re trying to win her back, don’t forget about showing off your knowledge and wisdom. Tell her about something you’ve been doing at work, send her cool news articles you think she might like, and try to have deep, thoughtful discussions with her. [9] X Research source For some Aquarius women, showing off your intelligence can be a form of flirting."

      "title": "Aquarius women are very intuitive.",
      "content": "Aquarius women are very intuitive. One of the markers of an Aquarius woman is their ability to sniff out deception. As you try to win her back, always tell the truth, and don’t try to win her over with lies. She’ll be much more angry if you’re trying to deceive her than if you just be honest with her. [10] X Research source It’s important to be as honest as you can about your relationship, too. If you try to lie to her about how important she is to you, she may be able to sense it."
