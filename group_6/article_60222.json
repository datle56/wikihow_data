After unplugging the TV from power, press the Power button on the TV and wait about 2 minutes. Pressing the button without the TV connected to power drains it of any residual electricity. After the 2 minutes, plug it back in and wait about 10-20 seconds until pressing the Power button again to turn it on. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "The outlet might not be getting power. You can plug the TV into another outlet to see if it turns on, or you can plug something you know works (like a lamp) into the current outlet to see if it's getting power. Some homes are built so a light switch controls the power in an outlet. You might have found a wall switch that seems to control nothing, but it actually turns the outlet on and off! In that case, make sure the switch is flipped \"On\" so you can use your TV. Also, try plugging the TV directly into the wall outlet to rule out problems with the adapter or surge protector."

      "content": "An incorrect input source can make it look like the TV isn't turning on. If you're watching with a streaming device or set-top box, you'll need to select the input source that corresponds to the port it's plugged into. If the wrong source is selected, you'll see a black screen even if you try to use that device's remote or a controller to change the channel or navigate through menus. Press the \"Input\" button on your Sony TV remote, which is usually in the top left corner, opposite the \"Power\" button. Continue pressing until you've found the source of the connected device."

      "content": "Reset any settings that might be preventing it from turning on. If your Sony TV still won't turn on, use the buttons (not the remote) to force it to factory reset, even if it's off. The steps differ depending on how many buttons your TV has: One button: Unplug the TV, press and hold the Power button, and plug the TV back in. Continue holding the Power button on the TV as a white LED light turns on, then release the Power button. The TV will factory reset and restart twice. Three buttons: Unplug the TV, press and hold the Power button, and plug the TV back in. Continue holding the Power button on the TV as a green LED light turns on, then release the Power button. The TV will factory reset and restart twice. More than three buttons: Unplug the TV from power, then press and hold both the \"Power\" and \"Volume Down\" buttons at the same time while you plug the TV back into the wall socket. Wait 10-30 seconds for a green LED light, then let go of the buttons. Next, use your remote to navigate to Home > Settings > Storage & reset > Factory data reset > Erase everything > Yes .
