      "title": "Innovative",
      "content": "Innovative If you were born with Uranus in Scorpio, you're likely the one who's always thinking outside of the box and looking for new and different ways of doing things. If something doesn't work for you (including your own personality traits), you're more than willing to throw it out and start fresh with something else. In your mind, there's nothing that can't be improved—and you're just the one to improve it. If you're a particularly outgoing person, you might find yourself not only coming up with innovative ideas but leading the charge to spark social change (or maybe even a revolution). Scorpio has a reputation for being a very sexual sign, so it should come as no surprise that people born with Uranus in Scorpio tend to be particularly innovative when it comes to sexuality and relationship power dynamics. They often focus on releasing themselves from sexual inhibitions and breaking taboos. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Intuitive",
      "content": "Intuitive Like other water signs, Scorpio has a strong sense of intuition.

      "title": "Independent",
      "content": "Independent Folks born with Uranus in Scorpio hunger for freedom—real freedom, an existence unbound by society's restrictions and the limitations of polite society. They certainly play along with society's rules when it suits them, but they also aren't afraid to go against the grain and stir things up a little if they think that's what's necessary to achieve what they've set out to do. This drive for freedom and independence affects these natives' personal lives as well. They might prefer looser, more casual relationships to a single life partner. Although, if they do choose to tie the knot, you can definitely count on them to be loyal—it's just not a decision they're going to take lightly or rush into."

      "title": "Potency and determination",
      "content": "Potency and determination Because Uranus is exalted in Scorpio, people born with this placement in their charts are strong forces for change. Not only do they have the ideas to change the world for the better, but they also have the willpower to put their changes into place. Once they've set their minds to something, these natives won't rest until they've accomplished exactly what they set out to do. [4] X Research source This determination also means that these natives aren't afraid of a little competition and typically won't back down from a fight.

      "title": "Volatility and jealousy",
      "content": "Volatility and jealousy People born with Uranus in Scorpio have intense emotions that can also turn on a dime. Because they have so much broiling underneath the surface, their emotional outbursts can seem to come from nowhere. Often, deep-seated feelings of jealousy are to blame for their outbursts. While Scorpio is a sign typically associated with jealousy and possessiveness, when you throw Uranus into the mix, you get a person who's much more likely to act on those emotions. At the same time, people born with Uranus in Scorpio tend to be pretty self-aware and they often try to keep this dark side hidden. Since they're pretty empathetic, they worry that they could hurt someone."
