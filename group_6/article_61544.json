      "content": "Use a cable to connect your record player to the computer with Audacity installed on it. In order to record from vinyl, you'll need to make sure you have accurately connected your record player as an incoming audio stream into the microphone jack of your computer. Use hardware adapters to secure your cable connection. Many older record players utilize a 1/4-sized input jack. The modern laptop computer, as well as many desktop models, use a smaller, 1/8-sized input jack. You can buy simple adapters at your local electronics store to fix this problem. Make sure that your cables and adapters support stereo."
