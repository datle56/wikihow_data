      "title": "Complete the Lightfall campaign and final mission.",
      "content": "Complete the Lightfall campaign and final mission. The key to unlocking the Strand subclass is owning (and completing) the Lightfall campaign. Once you own Lightfall, you’ll be prompted to start it the next time you open Destiny 2 and get its initial quest, “First Contact.” Proceed to finish the campaign by completing every quest through the finale—which is called “Desperate Measures.” [1] X Research source After you finish “Desperate Measures,” you’re free to unlock and use the Strand subclass anytime, although there are still a couple of things you’ll need to do to get it. Spoiler: “Desperate Measures” concludes after you kill Calus the Disciple, the final boss enemy of the main Lightfall campaign."

      "title": "Talk to both Zavala and Ikora at the Tower.",
      "content": "Talk to both Zavala and Ikora at the Tower. Zavala is the Awoken Vanguard of the Titan class and Vanguard Commander of the Last City. [2] X Research source Meanwhile, Ikora is the human Vanguard of the Warlock class and the overseer of the Hidden (a network of Guardians whose mission is to gather intelligence in secret). [3] X Research source To unlock the Strand subclass, you’ll need to find and talk to both at the Tower after completing Lightfall. Zavala is in the Courtyard of the Tower, standing on a balcony overlooking the city. Zavala is also a vendor for the Vanguard and sells useful gear. You can get upgrade modules from him and complete playlist activities, which earn legendary shards and other equipment. Ikora is at the Bazaar; you can reach her by spawning in the Courtyard and heading past Banshee-44."

      "title": "Meditate at the Pouka pond in the Hall of Heroes.",
      "content": "Meditate at the Pouka pond in the Hall of Heroes. The Hall of Heroes is a hub for Guardians during the Lightfall campaign, located within Neomuna—so by the time you’re ready to unlock the Strand subclass, you’ll already have discovered the Hall of Heroes location. Once you arrive, head to the Pouka pond area and meditate; this will definitively unlock Strand for your Guardian! [4] X Research source If needed, you can always summon a vehicle to help you reach your destination!"

      "title": "The Strand subclass lets you manipulate darkness and psychic energy.",
      "content": "The Strand subclass lets you manipulate darkness and psychic energy. In Destiny 2, Strand is the elemental manifestation of darkness—thus, taking the Strand subclass gives you control over Strand and the Weave, a matrix of psychic energy that connects all things. With the subclass, you have the ability to Weave objects (create objects using Strand), give yourself buffs (strengthen yourself), and debuff enemies (weaken them). [5] X Research source Buffs: Woven Mail. This buff ability creates a protective armor made from Strand, which reduces the amount of damage you take. Debuffs: Suspend. The Suspend ability lifts enemies off the ground and incapacitates them for a short time. In PvP (Player versus Player mode), you can lift rivals but not incapacitate them. Unravel. Attacking an enemy currently affected by Strand causes them to unravel, transforming them into a Tangle—a swirl of Strand fibers that attacks other enemies and unravels them as well. Sever. Severing an enemy makes them less capable of affecting the material world, thus reducing their damage output."

    {
      "title": "Using Strand also gives you the ability to Grapple.",
      "content": "Using Strand also gives you the ability to Grapple. Grapple is technically a “grenade,” but as an ability available to all players regardless of class, it’s also a core Strand mechanic. When you hit the grenade button, Grapple weaves a hook that you can use to either grab an anchor point or execute melee attacks. This is useful both in combat and while exploring! You can use Grapple to solve puzzles, swing through dangerous areas, and maneuver around battlefields. [6] X Research source The Grapple ability is super versatile and can come in handy just about anytime, whether you're raiding dungeons for loot like the Artifice Armor set or completing playlist activities to rank up with vendors."

      "title": "Broodweaver (Warlock)",
      "content": "Broodweaver (Warlock) Destiny 2 features 3 main classes: Warlock, Titan, and Hunter. Strand is a subclass available to all of them, but you’ll get different abilities depending on your main class. If you’re a warlock, your Strand subclass is “Broodweaver,” and your character will specialize in manipulating Strand to create Threadlings, which are explosive creatures woven from threads of Strand. [7] X Research source The Broodweaver’s abilities include: Arcane Needle. This projectile can track targets, causing lots of damage and unraveling enemies. It can be chained up to 3 times in a row. Weaver’s Call. The ability creates 3 Threadling eggs that hatch when they hit a surface. Perched Threadlings also get converted to eggs. Mindspun Invocation. When you make a melee grapple attack, this ability weaves 3 Threadling eggs from your target. Threadling grenade. This grenade splits into 3 projectiles when thrown, and all become Threadlings upon impact. Shackle grenade. This grenade acts as a bola that can entangle your enemy, detonating in a suspending blast and sending out smaller secondary bolas to suspend nearby enemies. Needlestorm (Super Ability). This creates spikes from woven Strand, which stick into enemies or objects in the environment and detonate. After that, they transform into a cloud of Threadlings."

    {
      "title": "Berserker (Titan)",
      "content": "Berserker (Titan) The Titan Strand subclass, Berserker, allows you to manifest huge, dual-wielding claw weapons (or arm blades) woven from Strand and attack enemies with it. You can also sever your enemies’ connection to the Weave with your new subclass weapons, making you formidable in melee combat. [8] X Research source The Berserker’s abilities include: Frenzied Blade. This ability lets you run forward, slashing enemies with your arm blades and decreasing their damage output. It can be chained 3 times. Into the Fray. When you destroy a Tangle, it weaves Woven Mail onto you and nearby allies, giving you damage reduction and increasing your melee energy regeneration. Drengr’s Lash. This ability creates a shockwave that ripples through reality, suspending enemies in its path. Bladefury (Super Ability). Use your arm blades in a light and heavy attack; the light attack is a supercharged version of Frenzied Blade, allowing you to increase the speed of each subsequent light attack, while the heavy attack lets you hurl seeking projectiles that suspend and damage enemies."

    {
      "title": "Threadrunner (Hunter)",
      "content": "Threadrunner (Hunter) The Hunter Strand subclass, Threadrunner, is focused on extending your mobility and improving your Grapple ability (which is universal for all classes but was originally a Hunter specialty). As a Threadrunner, you can also use your rope weapon to ensure you’re always in an optimal position during battles. [9] X Research source Threadrunner abilities include: Threaded Spike. This lets you summon a rope dart that bounces between enemies before returning to you. When it returns, it grants melee energy for each enemy—and bonus energy if you catch the rope with perfect timing. Ensnaring Slam. Press the air-move input while midair to slam downward and suspend all enemies around you. Widow’s Silk. This ability grants an additional grenade charge, giving your Grapple ability a persistent grapple Tangle when it latches onto something—and also fully refunds your grenade energy. You can also use this to set up chains of grapple points that the entire team can use. Silkstrike (Super Ability). This ability lets you use Grapple to move freely in third-person view—and, while grappling, throw out your rope to strike enemies below you. It features both a light and heavy attack; the light attack deals damage to single enemies, while the heavy lets you swing your rope in a 360-degree arc, damaging all enemies around you."

      "title": "The Strand subclass features 4 fragments available for use.",
      "content": "The Strand subclass features 4 fragments available for use. In Destiny 2, fragments are a type of ability modifier that lets players further customize their play style and make their Guardian builds even more effective. [10] X Research source There are many fragments you can optionally use throughout the game, but the Strand subclass specifically introduces 4 new fragments: Thread of Ascent. When you have this fragment, activating a grenade ability reloads your equipped weapon, granting increased weapon handling and airborne effectiveness for a short time. Thread of Fury. This fragment grants melee energy when you damage targets with a Tangle. Thread of Finality. Your finishers generate Threadlings when you have this fragment. Thread of Warding. With this fragment, picking up an orb of power grants Woven Mail."
