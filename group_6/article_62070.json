[1] X Expert Source Christin Birckhead Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 14 April 2020. If you have warm undertones, use a green shade with a bit of yellow in it.

      "content": "Create contrast with your eye makeup to make any eye color pop. In general, if your irises are on the lighter size (hazel, amber, pale green, or light blue), pick a dark green eyeshadow to create a beautiful contrast. If your irises are dark, experiment with paler or brighter shades of green. [4] X Research source A few other tips for you: If you have brown eyes, try a blue-green eyeshadow shade to bring out the warm, amber tones in your irises. If you have light green eyes, try a darker olive-colored eyeshadow. For dark green eyes, pick a brighter jade eyeshadow to create contrast. For hazel eyes, go with a warm, light green shade, like chartreuse, to accentuate the green tones in your irises. If you have dark blue eyes, try a deep hunter-green eyeshadow. For lighter blue eyes, go with a mossy green eyeshadow to bring out the green flecks in your irises."
