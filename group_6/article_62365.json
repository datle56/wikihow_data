[5] X Research source Despite these differences, reflective Virgos and spiritual Scorpios understand each other at a soul level. [6] X Research source According to psychic astrologer Stina Garbis, “Virgos have a natural pull towards secretive Scorpio. They like to unravel mysteries and have a few of their own. Being mysterious and not completely upfront about everything gives them a chance to become interested and want to know more.” Reader Poll: We asked 709 wikiHow readers who are Scorpios what type of relationship they look for, and 65% of them said they look for something committed, serious, and long-term. [Take Poll] Virgos also tend toward serious relationships, so this is a major compatibility between them."

      "title": "Virgo & Virgo",
      "content": "Virgo & Virgo A Virgo can be compatible with another Virgo since they enjoy deep conversations and understand each other’s need for structure and routine. However, a Virgo-Virgo relationship can quickly become tense or boring. They may enable each other’s homebody tendencies or clash over their mutual refusal to surrender their personal organization systems. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Virgo & Aries",
      "content": "Virgo & Aries Virgos don’t have much in common with the impulsive Aries. Aries tend to leave things unfinished or follow their current passions rather than follow through on a plan. [8] X Research source However, Virgos may appreciate Aries’ organizational skills and be drawn in by their captivating way of thinking. [9] X Research source Virgo and Aries do well together when they have a common mission or cause that they’re both passionate about."

      "title": "Virgo & Gemini",
      "content": "Virgo & Gemini Geminis are somewhat compatible with Virgos because they are “both ruled by Mercury…so they’ll have a lot to talk about,” as life coach Kari Samuels explains. “They have the same love language and love to talk about what’s on their mind.” However, a Virgo needs more reliability than the unstructured Gemini may provide. Likewise, a Gemini may resist the Virgo’s need for routine and emotional sensitivity."

      "content": "Virgo & Libra Libras and Virgos get along fine and have some similarities. For example, they both prioritize helping others and maintaining well-kept homes.

[10] X Research source Ultimately, Libras and Virgos aren’t a bad match, but they also are unlikely to have much spark or common ground."

      "title": "Virgo & Aquarius",
      "content": "Virgo & Aquarius While Aquarius matches Virgo in intellect, they are otherwise incompatible. Virgos are logical and practical, while Aquarius is imaginative and doesn’t care much about rules. While Aquarius and Virgo can make good friends, they are rarely a successful romantic match. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Virgo & Leo",

Meanwhile, Leo views Virgo as nitpicky and overly critical. [12] X Research source This relationship is unlikely to last but can succeed if Leo and Virgo find balance and appreciate each other’s strengths. Sometimes opposites attract!"

    {
      "title": "Compassionate and caring",
      "content": "Compassionate and caring Virgos are very selective about who they spend their time with, so they seek out compassionate and kind people. Since Virgos are natural caregivers, they need that care to be reciprocated in their relationship so that they feel valued. [14] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stable and easygoing",
      "content": "Stable and easygoing Virgos need someone who understands their need for routine but is laid back enough to let Virgo have their way. Virgos are intense perfectionists and are very hard on themselves, so they need someone reliable to make them feel secure and remind them of what’s important in life. [15] X Research source Despite their need for structure, Virgo is often attracted to slightly unstable people (they love a project), which can lead to resentment and toxic relationships."

    {
      "title": "Curious and intellectual",
      "content": "Curious and intellectual Virgos are incredibly intelligent. They enjoy being around people who want to engage in deep conversations and explore intellectual topics. Virgos are also very interested in self-improvement and expanding their perspectives, so they value a partner who does the same. [16] X Research source Psychic astrologer Stina Garbis explains how Virgos need to feel curious about or intellectually stimulated by potential partners: “you have to really intrigue [Virgos] in a particular way or through some strange fetish that they have, to get them to open up to you.”"

      "title": "Lack of gratitude",
      "content": "Lack of gratitude Since Virgo gives so much to their relationships, they need to feel appreciated by their partner. A relationship isn't likely to work if Virgo's partner doesn’t show gratitude for how hard they work to care for their home and loved ones. [17] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Lack of self-control",
      "content": "Lack of self-control Virgos are very modest and controlled, so they are irritated by signs that are overly-indulgent or free-spirited. Virgos see behavior like binge-watching TV, going on shopping sprees, or spontaneously going on a trip as a lack of self-restraint. [18] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Helplessness",
      "content": "Helplessness Since Virgos are so quick to take control of any situation, it’s easy for their partners to lean into laziness.

[19] X Research source It’s important that Virgo’s partner tells them to take a break and that they’ll pick up the rest of the work."

    {
      "title": "Dishonesty",
      "content": "Dishonesty Virgos are deeply emotional and detail-oriented. Not only will they notice any signs of their partner being dishonest, but they will struggle to forgive them. Virgos also want their partners to share their truest emotions with them. They’ll become suspicious and insecure if they think someone is being sketchy about their feelings. [20] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Overly-dramatic",
      "content": "Overly-dramatic While they enjoy being admired and appreciated, Virgos avoids being the center of attention. They feel best in their personal space, so signs like going out a lot and meeting new people won’t be a good match for Virgo. [21] X Research source Virgos also value rationality and logic, so they may be judgemental of people who become highly emotional during arguments."

      "content": "Improve your compatibility with Virgos by understanding their needs. Tarot card reader Stina Garbis advises that you “pick up after yourself and be conscientious of cleanliness and hygiene. Allow them to give advice no matter how cringey, and let them have their way. When fighting, let them be right and make it seem like they won. Listen to them and let them talk when they need to talk and let them complain without stepping in.”"
