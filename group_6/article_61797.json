      "content": "Sit up straight on the ball with your legs out in front of you. They should be at a 90 degree angle to your thighs and parallel to the ball. At first, you can place your calves in front of you so that they are touching the ball. This will give you added stability while learning to use the ball. Later, you will want to move your calves so they are not touching, which will provide more benefits for your core."

      "content": "Bend your elbows and place your forearms at a 90 degree angle. Reaching forward slightly, you should be able to rest them on the top of the desk or table. If you are using a computer, make sure it is at a 90 degree angle. If it is not, your neck will be out of alignment with the rest of your spine, and the ball will be less useful in helping your posture."

      "content": "Practice active sitting. This is the state when your body reacts to the prospect of falling off the ball by tightening your core muscles in your stomach and back. Flex the muscles in your abdomen to add an extra element of exercise."

      "content": "Use the ball in 20 minute intervals. Do not get rid of your office chair. Just like exercise, it is important to give your muscles rest to prevent muscle fatigue and get the maximum benefit. Work up to 30 minute intervals as you get used to the chair. Doctors do not recommend that you sit for longer than 30 minutes at a time. If you need to get up to change chairs frequently, this will also benefit your spine."
