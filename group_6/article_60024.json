      "content": "Gentle shaving removes facial hair and manually exfoliates the skin. Many women shave their facial skin to remove “peach fuzz” (vellus hair), visible facial hair (terminal hair), and dead skin cells that clog pores. It’s essentially a DIY version of professional dermaplaning , where an aesthetician uses a scalpel-like tool to scrape away the topmost layer of skin.

Some women simply feel more radiant knowing their skin is smooth and hair-free."

      "content": "Shaving exfoliates and rejuvenates the skin on your face. Hair removal aside, shaving gets rid of the dead skin cells on your face that can clog pores and cause pimples. It also balances your complexion by lightening darker areas of your face. In general, your skin will be fresher, softer, and less acne-prone. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Shaving makes makeup and skin product application easier.",
      "content": "Shaving makes makeup and skin product application easier. When small hairs and dead skin cells are gone, moisturizers and other skincare products can sink into your skin easier and work more effectively. Foundation, serums, primer, and concealer will also apply easier and stick to your skin better when it’s smooth, fresh, and clean. [3] X Research source Wait at least 12 hours to put on makeup after shaving. This gives any micro abrasions time to heal before you paint over them, which can cause an infection."

      "content": "Shaving is simple and inexpensive compared to professional treatments. When done correctly, shaving your face is a painless, simple process. It’s low-cost, too—all you have to pay for is a razor and any moisturizing or shaving gel products you want to use. It’s also a fairly quick process (definitely faster than traveling to and from a salon appointment). [4] X Research source Shaving is also a way to remove hair without the use of harsh chemicals."

      "title": "Shaving might cause razor bumps (ingrown hairs) on your face.",
      "content": "Shaving might cause razor bumps (ingrown hairs) on your face. Razor bumps happen when short, freshly shaved hairs curve and grow back into the skin, resulting in annoying red bumps. Small abrasions from shaving can also cause general irritation or hair follicle infections (folliculitis). [5] X Research source Besides razor bumps, there’s the chance of tiny cuts, bruises, or razor burn from shaving too. [6] X Research source Exfoliating before and after shaving can help prevent razor bumps from forming. Shaving sensitive, dry, or acne-prone skin may cause redness or an acne outbreak. Shaving over razor bumps or acne can lead to infection or scarring. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "You may develop a “shadow” as your hair regrows. If you have pretty light skin but dark, dense facial hair, there’s a chance that a shadow will form if your hair is visible from under the skin. This is most likely to happen where the hair is most coarse, like on the chin or the upper lip. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Shaving requires regular upkeep.",
      "content": "Shaving requires regular upkeep. Since the hair will begin to grow faster, you’ll have to shave frequently (probably a few times a week or every other day). You’ll also have to moisturize your face before and after each shave to protect it from razor bumps, razor burns, and irritation, which might result in breakouts if you have oily or sensitive skin.

      "title": "No, shaving doesn't make your hair thicker or darker when it regrows.",
      "content": "No, shaving doesn't make your hair thicker or darker when it regrows. When you shave, the hairs on your face become blunted. They may appear thicker or coarser as they grow, but this is only because the tip is no longer pointed. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If the hair looks darker than normal, it’s because it hasn’t been exposed to much sunlight yet. It will lighten and soften to its normal appearance as it grows. [11] X Research source Shaving doesn’t change anything about your natural hair, unlike waxing, which tears hair from the root and repeatedly subjects the follicle to trauma."

      "title": "Wash your face to prepare the skin for shaving.",
      "content": "Wash your face to prepare the skin for shaving. Using warm water and a moisturizing face wash or gentle exfoliating scrub , gently massage and clean your face (especially the areas you plan on shaving). Wipe your face clean with a damp cloth and then apply a few drops of facial toner all over your face with a cotton pad to remove any remaining sweat, dirt, oil, or makeup. [12] X Research source Additionally, you can steam your face for several minutes. It isn’t necessary, but it will soften the skin and open up your pores even more."

      "title": "Apply a moisturizing shaving gel.",
      "content": "Apply a moisturizing shaving gel. Put on a thin layer of clear shaving gel or aloe vera gel over the areas you plan to shave. Allow it to sit for a moment to absorb into your skin. Some choose to shave dry , but gel is especially recommended for those with sensitive skin. [13] X Research source Shaving gel reduces skin irritation by decreasing the friction between the razor and your face. Avoid using soap and water as a shave gel since it will dry your skin out. If you don’t have actual shaving gel, wet your skin and use hair conditioner or moisturizer as an alternative."

      "content": "Grab a clean razor and begin shaving . Hold the razor at a 45-degree angle to your face and shave with gentle, short strokes to avoid cuts and ingrown hairs. [14] X Research source Shave with the grain of your hair to minimize irritation. Try not to go over the same spot more than once if you can help it. It may be helpful to use your non-razor hand to gently pull your skin taut while shaving. [15] X Research source Use a single blade or safety razor to avoid nicks, cuts, and irritation. There are also facial razors designed specifically for exfoliating and softening skin."

      "content": "Hydrate your skin after shaving to prevent irritation. Use a cotton pad or clean cloth to wipe your face and remove shaving gel or loose hairs. Then, apply a cold aloe vera gel, rose water , a hydrating moisturizer , or an alcohol-free aftershave balm to soothe your skin, prevent razor burns or bumps, and leave your skin feeling extra soft to the touch.
