      "content": "The officiant will pause the ceremony. If there is an objection at your wedding, it’s up to the officiant to proceed. Oftentimes, they will take a brief pause while they decide what to do and how to handle the rest of the ceremony. [1] X Research source If the objection is minor and doesn’t have any legal standing, the officiant may even just keep going with the ceremony without pausing."

      "content": "You can have a private conversation with the objector before restarting the ceremony. It’s likely that the person who objects will want to speak with you and your partner. Take them to a private area and talk about their concerns. Then, whenever you’re ready, you can head back out and keep going with the ceremony. [2] X Research source If the person who objects isn’t willing to move on, you may have to ask them to leave. It can be nerve wracking to think about someone objecting at your wedding. Keep in mind that this isn’t common, and it’s much more likely that your ceremony will go off without a hitch! Calm your nerves before the wedding by relaxing with friends and family the night before."

      "content": "Wedding objections started in medieval times during the 12th century. They were used as a way to identify any legal issues with the bride and the groom—maybe one of them was already married, or one of them took a vow of celibacy. Since there was much less documentation back then, oftentimes, people could get away with a shady marriage if no one knew about their past. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Wedding objections are meant for legal issues, not emotional ones. In every wedding objection on television, there’s a huge declaration of love from an ex who wants to stop the wedding. In reality, though, that kind of objection wouldn’t matter—unless there’s a legal matter stopping the couple from getting married, an objection like that has no bearing on the wedding itself.

      "title": "No, you don’t have to include an opportunity for objections if you don’t want to.",
      "content": "No, you don’t have to include an opportunity for objections if you don’t want to. If you’re religious, especially in the Anglican or Episcopal church, there’s a good chance that your officiant will include this tradition automatically. However, you can ask them to edit the script and change the phrasing to simply ask your guests to welcome you and your partner with open arms. [5] X Research source If you’re not religious or you’re not having a religious ceremony, feel free to leave it out all together."

      "content": "You may be able to dissuade someone from objecting if you talk to them first. There’s a good chance that you already know about the one person who may speak up at your wedding. If that’s the case, pull them aside for a private conversation a couple of days before the wedding. Talk about their concerns, and ask them not to disrupt your ceremony on the big day. [6] X Research source You might say something like, “I know you don’t approve of this marriage, but we’re in love and we will be getting married. If you have any objections, please keep them to yourself or talk with us in private about them.”"

      "title": "Talk to the couple in private about your concerns if you want to object.",
      "content": "Talk to the couple in private about your concerns if you want to object. Objecting during the wedding ceremony causes unnecessary drama, and it most likely won’t stop the wedding. If you really don’t want the couple to get married, pull them aside and express yourself privately. Chances are, they’ll be much more open to talking with you if you do it quietly and respectfully. [7] X Research source Remember, the only way to stop a wedding is if you have a legal reason why the couple can’t be married. In today’s modern age, almost every legal issue is brought up before the couple applies for their marriage license, so it’s very unlikely that you could shout something out that would stop a wedding."

      "content": "You can only object after the wedding in extreme circumstances. Once the couple has been married, there’s not a lot you can do to annul or dissolve their marriage license. However, if you have a legal or moral concern about the marriage, you can call the authorities or notify the courthouse that issued the marriage license. [8] X Research source"
