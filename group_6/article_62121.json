      "content": "They enjoyed the date and your company. If your date stays put the whole time, laughs it up with you, and gives you lots of eye contact, they think you’re a great conversationalist. Their first kiss is a reward for how amazing and fun you are. [1] X Research source If your date goes longer than expected, it’s a sign your date is very interested in you. For example, if you two agreed to an hour-long coffee date, but hang out for five hours, then they had a blast. Your date might compliment you as well. They may say something like, “You really know your way around this city! I love that.” They want to encourage you and make you feel proud. If you want to tell them you have a really great time, you can make the first move. You could also give some praise like, \"You're a blast!\""

      "content": "They’re trying to confirm there’s a spark between you. Your date could be curious about what intimacy or a relationship with you would be like. If their mouth waters and their heart races, they may feel way more invested in you. They’ll also like the opportunity to see if there’s real potential for passion. [2] X Research source Look into their eyes after your first kiss. If you see excitement or tenderness, then they probably felt the chemistry they wanted to check for. Your date might also initiate more physical touch. For instance, they might run their hand up your back. That’s another good sign that the kiss was successful. If you’d like to check for some compatibility, ask for a kiss and see how you feel afterward."

      "content": "Making a physical connection is their way to see if there's a match. Your date might take a while to warm up. They could be more patient or observant, and they might not want to make any snap judgments. When they focus on deep talks and finally kiss you, they could consider that the last step of your first date. They’ll use that last kiss as a way to figure out if there’s a spark. [3] X Research source Some people wait to flirt or show any affection. Your date might be more interested in your conversation. Listen for if they ask about your values or seem hooked by good stories. Your date might prefer to say they’re into you before they make their first move. For instance, they could say, “You’re really good looking!” If you’re patient and like to wait until the end of the date, you can tell them that. You can even say, “I wanted to work up to this, but now feels like the right time.”"

      "content": "They want to show off their exciting and unpredictable side. Your date might just be really fun-loving and like to joke around.

[4] X Research source If they laugh or giggle after you kiss, they could either be shy or they could just find the interaction cute and light-hearted. You can ask them about where their head is at. They might smirk or smile and tell you, “You’re really fun!” Kisses could be their reflex when they’re in a bubbly mood. If you feel silly and want to give them a quick kiss, you can ask first. You can laugh and start off with something like, “You’re too much! Are you good with a little kiss?”"

      "content": "They’d like to work you up and make you crave them. Your date may enjoy a good chase and a lot of tension. If they flirt with you a lot, give you lots of praise, and straight-up say they’re interested but delay the kiss, that could just be the kind of romance they prefer. [5] X Research source They might also give you cues that they’re super patient and like to play. They could say something like, “I’m really into you, but I’m not in a rush.” Check for flirty body language during your date. If they put their hand on your leg all night but then wait a long time to kiss you, they may just really like to tease. If you want to wind your date up, you can stick to some playful touches and wait to kiss them."

[7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source They might pull away and make a cute comment like, “Something to remember me by.” They may also choose to give you the kiss right before they step into their car or walk away.
