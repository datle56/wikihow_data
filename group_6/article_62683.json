      "title": "Write the name of the recipient on the first line.",
      "content": "Write the name of the recipient on the first line. The first line should contain the name of the person who will be receiving the letter. How you write the name depends on how they like to be addressed. If, for instance, you know your aunt prefers a certain level of anonymity, you could simply list her as \"P. Jones,\" instead of \"Polly Jones.\" Include any necessary titles. You can probably skip titles for close friends and family members, but you might consider including them for government officials, military personnel, doctors, professors, or elderly people. For instance, if you were addressing a letter to your elderly aunt Polly who was widowed many years ago, you might call her \"Mrs. Polly Jones.\""

      "content": "Place the letter in the care of someone else (optional). If you're sending someone a letter to an address where that person does not regularly reside, it might be wise to include a \"care of\" or \"courtesy of\" line below the name. Write \"c/o\" before the name of the person who does live there, the hotel, the hostel, etc. For instance, if your aunt Polly is staying with a cousin for a few weeks and you're sending her a letter there, you might write \"c/o Henry Roth\" below her name."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the street address or post office box number on the second line.",
      "content": "Write the street address or post office box number on the second line. If you're writing a street address, be sure to include any directional notation (such as \"400 West\" instead of simply \"400\") or apartment numbers. If the street address and apartment number are so long that they don't fit on one line, just write the apartment number on the line below the street address. For example, if your friend lives on 50 Oakland Avenue in apartment #206, write, \"50 Oakland Ave, #206.\" You can use some abbreviations for the type of street it is, as long as you use them correctly. You can write blvd instead of boulevard, ctr instead of center, ct instead of court, dr instead of drive, ln instead of lane and so on. [1] X Research source If you're addressing a letter using a PO box, there's no need to include the street address of the post office. Based on the ZIP code, the postal service will know where the PO box is."

If possible, try to name a person as the recipient instead of listing an entire organization — your letter is more likely to get someone's attention that way. Make sure to use formal titles, such as \"Mr.,\" \"Ms.,\" \"Dr.,\" or whatever the person's title may be. Write the recipient's position after their name (optional). For instance, if you're writing the director of marketing, you might say \"Paul Smith, Director of Marketing\" on the first line. Write \"Attn:\" followed by the person's name if the person occupies a single desk or office at an address, if you like. For example: \"Attn: Shirley Shatten.\" If you're submitting your work to a journal and do not know who the fiction editor is, write, \"Attn: Fiction Editor\" to make sure your submission ends up in the right place."
