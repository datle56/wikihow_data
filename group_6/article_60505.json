      "title": "Dogs jump up because they want attention.",
      "content": "Dogs jump up because they want attention. If your pup meets someone new or is waiting at the door for you, they’ll most likely jump up from the excitement of getting some extra pats. Your doggo is so excited to receive praise and belly rubs that they’ll jump and jump until they get the attention they seek. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing! Jumping is normal dog behavior but can be a little rude, especially if your pup accidentally knocks someone down with their glee. It can be easy to accidentally reinforce jumping behavior. You’re just as excited to give your pup all the attention they crave that you may find yourself praising them when they jump up. Try not to beat yourself up about it if you’re dog has started jumping up on people. This behavior can easily be untaught with the right training techniques."

      "title": "Ignore your dog’s jumping behavior.",
      "content": "Ignore your dog’s jumping behavior. The first and best thing you can do is ignore your dog. We know it’s hard disregarding that adorable face, but walk right by or stand really still. Dogs read body language to gauge their surroundings, and this will teach your pup that they won’t get attention by jumping up. By moving away or walking past your dog, your body language says, “I’m not giving you attention.” Think of it as acting like a tree. Don’t move. Don’t speak. Try the “turn your back” technique if you find ignoring your furry friend to be a bit tough. All you have to do is turn around when they try to jump up. [1] X Research source When your dog calms down and places all paws on the floor, bend over and acknowledge them with plenty of cuddles."

      "content": "Ask your friends to ignore your dog’s jumping too. A dog’s behavior won’t change without persistence. Let your friends and people you meet know that you’re training your dog to stop jumping up. If your pup approaches them, ask them to stay still or simply walk by. This will help your furry friend realize that you’re not the only one enforcing this new rule. [2] X Research source Try saying something like: “I can’t wait for you to meet Rex! But if he jumps up on you, please don’t acknowledge it. We’re working on that.” “Are you okay with dogs? Charlie’s big, and I’m warning you, he jumps. Just stand still and turn around. I’m training him, and the first step is ignoring the jumping.” “Jet is going to love you! He’s been jumping lately, and we’re still training, so please don’t pet or talk to him if he does jump on you.”"

      "content": "Use a lead on your dog when people are near. A lead or leash is a great way to help train your dog to behave when meeting new people and put you back in control. If your pup starts to jump, give the lead a small tug. You can reel your pup back to your side and help calm their excitement. [3] X Research source Use commands like “sit” and “stay” when using the lead trick. Keep a distance between you and the stranger with your pup pulled closely at your side. Lessening the slack on the lead means your pup can’t jump too high. Dogs read body language, so stay calm when introducing your pup to new people."

If your pup starts jumping up, you can say “sit,” and they’ll be reminded of what they’re supposed to do—plus, they’ll get plenty of ear scratches in return. To teach the sit cue, all you need are a few treats and some patience. [4] X Research source Hold a treat out in front of your pup’s nose, just out of reach. Raise the treat towards your pup’s head, causing them to sit. Say “yes” when your pup’s bottom hits the ground and give them the treat."

This means avoiding all situations where your pup may get attention for jumping up. Simply place them in the room a few minutes before your guests arrive. [5] X Research source You can also keep your pup in their crate if your guests are only visiting for a short while. If you don’t have a separate room or crate, you can set up a dog or baby gate in a hallway to give your pup their own space. Explain to your guests that you’re training your dog, and if they want to meet them, they can’t acknowledge any jumping-up behavior."

Try to keep others from giving your pup treats as this can distract and derail your training. [11] X Research source"

You can start by saying something like: “I’m so sorry about that! We’re currently working on not jumping up on people.” “So sorry! If he jumps again, could you not move?
