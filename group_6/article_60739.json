      "content": "Following up within the first 24 hours shows a girl you’re interested. While it’s traditional to wait 3 days, there’s no shame in texting sooner. In fact, the girl you like will probably be flattered that you were so eager to get in touch. It’s also easier for her to remember you if you reach out soon after meeting her. These days, getting in touch with someone is a breeze. Therefore, the longer you wait, the more likely a girl will assume you’re just not that interested. Even if you don’t get to her within a day, don’t wait more than 3 days to text her. Show her that she really made an impression on you!"

      "title": "Offer a smooth, fun introductory text to remind her who you are.",
      "content": "Offer a smooth, fun introductory text to remind her who you are. If she gave you her number and is waiting for you to text her, start off with a polite re-introduction. Mention your name and how you know her—and feel free to put a playful spin on the text to get her attention. [1] X Research source For instance: “Hey there, Jenna, it’s Morgan from the bar last night—the one you totally schooled in foosball! Where’d you pick up your amazing skills?” “Hi, Ava! It’s Casey, your fellow gaming enthusiast from Tinder. 😊 Playing anything fun today?”"

      "title": "Incorporating a name makes your text stand out from generic ones.",
      "content": "Incorporating a name makes your text stand out from generic ones. Be sure to include her name in your introductory text. Doing so will show her that your message was written specifically for her. It’s also a better option than using a pet name right off the bat, which might make her uncomfortable since you just met. For example, “Hi, Isabel! What are you up to today?” is a better text than, “Hey baby, what’s up with you today?”"

      "title": "Get her in a positive mindset by talking about your meeting.",
      "content": "Get her in a positive mindset by talking about your meeting. If you met in person and exchanged numbers (rather than matching online), reference how you met. Meeting someone who catches your interest is a happy experience, and recalling it over text can recreate that positive feeling. [2] X Research source For instance: “It was great to meet you last night! Karaoke is so much fun, and you had the best voice in the place.” “What a crazy party yesterday! The conga line was definitely fun, but meeting you was my favorite part. 😉” Even if you met online, you can still mention something about her dating profile that caught your eye or something that made you like her right away."

      "title": "Questions keep her engaged and help you get to know one another.",
      "content": "Questions keep her engaged and help you get to know one another. Ask her specific and interesting open-ended questions rather than a vague \"What's up?\". Asking open-ended questions helps you learn about her and lays the foundation for a meaningful conversation. Just remember to focus on one topic rather than asking many questions at once! [3] X Research source “What are some of your favorite places on earth?” “What’s your family like?” “If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?” “What’s something you’ve never done but always wanted to try?”"

      "title": "Charm her by letting her know she’s on your mind daily.",
      "content": "Charm her by letting her know she’s on your mind daily. Send a “ good morning ” text to give her a happy start to her day and show her that she was the first thing on your mind after waking up. Similarly, “ good night ” texts strengthen the bond between you and ensure you go to bed thinking of one another. [4] X Research source “Good morning, gorgeous! I’ll be thinking of you today! ☀️” “How’s it going? Thought I’d check in and see if you’re having a good day!” “Just wanted to wish you good night. Sleep well, and have sweet dreams! ✨”"

      "title": "A thoughtful, heartfelt compliment can cheer anyone up!",
      "content": "A thoughtful, heartfelt compliment can cheer anyone up! Text her compliments that make her feel special. Be specific and genuine , so she knows you’re reflecting on all the qualities you like most about her—rather than giving a generic compliment that could apply to anyone. [5] X Research source “You have the most brilliant mind. I don’t know anyone else who knows as many cool trivia facts about the world as you do!” “You’re so talented! I love seeing your drawings and sketches. You come up with the best character concepts.” “Your eyes are incredible. There’s a little ring of golden brown inside the blue that takes my breath away every time I see you.” Don’t get sexual with compliments right off the bat. Focus on making her feel attractive and respected—not sexualized. Reader Poll: We asked 336 wikiHow readers and 57% of them agreed that their favorite type of compliments to receive are ones about their character or personality . [Take Poll] So try something related to who she is on the inside, like “I really admire your ambition” or “You’re so thoughtful.”"

      "content": "Show her that you like her with fun, flirtatious texts. Flirting over text proves that you want more than just friendship! Send playful texts that make it clear you’re flirting without getting too explicit. Note her responses, too: if she replies with happy emojis or flirts back, it’s a sign she likes you too. [6] X Research source “You look great today. I haven’t seen you yet, but I know that because you always look great! 😘” “Every time I get a message from you, I smile like a goofball! 😍” Develop inside jokes with her, too! However, avoid inappropriate jokes until you learn about her sense of humor."

      "content": "Photos are a great way to intrigue her and give her insight into your life. After all, she’s trying to get to know you, too! Snap a photo that can tell her a little bit about your day, like a fun activity you’re doing, a pic of your pet, or a cool view you came across while walking. Send it to her with a short caption to catch her interest! “Check out the view from this hike! Isn’t it great? 😆What’s your favorite place to go hiking?” “I’m pretty proud of myself for making this pizza, not gonna lie! It’s my first time making sauce myself. 😋 Got any favorite toppings?”"

      "title": "Prove that you read her replies by discussing her favorite things.",
      "content": "Prove that you read her replies by discussing her favorite things. Girls appreciate feeling listened to and love it if you remember what they say. Mention little details you learn days or weeks after she shares them with you, whether it’s an issue she’s been dealing with at work, her favorite movie, or the name of her pet. [7] X Research source “Hey, how’d that project at work go? You were working so hard on it!” “Did you see there’s a TV adaptation of Lord of the Rings being made? I know you love those movies! What’s your take on the show so far?” “I saw the cutest cat toy online today! I bet Luna would like it. Want me to send you the link?”"

      "title": "She’ll find your text exchanges more enjoyable when they’re lighthearted.",
      "content": "She’ll find your text exchanges more enjoyable when they’re lighthearted. Avoid complaining or venting about unhappy topics until you get to know one another better. Ensure all of your texts to her sound enthusiastic and cheerful! After all, when you’re trying to woo a girl, it helps to raise up her mood rather than bring it down. Even if you’re having a bad day, try to think of a single thing that made you smile or laugh, and tell her about that. If you can’t think of anything happy to say, put your phone down and return to it when you’re feeling better."

      "title": "Study her texts to find out how she likes to be texted.",
      "content": "Study her texts to find out how she likes to be texted. It’s hard to guess someone’s texting style—the number of emojis they like to use or the length of their texts—until you see a few messages firsthand. Observe her texting style and then match it in your own texts; letting her set the tone of the exchange helps you match her expectations! [8] X Research source For example, if she includes an emoji with most of her texts, then do the same. Send emojis regularly, but don’t pack your texts with them—match her style. Until you get an idea of her style, keep your texts short, sweet, and purposeful. Ask her a question to get her talking and see how she texts."

      "title": "Proper grammar makes a good impression and shows your maturity.",
      "content": "Proper grammar makes a good impression and shows your maturity. Basically, bad grammar might make her think you’re not putting any effort into your texts, even if you’re just trying to seem chill and casual. It’s better to start with a grammatically correct text and then match her style later if it turns out she doesn’t mind a few shortcuts. [9] X Research source For example, write, “Hey, it’s Alex! It was great to meet you last night. Let’s do it again soon!” instead of, “Heyy its Alex, great 2 meet u! LMK when we can do it again.” Keep your texts short. Send messages that are 2 or 3 sentences long at most, or it can look a little overwhelming on a phone screen."

      "title": "Spacing out your texts keeps her interested and eager to hear from you.",
      "content": "Spacing out your texts keeps her interested and eager to hear from you. Leave about 15 minutes between your texts at first, and then start matching her timing once you get a sense of her texting style. Girls like knowing that their love interest isn't just sitting around waiting for every text! [10] X Research source Remember not to stop texting her for days at a time. A little suspense is good, but outright ghosting might upset her. Avoid bombarding her with texts if you don’t hear back for an hour or two. Waiting can be stressful, but spamming her with texts comes off as overeager."

      "content": "Establish your connection with texting, then move on to a real date! As you start to develop a relationship, don't rely on texting forever. If this girl likes you, she'll expect to go on a date sooner or later. [11] X Expert Source Patti Novak Williams Professional Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 12 January 2021. Ask her out after a couple of days. Keep it light and casual; ask her if she’d like to go out with you, and tailor the date to her interests. “It’s been great getting to know you! Can I take you out to dinner this Friday? I remember you love Greek food—we could check out that new place in town.” “You seem like a really cool person, and I think we have a lot in common. Would you like to see the new Star Wars movie with me this weekend?” You can also come right out and ask her what she wants. For example, you could ask for her favorite restaurant and take her there for a date."
