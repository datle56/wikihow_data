      "content": "Create a new canvas with your sticker size and color specifications. Open Procreate and tap the + at the top-right of your screen to open a list of possible canvas sizes. [1] X Research source Choose a standard dimension size or create your own—you'll usually want to choose the size of the paper you're printing to. If you're printing to a full-size sheet of sticker paper, make your canvas 2550 x 3300 (8.5 x 11\"). If you'll be cutting the stickers out with a Cricut cutter , your canvas can't be any larger than 9.25 by 6.75 inches (23.5 cm × 17.1 cm). [2] X Research source Procreate will also prompt you to choose your color profile and resolution. If you want to print high-quality stickers, use CMYK as the color profile and 300 DPI as the resolution. [3] X Research source If your stickers are going to be digital, choose RGB as the color profile. You can still use 300 DPI as the resolution, but you can also go lower (to about 150) if you are worried about file size."

      "content": "Sketch your sticker onto the canvas. Tap on the brush symbol near the top-right corner of the screen to open up your Brush Library. Under the Sketching tab, choose your favorite drawing tool. If you want to adjust the size of your brush, use the sliding size adjustment tool on the left-hand side of your screen. [4] X Research source Then, you can start sketching!"

      "title": "Add color onto a new layer of your canvas.",
      "content": "Add color onto a new layer of your canvas. Touch the layer icon (looks like overlapping squares) and the plus sign to create a new layer. Move this layer underneath your sketch layer by tapping and holding it before dragging it below Layer 1. Navigate to the Brush Library and choose your preferred tool. Tap the circle in the top right corner of your screen to open the Color Panel and choose a color. [5] X Research source Drawing directly onto Layer 2, use your brush to add color into your sketch. Depending on the complexity of your design, it may be useful to create a new layer for each color. This technique can help keep your color scheme uniform and simplify things if you need to make changes later."

      "content": "Merge the layers down into a single layer. Once you’re satisfied with the color, layout, and design of your sketch, tap on the top layer and select Merge down . Repeat until you have a single layer of the sticker design. [6] X Research source Now that you’ve completed drawing your sticker, having the design in a single layer will make it easier to move around and resize as needed."

      "content": "Draw a white border around the sticker. Open a final layer and drag it underneath your other layer(s). With this new layer selected, navigate to the layers panel and uncheck the box labeled “Background” to create a transparent backdrop. Select white from your color palette and use a hard airbrush to draw a smooth line around your sketched image. [7] X Research source Once you have an outline, fill in the white shape completely. If you see any defined line on the outside of the white shape, drop more white into the shape and adjust your color threshold by keeping your pencil tip on the screen and sliding to the left or right. Since this white layer is the bottom layer beneath your design, it will show up like a background."

In the now-opened Selection Panel, choose Automatic and tap the background. Swipe three fingers down your screen to bring up the copy and paste options, then choose Cut and Paste . This action will remove anything in your background and put it in a separate layer—delete that new, separate layer to be left with a completely clean image."

Open up your color palette and select white, then use a hard airbrush to draw a smooth line around each sticker design. [10] X Research source Once you complete your outlines, fill in each white shape completely. You shouldn’t see a defined line between your outline and the interior of the shape. If you do, drop more white into the shape and keep your pencil tip on the screen. Adjust the color threshold by sliding your stylus to the left or right until you’re satisfied with the look.

This step isn't required, as most e-planners (including GoodNotes) can separate stickers from sticker sheets. If you're using a Cricut , you can import the file into Design Space. You'll have a chance to clean up the image and prepare it for printing right in the app."

      "content": "Option 1: By Hand Open your saved sticker file on your iPad—make sure it’s in a PNG format with the dimensions of a standard piece of printer paper (typically 8.5 by 11 inches (22 cm × 28 cm)). If you have an AirPrint-compatible printer, simply tap the Share icon on your file and select Print . [12] X Research source If you don’t have an AirPrint-compatible printer, download an app from your manufacturer (e.g., the Epson Smart Panel app) or transfer the image to your computer to print. Once printed, cut out each of your stickers with a pair of scissors, leaving a thin border around the edge of each design if desired. Tools & Materials: iPad + Procreate, printer with ink, Inkjet-printable sticker paper, scissors. Pros: Inexpensive, size-adjustable, no limit on quantity, low setup time, opportunity to work with your hands. Cons: Need access to a printer, requires good scissor skills, doesn’t use heavy-duty materials, not ideal for high volume."

Resize and reposition the artwork as needed, then select Make It . [13] X Research source If your design preview overflows off of a single page, tap Canvas to go back and shrink the image further. Go to Print and choose your AirPrint-compatible printer. If you don’t have an AirPrint-compatible printer, send the file to your computer and print from there. The Cricut printer will automatically cut your sticker according to the guidelines that you’ve given. Tools & Materials: iPad + Procreate, printer + ink, Inkjet-printable sticker paper, Cricut cutting machine + accessories. Pros: Professional-looking, easy-to-use software, size-adjustable, makes many stickers quickly, great for experimentation. Cons: Expensive, involves trial and error, time-consuming, limited print size, not ideal for high volume, requires AirPrint-compatible printer."

      "content": "Kiss Cut With a kiss cut sticker, the machine only cuts through the first layer of material and leaves the paper backing intact. Consequently, kiss cut stickers are easier to remove from their backing than die cut stickers. Most store-bought sticker sheets use kiss cut stickers rather than die cut stickers.

      "content": "Material/Stock The material or stock of a sticker refers to the material used to manufacture the stickers. For example, stickers may be made on canvas, paper, vinyl, or cling film materials. Sticker stock can also be holographic, mirrored, or glittery and have a coating or sheen that’s glossy, matte, UV laminate, etc. [18] X Research source Some materials can be used outdoors, such as those used for bumper stickers or floor stickers."

      "title": "Backing Paper",
      "content": "Backing Paper Sticker material, stock, or paper is made of two layers: the top layer (where the design is printed) and the backing layer (including the sticker adhesive). The backing layer is a type of coated paper that’s designed to easily release the sticker when peeled off."

      "title": "Raster",
      "content": "Raster A raster-based image is made up of pixels, such as a digital photo. When these images are enlarged, they lose quality and become pixelated. However, raster images can feature a lot of details without dramatically increasing the file size. [19] X Research source Procreate is a raster-based app, so any sticker made in Procreate will be a raster image. Raster file formats include .jpg, .gif, .png, and .tiff."

      "title": "Vector",
      "content": "Vector A vector-based image is made up of mathematical paths and shapes, allowing them to be enlarged to any size with no change in quality. However, vector images are usually not very detailed or textured, as this would drastically increase their file size. [20] X Research source Vector images are often made using Adobe Illustrator and Affinity designer, resulting in file formats like .ai, .eps, and .svg."
