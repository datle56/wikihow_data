However, if the inside of the butter is lighter than the outside of the butter, this means it has oxidized. As such, the butter is no longer fresh. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Some people are better at using this method than others. If you use and consume butter a lot, it should be obvious when butter no longer smells fresh. [5] X Research source A small taste test can also tell you much; it will taste sour or bad if it is no longer fresh."
