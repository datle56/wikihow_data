      "content": "For the most part, yes, but there are some risks to be aware of. While all these risks can be managed by using properly-fitting headphones and keeping the volume at a moderate level, it’s a good idea to be aware of them. If you want to take a break from using headphones while sleeping and you’re not worried about disturbing other people, you can always use an external speaker. Some potential problems from sleeping with headphones include: Earwax build-up : Earbuds block the natural movement of wax outside the ear, so it’s best not to wear them too long, or wear over-the-ear headphones if you’re concerned about this. [1] X Research source Hearing loss : Listening to loud music for prolonged periods of time can damage your hearing. Try to limit your volume to 60% of its maximum to prevent hearing loss. [2] X Research source Pressure headaches : Some people may experience headaches with tight-fitting headphones that place pressure on their skull. Using a more comfortable pair can limit these symptoms. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Necrosis : Ill-fitting headphones can damage the skin in your ear canal over time, which happens when there’s not enough blood flow to keep cells alive. Looser headphones can prevent this from happening.
