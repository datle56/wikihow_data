      "title": "Purchase more accurate darts.",
      "content": "Purchase more accurate darts. Although you may have a large supply of normal Nerf N - Strike Elite darts, they are unfortunately not designed for accuracy, try to instead use N - Strike Elite AccuStrike darts. If you are looking for a more affordable option, look on amazon for \"Dart Zone Waffle Head Darts\" without the quotation marks. Waffle darts are the more favored type of darts in the Nerf hobby, shown to be some of the most accurate and cheapest darts of lasting quality. The tip of waffle-head darts may fall off, so check reviews before you purchase."

      "title": "Figure out how the gun shoots and reloads.",
      "content": "Figure out how the gun shoots and reloads. Start out by doing the obvious thing that nobody does- reading the manual. This will show you how to operate and unjam the blaster without damaging it. Then, start to get comfortable with the blaster so you can get a feel for how it shoots."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find, build, or purchase a target.",
      "content": "Find, build, or purchase a target. Nerf makes several targets, or you can purchase Blaster Boards to build a customizable but more expensive, usually higher quality option. You can also make nerf targets. Good targets are a soda can, a dartboard, a cup, or anything that you can shoot at with your dart gun. Start using a smaller, moving, longer ranged target after you begin to get better with aiming."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice shooting and reloading every time you can.",
      "content": "Practice shooting and reloading every time you can. Use a target and fire as many shots at it as you can as fast as possible. This will be useful when you play with your friends because your friends will have an extreme advantage if you have to take a long time to reload."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try different scenarios.",
      "content": "Try different scenarios. Try hiding behind something and going up for a second to fire a shot, and then ducking again. You can also try putting your back to the back of a wall next to a doorway and practice peeking around and firing quick shots. Do anything that applies to what you want to use your Nerf gun for."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aim slightly above the target.",
      "content": "Aim slightly above the target. Nerf darts drop over distance due to air resistance, and physics so aiming slightly above your target will give the dart the velocity it needs to hit the target."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch out for non-players.",
      "content": "Watch out for non-players. Learn to aim through, over, or under a crowd of people as to not hit people who aren't playing. This will keep people from getting mad at you because you accidentally hit them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn to use the wind to your advantage.",
      "content": "Learn to use the wind to your advantage. Try aiming a little left or a little right, depending on where the target is. The wind will allow you to yaw the dart into the target using a gust of wind. Try not to shoot facing the wind and always try to circle around your target until the wind is hitting your back, then shoot. The extra push from the wind will help the dart fly harder, farther, and straighter."
