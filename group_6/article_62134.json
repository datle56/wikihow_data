If you see \"No SIM Restrictions\" next to \"Carrier Lock\" in your iPhone's Settings, your phone is unlocked and can be used with almost any mobile phone provider.

      "content": "Carrier locking prevents you from switching mobile service providers. When signing up for a new mobile service provider, you are often required to sign a 1 or 2-year contract. To ensure that you finish out your contract, your mobile service provider may lock your iPhone to its service to prevent you from switching to a different provider. When your phone is carrier-locked, you can only use SIM cards from the mobile phone provider the phone is locked to. If you try to use a SIM from another carrier, it will not work until the current carrier unlocks it."

You will likely need to provide your account name and number and your phone's IMEI or MEID number . If you are eligible, they will give you an unlock code you can use to unlock your phone. If you are still under contract or purchased a second-hand phone from someone who's still under contract, you may not be eligible to unlock your phone. There are paid services online you can use to unlock your phone. These services can be sketchy, so go through your carrier if possible."

Once you've activated the SIM , your iPhone will be ready to use. Some carriers may provide you with an eSIM instead of a physical SIM card. You can activate an eSIM in the Settings app or using your mobile carrier's app."
