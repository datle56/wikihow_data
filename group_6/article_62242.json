Starseeds are people who feel a deep connection to the cosmos and the stars, and they often feel like they don’t truly belong among “Earth souls.” Many believe that Starseeds come from different planets, galaxies, or even entirely different dimensions. Starseeds are also said to possess scientific and spiritual knowledge that they use to advance and heal humanity. [1] X Research source The concept of Starseeds is mentioned in Brad Steiger’s book “Gods of Aquarius,” published in 1976. Here, he refers to them as “star people” and describes them as human beings who were linked to extraterrestrials. The idea of people coming from the stars is also a popular theme in many myths and legends in different cultures and ancient civilizations. For example, many ancient Egyptian gods were believed to live in the sky. [2] X Research source As another example, the Hopi held the belief that their ancestors came from Pleiades, an open star cluster. [3] X Research source"
