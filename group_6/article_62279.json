      "content": "Use bleach powder and 30 volume developer . Mix some hair bleaching powder and liquid developer from a kit from the store. 30 volume developer is the strongest volume you can use without severely damaging your hair or skin, so it’s an effective option for dark hair. [1] X Research source “Volume” here indicates the percentage of the bleaching agent hydrogen peroxide in your developer: 10 volume (3%), 20 volume (6%), 30 volume (9%), and 40 volume (12%). [2] X Research source Don’t use 40 volume developer thinking you can speed up the lightening process! 12% hydrogen peroxide can be really detrimental to your hair’s health. A 1:1 ratio will create a thick solution that’s best for controlled highlights, while a 1:2 or 1:3 (powder to developer) ratio is better for spreading evenly, especially on thick and/or curly hair."

      "content": "You probably shouldn’t. Household bleach’s main ingredient is sodium hypochlorite, among other super strong chemicals, which can be very harsh on your hair, skin, and eyes. Hair bleach’s main ingredient is hydrogen peroxide, which is gentler and helps maintain pH balance in the hair. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "The prep:",
      "content": "The prep: In the weeks leading up to bleaching, you want to make sure your hair is retaining as much natural moisture as it can. Do a strand test before bleaching, applying the product to your hair and letting the bleach sit for at least 30 minutes so you have a better idea of what kind of lift you'll have and to see if there's any reaction. Stay away from hair dryers and flat irons, and try doing the occasional hair mask or deep condition. The night before, lather your hair in some coconut oil and go to sleep with a shower cap on. You’ll want to keep the oil in for the bleaching, as it will shield your follicles from damage but not get in the way of coloring. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "The application:",
      "content": "The application: Wear an old t-shirt and have an old towel under you to catch any drippings. Split your hair into four equal sections with clips or bands. Start applying bleach 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from your scalp with a brush. Do your roots last, as body heat activates bleach quicker. Put a shower cap on and set a timer for 15-30 minutes, depending on package instructions and desired results. When you’re done, rinse and wash your hair with a gentle shampoo. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "The aftercare:",
      "content": "The aftercare: The hair masks, deep conditioners, and coconut oil recommended for before bleaching are also great ways to revitalize hair after. You may need to repeat the process a few times to get the shade you want. Wait about 3-4 days to give your hair a break and keep your hair moisturized between sessions. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use purple toner shampoo after bleaching.",
      "content": "Use purple toner shampoo after bleaching. “Toners” neutralize uneven pigmentation in hair, and can easily be found and used in the form of shampoo. Purple color pigments can balance out the orange, brassy tones that can appear in bleached hair. Use a purple toner product once a week in place of your regular shampoo. [7] X Research source Once a week is recommended, though it really depends on how often you wash your hair normally. Keep your hair washing routine the same and just switch out your regular shampoo for purple toner shampoo."

      "title": "With patience and care, yes.",
      "content": "With patience and care, yes. You’re going from one side of the color spectrum to the other, so you’ll need to remove a lot of pigment. This is a process that will definitely require more than one bleaching session over the course of multiple weeks. Bleaching your hair to this degree will make it dry and brittle, so moisturizing it regularly will be crucial to keeping it looking healthy. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Yes, but not to the same effect.",
      "content": "Yes, but not to the same effect. If you’re trying to stay away from harmful bleach, there are a few natural hair lightening agents you can use as gentle alternatives. Note that none of these will produce the same drastic results that bleach will. They might lighten black hair by a shade or two, giving it a reddish tint, but they won’t turn your hair blonde. [9] X Research source Some alternatives and their application processes are as follows: Mix lemon juice, honey, cinnamon, and warm water until runny. Apply the mixture to your hair with a brush and let it sit for 30-60 minutes. Rinse, shampoo, and condition. This works best if it’s allowed to sit in direct sunlight for a while. Mix henna powder and hot water into a thick paste. Apply it with a brush and let it sit for 2-4 hours. Rinse, shampoo, and condition. This will provide the most noticeable result in black hair, giving it a deep red or orange color."

      "title": "Yes, you can!",
      "content": "Yes, you can! If you’re not naturally dark-haired and want to return to a lighter shade, you can use bleach to lighten your hair. However, if you frequently dye your hair, the dye pigment buildup will make the bleaching process take longer. [10] X Research source It may be helpful to try hair dye remover first. If your hair is not naturally dark, avoid using more bleach than you need to to minimize unnecessary damage."
