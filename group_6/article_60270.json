      "title": "Ask your partner to create a similar list, then swap lists.",
      "content": "Ask your partner to create a similar list, then swap lists. Every day, pick a topic of conversation from your partner's list and research and read about it for 10 to 30 minutes. (Google it, read it from a newspaper, book, etc.) Next time you and your significant other are at the dinner table or riding in the car, wow them with your newly found knowledge about their interests––be ready to ask questions too. After the first conversation dies out (if it does), then swap subjects. Reader Poll: We asked 1005 wikiHow readers, and only 10% of people recommended bringing up super deep, philosophical topics over text. [Take Poll] Instead, they suggest saving intellectual chats for in-person conversation!"

      "content": "Don't let your movie experience end in the movie theatre. Take a 20-minute walk and talk about it. Ask each other questions, such as: Did you like it? What was your favorite and least favorite part? Favorite character? Favorite line? Did you like the ending? What would you have done differently? Explore ideas together."

      "title": "Play:",
      "content": "Play: What's your favorite... would you rather... what would you do... if you were stuck on a desert island... etc. And get weird with it! For example: If you fell from the empire state building, do you think you would die if you were an ant? It seems childish, but it's good to connect to that side around the person we trust the most. Don't hold back! Do not get stuck with your responsibilities and become serious. Remember to play as a couple.
