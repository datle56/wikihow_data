      "content": "Find an Allay. In Minecraft , Allays have a 50% chance to spawn in dark oak cages in Pillager Outposts. You can also find them in jail cells inside Woodland Mansions (also a 50% chance to spawn). In both locations, 1 to 3 Allays have a chance of spawning in each cage/cell. [1] X Research source Allays are passive mobs that are blue and look like fairies. They also look similar to the hostile mob Vex but differ in color (Vex are gray, while Allay are blue), and Vex carry swords."

      "content": "Approach the Allay and give it an item. While Allays cannot be tamed like other mobs, you can \"tame\" them by giving them an item. That Allay will then follow you and search for the item you gave it. An Allay can carry about 64 of the same item and will only pick up one type at a time. If another user gives the Allay an item, the Allay will then follow that user. While you cannot tame Allays normally, you can also use a Lead and a Name Tag on them in Java Edition."

      "content": "Allays are most useful for finding items. As stated above, if you give an Allay an item to \"tame\" it, it'll go looking for that item. This is useful if you're farming a particular item or want your Allay to help you find a lost item. Note that Allays cannot gather items that are underwater."

After delivering the items, the Allay will spend about 60 seconds by the note block before returning to the player."
