    {
      "title": "Tape the paracord to the handle.",
      "content": "Tape the paracord to the handle. Place the paracord along one side of the handle. Tape it to the handle at a point just beneath the blade of the knife. There should be enough cord to extend down the length of the handle, plus a little extra. For most knives, the total length should be about 1 foot (30.5 cm). Allow this excess cord to hang off past the bottom of the handle. Do not cut the paracord yet. Wrap the tape around the handle two or three times. Make sure that it firmly holds the cord in place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wind the cord around the handle.",
      "content": "Wind the cord around the handle. Wrap the paracord around the width of the handle in one full rotation. Work with the cord still attached to the bundle. Do not wrap using the excess cord hanging down from the bottom of handle. The cord should form a tight loop over the handle, fitting over the handle's width. This loop should end when it crosses over the taped starting point."
    },
    {
      "title": "Work your way down the entire length of the handle.",
      "content": "Work your way down the entire length of the handle. [1] X Research source Continue wrapping the paracord around the width of the handle until you reach the opposite end. Each consecutive loop should be directly next to the loop before it on the handle. Keep the wrapping very tight as you go along. Wrap the attached side of the paracord over the loose, cut end, covering that cut end and securing it to the handle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie the cord to the empty end.",
      "content": "Tie the cord to the empty end. Slip both ends of the paracord through the lanyard hole at the bottom of the handle. Tie them into a firm knot to secure the wrapping. If the hole is not large enough, you could wrap both ends of the paracord around the back notch of the knife. Tie the knot behind this notch. The knot must be very tight so that the paracord wrapping cannot unravel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Knot the ends together.",
      "content": "Knot the ends together. Cut the attached side of the paracord so that the tail is roughly the same length as the excess loose end still hanging off the bottom of the handle. Tie both of these ends together into a firm knot. The resulting loop should serve as a wrist loop, so you'll need to make sure that you cut off enough to paracord to form a loop capable of fitting over your wrist. The process is complete once you finish this step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Center the handle over the paracord.",
      "content": "Center the handle over the paracord. Cut a long piece of paracord and lay it on your working surface. Place the top of the handle over the center of the cut paracord. You need a piece of paracord that is at least at least four to five times longer than the length of the handle. Any excess cord can be trimmed at the end of the process, so it's better to start with too much than too little."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cross the left end over.",
      "content": "Cross the left end over. Grab the left end of the paracord and cross it over the top of the handle. Slip it under the right end of the cord, drawing it through from the bottom and out from the top. The two ends should form a loop over the width of the handle. The intersection of this loop should be at the right side of the handle."

      "content": "Weave the right end back through the loop. Take the other end (the one you haven't worked with yet) and slide it into the loop from the back. Draw it back through to the left side of the handle. From the back side of the loop (lying beneath the handle), you will need to slip this end into the bottom of the loop and out through the top. This step will tie the loop in place. Pull the paracord tight with both ends to tighten the loop in place around the handle. At the end of this step, the right and left ends of the paracord will have changed places. The end that was previously the left end is now the right end and vice versa."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cross the right end over.",
      "content": "Cross the right end over. Grab the right end of the paracord and cross it over the top of the handle, beneath your previously formed loop. Slip the right end under the left, drawing it through from the bottom and out from the top. As before, this should create a loose loop. The point of intersection should lie at the left side of the handle this time."

    {
      "title": "Cross the left end behind the handle.",
      "content": "Cross the left end behind the handle. Take the left end of the cord and pass it underneath the handle of the knife.

      "content": "Weave the end through the loop. Take the end you worked with in the previous step and pass it through the loop around the handle from the right side. You'll need to insert the end through the loop from bottom to top. Pull the cord tight to secure the loop in place. At the end of this step, the two ends will have reversed sides again."

      "content": "Mirror the steps with the opposite side. Repeat the steps used to create the last loop, working with the cord on the left instead of the cord on the right. Cross the left end over the front of the sheath. Pass it under the right end to create a loop. Pass the right end behind the handle to the left side, then insert it through the loop at the left side, working from back to front. Pull both ends to secure the new loop in place."

Note that you should tape the loop to the flat side of the handle, not the narrow edge. The dimensions of the loop should also correspond to the flat side. The intersection of the loop should be at the top of the handle, just below the bottom of the blade. The curve of the loop should be at the bottom of the handle. The length of paracord should be roughly four to five times longer than the length of the handle. The loop should be centered in the middle of the handle."

The left end of the cord should wrap all the way around the handle. When it reaches the point of intersection of your original loop, slide the end beneath the intersection and underneath the cord below it. This will be the cord on your left, but it is also the section of the loop closest to the right end. When finished, the left end of the cord will still be on the lefthand side of the handle. Wrap the cord tightly as you work."

The three sections of cord at the center front are the two portions just beneath the intersection of the original loop and the left end you wrapped around the handle in the previous step. Slip the right end over the left intersection portion, under the left cord, and under the right intersection portion. Tug on the cord tightly to secure the wrap in place. When you finish this step, the right end will still be on the right side of the handle."

[4] X Research source The rest of the handle should be wrapped by following the same two wrapping steps; these two steps consist of a set. After completing each set, rotate the knife 180 degrees. Essentially, every other set will be performed upside-down. Each set should be performed by wrapping the left end first, followed by the right end. Continue until you reach the bottom of the handle."
