      "content": "In Christianity, an upside-down cross symbolizes humility and hope. Also known as the Cross of St. Peter or Petrine Cross, an inverted cross is based on the story of the apostle Peter, who was crucified upside down. While Peter was a loyal follower of Christ, he was sometimes rash, fearful, and unfaithful. But Jesus loved him all the same. Because of this, the inverted cross is a sign of humility for Christians—Peter had his faults, but he was always humble. [1] X Research source Peter was one of the first followers of Jesus and a pillar of the church; he was referred to as the “rock” by Jesus: “And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it” (Matthew 16:18). There’s no scriptural witness to Peter’s crucifixion, but it’s believed that he wanted to be crucified upside down because he was unworthy to be crucified the same way as Jesus. [2] X Research source If someone has an inverted cross tattoo, it may mean they’re a Christian who feels a connection to Peter’s story."

      "title": "An upside-down cross can be an anti-Christian symbol.",
      "content": "An upside-down cross can be an anti-Christian symbol. The first person to wear this symbol was 19th-century occult leader Eugéne Vintras, who claimed to be the reincarnation of the Prophet Elijah. He read and preached the Acts of Peter as a war against a Saint and a sorcerer. The inverted cross was a symbol of Vintras’ new faith going against traditional Christianity. Because of Vintras’ practice of demonic rituals and witchcraft, the symbol soon came to be associated with the occult, atheism, and Satan. [3] X Research source This is one of the most common meanings today, as the symbol often appears on necklaces and t-shirts with anti-Christian propaganda. If someone has an upside-down cross tattoo, it might mean they’re an atheist or they're interested in the occult."

      "content": "Where someone places an upside-down cross tattoo could affect the symbol’s overall meaning. Every tattoo is individual and has a personal meaning; however, here are the most common placements and spiritual interpretations: On face: A tattoo on the head or face could be a sign of consciousness or spiritual enlightenment. [4] X Research source An inverted cross on the face, therefore, might mean someone feels closer to God or the devil. Under eye: A tattoo near the eye is often seen as a representation of perceptions. [5] X Research source An upside-down cross under the eye could be a gang sign to show loyalty or a depiction of seeing things through an atheist lens. Behind ear: A tattoo behind the ear is usually associated with communication. [6] X Research source An inverted cross behind the ear could symbolize blocking out Christianity or Satanism. On hand: A tattoo on the hand can symbolize spiritual creativity and action. [7] X Research source An upside-down cross on the hand may signify loyalty to St. Peter or the occult. Know that tattoo placements don’t necessarily have a specific meaning—that’s all up to the individual. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "An upside-down tattoo is a tattoo that faces the wearer. Sometimes, a cross tattoo can look upside-down to you but may be right-side-up for the wearer. This can change the tattoo's meaning depending on who’s looking at it. While you see the symbol as upside-down, they do not. Tattoos are ultimately for the wearer, and how they desire to see the image will determine the overall placement and position. [9] X Research source For example, say someone has a cross tattoo on the inside of their wrist. The end of the cross may point towards their elbow. To them, the cross is right-side-up. To anyone else, it is upside-down."
