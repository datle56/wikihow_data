      "title": "Aries, your adventurous nature will get the best of you one day.",
      "content": "Aries, your adventurous nature will get the best of you one day. Your friends will remember you as the risk-taker and the one who wasn’t afraid to speak their mind. Whether you kick the bucket from riding a motorcycle too fast or bungee jumping off a cliff, your obituary is sure to be one for the books (and you’d best believe that your ghost will hang around having adventures from the afterlife!)."

      "title": "You love your knick-knacks, so there’s no way you’d leave them behind.",
      "content": "You love your knick-knacks, so there’s no way you’d leave them behind. If anything, your Taurus personality will have you hanging onto life longer than anyone else, just so you can grab that latest piece of tech that drops tomorrow. Just watch out that your stuff doesn’t come back to bite you—getting buried alive underneath stacks of books and vintage dishware doesn’t sound like a good time, even for you."

      "title": "Your natural curiosity is going to get the best of you, Gemini.",
      "content": "Your natural curiosity is going to get the best of you, Gemini. With your insatiable need to explore and your love of adventure, you’re bound to get yourself into some dangerous trouble. Your loved ones will think fondly of your ability to see both sides of things. Your ruling body part is your hands, so don’t be surprised if it’s your digits that eventually do you in (anyone up for picking some poisonous berries? They look delicious!)."

      "title": "Your DIY mindset might get you in the end, Cancer.",
      "content": "Your DIY mindset might get you in the end, Cancer . You love to support others, but you have a tough time accepting help for yourself. Sure, your DIY nature will get you through a few decades, but eventually, you’ll stumble across a project that you just can’t do yourself. Whether it’s re-wiring the electrical in your house or installing a grand piano on the third floor, you’ll go out kicking and screaming about how you’ve got everything handled."

      "title": "Leo, your flair for dramatics may end up being your downfall.",
      "content": "Leo, your flair for dramatics may end up being your downfall. While storming off after a friend says something mean might feel good in the moment, it can also lead to distractions (watch out for that bus!!). Whether you’re flouncing away after being called out or making a showy exit after giving a flirtatious wink, your death (like your life) is sure to be both glamorous and breathtaking."

      "title": "You may have to pay the ultimate price for all those sleepless nights, Virgo.",
      "content": "You may have to pay the ultimate price for all those sleepless nights, Virgo. Your work ethic and drive are great skills to have, but they can also push you to the brink. Watch out for any mysterious stress-related illnesses, like headaches, rashes, or stomach aches—they might just be more serious than you think. Get some self-care in, ASAP!"

      "title": "Libra, your indecisive nature is likely to contribute to your demise.",
      "content": "Libra, your indecisive nature is likely to contribute to your demise. Making decisions is hard for anyone, but for you, Libra, it’s like pulling teeth. The next time you’re stopped at a red light trying to figure out whether to turn right or left, make a decision and stick with it (otherwise, you could get into trouble)."

      "title": "Your anger issues will eventually destroy you, Scorpio.",
      "content": "Your anger issues will eventually destroy you, Scorpio. While your fiery nature is great for a lot of things, it’s not so good when you direct it at the wrong person. The next time you set out to get revenge, use caution, as it might just be your last big move."

    {
      "title": "Sagittarius, your love of adventure will take you out.",
      "content": "Sagittarius, your love of adventure will take you out. Constantly hopping from one dangerous thing to the next has worked for you so far, but it won’t be long before it kills you! Next time you’re planning your 10-day hike through the jungle or your road trip through all 50 states, consider taking a relaxing vacation instead."

      "content": "You’ll obviously die after retirement, right, Capricorn? With your hard-working attitude and your goal-oriented nature, there’s no way you’d kick the bucket before achieving all of your career milestones.

      "content": "Aquarius, your solo adventuring could end in disaster. While heading off into the woods with limited cell reception and no portable charger sounds like a good time to you, it’s not the best plan when you find yourself walking in circles. Try to accept help from others, even if you think you don’t need it—we promise it will be worth it."
