      "content": "Coat your clean hands with cornstarch. Wash your hands with soapy water and dry them really well to remove dirt, grease, and bacteria. Shake cornstarch onto your palms and rub your hands together. Work the cornstarch between your fingers and get your hands completely coated. Then, wait about 15 minutes so the cornstarch can really dry out your hands. Take a dry cloth and wipe off the excess cornstarch before you start playing. [2] X Research source You can use baby powder instead of cornstarch but look for talcum-free products since studies suggest talc contains asbestos which can cause cancer.

      "title": "Yes—spray antiperspirant onto your palms before you game.",
      "content": "Yes—spray antiperspirant onto your palms before you game. The antiperspirant works when your skin begins to sweat. It gets pulled down into your sweat glands and blocks them. This sends a signal to your body to stop producing sweat. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If your hands feel irritated or you notice a burning sensation, stop using the antiperspirant and talk with your doctor. You may have heard that aluminum in antiperspirants causes cancer. However, the American Cancer Society notes that there's no clear link between aluminum and cancer.

      "content": "They're made with moisture-wicking material to prevent sweaty hands. If you feel the surface of the gloves, you'll also notice they're covered with bumpy dots that help you grip the controller. Most of them also have finger grips along the pads of your fingertips so you can use the gloves with a variety of gaming platforms.

      "content": "Dry them on a clean cloth or napkin. You might find that you still sweat a little, even after trying preventative measures. For a quick fix, keep a hand towel near your gaming space so you can wipe your hands dry as soon as they feel sweaty. [7] X Research source Try doing this every time you get to a loading screen. It can prevent your hands from getting so sweaty that the controller feels slippery when you hold it."

      "content": "Take breaks to help you relax. It's no surprise that you sweat more when you're anxious or tense—things you probably feel constantly when you're gaming! Try to take frequent breaks. Even stepping away for a few minutes can clear your head and reduce stress. You might walk around the room or just get up and stretch.

      "title": "Yes—get a silicone anti-slip cover for your controller.",
      "content": "Yes—get a silicone anti-slip cover for your controller. A lot of these have bumpy, textured surfaces so your hands have something to grip onto when you play. To put it on, just push the controller cover onto your controller and adjust it so the buttons and sticks aren't covered. [9] X Research source Shop your local game store or online for these grippy covers. Many of these come with circular grippy covers for the controller's sticks. Pop them onto the sticks so your thumbs don't slide off of them if your hands get sweaty."

You'll need to get a medical exam and if your doctor diagnoses you with hyperhidrosis, they may recommend getting Botox injections. They'll numb your hands before injecting the Botox across each palm. The Botox blocks the nerves in your skin that cause sweating and the effects should last 6 to 12 months.
