      "content": "Temperature fluctuations The air inside your tires naturally expands or contracts as the temperatures rise or fall. Your tires lose about 1 pound (0.45 kg) of air per 1 square inch (6.5 cm 2 ) for every 10 °F (−12 °C) drop in air temperature. [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source This is nothing to worry about, and can easily be fixed by filling your tires with the appropriate amount of air. Fixes: Check your air pressure each month with a tire gauge and top it off at a gas station, tire shop, or auto care store. [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source The correct air pressure (psi or kPa) for your tires can be found in your owner’s manual or on a sticker on the lower part of your driver side door jamb. Estimated cost: Some air pressure stations and services are free. Others might charge $1 to $2 to fill your tires with air."

      "title": "Natural permeation",
      "content": "Natural permeation Air molecules can escape through your tires’ rubber sidewalls over time in a completely natural process called permeation. Permeation can lead to a gradual drop in tire pressure without leaving any punctures or holes in the actual tire. This can happen even if the tire isn’t driven or the tire isn’t mounted on the car.

      "content": "Deteriorated valve stem or core The valve stem, where you would attach an air nozzle to fill up your tire, can deteriorate and cause air pressure leaks over time. The valve can also be defective. Remove the hubcap if you have one and use a flashlight to check the stem for cracks along the stem and where it meets the wheel. [5] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Fixes: Take your car to a tire repair shop. You can also replace it yourself with a valve stem replacement tool kit by removing the wheel from the vehicle, taking the rubber wheel off the rim , removing the valve, and inserting the new one provided in the kit. Estimated cost: Tire shops can replace your valve stem for around $25 to $30. Doing it yourself can cost around $10."

      "title": "Damaged wheel",
      "content": "Damaged wheel Damage to the metal part of the wheel, like corrosion or a bent rim, can create small gaps between the tire bead and the wheel, allowing air to escape. Check the area around the outside of the rim for corrosion (blue, green, or red discoloration) or small deformities. [6] X Research source Fixes: If you have a bent wheel, visit a tire shop to get it straightened. If your rim is corroded, have it replaced at a tire shop or repair it yourself as a temporary fix. Jack up your vehicle, remove the tire, dismount the tire from the rim, and sand the rim down with 220 grit sandpaper . [7] X Research source Spray it with a clear coat of paint or a car paste wax and mount the rim back on. [8] X Research source Estimated cost: Bent rim repairs can cost between $50 to $125. [9] X Research source New tire rims can cost between $80 to $300. 220-grit sandpaper and paint or car paste wax can cost from $20 to $30."

      "content": "Broken or leaking tire bead The tire bead is the inner edge of the tire that holds the tire in place on the wheel’s rim. If the bead is damaged or not closing correctly, it can cause air leaks. This is most commonly caused by driving on tires that aren’t properly inflated, causing the bead to slip and become damaged. [10] X Research source Fixes: Go to a tire shop right away to replace the tire. If the tire bead is damaged, it can lead to problems with your car’s ride and handling and put you at risk of a blowout.

      "content": "Faulty tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) If your TPMS says your tires have low pressure but a tire gauge says your tires are fine, it might be faulty. Most TPM systems have a pressure sensor or transmitter mounted to the wheel inside the tire’s air chamber, but some get their information by monitoring the revolution of the tires as the vehicle moves. [13] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Fixes: Take your car to a tire shop to have them replace the sensors or reset the TPM system. [14] X Research source Tire pressure sensors generally last about 10 years before they need to be replaced. [15] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Estimated cost: The average price for tire sensors is around $40 to $60 per wheel. If you’re already getting new tires, the sensors might be less expensive to replace.

You might notice lacerations, or small cuts, around where the puncture happened that allow air to escape from inside your tire.

Fixes: Visit a tire store to repair or replace the punctured tire. A puncture larger than 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) cannot be safely repaired and requires a replacement.

You can find when the tire was manufactured on the sidewall followed by the letters “DOT.” The last 4 numbers identify when a tire was made. For example, if the last 4 numbers are “3004,” the tire was manufactured on the 30th week of 2014 and needs to be replaced immediately.
