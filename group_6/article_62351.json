      "content": "The control arm is a long metal bar that spans the length. When the ice tray is full, the control arm raises, and the ice maker shuts off. Make sure the control arm is lowered and there isn't any ice obstructing it and preventing it from lowering. The ice maker compartment is generally in the upper-left corner of most Whirlpool refrigerators. Press the release button and remove the ice tray to access the ice maker compartment. The ice maker may be located in a different location on a few Whirlpool refrigerator models. On some models, it may be located in the door."

      "title": "You should change your Whirlpool water filter every 6 months.",
      "content": "You should change your Whirlpool water filter every 6 months. Otherwise, sediment may build up and restrict water to the ice maker. It can also make your ice taste funny. If the water pressure is low or your ice tastes weird, it may be time to change the filter. Check the documentation that came with your refrigerator to learn where the water filter is located and how to change it. Some after-market filters may not work as well as the ones that came with your refrigerator. Make sure you get a water filter that is right for your refrigerator model."
