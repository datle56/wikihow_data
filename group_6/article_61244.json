      "title": "Dogs can develop different kinds of cysts.",
      "content": "Dogs can develop different kinds of cysts. True cysts develop near glands and often form on a pup’s eyelids. Follicular, or epidermoid cysts, form in your dog’s hair follicles. Sebaceous cysts are also found around your pet’s hair follicles, and especially likely to get infected. Other dogs may have false cysts, which usually form after some type of injury.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Most cysts have a “secretory lining,” or a special lining that surrounds the entire cyst. False cysts don’t have this type of lining, and they only appear in dead tissue. Dermoid cysts are a rare type of cysts that a few pups develop before they’re born—chances are, this isn’t the kind of cyst your dog is dealing with."

      "title": "Sebaceous cysts form when hair follicles get blocked.",
      "content": "Sebaceous cysts form when hair follicles get blocked. Your pup naturally secretes sebum from their oil (sebaceous) glands, which spreads onto their hair and skin. [4] X Research source When the hair follicle gets covered with debris and dirt, this new sebum has nowhere to go, and ends up forming a cyst. Over time, these cysts can grow bigger and bigger as they fill up with extra secretions. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Injury, pressure points, and sun damage can also lead to cysts.",
      "content": "Injury, pressure points, and sun damage can also lead to cysts. Follicular cysts usually form after some type of damage to the hair follicle, or when a pore gets blocked. In a similar fashion, true cysts appear when the sweat gland gets blocked off. False cysts, on the other hand, tend to pop up when your dog has a bad reaction to a shot.

You’ll probably find this type of cyst on your dog’s head, trunk, or neck, where you’ll see a gray or yellow, cheese-like substance leaking out. Unfortunately, this cyst tends to smell bad once it gets infected. [7] X Research source"

If this happens, clean out the cyst and carefully wrap it up with a clean bandage. Don’t try to pop or remove the cyst yourself, though. [11] X Research source You can clean the area with warm tap water or a warm saline mixture made with 1 tsp (5.9 g) of salt and 2 c (470 mL) of distilled water. Don’t use any shampoo, soap, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other substance to clean the area, unless your vet specifically suggests it. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Take your dog to the vet as soon as you can after the cyst ruptures. There, veterinary professionals may remove the cyst with a laser. Vets won’t usually squeeze or drain a ruptured cyst since that won’t get rid of the blockage completely and could cause the cyst to reform. [13] X Research source After the surgery, keep your pet in a quiet, closed-off area. Follow your vet’s after-care instructions; you may need to give your pup some special medication, or change their bandages regularly."

During surgery, a vet will physically remove the cysts and stitch your dog’s toes together while the area heals. With a CO₂ laser, your vet will vaporize the cysts without hurting the rest of the paw. For a more long-term treatment plan, vets might treat the cysts with steroids and antibiotics.

Hairless breeds, like the Chinese Crested Dog and Mexican Hairless Dog, may also develop follicular cysts since their hair follicles are so inactive.
