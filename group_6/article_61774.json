      "content": "Slide the poles together with the latches lined up. Swiffer WetJets come in 3 pieces. Line them all up, with the mop on the bottom, the pole with the handle on top, and the third piece in the middle. You should hear a click when they slide together. [1] X Research source Once the poles are assembled, it’ll be pretty difficult to disassemble them."

      "content": "Slide open the battery compartment and put in 4 AA batteries. The battery compartment isn’t immediately accessible. You have to open it up by pushing up on the battery tab on the front middle section of the base. Slide the tab upwards, so that the battery compartment slides out of the WetJet base. Then, insert 4 new AA batteries. [2] X Research source If you just bought the WetJet, it should come with batteries that you can put in."

      "content": "Attach the pad print-side down. Don’t remove the plastic layer on the back of the cleaning pad. Many people make this mistake, but it actually messes up the cleaning pad. Just put the print side down onto the bottom of the cleaning pad, and it will stick by itself.

      "title": "Use the WetJet on finished hardwood, ceramic, vinyl, or laminate floors.",
      "content": "Use the WetJet on finished hardwood, ceramic, vinyl, or laminate floors. The WetJet will work well on most kinds of floors, but you shouldn’t use it on unsealed wood floors or carpeted floors. If you’re not sure whether your wood floors are sealed, drip a few drops of water in an inconspicuous part of your floor. If the floor absorbs the water, your floor isn’t sealed, but if the drop stays sitting on top of the floor, it is sealed. [5] X Research source Instead of using the WetJet, clean carpeted floors by vacuuming them and unsealed wood floors by sweeping them."

Get all the excess dust and hair off your floor, so that your mopping can focus on the hard-to-remove spills and stains.

Put the shammy over the bottom of the Swiffer pad and wrap the extra width on top so that you can tuck the fabric into the Swiffer.
