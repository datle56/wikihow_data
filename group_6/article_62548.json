They’ll send the money (minus any penalties) to whatever account you’ve designated on the form.

      "content": "Expect a 10% penalty if you withdraw before 59 ½. If your account is over 2 years old and you’re under 59 ½, you will pay a 10% penalty as well as pay income taxes on the money you withdraw from your SIMPLE IRA. This penalty will be automatically removed by your plan manager when you withdraw. [5] X Research source For example, let’s say you take out $3,000 and your tax rate is 22%. After the 10% penalty is applied (which is $300 on a $3,000 withdrawal), you will receive $2,700. Your 1099 or W-2 will say you made $3,000 more on top of your normal income. At 22%, that $3,000 will lead to $660 in additional taxes. Thus, your total return from the $3,000 withdrawal will be $2,040."

If you haven’t had (and contributed to) the SIMPLE IRA for more 2 years, that 10% early withdrawal penalty shoots up to 25%. The withdrawal will be treated as taxable income at the end of the year. The two year period is calculated from the first day that your employer deposits into your SIMPLE IRA. So, let’s say you take out $3,000 and your tax rate is still 22%. The 25% penalty will take $750 off of the top, so you’ll have $2,250 to spend as you see fit. At the end of the year, your tax bill will be $3,000 higher, leading to $660 in additional taxes. As a result, your overall return on the withdrawal will be $1,590."

The specific state by state rules are pretty complex, but know that some US states will automatically take a percentage of your early withdrawal. They do this because withdrawals are taxable income, and they may take a chunk of what you’ll eventually owe them come tax season. [6] X Research source So, if you expected to receive $2,250 back and you only see $2,120 in your account, it’s likely that the state you live in took a piece out for your state income taxes. You won’t see any money taken out by your state if you live in AL, AK, AZ, CO, FL, HI, ID, KY, NV, NH, ND, OH, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, WA, or WY. Every other state has some kind of withholding process for early IRA withdrawals."

If you make a transfer to a different account, it is considered a withdrawal. In this case you will be required to include the amount in your gross income. You cannot transfer funds from a SIMPLE IRA to a Roth IRA or Roth 401k.
