      "content": "Selecting the best image is important for a great Depth Effect lock screen. Use the following tips to pick the best lock screen wallpaper to use with Depth Effect: Pick an image that is a JPG/JPEG or HEIC. If you're using a photo you took on your iPhone , it's already an HEIC file, but if it's something you found online, you may need to convert it to a different filetype. Make sure your image has a clearly defined foreground. If not, Depth Effect might not work properly, and you won't get the best effect. Select an image with ample space for the clock widget. A great lock screen wallpaper has the subject in the middle or near the bottom of the image that overlaps just slightly with the clock widget, so you can get the full \"depth effect\" without sacrificing the ability to read your phone clock."
