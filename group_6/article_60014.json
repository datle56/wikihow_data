      "content": "Begin shooting. Press L1 / LB and use the right analog stick to change weapons. Press and hold the L2 / LT trigger to draw your weapon and it will lock on to a person (civilians, lawmen, and enemies can be targeted) and press the R2 / RT trigger to fire."

      "title": "Take cover.",
      "content": "Take cover. When you are close to an object e.g buildings, crates, you can take cover by pressing R1 / RT . This will prevent John from being shot and it will allow him to restore his health. You can also shoot from cover by using the Aim button and firing. Another method is to just press the fire ( R2 / RT ) button, this will allow no damage done to John but it will decrease the Accuracy of the weapon."

    {
      "title": "Fire on the move.",
      "content": "Fire on the move. Firing on the move is more difficult because you have less time to take aim and enemies will be moving and they're more likely to dodge your gunfire."
