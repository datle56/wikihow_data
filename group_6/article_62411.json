      "content": "They're feeling disappointed. This is another common reason why dogs sigh. Even if you’re done playing a game of fetch, your dog might not want to stop.

      "content": "They’re happy. You might notice your dog sigh at you after a thorough, leg kicking belly rub or a particularly great bowl of dog chow. This sigh means they’re feeling satisfied, just like how you might sigh after a refreshing sip of lemonade on a hot day. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "They’re bored.",
      "content": "They’re bored. Maybe it’s raining and you can’t take your dog on their usual run, or you're busy and can't give your dog all the attention they crave. On these days, you might find your dog sighing at you to show you they want something to do. [4] X Research source Buy your dog fun new toys , teach them new tricks, or take them to a dog park to keep them from feeling bored . If there are days you know you’re going to be busy, hire a dog walker to give your dog their much needed stimulation and exercise."

      "title": "They want your attention.",
      "content": "They want your attention. A sigh can be your dog's way of telling you they want more pets and scratches, or that they loved the treat you gave them so much that they think they deserve another. Your dog will look directly at you or the thing they want as they sigh. [5] X Research source Petting your dog or brushing them away when they sigh tells them that sighs get attention. If you want to break this behavior, ignore them and then give them a treat when they lie down or play with their toys quietly. However, if their sigh makes you realize that you haven’t played with them or taken them on a walk, be sure to do so!"

      "content": "They’re deep in sleep. You’ve probably seen your dog twitch their feet and whine when they’re sleeping, and a sigh is just another reaction to their dreams. Maybe they’re contentedly dreaming about the ear scratches you gave them right before bed. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "See if your dog is laying down or sitting up. A hard plop onto the floor followed by a sigh and their head resting on their paws usually means your dog is happy and relaxed. If your dog is sitting up or standing, their sigh most likely indicates they’re a little annoyed. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Look at your dog’s eyes.",
      "content": "Look at your dog’s eyes. If your dog is sighing as their eyes are half open or beginning to droop, they’re probably feeling content, happy, or tired. On the other hand, if their eyes are open and looking at you, they’re conveying their disappointment, boredom, or need for attention.

      "content": "Check if they’re relaxed or alert. It’s important to look at your dog’s whole demeanor to see what the sigh means. If your dog's ears are relaxed and their body is calm, the sigh means they’re at ease and peaceful. An alert position with ears perked up and head cocked can mean the sigh is disappointed or a request for attention. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Sighs and groans together can mean your dog is in pain. While sighs alone are normal, look for signs of discomfort like whining and moaning while your dog is laying down. They might have an upset stomach which makes laying down uncomfortable. If your dog is older, they could be feeling the pains of arthritis. [10] X Research source Make an appointment with your vet to see if the sighs mean something is bothering your dog."

      "content": "If your dog is sighing a lot, this can also mean they’re uncomfortable. It is easy to tell what your dog's sighs mean when they’re scattered throughout the day, but if your dog is sighing all the time, they might have a medical problem. Look for other pain cues like being lethargic or not eating before you call your vet."

If your dog is older and sighing is new behavior for them, make an appointment with your vet to get them checked out. [11] X Research source"
