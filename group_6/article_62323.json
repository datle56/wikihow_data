      "title": "He wants you to talk to him.",
      "content": "He wants you to talk to him. Sometimes, if a guy swipes up on an Instagram story or comments on a post with “Stunning,” he’s trying to flatter you to initiate conversation. If you don’t know him well, he may use “stunning” to start talking to you. He could also use “stunning” to start a conversation on a dating app, usually for the same reasons."

    {
      "title": "He thinks you look amazing.",
      "content": "He thinks you look amazing. “Stunning” is a less common compliment than “beautiful” or “pretty,” so there’s a good chance that you look absolutely incredible to him. If he seems shocked to see you or sees you across a room and can’t take his eyes off of you, he may find you very attractive. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He’s flirting with you.",
      "content": "He’s flirting with you. People often start flirting by giving the other person a high compliment. [2] X Research source If he doesn’t know you very well and approaches you by saying “You look stunning!” it can mean he’s attracted to you and wants to let you know. Other signs that he’s flirting are prolonged eye contact, body scanning (he looks you up and down), leaning in close, and physical contact."

    {
      "title": "He loves you.",
      "content": "He loves you. If you’re already in a relationship with someone who calls you stunning, he may be referring to more than your looks. Sometimes, compliments like “stunning” or “beautiful” also refer to your inner beauty, your character, and everything that makes him feel lucky to be with you. If he stops for a moment, lowers his voice, and seems relaxed (and awed at the same time), he may love you or care deeply for you. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Say thank you.",
      "content": "Say thank you. Saying thank you is always a great way to respond to compliments . [4] X Research source It shows the person that you heard them and you’re grateful for what they said. Some people find it hard to take a compliment, but just remember that this person believes what they said, and dismissing the compliment can make them feel bad."

    {
      "title": "Continue the conversation if you’re interested.",
      "content": "Continue the conversation if you’re interested. Give them a compliment, ask them a question, or comment on your situation. If it’s from a comment on something you posted, consider saying something about what you were wearing or doing in the post. You could bring up where the picture was taken, why you did a certain pose, or why you chose the outfit that you wore."
    },
    {
      "title": "Return the compliment and flirt back.",
      "content": "Return the compliment and flirt back. If it’s online, text him something like “okay but you though..🫣” or “omg coming from you 😳.” If it’s in person, flirt by smiling, making eye contact, touching his arm, or giving him a compliment, like “handsome.” You can also respond playfully, as long as it’s clear you’re being sort of jokey. You could say something like “You don’t look too bad yourself, handsome.”"

    {
      "title": "End the conversation if you're not interested.",
      "content": "End the conversation if you're not interested. If someone DMs you: “You look stunning,” you don’t have to respond to them, especially if you don’t know them. If you feel it’s not genuine—or you’re just not feeling it—just ignore the message. If a guy compliments you in person, just say \"Thanks\" and walk away if you're not interested."
