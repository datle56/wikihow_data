[1] X Research source Use strong plastic baggies made specifically for the freezer, so they don't break when the water freezes into ice. Depending on what area of your shoe you're trying to stretch, the amount of water used fill the baggies with will differ: Toe : 1/4 of the way with water Toe and instep : 1/2 of the way with water Toe, instep, and ankle area : 1/2 - 1/3 of the way with water"

This will help keep the bag from popping in the freezer, allow all the water to fill out the shape of the shoe without bubble pockets, and make inserting the bags into the shoes easier.

      "title": "Remove the bags of ice.",
      "content": "Remove the bags of ice. Let your shoes sit at room temperature for 20 minutes before you try and take out the bags of ice. Allowing the ice to thaw will make it easier to remove the baggies. After allowing the baggies to thaw, if the bags of ice still won't come out of your shoes, you can try waiting longer for most of the ice to melt, or try to break the ice and then remove the bags. These two alternatives are better than pulling on the baggies, ripping them, and then having open bags of water and ice in your shoes. The water could potentially damage your shoes."
