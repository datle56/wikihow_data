No need to break out the blender—in the 1940s, daiquiris weren't served frozen. Instead, they were simply made by mixing 1 1 ⁄ 2 fl oz (44 ml) of light rum, 3 ⁄ 4 fl oz (22 ml) of lime juice, and 1 ⁄ 2 fl oz (15 ml) of simple syrup. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Look up recipes for foods that were common in this time. During the war, food rations meant that it was sometimes hard to get things like eggs, meat, and butter. That meant cooks had to get creative to serve up nutritious and tasty food for their family, and you can do the same thing for your guests. If you're having a full meal, set out a buffet with classic foods like meatloaf, Spam, mashed potatoes, potato salad with hot dogs, coleslaw, egg salad, and brown bread. If you'd rather serve finger foods, opt for things like assorted sandwiches, scones or spiced biscuits with jam, cheese and potato dumplings, vegetable turnovers, sausage rolls, and potato cakes. [5] X Research source Include a few sweets, as well—boxed cake mixes were popular, as were Jell-O salads, applesauce, coconut cream pie, and molasses cookies.

Feel free to get creative with other popular images from the time, like private eye movies or pin-up girls—look up photographs and ads from the time for even more ideas! Consider picking a party date with historical significance, like the end of the war in Europe (May 8) or the premiere of the film Casablanca (November 26)."

      "content": "Set up a projector to feature your footage. Truly capture the 1940s with authentic footage from the time. Use clips from Hollywood movies, newsreels, and commercials. You can find a wealth of footage in the public domain from this period online—at sites like the UK's National Archive site, the Internet Archive, and even YouTube. Edit the footage to create a montage of 1940s clips to play on loop the day of your party. If you need help editing the film, search for online tutorials or check out the media help desk at your nearest public library. On the day of your party, project the footage onto a wall or white sheet. Alternatively, you can use a large screen or television, but a projected video will appear grainier, so it'll have a more historic look. You probably want to set the footage on silent, so guests can converse with one another and enjoy other music or entertainment."
