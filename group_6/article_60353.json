      "content": "Commenting on their Story shows that you’re interested in their life. Using Snapchat’s Stories is a great way for people to show their friends what they’re up to – and a great way for you to get a conversation going! Pay attention to what they say so you can ask for updates along the way. For example, if they say they’re going to a movie with a friend or to dinner with their family, this gives you the opportunity to show that you care about them and ask how it all went afterward. “Where are you vacationing? That view is incredible 😍” “I love that band too! What’s your fav song?” “That’s my favorite restaurant! Have you tried their (insert food item)?” Reader Poll: We asked 320 wikiHow readers how they prefer to slide into their crush’s DMs, and 56% of them agreed that the best way to do so is by responding to their story with an emoji or quick reaction. [Take Poll] Then, continue the conversation by asking an open ended question about their post."

Plus, sharing common passions and viewpoints can build up familiarity and create a sense of safety in your relationship. Try not to send them a bunch of random links. Keep it simple, and add your own thoughts in a separate message to start or continue the conversation. [11] X Research source"

[13] X Research source You can even ask your followers what they think about your picture in the captions to prompt your crush to message you first! Post a video of you playing guitar, dancing, or hanging out with friends to show your crush what you do in your spare time. Have an embarrassing picture of you at your cousin’s birthday party?

Switch topics when natural, text them about school or homework, ask them about their family, and slowly get more personal as time goes along. Texting long-term early on in the courting stage can mean you miss out on your crush’s tonality and body language. When your conversations get more romantic, don’t be afraid to make a move and take your relationship to the real world! When you’re feeling confident and ready, suggest having coffee, studying together, or going to a movie."

If you keep snapping them without getting a response, they might feel intimidated and avoid responding back altogether. [14] X Research source Try to keep your responses casual and step back a little if they seem unresponsive. If you’re not sure how to respond to something your crush sends, take your time! You don’t have to respond instantly, and it can even be better to take it slow and carefully craft a better response."
