NVIDIA cards released before the NVIDIA GTX 10 series have a locked voltage and cannot be undervolted (at least not with the standard undervolting tools). Newer NVIDIA cards, including the NVIDIA RTX series, can be undervolted."

You should see the GPU stats in the upper-left corner of the screen as you play. Write down the stats, particularly the voltage and core clock refresh rate. The display in the upper-left corner displays your GPU's core temperature (in Celsius), the percentage of the GPU being used, the GPU core clock (MHz), the GPU power draw (in watts), the GPU voltage, and the framerate (FPS). If you don't see the GPU stats in the upper-right corner. Press the key you assigned to the on-screen display toggle in Afterburner. Some laptops don't support voltage monitoring. If your laptop doesn't display the voltage, don't worry. Just write down the core clock refresh rate. You can find out your voltage later. Alternatively, instead of playing a game, you can use a benchmark program, like Heaven Benchmark , which is used when overclocking or fine-tuning your hardware."
