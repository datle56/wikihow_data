      "title": "Clean your bathtub.",
      "content": "Clean your bathtub. Your tub can get surprisingly dirty for a place that’s supposed to keep you clean. So, take a few minutes to clean your bathtub with a bleach-based cleaning product , a natural alternative like vinegar or baking soda, or bleach. This ensures that your tub is sterile and safe to soak your injured tissue in. Scrub the tub thoroughly with your cleaner of choice to remove soap scum and other debris from your bath products. Rinse your tub with water to remove the cleaning product and any debris."

      "title": "Fill the bathtub with 3-4 in (7.6-10 cm) of warm water.",
      "content": "Fill the bathtub with 3-4 in (7.6-10 cm) of warm water. Run the water in your bath until it comes out warm, but not uncomfortable or scalding hot. Then, plug the drain and fill up your tub until the water is about 3 to 4 inches (7.6-10 cm) deep. You only need enough water to cover your anus, genitals, and perineum (the area of skin between your anus and genitals). As you run the water, dip in your finger or place a few drops on the sensitive skin on your wrist to test the temperature and see if it’s comfortable. Keep the water around 104° F (40° C) to ensure it’s warm but not too hot. Very hot water can potentially burn your skin or further irritate and inflame the area you’re treating. Some doctors recommend using cool water, so always follow your healthcare provider’s instructions."

      "title": "Mix salt or medicine into the water if directed to by your doctor.",
      "content": "Mix salt or medicine into the water if directed to by your doctor. Depending on what you’re treating, your healthcare provider might instruct you to add salt or another medicinal additive to the water to help relieve your symptoms. Simply follow their directions for adding the product. If your doctor did not provide you with additives, just use plain water. Warm water is all you need to ease your pain, increase blood flow to the injured area, and speed up your body’s healing process. [1] X Research source Talk to your doctor about adding salt or another soothing additive to your bath to ensure it won’t irritate or inflame the affected area."

    {
      "title": "Soak the affected area in the water for 10 to 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the affected area in the water for 10 to 20 minutes. Carefully step into your bathtub and sit down in the warm water. Adjust your body to ensure the entire area you’re treating is covered, such as bending your knees or leaning against the side of the tub. Then, simply sit in the warm water for 10 to 20 minutes. It’s normal to feel some pain when you first sit in the water. After some time, the pain should ease and go away. [2] X Research source Add more water to the tub as needed to keep the temperature warm and comfortable."

      "title": "Pat yourself dry with a soft, clean towel.",
      "content": "Pat yourself dry with a soft, clean towel. Get out of the tub carefully in case you feel lightheaded, holding on to the edges of the tub or asking a caregiver for help. Then, grab a clean towel and gently pat your genitals and anus dry. Do not rub the area, as your damaged tissues are very sensitive. Rubbing or scrubbing the area dry can cause further irritation, inflammation, and injury. If instructed to by your healthcare provider, apply any ointments or dressings on top of the area after drying it. Take 3 to 4 sitz baths each day, or as often as your doctor recommends."

      "title": "Clean the sitz bath basin.",
      "content": "Clean the sitz bath basin. A sitz bath basin is a large bowl that you fit over a toilet seat and fill with water. Whether you’ve used your sitz bath basin already or it’s new out of the package, sanitize it to ensure you’re not exposing your anus or genital areas to bacteria and possible infection. Simply spray the basin with a bleach-based cleaning product , scrub it well with a sponge, and then rinse it out with water. Some sitz bath kits include a plastic bag and tube that you use to spray water onto the affected area and a solution that you add to the water."

      "content": "Assemble the sitz bath kit if it has a plastic bag and tube. Run the plastic tube that’s attached to the plastic bag through the hole at the front of the sitz bath basin. Then, snake the tube to the center of the basin and secure it inside the clip at the bottom of the bowl. [3] X Research source If you can’t find the hole or where to clip on the tube, consult your kit’s instructions manual."

      "title": "Fill the basin or plastic bag with warm water.",
      "content": "Fill the basin or plastic bag with warm water. If your sitz bath kit just came with the basin, add in enough warm water to cover your perineum, or the area between your anus and genitals. This is usually about 3 to 4 inches (7.6-10 cm) of water. If your kit comes with a plastic bag and tube, place the flow clamp attached to the tube in the “Off” position. Then, fill the plastic bag with warm water. Set the plastic bag on a counter next to the toilet or hang it up. Just ensure that the bag is higher than the toilet so the water flows down the tube. Use your finger to test the water before you fill the basin or bag to ensure it’s warm but not hot. The optimal water temperature is around 104° F (40° C). If instructed by your healthcare provider, add salt or another soothing solution to the bowl or bag after filling it with water. Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions if they tell you to use cool water instead of warm."

      "title": "Sit on the basin, unclamping the plastic tube if you have one.",
      "content": "Sit on the basin, unclamping the plastic tube if you have one. Carefully lower yourself onto the sitz bath basin, adjusting your position until you feel comfortable. If your kit comes with a plastic bag and tube, turn the flow clip to the “On” position to release the water into the basin. The water sprays directly onto your perineum and then catches in the bowl, allowing you to soak in the water. When you first sit in the water or spray yourself, you might feel some pain. After being exposed to the water for several minutes, the pain should go away. If the spray feels uncomfortable on your perineum, turn the clamp to the “Off” position, unhook the tube from the bottom of the basin, and then simply let it hang inside the basin."

Apply any creams or ointments onto the affected area as directed by your doctor. Use the sitz bath basin 3 to 4 times each day, or as often as your healthcare provider tells you to."

      "content": "Sitz baths clean and heal damage to the anus, genitals, and perineum. The warm water of the sitz bath increases blood flow to your perineum area which helps relax your muscles, soothe pain and irritation, and speed up healing. Your doctor might recommend this bath to: Relieve hemorrhoid pain and irritation. Ease anal fissure pain. Soothe discomfort after childbirth or an episiotomy. Relieve prostate pain from prostatitis. Ease menstrual cramps. Soothe the area after surgery. Cleanse the area if you can’t directly bathe it."

Taking a sitz bath is a non-invasive way to treat anal, genital, and perineum discomfort, meaning you don’t have to deal with the risks of taking medications or getting surgery. The bath is also effective at healing pain and irritation stemming from hemorrhoids, anal fissures, childbirth, and other causes.

If you notice increased redness, swelling, or discomfort, stop taking the baths immediately and visit your healthcare provider.
