      "content": "OTP sometimes means “One Time Password.” Nowadays, many companies use “one time passwords” as a way to boost security for their users. These 6-digit numbers are sent by an automated system as a part of 2-factor authentication, which prevents hackers and criminals from hijacking a user’s account and stealing their info. [4] X Research source You might get a text like “Your OTP is: 123456. It expires in 10 minutes. Don’t share this code with anyone.”"

I just started and Shepherd/Alenko is totally my OTP lol”"

Let your friend know your thoughts on their OTP, and share your own OTP if it’s different from theirs. Just remember to keep it friendly! Them: “Fenris/Hawke is honestly the best ship in the entire Dragon Age franchise. True OTP material right there” You: “That’s so valid! I’m honestly more of an Inquisitor/Cullen shipper myself, though 😂” Them: “Just started Merlin and I can already tell that Merlin/Arthur is gonna be my OTP lol” You: “Same!!!

If someone uses “OTP” to share that they’re on the phone, you don’t really have to reply right away—just wait to send them a message later. Texts that include a “One Time Password” are always automated, so you don’t have to reply to them, either. If you want, you can shoot a quick “Okay!” or “Sounds good” message in response to an “On The Phone” message."

      "content": "OTP can occasionally stand for “One Trick Pony.” A “One Trick Pony” is a fancy way of saying that someone specializes in one skill or talent and isn’t very well-rounded. OTP doesn’t usually refer to this in casual conversations, but it really depends on the context. You: “He’s my favorite player on their football team!” Them: “Eh. He’s all right, but he’s kind of a OTP” You: “Did you catch The Voice last night? John was awesome!” Them: “He’s definitely talented, but his music selection makes him seem like a OTP”"
