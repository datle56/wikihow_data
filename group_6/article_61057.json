      "content": "Use leather or waxed cotton cord . Look for cord that is 1 to 2 millimetres (0.0 to 0.1 in) in width so it is just thick enough to knot. [1] X Research source Pick the cord color based on the pendant or beads being used for the necklace. For instance, a darker-colored cord will make a pendant or beads stand out more."

      "content": "Make sure the necklace cord is at least 48 inches (121.9 cm) long. [2] X Research source A necklace with slip knots has to fit over your head and sit nicely around your neck. You need a minimum 24 inches (61.0 cm) of cord to fit the necklace over your head. Doubling the length of the cord ensures thereâ€™s enough cord to make the knots. Add more cord if you want the necklace to sit lower around your neck. [3] X Research source Triple the normal amount of cord if you want the knots to sit close together on the necklace."

      "content": "Check where you want the necklace to hang. Before tying a slip knot, hold the ends of the cord together and slide it over your head to confirm you can put it on easily. Then, make sure it sits at a preferred spot around your neck. Keep in mind it will be nearly half its length once you tie the slip knots."

      "content": "Lay the necklace on a flat surface. Place the ends of the necklace on top of the cord, doubling the cord to form 2 layers. Make sure the pendant or beads are at the center of the cord. The ends should run straight up from the pendant or beads. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Try on the necklace and adjust it as needed. Once both slip knots are tied, put the necklace over your head and let it sit on your neck. Place a finger over the slip knot and use your other hand to slide the knot up or down to make the necklace longer or shorter. Check that both knots sit evenly so the necklace is straight around your neck. [13] X Research source Try wearing the necklace at different lengths by pulling the slip knots up or down. Have fun by wearing it low or high based on your outfit or mood for the day."
