      "content": "Your partner isn’t remorseful. After such a betrayal, the least your partner can and must do is sincerely apologize. If they don't say they're sorry, or if they seem to think one apology will resolve the issue, it could be a sign they don’t respect your feelings about the situation. Moving forward from infidelity requires that the cheating partner be sorry for their actions and seek to make amends. [1] X Research source Your partner must not only apologize, but it must be sincere. A sincere apology will focus on their behavior, rather than on your feelings about their behavior (e.g., “I’m sorry I cheated” instead of “I’m sorry you feel hurt”). [2] X Research source"

But if you’re the only one putting in work to repair the relationship , consider that it may not be worth repairing. Putting in the work involves taking the lead: if your partner is only working on the relationship at your insistence, it may be a sign to step back from the relationship."

If your partner refuses to end things with the person they cheated with, it’s not necessarily a sign they’re going to cheat again—but it’s a very definitive sign they don’t respect your feelings. A cheater partner who is determined to repair their relationship will cut ties with the person they had an affair with. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In specific circumstances, it may not be feasible for your partner to cut off all ties with the person they cheated with—for instance, if it’s a coworker and they can’t get a new job. Still, your partner must limit contact as much as possible. In relationships where one person has betrayed the other’s trust, the hurt partner may ask the cheater for open access to their phone, email, and social media to be sure they’re not still in contact with the person they cheated with.

If your partner lies about their whereabouts, hides their phone, or participates in any other dishonest activity after cheating, it may be a sign they aren’t committed to reforming.

Sometimes it’s hard to see the forest for the trees—in other words, you may have a hard time seeing the reality of your relationship, and an outside perspective can help you gain some clarity on the big picture.

If you and your partner were considering ending things before they had an affair, it's possible the infidelity was a symptom of a larger problem and a sign that your relationship may have an expiration date. Remember, just because your relationship may have already been in danger, it doesn't mean your partner was \"right\" to cheat. There's no excuse for infidelity. If your relationship was already rocky, it's not an automatic sign you and your partner need to break up: instead, your partner's infidelity could be a wakeup call that the relationship needs some attention in order to thrive."

Breaking up will have a massive effect on your children’s day-to-day lives. It may mean they see one or both of you less regularly, or they have to split their time between 2 homes. That said, your children will be OK if you do opt to end the relationship, and in some cases, they may be better off in the long run if your relationship or marriage really isn't healthy.

Whether it’s with your partner or your support system, talking through the infidelity is essential to helping you heal—but at a point, talking can become dwelling, and dwelling may hinder the healing process. Try to restrict the amount of time you spend talking or thinking about the affair and make an attempt to avoid reliving the infidelity. It's a kindness to yourself: you don't need to keep the wound open. Let it heal. Consider inviting people in your support group to let you know if they feel you're ruminating and if they think you could benefit from taking a break from the subject. Try to set aside 20 minutes a day to think about the affair. When you find yourself ruminating outside of this 20-minute period, accept that you’re dwelling and try not to be too hard on yourself. Try to distract yourself from your thoughts, or meditate to practice being more mindful and to keep your thoughts from racing . [13] X Research source Limiting time to dwell isn't just healthy for the offended party, but for the person who cheated, as well. If they're committed to making amends for their behavior, they may suffer with extreme shame and guilt. Meditation and distraction can help them overcome their own tendency to ruminate."
