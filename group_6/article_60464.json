      "content": "Take a deep breath. An excess of adrenaline can cause your body to shake, especially if something has scared you and caused your fight or flight response to kick in. This shaking will probably be most noticeable in your hands and legs. If you find that you are shaking as a result of fear or nervousness, the best thing that you can do is take a deep breath.
