      "content": "VALL-E is not available to the general public—yet. VALL-E was created by Microsoft following other popular AI models, such as ChatGPT and Bing Chat. Whereas AI chatbots generate text responses to prompts, the unique VALL-E AI utilizes voice clips to convert text to audio that can simulate the sample's voice. Currently, there's no official release date for general public access, but this may change in the near future."

      "content": "VALL-E takes 3-second clip samples to recreate realistic voices. Once the AI learns the speech patterns and tone from the sample clips, it can replicate and synthesize the speaker's voice. This includes the speaker's tone and emotion. Microsoft has created this AI assuming that speakers have approved the usage of their voice. Users should never use another speaker's voice without their knowledge, as this can get them in legal trouble. [1] X Research source"
