      "content": "If you're separated by distance, you can still tell them how you feel. Text them asking if they would be available to talk on the phone. It's best to pick a time to talk so that your partner won't be busy when you call to share how you feel. Text them something like, \"I miss hearing your voice. Would you be free to talk on the phone this evening?\" Set up a video chat date, like eating dinner together in your respective homes. Then, say something like, \"I'm so happy I get to see your face even if we can't be together right now. I love you.\" [2] X Research source You can also tell them how you feel over voicemail for a romantic (and unexpected) gesture."

      "content": "This is a thoughtful way to tell your partner how you feel. Your gift doesn't even have to be expensive or grand.

To find the perfect poem, look online or parse through some poetry books at your local bookstore or library. Then, read it aloud or recite it to your partner when the two of you are alone.

You might try giving your mix a cute title, too, like \"Love Songs for Jen\" or \"Music for My Love.\" Your partner will probably be super flattered to receive such a thoughtful collection of songs, and it'll show them just how much you adore them. If you're having trouble picking love songs, add a few tracks that have sentimental value in your relationship. You might try a song that was playing on your first date or a track by your partner's all-time favorite artist."
