      "title": "Wear modest, semi-formal clothes.",
      "content": "Wear modest, semi-formal clothes. Baptisms are sacred, religious events that are usually held in a church, so it’s important to dress respectfully and not too casually. As a good rule of thumb, dress in your “Sunday best,” or clothes that are appropriate for a regular church service. Think tailored trousers, button-down shirts, long dresses or skirts, and dressy, closed-toe shoes. [1] X Research source If you’re not religious, dress in a “smart casual” outfit appropriate for the office or a conference. This also includes slacks, collared shirts, blazers, and long dresses or skirts."

      "title": "Choose clothing in light or pastel colors.",
      "content": "Choose clothing in light or pastel colors. Light colors are perfectly acceptable to wear to a baptism, as they help symbolize the baptismal themes of purification and new beginnings. Feel free to wear white and pastels in red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and pink. [2] X Research source Black and dark colors are also perfectly appropriate to wear to a baptism. Since these hues can be associated with more formal or subdued events, like funerals, try to accessorize with light or pastel colors. Patterns are also acceptable to wear at baptisms, like florals, plaids, stripes, and polka dots."

Also respect their cultural customs about dressing, such as ensuring you’re showing minimal skin. [3] X Research source For instance, Catholic baptisms tend to be more formal than other Christian baptisms. So, a suit or dress pants and a dress shirt might be more appropriate than a polo and khakis."
