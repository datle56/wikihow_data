      "content": "TTYT is an abbreviation that stands for “Talk to you tomorrow.” It’s often used in text messages as an informal goodbye. “Talk to you tomorrow” implies that you can no longer talk at the moment, so it generally signals the end of a text message exchange (or an exchange on social media). “Ttyt! I’ve really gotta get some beauty sleep 🥱💤” “So happy we got to chat today! TTYT? 😄”"

It’s common to use TTYT when you have something more pressing to do, whether that means work, studying, eating a meal, or just heading to bed for the night. Include TTYT in a message when you have to go—and, if you want to, briefly explain why you can’t keep talking. [1] X Research source “Ahh! I lost track of time, and I really have to go. 🫨 TTYT!” “I’m about to go to dinner with the fam, so I’ll ttyt! 🤩”"

When you ask someone “TTYT,” it gives them a chance to tell you when they’re free to talk (or if they’re busy). “I’d really love to continue this, but I’ve gotta run. TTYT?? 🥺🙏” “Got some stuff to do today—ttyt instead? 😊”"

When someone uses TTYT to tell you they have to go, the polite thing to do is simply say “Goodbye.” If you like, you could also tell them you’re looking forward to talking again or wish them a great rest of their day.

On the other hand, if you’ll be free and want to talk, you could tell them when the best time would be—or ask them to tell you when they'll be able to talk. Them : “Let’s continue this later! Ttyt?” You : Yeah! I can talk anytime after 3 pm. Just let me know what’s good for you! 😋”"

      "title": "Talk to you tonight",
      "content": "Talk to you tonight “Talk to you tomorrow” is the most common meaning for TTYT, but some might use it to say “Talk to you tonight” instead. The only distinction between the two is that “Talk to you tonight” means someone plans to talk to you later in the evening on the same day, while “Talk to you tomorrow” means they won’t talk to you again until the next day. [3] X Research source Them : “I’m heading out to run an errand now—ttyt! 🏃” You : “No problem! Looking forward to tonight! 😉” It may be hard to tell if someone means, “Talk to you tomorrow” or “Talk to you tonight” based on the acronym alone. If you’re unsure and need to know what they meant, just ask for clarification! Or, if you prefer, write “tonight” in your reply; if they correct you, you’ll know they meant “tomorrow” instead."

On the other hand, “Talk to you tomorrow” is used to make loose plans to talk the following day. Them : “Let’s talk this Saturday. Can I call around 6 pm?” You : Totally! TTYT! 😁” You can usually tell when someone means “Talk to you then” because they’ll already have agreed to a date and time before using the acronym."

TTYL is even more popular than TTYT, although it’s broader and more vague (since “later” doesn’t necessarily indicate a day or time). You might use TTYL to tell someone you’ll text them again soon without making concrete plans; it could refer to hours, days, weeks, or even longer.
