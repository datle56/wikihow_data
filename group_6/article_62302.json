    {
      "title": "Send a personalized text letting them know you remember them.",
      "content": "Send a personalized text letting them know you remember them. You can lose contact with someone for a number of reasons, but that doesn’t mean you forget everything about them. If you used to work together, ask them how the company or your past boss is doing. If they talked about a new career the last time you spoke, bring it up. This will show them you still have an interest in their life. [1] X Research source “The last time we spoke, you’d just started a new job.” “How’s the new career path? You were so excited about it the last time we spoke.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "This is a perfect informal text to send to a friend.",
      "content": "This is a perfect informal text to send to a friend. Casual and quick, this text lets you acknowledge that you haven’t spoken in awhile and gives an open-ended question they can answer. Fingers crossed this will spark a conversation that leads to reconnecting with a long-lost friend. [2] X Research source Change up the message to fit your relationship with your friend. If you were on a team together, try something like, “It’s been forever! How’s the basketball season going?” If you used to work together, go for something like, “Long time no see! What’s new at the restaurant?”"

      "title": "Chances are you have a lot of good memories together.",
      "content": "Chances are you have a lot of good memories together. Bring these up when first texting them again, especially if they are a close childhood friend or relative.

We should get the whole gang back together soon!” “I pulled out our old yearbook and look how silly we are😂” Send them a pic with this text."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apologizing is a good way to reopen communication with them.",
      "content": "Apologizing is a good way to reopen communication with them. When you’re trying to reconnect with a friend, especially one you’ve fallen out with, it can be hard finding a reason to start a conversation. You don’t need a fancy reason. It can be as simple as an apology . Let them know why you’re contacting them to set the tone moving forward. [4] X Research source “I’m sorry for how things ended between us. I wish I could take back what I said.” “I was thinking about you the other night, and I’m sorry for letting you down.”"

    {
      "title": "Special occasions are low-pressure opportunities to reach out.",
      "content": "Special occasions are low-pressure opportunities to reach out. This text is a great way to send them a “Hey, I’m thinking of you” message without putting any pressure on them to respond. They may respond back enthusiastically and plan a day to catch up, or they might ignore the text—it’s worth a shot either way! [5] X Research source If it’s their birthday, try out, “Happy birthday🥳 Let’s not let another year go by without chatting.” If it’s Thanksgiving, go for something like, “Happy Thanksgiving! I know we haven’t talked in awhile, but I want you to know I’m so thankful for the memories. Let’s make some more soon!” If they just graduated, share in the excitement with something like, “I heard you graduated🎉 Congrats! I would love to hear about your future plans someday soon.”"

Maybe you’ve been thinking about them nonstop and want to reconnect. Let this text be a way for you to feel out the waters. If they’re in a relationship, maybe they text you back saying they have a partner. If they’re single and ready to mingle, maybe they send a flirty reply. “Can’t stop thinking about you these days!” “Missing that big smile of yours!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Reconnect with someone by mentioning their social media.",
      "content": "Reconnect with someone by mentioning their social media. A text centered around a recent social media post will let them know you’re paying attention to their feed and are curious about their life. If there’s something you used to do together, send them a message about a post centered around that interest. “I saw your post about opening a bakery. I’m so excited for you? When are you opening?” “Your post about remembering the past hit me hard. I would love to catch up someday soon😊” “I just saw your post. How does your food always look so good? Seriously, can you teach me to cook?”"

I’m so sorry !” “Can you believe I just now realized I never responded? Sorry about that🤦🏽”"

    {
      "title": "This is a nice way to make an emotional connection.",
      "content": "This is a nice way to make an emotional connection. Take a picture of a past art project, school building, or inside joke that’ll make them smile and be flooded with good memories. This is a fun way to spark a conversation. “Saw this and had to send it to you.” “Couldn’t not show you this🤣” If they respond, ask them how they’re doing to keep the conversation going."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make them wonder what you’re thinking with this message.",
      "content": "Make them wonder what you’re thinking with this message. Maybe you’re going about your day and something suddenly triggers a random flashback to time spent with this person. Even if you haven’t spoken to them in a while, don’t be afraid to reach out, especially if you want to rekindle a connection. This text will have them asking what your flashback was and can spark a delightful conversation full of nostalgia. “This is random, but I just thought of you. How are you?” “Heard Taylor Swift’s new song on the radio and immediately thought of you!”"

It’s been too long since we’ve talked.”"

      "content": "This text is great to send to an ex or friend you had a falling out with. When you haven’t spoken to someone in a long time, it can be easy to raise your expectations and daydream about what could have been. Lower your expectations and let them take control, steering the conversation in a direction they choose. With this text, there are no pressures whatsoever. [7] X Research source The key to reconnecting with people from your past is to lower your expectations. Reach out because you want to check-in with them, not to fulfill a fantasy. If they don’t want to catch up, that’s okay! Some relationships and friendships can’t be rekindled, so don’t be hard on yourself because you tried and that’s all you can do."
