      "content": "Choose your character(s). It's easier to pick people from a fandom (for example Harry Potter ) because then you don't have to describe them. If you want to write a prose one-shot you should use simple characters, but if you do and if you wanna write a description - keep it short. Going into details about your characters would be better suited for a chaptered story, so if you find yourself heading down this path, don't be afraid to break that \"one-shot\" up into chapters."
