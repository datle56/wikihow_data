      "title": "Wait 48 hours to watch the Highlight.",
      "content": "Wait 48 hours to watch the Highlight. If you watch an Instagram Highlight after it's been published for 48 hours or more, your view won't be counted, and the person who posted it won't know you've seen it. If you don't wait long enough, your account name will show up as \"Recently Viewed\" in the bottom left corner."

      "title": "Disconnect from the internet to watch Highlights anonymously.",
      "content": "Disconnect from the internet to watch Highlights anonymously. This doesn't always work, especially if the profile has a lot of Highlights, but you can try it on a profile with only a few Highlights posted. Go to the person's profile page and wait for the circle around their name to finish spinning. Once it stops, the Highlights have been loaded. Tap the Airplane Mode toggle in your Quick Panel (Android) or Control Center (iOS), then watch the Highlight."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch anonymously with a new account under a fake name.",
      "content": "Watch anonymously with a new account under a fake name. Create a new Instagram account with a different identity than your own. For example, create a \"Jane Doe\" account to watch Highlights without people knowing that it's really you watching them. You can see public Highlights, and if you've been accepted as a friend, you can also view private Highlights! This is probably the most thorough way to watch Highlights anonymously as long as you use a brand new email address when creating your account so it isn't tied to your personal account. Use a VPN or mobile data when viewing Highlights on Instagram to protect your data usage information."

    {
      "title": "Use a website like AnonStories, Mollygram, or InstaSuperSave.",
      "content": "Use a website like AnonStories, Mollygram, or InstaSuperSave. Sites like this don't require you to sign into your Instagram account, which compromises the security of your account. Simply enter the username of the account with Highlights you want to watch and download the resulting videos! However, you'll only be able to see highlights from public accounts. [1] X Research source These sites, however, are repeatedly unable to access Stories and Highlights due to Instagram's API coding updates. After an update, you most likely won't be able to use some websites and will have to find an updated one."

      "title": "Can you see who views your highlights?",
      "content": "Can you see who views your highlights? The usernames of people who've seen your Highlights only appear for 48 hours. If it's been fewer than 48 hours since you posted the Highlight, you'll see the usernames of people who watched it in the lower left corner. The only other way to see who saw your Highlight after 48 hours is by using a third-party app. However, using those apps is a high-security risk that could result in your account being hacked or banned."

      "title": "Can you see someone's highlights if they blocked you?",
      "content": "Can you see someone's highlights if they blocked you? No. If you've been blocked from viewing the Story, you cannot see that Highlight on your account. You can use tricks like using another account or watching the Highlight from a friend's phone to get around this."

      "title": "Can you see someone's Instagram highlights if they are private?",
      "content": "Can you see someone's Instagram highlights if they are private? Not reliably. Some online tools claim that they can anonymously view public and private Highlights, but that's not always the case."
