She's a very social person and you'll rarely have her all to yourself, even if you end up in a committed relationship. Aquarius women also try to avoid uncomfortable situations at all costs, so if she shies away from spending alone time with you, it might also be that she just doesn't quite feel comfortable around you yet."
