      "content": "Yes, in the long run, creatine can help you burn belly fat. Creatine gives you more energy to work out. It also helps protect and strengthen your muscles during workouts, which can help you build more muscle mass—which will make your stomach leaner over time. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source During the loading phase (a period of time—usually a week—in which you take a high dose of supplements to saturate your system), creatine can lead to water retention, bloating, and even weight gain. The water retention and bloating will fade as you drop your daily creatine intake."

There’s no exact amount of creatine you “should” take during the loading phase (a.k.a., a week or so in which you take a high dose of supplements to saturate your system). However, experts recommend taking .3 grams per kg of body weight a day for about a week, or roughly 20-25 grams a day. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Take 3-5 grams at a time at different times of the day (most people take creatine right before and/or after a workout). Taking too much at once could cause digestive issues such as diarrhea or stomach pain.

Some athletes and bodybuilders may still take 20 or more grams a day, but this isn’t necessary for most people to get results. [5] X Research source When dropping your creatine intake or if you stop taking supplements, prepare for some fatigue and a loss of muscle mass as your body adjusts to having to make more of its own creatine again.

It's always important to hydrate , but creatine acts like a sponge: it sucks water into and around your cells and causes similar effects to dehydration. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try to get about 300-500 ml of water along with every 3-5 gram serving of creatine. Staying hydrated can also boost your metabolism and keep you feeling full, which can help you cut calories, which will help you lose belly fat."

Not getting enough sleep can leave you feeling foggy, irritable, unmotivated, and low on energy—which will make it hard to work out, no matter how much creatine you’ve taken. Plus, being sleepy might make you reach for a second (or third) cup of coffee, and studies suggest caffeine can weaken the effects of creatine.

[9] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Try to make sure that 10-35% of your daily calorie intake comes from protein. For a 2000-calorie diet, that equates to about 50-175 grams of protein a day. To find out exactly how much protein you need based on your body type, you can enter your info into the USDA's DRI (dietary reference intake) app . Popular animal-derived proteins include turkey, chicken, beef, pork, fish, eggs, cheese, and yogurt. For plant-based proteins, go for almond milk, soy milk, tofu, seitan, tempeh, edamame, lentils, kidney beans, whole-grain cereal and bread, quinoa, and peanut butter.
