      "content": "The squonk started as lumberjack folklore in the early 1900s. Squonks first appear in William Thomas Cox’s 1910 book, Fearsome Creatures of the Lumberwoods . [1] X Research source Squonks are thought to have appeared in the hemlock forests of Pennsylvania during this time because it was the height of the state’s timber and hunting industry. In 1939, Henry D. Tryon published the book Fearsome Critters which hypothesized that squonks once lived in the high plains, but migrated to the swampy countryside. [2] X Research source The squonk’s scientific name, Lacrimacorpus dissolvens , comes from the Latin words for tear, body, and dissolve."

      "content": "The squonk has saggy skin with warts, moles, and webbed feet. Cox says that the squonk is a very unhappy creature with a low mental ability that always weeps over his ugly appearance. Tryon later described the squonk as having webbing between the toes on its left foot, causing it to swim in circles forever. [3] X Research source Tryon also says that fossil bones dredged from those lake bottoms reveal that thousands of squonks died of starvation because they couldn’t get back to shore. In the 2015 retelling of Tryon’s book by Hal Johnson, the squonk is a kind of pig with warts, cauliflower ears covered in wax and hair, and yellow crooked tusks."

      "title": "The squonk only travels at twilight and dusk.",
      "content": "The squonk only travels at twilight and dusk. On clear moonlit nights, the squonk moves slowly or lies still in its den to avoid catching a glimpse of its ugly appearance in illuminated bodies of water. It’s said that you can sometimes hear one weeping softly to itself through the night. [4] X Research source Some people believe that the squonk reproduces through binary fission, meaning its body splits into two new bodies."

      "content": "Squonks tend to dissolve into a pool of water when they’re caught. Not many people have been able to catch the mythical squonk—one hunter named J. P. Wentling was reported to have mimicked the weeping of the squonk and captured it in a bag. When he carried it home, the bag grew light, and when he looked inside, all that was left was a pool of tears and bubbles. [5] X Research source Other hunters who have tried to catch them have found out that these creatures dissolve completely into a pool of tears when they’re cornered."

      "content": "Follow the squonk’s trail of tears on clear nights in the Hemlock forest. If you’re an aspiring cryptid hunter, legend says that you can follow a squonk’s tear-stained trail to its hemlock home. [6] X Research source Since squonks dissolve when surprised or frightened, you may want to only attempt to capture the creature on film. You can also listen for its low-toned weeping under the boughs of the dark hemlock trees. [7] X Research source Some sources also say that hunters might be even more successful on cold nights when tears are shed slowly and squonks don’t like moving around. [8] X Research source"

Squonkapalooza is an all-ages festival that celebrates its home state cryptid, the squonk, along with other creatures of Appalachian folklore and cryptozoology. [9] X Research source The festival’s mission is to turn frowns upside down—who knows? Spreading a love of the squonk might cheer them up. There’s also a performing artist group from Pennsylvania called Squonk Opera. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Squonks have appeared in songs by rock bands like Genesis. Artists and musicians from Pennsylvania have embraced the legend of the squonk. “Any Major Dude Will Tell You” by Steely Dan contains the line, “Have you seen a squonk’s tears? Well look at mine,” and Genesis has an entire song called “Squonk.” Genesis’ song seems to follow J. P. Wentling as he tries to catch the squonk. The squonk also appears in video games like Final Fantasy XIV and in a cryptozoology-themed collectible card game called Metazoo."

In this 1964 book by Wallace Wadsworth, one of the loggers hears wailing in the woods, mimics its cry, and catches a squonk in his bag. However, when he opened the bag, there was nothing inside except salt water and bubbles. [11] X Research source In this account, the squonk is described as having red eyes, a long comical nose, and ill-fitting warty skin."
