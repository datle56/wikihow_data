      "title": "Think about what you want the story to be like.",
      "content": "Think about what you want the story to be like. You should sit back and let your imagination run wild. There are many ways to gather ideas for a story, be it inspiration from your life, the world around you, or the works of other film makers but it is important you think outside the box and try to bring something new to the world. Try your best to come up with an idea that you and others would enjoy, ensuring that is worth all the effort writing the script will entail. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide which elements of the story you want to write. If the plot to the movie is given to you already then build upon that."

      "title": "Build a story arc from scratch.",
      "content": "Build a story arc from scratch. If you want ideas then you should read a few books that have to do with the plot of the movie. This will give you an idea of what to write. Possibly the most important aspect of this step is ensuring that the frame of your story has no big conflicting story points or plot holes in it (unless put there intentionally *a dangerous move probably left to the professionals but if it works out, go right ahead*). This simple self criticism could save you hours if not days of hard work in the future trying to rework the tale so that it all makes sense later on when there are already details built upon the faults.

      "title": "Show your rough draft to people you trust for constructive criticism.",
      "content": "Show your rough draft to people you trust for constructive criticism. Have them read the draft and tell you what they like or don't like about it. This way you know what you can correct or what looks good."

      "content": "Write out some pages of your story as a sample to share. You should have this around as a sample to show people your work. This will give people you are working with an idea of how the story is coming along."

      "content": "Edit your story for clarity and length. After you are done with your story, you can check it over and over again for mistakes. If you have the income take your story to an editor and have him or her review your story. If you have a professional who can review your story for free then go ahead. [3] X Research source"
