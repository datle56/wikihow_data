Sure, some people prefer to plan ahead instead of deciding everything the day of—but it’s a red flag if they take this sense of control to an extreme. [2] X Research source A careful planner might try to arrange the date ahead of time, but is ultimately willing to compromise with you on where and when the date will be. Someone who behaves in a narcissistic way, on the other hand, has a lot of trouble handing the reins over to another person.

Sure, there’s nothing wrong with picking out a fun, stylish outfit when you’re meeting someone for the first time—but someone who tends toward narcissistic traits will take their outfits to an extreme. For example, you might be dressed in a fashionable but slightly casual ensemble while your date rocks a suit, gown, or another fancy outfit. These people truly take “dress to impress” to a whole new level. [4] X Research source Ultimately, someone with narcissistic qualities will want to create a great first impression by dressing up.

These issues manifest in a need for compliments and constant appreciation. [15] X Research source Of course, they won’t ask for compliments outright. Instead, they’ll make subtle comments, like: “I must look like such a mess. I put this look together in 10 minutes.” “I don’t think I’m pulling off this outfit very well.” In making these comments, they're hoping you’ll say something like “No, you look great!” or “No, you’re rocking that outfit!”"

See if your date chats about their previous partnerships, or what they’re hoping to get out of a new relationship. Their typical relationship might go through multiple “cycles” or phases: idealization , where they jack up the intensity of the relationship; devaluation , where they treat their partner like a second-class citizen; and discarding , where they either break-up or separate themselves from the relationship. If you’re on a date with someone who’s demonstrating narcissistic behaviors, they probably don’t have a great, long-term track record with their past partners. [19] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 August 2020. Most relationships that involve someone with narcissistic tendencies will follow this cycle. In some cases, the person will go back to the “idealization” phase to get their partner hooked back into the relationship. Keep in mind that getting out of a short relationship doesn’t automatically mean someone has narcissistic tendencies—and you should always avoid labeling someone as a narcissist unless they’ve been officially diagnosed.
