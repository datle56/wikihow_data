      "content": "Of course. “OFC” is just a simplified way for people to say “no problem,” “you’re welcome,” or “definitely” over text. It’s typically used as a quick reply to a question or comment. [1] X Research source Some people keep it lowercase (“ofc”), while some people choose to capitalize the “O” (“Ofc”)—it really comes down to personal preference! “Hey, can I vent to you for a sec?” ”Ofc you can!” “Could you tell Mike that I’ll be a few minutes late to rehearsal?” “Ofc!” “Is it cool if I copy your notes from class yesterday? I was out.” ”Ofc! Meet me before 3rd period and I’ll give you my notebook.”"

      "title": "Of f*cking course.",
      "content": "Of f*cking course. Well… “OFC” is an acronym, so the “F” has to stand for something. In especially sassy or sarcastic messages, the sender might include “OFC” as a spicy clapback. Don’t worry, though; 9 times out of 10, “OFC” just means “of course” without any expletive meaning. “LOL I just realized tysm stands for thank you so much” “OFC it does!”"

      "title": "You don’t really have to respond.",
      "content": "You don’t really have to respond. A lot of times, people say “OFC” as a synonym for “no problem” or “you’re welcome,” effectively ending the conversation then and there. If you’d like to keep the conversation going, feel free to change the subject or continue chatting about what you were originally talking about. You: “Thanks so much for the advice.” Them: “OFC!” You: “So, do you think you’re going to Claire’s party on Friday?”"

      "content": "Let someone know that you’re happy to help. Maybe a friend texted you asking you for advice, or a co-worker asked you for a quick favor. “OFC” is a great way to show your support and agreement quickly and efficiently. Them: “Could you give me a ride to school tomorrow?” You: “Ofc!”"

      "content": "Use it as an emphatic yes . “OFC” is a quick and easy way to express your agreement with someone or something. Friend: “I’m stopping by McDonald’s on the way to school. Do you want anything?” You: “Ofc! I’ll take a Big Mac and fries, pls” Friend: “You wanna hang out tonight?” You: “OFC! I’ll be over at 8.”"

      "content": "Say “OFC not” as an alternative to no . Maybe your friend wants your input on something, or your sister came up with a really silly idea. Give them your input with a well-timed “OFC not.” [2] X Research source Friend: “Do I look bad in this dress?” You: “OFC not!!” Sibling: “Hey, Jurassic Park is your favorite movie, right?” You: “Ofc not! Who told you that?”"

      "title": "Send it to your friends and close loved ones.",
      "content": "Send it to your friends and close loved ones. “OFC” works great in casual messages, and fits the relaxed vibe you probably have with your friends and siblings. [3] X Research source If you use other text abbreviations while chatting with someone (like “LOL” or “LMAO”), you’re probably safe shooting off “OFC” in a text, too. Use your best judgment when it comes to texting family members. A sibling, cousin, or tech-savvy parent will probably take “OFC” in stride, while a grandparent might be a bit confused by the abbreviation. Stick to formal language for professors, bosses, and other authority figures. “OFC” is a really casual message, and doesn’t belong in a work email or memo."
