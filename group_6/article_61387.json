      "content": "Snake the piping with a bent hanger for close-by clogs. If the clog isn't too far down the pipe, a hanger might work! Find a wire coat hanger, straighten it out, and bend the tip to a 90-degree angle using a pair of pliers. The length of the hook should be small enough to fit through the drain. Push the hooked end down the drain and into the piping as far as you can. Afterward, twist it and pull it upward. [3] X Research source Repeat the above process until you pull something out. If your drain has a basket strainer—the screen designed to catch foreign particles—remove it from below the sink with an adjustable wrench. For a more effective solution, rent or purchase a plumbing snake that you can feed into the drain to clear out any clogs.

      "content": "Dump a baking soda, salt, and hot water mixture into the piping. Mix 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of baking soda with 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of table salt. Stir the mixture with a spoon to ensure a consistent solution. Gently pour the mixture down the drain and let it sit in the piping for 10 to 20 minutes.

      "content": "Flush the piping with a mixture of vinegar and baking soda. Start by pouring a pot of boiling water down the drain. Afterward, mix 1 cup (240 mL) of vinegar with 1 cup (240 mL) of boiling water. Throw 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of baking soda into the drain and wash it down with your solution. Let the mixture bubble and sit for about 1 hour. [6] X Research source Run hot water into the piping for 30 seconds after letting the mixture sit."

If you have a wet/dry vacuum, turn it to the wet setting and use the highest suction possible. Hold it over the drain to the clogged piping and wait for something to come up. Be sure to cover the vacuum vent using a plastic bag or container to catch any particles that make it through the filer. Don't try this method with a machine that isn't designed for wet work! If nothing comes out, try pressing the nozzle of the vacuum into the drain as far as possible. [8] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019."

      "title": "Locate the clogged piping through trial and error.",
      "content": "Locate the clogged piping through trial and error. If one fixture is clogged and the trap is not clogged, the drain line from that fixture is likely the culprit. For example, if your sink is not working but the trap is cleared, the drain downstream from the sink is probably clogged. If there are multiple clogs, the clogged pipe is likely downstream from where they connected. Upper floor fixtures possess pipes that run under your home's flooring or downward to the basement. Look for floor drains to get a feel for where each pipe runs."

      "title": "Rent a drain-cleaning machine with a cable at least the length of the pipe.",
      "content": "Rent a drain-cleaning machine with a cable at least the length of the pipe. Either locate or estimate the location of the clog and measure the length from the clog to the cleanout plug. Head to a rental store and select a cable length long enough (ideally longer) to reach your clog. For small drain lines that are 1.5 to 3 inches (3.8 to 7.6 cm) in diameter, select a cable 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) in diameter. For larger piping, select a cable 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) in diameter."

      "title": "Remove the cleanout plug with an adjustable wrench.",
      "content": "Remove the cleanout plug with an adjustable wrench. Cleanout plugs are used to clean out your piping and are located in plumbing fixtures, leading away from your home, or in basement or garage floor drains. Regardless of where it is, have a bucket ready for the water that may drain out. Turn the square notch counterclockwise with your adjustable wrench. If you're having trouble, place a cold chisel to the corner of the square. Now, hit the handle with a hammer to get it going. [9] X Research source Never remove a cleanout plug or attempt to unclog a pipe that contains chemical drain cleaner. Apply penetrating oil to the cleanout plug to loosen it up. Wear leather gloves and safety glasses."

      "content": "Setup the machine 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.22 m) from the cleanout opening. Connect the machine to either a grounded outlet or a 12- to 14-gauge grounded extension cord. Always keep the motor switch in the \"Forward\" position prior to turning it on. Be sure you aren't wearing loose clothing, jewelry, or belts, and put on safety glasses and heavy duty leather gloves. [10] X Research source Place the foot-operated switch somewhere easily accessible so you can step on it while feeding the cable into the drain. Practice using the machine with the foot switch before trying to unclog the pipe. Always follow the instructions given with the equipment—these are powerful machines. Never wear cloth or rubber gloves—they can become caught between the coils of the drain-cleaning machine's cable."

      "title": "Feed the cable into the pipe slowly to locate the clog.",
      "content": "Feed the cable into the pipe slowly to locate the clog. Start by feeding the cable with the machine off until it doesn't go any further. Firmly hold the cable with both hands and start the machine's motor with the foot switch. Feed the cable into the pipe slowly while turning the motor on and off. Listen for the slowing of the motor and feel for an increase in the tension of the cable. Once you sense either change, stop immediately by taking your foot off the motor. [11] X Research source Never allow tension to build in your cable, which often happens when the cutting head hits an obstacle and stops turning."

      "title": "Turn the motor to \"Reverse\" to relieve tension from the cable.",
      "content": "Turn the motor to \"Reverse\" to relieve tension from the cable. After switching to \"Reverse,\" hit the foot switch and watch the cable cage for 3 to 4 revolutions. This will decrease tension that accumulated in the cable after contacting the clog. Now, switch the motor to \"Forward\" again to continue chewing through the clog. Proceed slowly and carefully to avoid the cable suddenly twisting around your arm. Only use the \"Reverse\" motor option when the cable will not go forward or to relieve tension when removing the clog."

      "title": "Chew through the clog slowly and carefully.",
      "content": "Chew through the clog slowly and carefully. After you reach the clog, tighten the lock bolt located above the region the cable leaves the machine. While holding the cable and making sure the machine is running on \"Forward,\" hit the foot switch. After it is depressed, loosen the lock bolt and wait for another 2 to 3 rotations of the cable. Now, retighten the lock bolt. Continue this process until the clog is removed."
