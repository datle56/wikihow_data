      "content": "Push on the brake, pull the choke out, and turn the key to start. You'll also have an easier time getting your mower to start up if the throttle is in the highest position. With your foot on the brake, pull out the choke knob to activate it. Turn the key to the right and hold it until you hear the engine fire up. Then, push the choke back in. [1] X Research source If you want to mow slowly, lower the throttle. If you'd like to mow quickly or you're cutting really tall grass, it's fine to keep the throttle high. The choke control is a system that temporarily adjusts the fuel and air going to the engine. This helps the mower start. It's important to push the choke back in so you don't dilute the oil or damage the combustion chamber of the engine."

      "content": "Shift the mower into low gear and steer it toward your lawn. Lift your foot from the brake pedal and use the shift lever to put the mower into low gear. Then, press the drive pedal until your mower is going as fast as you'd like—it's pretty much like steering the wheel of a car. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Engage the mowing blades and drive the mower across your lawn.",
      "content": "Engage the mowing blades and drive the mower across your lawn. When the mower is where you'd like to start mowing, stop driving and pull the blade engagement knob or flip the lever. This lowers the blades under the mower down to the lawn. Now all you have to do is drive the mower in the direction you'd like to mow. [3] X Research source Some models might call the blade engagement the \"power liftoff\" while others might just say, \"blade engage.\""

      "title": "Mow in straight lines back and forth so the lines overlap.",
      "content": "Mow in straight lines back and forth so the lines overlap. Although there's no one-size-fits-all to mowing, ride the mower across the length of your yard. Start on one side and mow your way to the opposite side by simply mowing in rows that overlap by a few inches. This way, you don't end up with patches of tall grass between your rows. [4] X Research source If you've got slopes or inclines, never mow across them—only mow up and down so the mower doesn't tip over. If your slope has an incline over 15 degrees, don't use your riding mower since it's more likely to tip. Plan on cutting the grass by 1/3 of its length so you don't put stress on the plant."

      "title": "Mow as close to the corner as you can and curve to a 90-degree angle.",
      "content": "Mow as close to the corner as you can and curve to a 90-degree angle. Then, back up straight to mow the corner and go straight again. You'll probably still have to use a trimmer to even out the corner. [5] X Research source Use a zero-turn riding mower to get perfect corners. Instead of using a steering wheel, a zero-turn mower has lap bars or levers that you can push or pull forward once you reach a corner. The mower turns on a dime so you can simply pull the lever to make a 90-degree turn. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Riding mowers can mow a large lawn faster than a push mower.",
      "content": "Riding mowers can mow a large lawn faster than a push mower. A lot of people find them easier to use since they're not walking and pushing the mower across the entire yard. Instead, riding mowers have comfortable seats, and operating one is like driving a car. Once you get used to it, you'll be able to quickly and efficiently mow your lawn. [7] X Research source Some riding mowers have high seats for extra back support. Fancy models might even have padded armrests with cup holders! If you want an even smoother ride, use a riding mower that has spring-coil shock absorbers below the seat."

      "title": "You may need to charge or replace the battery.",
      "content": "You may need to charge or replace the battery. If you haven't used your mower in months, your battery might just need a boost. Connect charging cables to your 12-volt battery and plug the cable into a wall outlet. This should charge the battery within 1 hour. [8] X Research source If the battery doesn't charge within 8 hours, it's probably time to get a new battery. [9] X Research source Always charge your battery before you stowing your mower at the end of the season."

      "title": "The fuel might be old and need to be replaced.",
      "content": "The fuel might be old and need to be replaced. If you stored the mower with gas in the tank, it might be old so it doesn't combust as easily. Carefully drain the gas into a fuel can and fill up the tank with fresh gas. [10] X Research source Dispose of the old gas at your local hazardous waste facility. You can also replace the fuel filter if you haven't changed it within the last season. A clean filter ensures that gas flows to the engine where it combusts."

      "content": "Clean out grass, dirt, and debris so it doesn't clog your mower. If you've been using your mower a lot or mowing really tall lawns, grass and debris can accumulate inside the mower. Take a leaf blower and blow out all of the dirt and debris. [11] X Research source Your mower may come with an attachment so you can power wash the inside of the mower."

      "title": "Check the air filter, oil, belts, and spark plugs every season.",
      "content": "Check the air filter, oil, belts, and spark plugs every season. Most riding mowers have a removable air filter on the side. Open the compartment and swap out the air filter when it looks dirty or clogged. Replace the oil once a season and swap out the mower belts if they look worn. Many manufacturers also recommend replacing the spark plugs once a season. [12] X Research source These are some of the most common maintenance steps you should take, but it's also a good idea to check your owner's manual for more specific maintenance. If you don't want to do the maintenance yourself, check with local hardware or tractor supply stores. They may offer maintenance services."
