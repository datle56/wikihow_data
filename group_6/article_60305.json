      "title": "You never know when you'll want to share God's word with someone.",
      "content": "You never know when you'll want to share God's word with someone. If your Bible is handy, you can easily flip to a certain verse so you can show the other person exactly what God says about whatever they're going through. You can also be a witness by simply studying your Bible on your lunch break and other quiet moments. [1] X Research source To save on space, carry a pocket-sized version of the New Testament or download a Bible app onto your phone."

      "title": "Proudly display Bible verses and religious phrases or symbols.",
      "content": "Proudly display Bible verses and religious phrases or symbols. For instance, you might wear a T-shirt with \"Jesus Saves\" on the front and John 3:16 on the back. You could also wear a cross necklace or a wristband with a Jesus fish on it if you prefer something more subtle. [2] X Research source You can decorate with Scriptures, too—try hanging vinyl stickers or framed prints in your home or office, for instance, or sketch them onto your school notebooks."

      "title": "Mention your beliefs when it fits into a conversation.",
      "content": "Mention your beliefs when it fits into a conversation. Don't be shy about telling others that you believe in God—it gives them an opportunity to ask you more about it if they're curious. However, you don't necessarily have to convince others to convert to your faith every time you bring it up. Instead, focus on letting the people around you know that God is an important part of your life. [3] X Research source For instance, if someone is talking about ghosts, you might casually say something like, \"I don't think we hang around after we die. I think our soul goes to be with God.\" It can also be even more subtle, like bowing your head to pray before you eat."

      "title": "Make recommendations based on what they like.",
      "content": "Make recommendations based on what they like. If there's a Christian band you're really into, don't keep it to yourself—share it with a friend who likes the same type of music you're into. Do the same if you see a really great movie that portrays a person of faith or a story from Scripture. If the other person isn't a believer, let them know they can talk to you if they have any questions later on. [4] X Research source A few popular Christian movies include The Passion of the Christ , Miracles from Heaven , Fireproof , and Letters to God . [5] X Research source For a faith-based page-turner, try books like the Coastal Guardians series by Dani Pettrey, The Gentleman Spy by Erica Vetsch, the Left Behind series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, and Stories that Bind us by Susie Finkbeiner. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Be specific about how God has worked in your life.",
      "content": "Be specific about how God has worked in your life. When you're connecting with others, look for opportunities to talk about how God has worked in your life. This can be especially helpful if you can relate to something they're going through. Explain that you haven't always been the person they see in front of you now, and talk about how you found God and the impact that had on you. [7] X Research source For instance, if you know someone who's struggling to get sober, it might be really powerful to them if you share your story of how God helped you overcome your addiction."

      "title": "Include some context so it will really stand out.",
      "content": "Include some context so it will really stand out. Social media gives us all the ability to reach more people than ever. However, it's also really easy to just scroll past posts without paying them much attention. Try posting a verse that's really special to you, and include a caption that explains how it applies to your life. That will make the message more personal, so it's more likely to make an impact on someone who sees it. [8] X Research source Try posting on a regular schedule, like once a day or every Friday. If you're using your social media to share God's word, be thoughtful about the other content you're sharing. For instance, your message won't be as meaningful if you're also sharing crude memes or inappropriate photos."

      "title": "Join a group in your area that collect and distribute Bibles.",
      "content": "Join a group in your area that collect and distribute Bibles. If your church doesn't have a ministry that hands out Bibles, see if another organization in your area does. Then, volunteer your time passing out Bibles at local events, or go on mission trips to give Bibles to people who might not be able to access them. [9] X Research source If there aren't any ministries in your area doing this, start one yourself! Hold fundraisers or ask for donations of used Bibles, then find ways to get them to the public. For instance, you might get permission from event organizers to put up a table and pass the Bibles out to people who are interested."

      "title": "Have regular meetings where you talk about God.",
      "content": "Have regular meetings where you talk about God. Sharing God's word doesn't always mean evangelizing to people who don't believe in Him. Sometimes, it means getting together with other believers and talking about the Bible and what it means in today's world. Invite a handful of people to join your group, then meet to share Scriptures, pray, and enjoy each others' company. [10] X Research source If you'd like, you can appoint a certain person to lead the study each week or you could take turns leading. You could also go around in a circle each week and share a verse that you found meaningful. If you're having a hard time getting an in-person group together, try setting up a Zoom chat where you can share prayer requests and Bible verses!"

      "content": "Figure out how you can get an audience's attention. Is there anything you're really good at? Maybe you're a great singer, dancer, or writer. Or maybe your talent is even more unique—you might be a skilled ventriloquist, an impressive weight lifter, or a hilarious comedian. Whatever talents God has given you, try to find a way to use them to draw people's attention to God's word. For instance, if you're really great at drawing comics, you might create a graphic novel about a villain who discovers God's love, demonstrating that no one is too much of a sinner to be saved. You don't even necessarily have to have a special talent to get people's attention—maybe you could plan a bike ride across your state to raise awareness about your faith, sharing God's word with the people you meet along the way."

      "content": "Sometimes the best way to demonstrate God's love is through action. Do your best to be humble, kind, and compassionate toward others. [11] X Expert Source Olivia Woodford Holy Bible Expert Expert Interview. 2 May 2023. If you're open about your faith and you live your life in a way that honors God, people are going to notice. That can be a more effective witness than words alone. [12] X Research source For instance, if one of your friends is hungry, share your food with them. If someone is sad, sit with them and listen to what they're going through. [13] X Research source Try to keep a positive attitude throughout the day to show others that your faith gives you peace, comfort, and joy."

      "content": "Let the Spirit guide how you talk to people about God. When you're closely in touch with God, you might sometimes feel led to reach out to a certain person. If you trust that feeling, you may be able to give someone a message of God's love just when they need it the most. [14] X Research source Ask the Spirit to lead you to be there for the person in a way that will touch them—sometimes, people might need you to sit and listen to what they're going through, while other times, it might help if you share your own story with them. You might even just need to cheer them up with a smile and a hug!"
