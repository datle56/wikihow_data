      "content": "Look around for cops. Before you steal a car, look around and check if there are cops around the area. If you see one, you may want to let him walk by first until he’s a few meters away from you. Stealing a car while there’s a cop near you will instantly raise your wanted level to one star. Cops will start chasing you and shoot at your car."

      "title": "Get into the car.",
      "content": "Get into the car. Stand right beside the vehicle and press the Y (Xbox), Triangle (PlayStation), or F (PC) button to get into the car. Your character will break the side window, enter, and start the vehicle. In some occasions, a car may have an alarm. Once your character breaks the side window, the alarm will set off. Don’t panic because the alarm is useless unless there are cops near the vehicle. It will eventually turn itself off after a few seconds."

To escape the cops, look at the mini map on the lower left corner of the screen to check the range of the police, marked by a large flashing circle, that’s chasing you. Simply speed away out of the cop’s range, and they will stop chasing you, removing any wanted star you have."
