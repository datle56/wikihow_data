      "title": "Defeat a faction in the campaign.",
      "content": "Defeat a faction in the campaign. If there’s one specific faction you want to play, wipe out that faction in the campaign by killing every one of its family member (generals). If this is your number one priority, try making a large number of assassins and send them to kill the family members directly. This is not always a great strategy for winning, but it will unlock the faction more quickly than defeating it on the battlefield. Without the hack described in the section below, you can only unlock The Greek Cities, Egypt, the Seleucid Empire, Carthage, Gaul, Germania, Britannia, and Parthia."

If you're up for the challenge, use one of the methods below to unlock these. In the Barbarian Invasion expansion, all playable factions start out unlocked.

The file should begin with a list of faction names, sorted underneath the words \"playable,\" \"unlockable,\" and \"nonplayable.\" Select all factions underneath \"unlockable,\" cut them from the document, and paste them into the list under \"playable.\" Before you do the same for the factions underneath \"nonplayable,\" read the following warnings: In the original campaign, the maximum number of playable factions is 20. Keep at least one faction underneath \"nonplayable\" to avoid bugs. [2] X Research source In the original campaign, most people experience frequent crashes when playing as the \"romans_senate\" (SPQR) or \"slave\" (rebels) factions. See Tips below for a possible workaround. In the Barbarian Invasion, the following factions should be left under \"nonplayable\" (they crash the game if you attempt to play as them): romano_british, ostrogoths, slavs, empire_east_rebels, empire_west_rebels, slave. [3] X Research source Every faction name must have a \"Tab\" indent in front of it, and should be the only word on its line."
