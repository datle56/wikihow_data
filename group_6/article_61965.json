      "content": "Wait about 4 weeks until your tattoo is fully healed. It’s absolutely essential to avoid fully submerging your tattoo in water until the skin around it has fully recovered. A new tattoo is basically an open wound so getting it wet too soon holds high risks of irritation, skin infection, and damage to the ink. Avoid baths, hot tubs, pools, oceans, rivers, lakes, and any other body of water until your tattoo has healed properly. [1] X Research source The average amount of time a tattoo takes to heal is a month, but can be as short as 2 weeks or as long as 3 months. It’s best to listen to your tattoo provider on the approximate time it’s safe to swim again. Showering with a new tattoo is okay. Just don’t stay in the shower for too long and avoid using loofahs or sponges until your skin has healed. Don’t stress if your tattoo gets a little wet before it has fully healed. Just dab it quickly with a clean towel to avoid attracting bacteria."

      "content": "Wrap your tattoo with a waterproof bandage right before swimming. There is no way to fully waterproof a tattoo before it has fully healed. However, if swimming is unavoidable, the next best option is to cover your tattoo with a waterproof bandage like Sanaderm, Tegaderm, or medical retention tape. Make sure to apply the bandage immediately before swimming to avoid as much sweat buildup as possible beforehand. [2] X Research source Avoid swimming in oceans, lakes, and rivers altogether. While the chlorine in a swimming pool is still bad for a tattoo, the bacteria found in large freshwater bodies (especially coastal freshwater bodies) are far more dangerous and unpredictable.

Because petroleum jelly is moisture-trapping, applying a thin layer of it on top of your waterproof bandage adds an extra layer of protection between the water and your tattoo. [4] X Research source If petroleum jelly is too harsh on your skin, coconut oil, cocoa butter, and other water-based lotions can offer the same protection. Your tattoo provider may also have recommendations. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source"

Properly caring for your tattoo while your broken skin recovers is an important step in making sure your cool new ink develops as intended. Once you get home, remove the tattoo covering to prevent it from sticking to your skin. Remove your tattoo bandage anywhere from 1 to 5 hours after your piece has been completed. Since every piece is different, talk to your tattoo provider for their advice on when they feel it’s the best time to peel the bandage off. The tattoo artist will provide you with instructions on how to take care of your tattoo. Make sure to follow them exactly."

To keep the ink in the best condition, moisturize the affected area regularly with a tattoo aftercare cream. Do it for the first 7-10 days as well. [13] X Research source Don’t over-moisturize! Overdoing it on the aftercare cream can clog your pores which will lead to breakouts and slow the healing process. The usual recommendation for applying aftercare cream is 2-3 times a day. However, this may vary depending on the piece. Listen to your tattoo provider for their regiment and cream recommendations. The best time to apply moisturizer on your tattoo is 5-10 minutes after it has been air dried after it’s cleaned."
