      "content": "Start a yawn with your lips formed like you’re making a “u” sound. Say the letter “u” and keep your lips in this position. Then, inhale through your mouth and make yourself yawn. Do your best to keep your mouth shaped like you’re saying “u” for the entire yawn. Keeping your lips in this shape helps push your soft palate into a better position so that your breath can flow in and out without causing nasal sounds."
