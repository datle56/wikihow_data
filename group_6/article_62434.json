      "content": "Reciting the Pledge of Allegiance is a promise of loyalty to the U.S. The U.S. flag represents the beliefs and principles of the country, and pledging allegiance to it is a way to show loyalty to those principles. [1] X Research source Today, this pledge is recited by students at the beginning of the school day. The sessions of the House of Representatives and the Senate also begin with the pledge. [2] X Research source The pledge reads: “I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic, for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.” [3] X Research source Pledging allegiance to the “Republic” means pledging loyalty to a government where the people vote for their own representatives. “One Nation under God, indivisible” means all 50 states are united as a single Republic under God and cannot be separated from each other. “With liberty and justice for all” means that all Americans have the freedom to pursue life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and have the right to be treated fairly."

Others argue that children can’t give consent or understand the pledge of loyalty they’re making. [21] X Research source"
