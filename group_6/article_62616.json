Also make note of the last time you received a pay increase. You can then compare this information to the other data you'll find as you further investigate your field. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source If you're unaware of what your exact compensation is, collect your past pay stubs. If you don't have these, ask at the company payroll department for your financial history at the job."

      "content": "Gather any positive feedback to bolster your argument. The key to getting a salary increase is proving that you're an asset to your company. Good performance reviews, customer feedback, or any other information that attests to your value will help your case. Keep these records close at hand so you can cite them when you write your proposal. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Not all companies do regular performance reviews. In this case, there are a few things you could do to gather information to help your case. For example, if you have team or planning meetings for your area or department, then these could be good opportunities to check in with your boss and assess your performance on a regular basis. You could periodically schedule a meeting with your boss and ask how you're doing at your job. Make note of the feedback you receive. If your boss says you're doing a great job, use this as your positive feedback. If your boss tells you a few things you could improve upon, take that feedback seriously and work on those areas. Then when you write your letter, you can say how you've taken your boss's advice and improved. If you have a direct supervisor who's not your boss, see if he or she will give you some feedback. If you get good feedback, you can ask your supervisor to write a letter to your boss about your good performance. You may also consider looking for a mentor at work. If your company has a mentorship program, then indicate your interest to your supervisor. Or, if there is not mentorship program, then try talking with a more experienced, successful employee and see if they would be willing to be your mentor. Take all feedback you receive without getting defensive. If you get some negative feedback, don't argue. Instead, take the advice and use it when you write your letter. You can demonstrate that you've taken feedback to heart and improved your performance.

      "title": "Investigate the pay range for your job and level of experience within the industry.",
      "content": "Investigate the pay range for your job and level of experience within the industry. When asking for increased compensation, you have to be familiar with typical pay rates within the industry. This will show you whether it would be reasonable to ask for a raise or not. [4] X Research source Use sites like PayScale or Glassdoor to research salaries within your industry. For example, you might find that the average worker in your field earns between $45,000 and $50,000. If you're earning $44,000, you're below the average, and it would certainly be reasonable to ask for more money. You can use this as leverage when you write your proposal. If, however, you're making $52,000, you might have trouble getting an increase. You boss could counter your request by saying that you make an above-average salary. If you're earning above the industry average, you could still ask for a raise, but you'll need a lot of evidence that you're a true asset to the company. Financial figures would help most, because it would show your boss that he or she is making money with you around."

If things have been tough for a while, your boss may not be able to give you a raise even if he wanted to. If earnings have been high, however, you can take advantage of both the availability of money and your boss' good mood by asking then."

You will need to provide concrete evidence of your performance in the letter. Be sure to include specific details, percentages, and figures about your contributions to the company.

[10] X Research source Write, \"In line with my performance for this company, I request a compensation increase of 3% annually, which will bring my yearly salary to $50,000.\" It is often good to ask for slightly more than you actually want so if your boss negotiates with you, you'll end up closer to what you actually want. Don't go overboard, however, or you'll seem unreasonable. For example, if you want a 2% raise, ask for 2.5 or 3%, not 10%. [11] X Research source"
