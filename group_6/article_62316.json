      "content": "Change your septum piercing once it’s fully healed in 2-3 months. Most people will heal within 3 months of getting a septum piercing. However, some people may take 6-8 months or longer depending on how well they take care of it, the exact location of the piercing, and the strength of their immune system. By waiting for it to be fully healed, you reduce the risk of infection, pain, or scarring when you swap in new jewelry. [1] X Research source Change your piercing as early as 2 months if necessary (like if you need a horseshoe you can flip and hide for work). Consider having your piercer do it this early. [2] X Research source Your septum is fully healed when it’s no longer painful or swollen, does not crust over, and doesn’t show any signs of infection. Septum piercings should go through the soft tissue under the cartilage between your nostrils. Piercings that go through the cartilage take longer to heal. Signs of infection include redness or tenderness, swelling, prolonged bleeding, pus or other fluid discharge, or a change in skin color around the piercing.

      "content": "Buy or use implant-grade jewelry for your replacement. Prepare to spend a few extra dollars for fine, quality jewelry that won’t irritate or break down in your nose. If you want a silver look, choose titanium , implant-grade stainless steel, or biocompatible white gold pieces. Use real 14-karat gold , titanium anodized rose gold, or biocompatible yellow jewelry for gold looks. [4] X Research source Steer clear of surgical steel, which shouldn't be left in your body for long periods of time, as well as copper, brass, or anything that’s plated or coated."

[5] X Research source Then, disinfect the replacement jewelry by boiling it in water for 5 minutes, soaking it in sterile saline for a few minutes, or washing it in hot water and antibacterial soap. [6] X Research source Rinse your jewelry thoroughly if you cleaned it with saline or soap, and make sure there’s no debris still clinging to the metal. Let the jewelry air dry or wipe it dry with a clean paper towel."

      "content": "Unscrew the ball at one end of the horseshoe and rotate the ring out. Most first septum piercings are a horseshoe with ball bearings at the ends (one or both balls may be removable). Twist the removable ball counterclockwise to unthread it and set it to the side. Then, slowly and gently twist and slide the horseshoe so the ball-less end slides out through the piercing hole. [7] X Research source Wear rubber gloves if you’re struggling to get a good grip on the jewelry. If you have a hinged segment clicker (a hoop with a hinge and a seam), rotate the hoop so the hinge and seam hang below your nostrils. Pull the seam apart and rotate the ring to remove.

      "content": "Unfasten the new jewelry and slide it through the piercing hole. For horseshoes , unscrew a ball bearing and line up the threaded end of the hoop with the piercing hole. Look upward into a mirror, push the tip of your nose up with your pointer finger, or pull the lowest part of your septum downward to find the hole easier. Gently push the jewelry through, rotating as you go, then fasten the ball back onto the end of the horseshoe. [9] X Research source For hinged segment clickers , pull the seam apart and then rotate the hoop through the piercing hole. Push the seam back together to fasten it. [10] X Research source Work slowly and carefully for your first jewelry change. It will get easier the more you do it!"

      "content": "Clean the new jewelry twice a day for a week. Once the new metal is in, follow your original aftercare instructions to make sure it stays infection-free. Clean it twice a day with saline or saltwater and take care not to go swimming or irritate it with makeup, lotions, or by snagging it on clothes. Handle or flip it as little as possible, and always make sure you wash your hands before touching it. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Touch your piercing as little as possible for 2-3 months.",
      "content": "Touch your piercing as little as possible for 2-3 months. Germ from your hands are the #1 cause of piercing infections, so try not to handle it unless you’re cleaning it (and always wash your hands before touching it!). Think of the phrase “less is more,” especially with septum piercings which are tempting to flip up and down to hide or to get different looks—the less you touch your piercing, the faster it will heal. Try not to pick at any scabs or crust that form during healing, either. Some crusting is normal and can be rinsed away with saline or saltwater. If you have to touch your septum piercing, always wash your hands with hot water and antibacterial soap for at least 20 seconds beforehand. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean your piercing twice a day until it’s fully healed.",
      "content": "Clean your piercing twice a day until it’s fully healed. Spray all exposed parts of the jewelry with sterile saline spray or soak a clean cotton pad in saline and hold it to the piercing for 5 minutes. [13] X Research source Afterwards, rinse your piercing and the inside of your nose clean. Just cup some warm (not hot) water in your hands and blow bubbles in it with your nose for about 15 seconds. Lightly rotate or twist the jewelry a few times while it’s still wet to make sure your flesh isn’t sticking to the post. Use store bought sterile saline or make your own at home (mix ¼ tsp (1.5 g) of sea salt dissolved in 8 fl oz (240 mL) of boiled water). Stay away from hydrogen peroxide, iodine, or rubbing alcohol for cleaning. These harsh chemicals will kill healthy, new cells and slow down your healing."

      "title": "Keep your piercing dry outside of cleaning or showering during healing.",
      "content": "Keep your piercing dry outside of cleaning or showering during healing. Try not to go swimming in pools, lakes, or hot tubs during healing (especially during the first few days or weeks) since microorganisms in the water can irritate or infect your new piercing. This goes for luxurious soaks in the bathtub, too. The drier the piercing, the better! [14] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Remember, a piercing is like an open wound. Your chances of infection are lower when it isn’t kept wet for long periods of time. Generally, the older a piercing is, the better it holds up in water."

      "content": "Try not to get makeup, moisturizer, or sunscreen on your piercing. Apply cosmetics and lotions carefully around your nose or upper lip. If any chemicals linger on your piercing, they could inflame or infect it. Be careful not to snag the jewelry on anything either (like when you’re taking off a shirt), since pulling and tugging can slow healing (and hurt!). [15] X Research source Don’t use your new piercing as a reason not to apply sunscreen, though. A nasty burn on your nose could irritate the new piercing too. Rinse your piercing with clean water and spray it with saline in case you do accidentally get makeup on it."

      "content": "Speed up your healing time with rest and a nutritious diet. A healthy body heals from injuries faster, so focus on getting good sleep most nights and eating lots of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and vitamins during the first weeks or months of healing. Stay hydrated and try to cut back on your alcohol intake as well. [16] X Research source Consider starting a multivitamin or Vitamin C supplement to boost your body’s healing powers."
