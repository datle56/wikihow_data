    {
      "title": "Check the fuel cap.",
      "content": "Check the fuel cap. If you have a gas-powered chainsaw, it will need to be fueled up before using it. Before starting it, you should make sure that the fuel cap is securely fastened, and that there are no drips or pools of fuel on the outside of the chainsaw. [1] X Research source If you see any fuel on the outer parts of the chainsaw, carefully wipe it away. Always start your chainsaw well away from fuel sources."
    },
    {
      "title": "Activate the chain brake.",
      "content": "Activate the chain brake. On a gas-powered Stihl chainsaw, the chain brake is located just in front of the handlebar. All you have to do to activate it is push it forward. This will keep the chain locked as a safety precaution while you are starting the chainsaw, and until you are ready to use the tool."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the bar cover.",
      "content": "Remove the bar cover. Your chainsaw may be equipped with a sheath or cover that goes over the chain and bar. If so, remove it before starting the chainsaw. That way, your tool will be ready to use once you start it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Press the decompression valve, if applicable.",
      "content": "Press the decompression valve, if applicable. Typically, only professional-grade Stihl chainsaws have a decompression valve, so if you have a home or consumer-grade model, you will skip this step. If you have a professional saw, simply press the valve down (it will be located on the top of the chainsaw, near the starter rope)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pump the primer valve, if your saw has one.",
      "content": "Pump the primer valve, if your saw has one. Many Stihl models have a primer valve located on the side of the tool, near the handlebar. If yours has one, simply push it down several times. Don’t worry about the number of times you press the valve.-Several pushes won’t flood the engine, only circulate the fuel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the master control to the cold start setting.",
      "content": "Set the master control to the cold start setting. Press and hold the throttle trigger lockout (located on the side of the chainsaw, above the trigger) with your thumb, then move the master control (on the left of the rear of the chainsaw) down as far as it will go. This is the position you should start the chainsaw in the first time you use it each session. If you have recently used the chainsaw, turned it off for a few minutes, and are ready to use it again, set the master control to the warm start setting before beginning. This is located one notch up from the lowest setting."

    {
      "title": "Set your chainsaw on the ground in a clear, flat area.",
      "content": "Set your chainsaw on the ground in a clear, flat area. Stihl recommends starting your chainsaw from a sitting position. Set the tool on level ground, and make sure there is nothing touching or immediately below or in front of the bar and chain. [2] X Research source Never “drop” start or “throw” start your chainsaw. These are dangerous positions that do not allow you to control your tool."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the chainsaw down with your foot and hand.",
      "content": "Hold the chainsaw down with your foot and hand. Slip the toe of your right foot into the rear handle opening. At the same time, press down on front handle with your left hand, wrapping your thumb and fingers around it and locking your elbow. This will secure the chainsaw as you start it. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the starter rope.",
      "content": "Pull the starter rope. Grip the handle of the starter rope with your right hand. Slowly pull vertically until you feel some resistance. Then, pull the starter rope quickly several times until the chainsaw fires. Only grasp the starter rope handle. Never wrap the rope around your hand or grasp the rope itself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the chainsaw to open the “choke”.",
      "content": "Set the chainsaw to open the “choke”. The chainsaw will fire, but then immediately die again. When this happens, move the master control up one position to the half throttle (warm start) setting. If you recently used your chainsaw, the master control should already be at the warm start setting."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the starter rope again.",
      "content": "Pull the starter rope again. Using the same technique as before, grasp the starter rope handle again and pull vertically. You will hear the engine of your chainsaw fire again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move the master control to the idle setting.",
      "content": "Move the master control to the idle setting. Once the chainsaw has started and stays running, move the master control up one notch. Just a slight touch of your finger should do it. This will keep the chainsaw running."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift the chainsaw up.",
      "content": "Lift the chainsaw up. Check your surroundings one more time to make sure there are no people or objects in your way. Slowly get up, holding the chainsaw by the handlebar. Then release the chain brake by pulling it back toward you. Your chainsaw is now ready to use."

      "title": "Make sure you have secure footing.",
      "content": "Make sure you have secure footing. If you must start your chainsaw on uneven ground, Stihl recommends an alternate technique for safety reasons. First of all, use your foot to clear any debris away from your site, and make a small impression in the ground you can use to support your foot. Do not use the chainsaw on any gravel or masonry. If the blade hits the rocks, it could send them flying. [4] X Expert Source Abraham Schwartz Handyman Expert Interview. 28 August 2020."

      "title": "Position the rear handle of the chainsaw against your leg.",
      "content": "Position the rear handle of the chainsaw against your leg. Brace the handle against your body, just above the knee. This will give you greater control over the chainsaw."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the chainsaw securely.",
      "content": "Hold the chainsaw securely. Keep your left hand on the chainsaw’s handlebar, and lock your elbow. Use your right hand to start the chainsaw, then follow the same directions for pulling the starter rope and starting your tool as you would when beginning from a sitting position."

      "title": "Connect to a power supply.",
      "content": "Connect to a power supply. The power supply you connect your chainsaw to must be of the same voltage. Check your chainsaw’s manual for information if you are not sure about your model’s specifications. [5] X Research source Use an extension cord if necessary."

      "content": "Find secure, balanced footing. You can start an electric chainsaw from a seated or standing position as necessary. As you would for a gas-powered chainsaw, check and make sure that the surrounding area is free from people and obstructions. Your body should feel balanced before you begin. [6] X Research source"
