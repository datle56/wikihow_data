      "title": "Don’t put your foot on the brake like you normally do.",
      "content": "Don’t put your foot on the brake like you normally do. The steering wheel on vehicles will occasionally lock up when the steering column and the ignition don’t line up. This often happens when you turn the vehicle off without lining the wheels up straight. To fix this, do not press the brake the same way you normally would starting the car. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Press the start button to unlock the wheel.",
      "content": "Press the start button to unlock the wheel. On some vehicles you’ll need to press the start button twice. So long as you’ve got the remote key on hand, your vehicle will recognize that it’s okay to turn the electrical/accessory systems on. [2] X Research source If you hold the brake down and press the start button, your vehicle will normally try to start. But if your steering column is out of alignment, you won’t be able to run the wheel. This shouldn’t happen with the electrical on since the vehicle won’t worry about rolling."

      "title": "Try turning or jiggling the steering wheel.",
      "content": "Try turning or jiggling the steering wheel. With the electrical systems on, gently jiggle the steering wheel. If it comes loose, start the vehicle by pressing the brake and the start button and you should be good to go. [3] X Research source If the steering wheel won’t turn, try starting the vehicle anyway. Even a slight adjustment can fix a goofy column alignment. If you still can’t turn the wheel though, it’s time to take the vehicle to the mechanic."

      "title": "Jump your battery",
      "content": "Jump your battery if your entire vehicle is disabled and nonresponsive. If your steering wheel is locked up and the push to start button isn’t doing anything, it’s possible that your battery is just dead. Contact a friend, family member, or neighbor and ask them to help you jump your battery. With both vehicles off, connect the positive terminal of the dead battery to the positive terminal of the donor battery. Then, attach the negative terminal to the donor battery to the dead battery. Wait a minute, start the donor car, and then start your vehicle. [4] X Research source Remove the cables in the opposite order that you attached them. Let your vehicle run for a few minutes to give your vehicle’s electrical systems time to stabilize."

      "content": "Look for power steering error codes on your dashboard and address them. If your vehicle turns on but you can’t turn the steering wheel, it’s possibly stuck due to a power steering issue. Perhaps your vehicle’s power steering lines are damaged, or maybe you’ve run out of power steering fluid entirely. If you know your way around the engine bay, check your power steering fluids to confirm the issue. [5] X Research source If you aren’t a gearhead and you’ve got a power steering error code, get your vehicle towed to a mechanic. There’s also a thin chance that you can’t turn the steering wheel because your serpentine belt is completely disconnected and needs to be replaced , but this will almost always happen while you’re actively driving—not when your car is off and parked."

      "content": "Consult your specific model’s manual for unique wheel locking issues. Some vehicles lock the steering wheel for safety reasons if they detect a break-in, there’s a problem with the ignition control, or there’s something going on with your engine that makes it unsafe to drive. Before you start disassembling the steering column or messing with the ignition, consult your driver’s manual to see if there’s a model-specific solution. [6] X Research source This is especially likely if your vehicle turns on but your steering wheel won’t even budge a little bit. You may even get some kind of warning chime or indicator to let you know a problem needs to be addressed."

      "title": "Try turning the wheel while turning the key.",
      "content": "Try turning the wheel while turning the key. If you turned the vehicle off when the ignition and steering column were misaligned, you may just need to jiggle the key a bit to get the ignition column to unlock . Put one hand on the steering wheel and stick the key in the ignition. Slowly turn the key while gently moving the wheel back and forth. Continue applying light pressure until your wheel unlocks and you can start the car. [7] X Research source Do not turn the key with a lot of force—this doesn’t require a lot of effort, and turning the key too hard may bend it."

      "content": "Use a spare key if you have access to one. If you’ve got a spare key lying around somewhere, test that before moving on to more serious or involved repairs. Grab your spare key and try using that to unlock your steering wheel and start your car. If it works, the grooves of your primary key are worn down and you’ve got a key problem, not a steering wheel problem. Feel free to use your spare key to get around. You should get a second copy made soon, though."

      "content": "Spritz WD-40 in the ignition if it won’t turn smoothly. If your key is sticking in the column and that resistance is preventing you from turning the vehicle on, grab a can of WD-40 or any other silicone lubricant. With the vehicle off, spray a dash of WD-40 into the keyhole. Move the key in and out to spread the lubricant around and then try turning the vehicle on. [8] X Research source If this works, you just had some dirt or debris inside the keyhole. However, it could be a sign that you’re coming up to the end of the life for your ignition module, so you may need to make that repair soon. If the key won’t go in all the way, skip the WD-40 and try blowing compressed air in the ignition opening. This may knock out whatever debris is blocking your way."

      "title": "Replace the ignition switch",
      "content": "Replace the ignition switch in the steering column as a last resort. If you still can’t turn the key, it’s possible the entire ignition assembly needs to be replaced. Purchase a replacement ignition switch for your vehicle and unscrew the fasteners on your dashboard to unlock the panels. Pry the panels out until you can access the ignition cylinder and replace it before reassembling your dashboard. [9] X Research source You can also go to a dealership to have them replace this one and cut you new keys."
