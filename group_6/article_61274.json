      "title": "Type the LEFT or RIGHT formula into your selected cell.",
      "content": "Type the LEFT or RIGHT formula into your selected cell. The LEFT and RIGHT formula are built on the same premise, though the LEFT formula displays characters from the left side of your cell's text and the RIGHT formula displays characters from the right. The formula is \"=DIRECTION(Cell Name, Number of characters to display)\" without the quotation marks. For example: [1] X Research source =LEFT(A3, 6) displays the first six characters in cell A3. If the text in A3 says \"Cats are better\", the truncated text will read \"Cats a\" in your selected cell. =RIGHT(B2, 5) displays the last 5 characters in cell B2. If the text in B2 says \"I love wikiHow\", the truncated text will read \"kiHow\" in your selected cell. Keep in mind that spaces count as characters."

      "content": "Type the MID formula into your selected cell. MID chops characters off of the beginning and end of your selected cell's text. To set up the MID formula, you type \"=MID(Cell Name, Starting Character Number, Number of characters to display)\" without the quotation marks. For example: =MID(A1, 3, 3) displays three characters from cell A1, the first of which is the third character from the left in the text. If A1's text says \"racecar\", the truncated text will read \"cec\" in your selected cell. Similarly, =MID(B3, 4, 8) displays eight characters from cell B3, starting with the fourth character from the left. If B3's text says \"bananas aren't people\", the truncated text will read \"anas are\" in your selected cell."
