      "content": "Crossbody Simply drape the belt bag across the front of your body with the pouch and pocket facing forward. When the pocket is off-centered (either closer to your shoulder or closer to your waist), this can help add some asymmetrical interest to the outfit. [1] X Research source The Lululemon Belt Bag comes with adjustable straps, so you can decide where on your body you’d like the front to lay. This will vary based upon your height, size, and what is most comfortable for you. This option looks great with any outfit! Sweatshirts, dresses, jackets, crop tops, t-shirts, sweaters, or turtlenecks are all game here. As the most popular way to wear the Lululemon belt bag, the crossbody style has no limits."

      "title": "Facing backwards",
      "content": "Facing backwards Wearing the belt bag as a backpack gives off a more discreet vibe. Just put the bag on as you would a normal backpack, but instead of putting both arms through two straps, drape it across you diagonally. Think of this as a crossbody backpack. [2] X Research source This style is perfect for when you’re out jogging or just don’t want the front of the bag getting in the way. It looks best with athletic wear, casual sweats, or minimalist tees and sweaters. Don’t place any valuables in the belt bag if you choose to wear it this way. Without having a proper eye on the bag at all times, anyone may be able to unzip it and get to what’s inside."

      "title": "As a purse",
      "content": "As a purse Wearing your Lululemon Belt Bag as a purse is a great way to upgrade the bag from casual to sophisticated. The adjustable straps allow you to lengthen the bag and have it sit as a regular purse; it doesn’t hold as many items as a huge handbag does, so this is perfect for when you’re going out to dinner or brunch and just need to throw a few must-haves in your bag. [3] X Research source Since the purse look is a bit more elegant than most other belt bag styles, save this option for fancier outfits like dresses, skirts, blouses, and jackets. The Lululemon 1L Everything Belt Bag is the perfect size for containing small objects like earbuds, lip stick, tissues, chapstick, hand sanitizer, scrunchies, or eye drops, making it the ideal small purse.

      "content": "Fanny pack style Wearing the Lululemon Belt Bag around the waist evokes a classic style. Whether you shift the pouch to the left or the right of your body, you can’t go wrong with this vintage look. Simply wrap the straps around your waist and clip the snap closure together. [5] X Research source The fanny pack look is another option that goes wonderfully with any outfit. Some classic go-tos to pairings are a top and jeans, sweatshirt and sweatpants, overalls, or a blazer for a retro feel. You can also push the pouch to the back if you don’t want the bag to be front-and-center."

      "content": "Match the bag’s color to your shoes for a tied-together appearance. Matching your bag to your shoes is a golden rule of fashion. Some may think matching your shoes with your bag is an outdated concept (we’re all about playing with color in modern times), but it adds a layer of cohesion to your outfit that you just can’t beat. Because the Lululemon Belt Bag is all about dressing casually, like-colors are the way to go. [6] X Research source You can follow this rule when dressing up or dressing down. For example, if your Lululemon belt bag is black, reach for a pair of black sneakers for a casual outfit. If you’re looking for a more elevated style, opt for some black pumps or sandals."

You can try this with any outfit, but it looks best when paired with an oversized sweatshirt, t-shirt, or jacket. In this situation, the “belt” aspect of the bag really comes out to play.

Because the Lululemon bag is such a minimalist accessory, it’s totally fine to dress up your look with some bold jewelry! Some hoops, a chain necklace, or your favorite watch are perfect for upgrading the outfit. [8] X Research source While jewelry is the perfect accessory for the Lululemon Belt Bag, other accessories may be a bit overboard. For example, wearing a belt with your belt bag is likely to make the look cluttered or bulky."

If you’re someone who shies away from bright clothing but are in need of an upgrade, adding a simple pop of color will add a bit of life into your ensemble. Luckily, the Lululemon Belt Bag comes in really fun colors like hot pink, watermelon green, blue, and vibrant flower print, which are all ideal choices for any neutral-colored fit.

      "content": "Conceal the bag under a jacket or cardigan for a muted look. Throwing on a jacket over the bag will keep it hidden. Not everyone wants their bag on display—some prefer to keep one on themselves for functional purposes. If this sounds like you, simply put on your Lululemon Belt Bag (crossbody, around your waist, or whichever way feels most comfortable to you) and then add your jacket. You can position the pouch so it’s totally hidden from others, or you can show it off a little bit in the front—it’s up to you! If you decide to wear your belt bag this way, make sure you have access to it if you plan to keep your jacket on all day/night. One of the best parts about the belt bag is storing your accessories in it, so be sure you can grab your wallet or whatever you may need out of it at any time."

Since it's made from polyester, it can be cleaned with water and a rag or with a spot solution like vinegar and water, baking soda and water, or laundry detergent and water. [15] X Research source Always do a test on an area of the bag that can't be seen before attempting to spot clean. This will ensure you don't ruin the bag or create a mark in an area that is highly visible."

If you plan to use the bag on a daily basis, you'll want to steer clear from lighter colors like white. If you know you'll only be using the bag on occasion, white is fine. Great shades to select for daily use are black, green, blue, gray, or any color that is dark and won't show dirt."
