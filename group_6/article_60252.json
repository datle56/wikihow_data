      "title": "Start with the 5 vowels.",
      "content": "Start with the 5 vowels. The Shona alphabet has 5 vowels, each of which are pronounced similarly to the same letters in the Spanish or Italian alphabets. If your first language is English, practice the vowel sounds, focusing on the ones that are pronounced differently in Shona than they are in English. Vowels are perhaps the most important part of the Shona language. Because Shona is a phonetic language, if you understand the vowel sounds, you'll be able to spell practically any word you hear. The letter \"A\" makes an \"ah\" sound, similar to the \"a\" in the English word \"father.\" The letter \"E\" makes an \"eh\" sound, similar to the \"ay\" in the English word \"say.\" The letter \"I\" makes an \"ee\" sound, similar to the \"ee\" in the English word \"see.\" The letter \"O\" makes an \"oh\" sound, similar to the \"o\" in the English word \"so.\" The letter \"U\" makes an \"oo\" sound, similar to the \"oo\" in the English word \"doom.\""

      "title": "Pronounce most consonants the same as you would in English.",
      "content": "Pronounce most consonants the same as you would in English. Shona uses the same alphabet as English, and almost all of the consonants are pronounced the same, with the exception of \"j,\" which is pronounced with a \"yah\" sound, similar to the Spanish \"j.\" However, Shona also has more breathy consonants that don't appear in English. [2] X Research source To pronounce a breathy consonant, breathe out a little, almost like a sigh, as you say the letter, similar to how you would pronounce the \"h\" in the English word \"behind.\" Breathy consonants in Shona are represented by an \"h\" after the initial consonant: \"bh,\" \"ch,\" \"dh,\" \"mh,\" and \"vh.\" Most Shona dialects, as well as \"Standard Shona,\" do not use the \"L\" sound, except in loan words."

    {
      "title": "Practice consonant combinations.",
      "content": "Practice consonant combinations. There are no silent letters or blended consonants in Shona. Rather, each consonant retains the same sound regardless of which letters appear around it. For this reason, some consonant combinations may be difficult for you to pronounce correctly. [3] X Research source For example, the combination \"dz\" might give you trouble, especially if your first language is English. The combinations \"zv\" and \"sv\" are properly pronounced with something like a whistle. This is a sound unique to the Shona language, and can also be difficult if you speak English or a European language as your first language. Listen to native speakers to get a better idea of how these combinations sound. [4] X Research source If you come across a word with a consonant combination that you have difficulty pronouncing, look online for a recording of a native speaker saying the word slowly. Practice saying the word, gradually speeding up your speech until you can pronounce it correctly. Forvo ( https://forvo.com/languages/sn/ ) is a good place to find native speaker pronunciations of words."

      "title": "Use vowels to break words into syllables.",
      "content": "Use vowels to break words into syllables. Shona words only have one vowel per syllable and each syllable ends in a vowel. Therefore, you can use the presence of vowels to easily divide a word into syllables. For example, the word \"vakadzi\" means \"women\" in Shona. You can break this word down into 3 syllables: va-ka-dzi. All syllables carry the same stress in a Shona word, and the vowels always sound the same. Therefore, a word such as \"vakadzi\" would be pronounced \"vah-kah-dzee.\""

      "title": "Listen for tones that differentiate words.",
      "content": "Listen for tones that differentiate words. While Shona is not a completely tonal language, like Chinese, the language does use two tones — a high tone and a low tone. These two tones are used to differentiate words, typically two-syllable words, that mean something different depending on which tone pattern is used. For example, the word \"hama,\" spoken with two high tones, means \"relative.\" However, if you use a high tone with the first syllable and a low tone with the second syllable, the word means \"hammer.\" In longer words with 4 or more syllables, tones have less significance. While tones may be used with longer words, getting the tones wrong will seldom change the meaning of the word."

This greeting is appropriate when greeting or acknowledging anyone, particularly if you've never met them before.

      "content": "Continue the conversation by asking \"Wakadini?\" The word \"wakadini\" means \"How are you?\" If you want to converse with someone you meet, say this immediately after saying \"mhoro.\" This is also considered polite if you're actually interacting with someone rather than simply acknowledging their presence. [8] X Research source The standard response to this question is \"ndakasimba, waita hako,\" which means \"I'm good, thanks.\" If you were the first person to ask, the person might also add \"ko iwe?\" which means \"And you?\" For example, if you're walking up to a counter at a restaurant to order food, you might say \"Mhoro, wakadini?\""

Say \"ndinonzi\" followed by your name. You don't have to worry about \"translating\" your name into Shona. Your name as it's pronounced in your language is fine. [9] X Research source After you introduce yourself, add \"Unozani?\" to ask them their name. When they tell you their name, you might say \"ndafara kukuziva,\" which means \"pleased to meet you.\""

If you're just beginning to learn Shona, it doesn't matter if you don't understand every word the person says — you can ask them about it later to get a better sense of what they're saying. Some good questions to ask are: [10] X Research source Une makore mangani? (How old are you?) Unobva kupi? (Where are you from?) Unogara kupi? (Where do you live?) Unoitei chinokuraramisa? (What do you do for a living?) Note that Zimbabweans consider it a point of pride to talk about their education and occupation, as these things are seen as a way to earn your respect.

However, most of them are free. Those which charge a subscription may offer additional options that aren't offered on free websites, such as the ability to have group chats or converse for longer periods of time."
