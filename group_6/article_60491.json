      "content": "Anticipate happy drool. Cats often drool when they are happy and content, like when they eat catnip. Don’t give your cat catnip if you don’t want it to drool. Also feed your cat on time so it doesn’t drool when it’s happily waiting for food. And put a towel on your lap when you pet your cat, because you can’t prevent this type of happy drool.

      "title": "Give your cat water or a little food when you administer medicine.",
      "content": "Give your cat water or a little food when you administer medicine. Cats drool after eating bitter or unpleasant things, like medicine. Also distract your cat with toys or a ball of yarn after you apply topical flea or worming medication to try and prevent it from licking the medication off its fur. Treat your cat with food or water if it does lick any medication off. Bring your cat to the vet for medication and treatment if you notice your cat has symptoms like twitching, seizures, diarrhea, vomiting, not eating, and/or problems with its coordination after it licks topical medication off its fur. If your cat has to take a bitter medication long-term, then ask your veterinarian if it is possible to have the medication compounded so that it tastes better to your cat."
