      "content": "Possibly, if you think you’re up to the challenge. School clubs are a great way to explore your interests and meet new people. A school club can also help boost your self-esteem, and give you a nice break from classes and homework. [1] X Research source According to some studies, participating in certain clubs can even improve your grades! [2] X Research source Starting a new club is a big responsibility, and takes a lot of time, patience, and hard work. If you already have a lot on your plate, or don’t know a lot of people who’d be interested, starting a new club may not be the best option. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Yes, as long as you have people interested in joining. Starting a club is a lot easier if you have people supporting you along the way. Before getting the ball rolling, ask your friends and acquaintances if they’d like to join your club. [4] X Research source You might say, “I’m thinking about starting an outdoors club. Would you like to join?”"

      "title": "Create a club that matches your interests.",
      "content": "Create a club that matches your interests. Your new club can be just about anything, as long as it doesn’t break your school’s rules. You might start a sports club, like badminton or ultimate frisbee, or an academic-themed club, like Model UN, mock trial, or chess. You could even focus on a really specific interest, like anime, gaming, or gardening. [5] X Research source Choose a topic that really speaks to you, and that other students might be interested in joining. You might start an environmental club that helps out in the local community. [6] X Research source A kindness club is another great option. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "You could also start a chapter of an established club at your school. Well-known organizations like the American Red Cross, UNICEF, Key Club, and Lion’s Club all host clubs at the school-level. Pick a club that really meshes with your interests, whether it’s community service, academics, or something else altogether. Here are some resources for starting a Red Cross Club: https://redcrossyouth.org/college-resources/college/how-to-start-a-red-cross-club-2/ This guide can help you start a Key Club: https://www.keyclub.org/membership/how-to-start-a-club ."

      "title": "Ask a faculty member on board to supervise your club.",
      "content": "Ask a faculty member on board to supervise your club. Most schools will require your new club to have a faculty adviser, who can help guide the group. Chat with a teacher or staff member who you’re really friendly with, and who has some background in your club’s topic. Ask if they’d be willing to support and sponsor your club. [8] X Research source Plan on speaking with multiple faculty members, in case your first choice says no. Say something like, “Hi Mr. Williams! I was thinking about starting a newspaper club. I learned a lot from you in your English class last semester, and I was wondering if you’d like to be the club sponsor.”"

      "title": "Plan when you’ll meet and what you’ll do.",
      "content": "Plan when you’ll meet and what you’ll do. Choose a date and time that works well for you, your sponsor, and your potential members. Chances are, your club will meet at some point after school. Then, create a rough outline of what your meetings will look like, and what you’ll accomplish during that time. [9] X Research source For instance, you might decide to meet on Thursday afternoons from 3 PM to 4 PM. In a yearbook club meeting, you might discuss club announcements, suggest new ideas, and plan potential page layouts. Some schools might let you meet during a free period, while others might have you meet after school. Check with your school administration to see what your options are."

      "title": "Submit an official application.",
      "content": "Submit an official application. Pick up a club application form from your school administration. Many schools will ask you to include a list of potential club members, along with a copy of your club’s by-laws or constitution. You may also have to create a budget for your club. Fill out the form with your fellow club members and faculty adviser so the application is as detailed and accurate as it can possibly be."

      "title": "Describe the inner-workings of your club.",
      "content": "Describe the inner-workings of your club. Start by outlining the purpose and objectives of your club, and your overall mission. Then, write down how your club will elect or choose leaders, and how club members are expected to behave. You might also have to create a club budget. For example, your club might hold elections once a semester, and membership might be capped at 30 students. If you’re running a chemistry club, the purpose might be “to study and practice chemistry,” and the mission might be “to create a safe, productive environment where students can learn more about chemistry.”"

      "title": "Outline your club’s goals first.",
      "content": "Outline your club’s goals first. Think about what your club is for, and what you’d like to do. Once you’ve outlined your club’s goals, brainstorm how you plan on achieving them. These suggestions and ideas will be a good starting point for your budget. [10] X Research source For a wiffle ball club, a goal could be: “We will get together for wiffle ball games twice a month.” For a political club, a goal could be: “We will buy a web domain and post blog entries about our opinions.”"

      "title": "Draft a list of funding requests.",
      "content": "Draft a list of funding requests. Think about the upcoming events and meetings your club will have. Write out a general list with all these general funding requests, so you have a good starting point. [11] X Research source For instance, you might fill out a funding request for a museum trip. In this request, you’d ask for money for transportation, and possibly admission to the museum. Don’t forget about marketing! If you plan on creating fliers or other advertisements, include those in your budget."

    {
      "title": "Go into detail about each funding request.",
      "content": "Go into detail about each funding request. Explain what you’ll need to buy for each meeting and event, and how much these items will cost. Then, add up all of the costs, so your school knows how much money the club needs each semester. Transfer this information to a spreadsheet, so it’s really easy to navigate. [12] X Research source For instance, if your club is holding an ice cream social, you’d need money for ice cream, toppings, and silverware."

      "title": "Hang up fliers around your school.",
      "content": "Hang up fliers around your school. Ask your school if you can post ads for your new club, and where you’re allowed to post them. On these fliers, let students know when and where your club is meeting. [13] X Research source You might be able to advertise your club during the morning announcements, or hand out customized business cards. Chat with your school administration to see what your options are."

      "content": "Assign or elect leaders. Chat with the members and see how they’d like the club to run. You might assign leadership roles, or you could host a club election where people run for leadership positions, like President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. [14] X Research source If your club is especially large, you could offer extra leadership roles."

      "content": "Yes, many places let schools charge fees for clubs. This is also known as “Pay-for-Play,” and is a hot topic in the education community. Some places are okay with club fees, while other places, like New York, California, and Oklahoma, banned these extra charges. [15] X Research source Double-check with your school administration to see what their policy is."
