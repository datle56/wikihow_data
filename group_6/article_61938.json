If your trainers are made of nylon or canvas, your days of unnecessary elbow grease are over! [1] X Research source Unfortunately, other materials, like mesh and fake leather, are best cleaned by hand. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Pull the laces out of the shoes. Start at the bottom of each shoe’s tongue and begin tugging on the center portion of the lace. Depending on how tight your laces are tied, you probably won’t be able to pull out the laces in one fell swoop. Instead, work on each lace eyelet, tugging and loosening the laces until the whole string can be pulled out easily. [3] X Research source Laces can go in the washing machine with the shoes, or you can clean them separately. If you choose to wash your laces in the machine, be sure to put them in a mesh laundry bag before starting the wash cycle. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Take out any removable insoles. Feel around the bottom of your shoe for any loose pieces. Although removable insoles are washable, consider keeping them out of the cycle. If nothing feels removable, then your shoes are ready to go in the washing machine. [5] X Research source For example, if your soles are made out of foam, they might become warped after being placed in the washer. [6] X Research source If your insoles are especially smelly, consider cleaning them ."

      "content": "Remove any excess or dried dirt from the shoes over a waste bin. Take your shoes outside or hold them over a trash can to begin removing any extra dirt. If they look a little worse for wear, set aside a few minutes of your day to get rid of any obvious grime. Prevent an entire soccer field of dirt from getting into your washing machine by using a damp cloth to wipe any dust or clumps of dirt from the trainers. [7] X Research source Knock the shoes against each other to make larger clumps of dirt fall off."

      "content": "Coat the trainers with spot-treatment spray before putting them in the machine. If your trainers look really dirty or have tough stains embedded in the fabric, pre-treat them with a spot-treatment spray. The spray is particularly useful if your trainers are white.

      "content": "Place your de-laced trainers in the washing machine with 1-2 towels. Place them into your washer, but be sure to place some other items into your machine as well. It isn’t a good idea to machine wash shoes by yourself, so consider throwing some old towels. Make sure that they’re items you don’t mind washing with your dirty shoes! [9] X Research source If you don’t want to use towels, try using blankets or sweatshirts."

      "content": "Put the laces in a washable mesh bag and put them in the machine Take the string of shoelaces and place them in a washer-safe bag with the trainers and towels. Mesh materials are great to use, since they filter the detergent into the bag while preventing the laces from tangling around the shoes. In a pinch, a pillowcase can work as well. [10] X Research source If you want to wash your laces separately, place them in a small bowl of water mixed with a stain removing agent. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour a coin-sized amount of gentle detergent into the machine. Place a small amount of liquid detergent into the soap container of your washer. For trainers, a little goes a long way, so try to avoid pouring in an excess amount of product. [12] X Research source Depending on the style of your washing machine, the soap container might be in a different place. Front loading machines generally have an extendable drawer for the detergent on the front side, while top loading machines have a specific spot for the detergent, or you can add the detergent directly to the drum. [13] X Research source Some machines have containers for fabric softener and bleach. Make sure that you’re pouring the detergent into the right section."

Since you don’t want your shoes to wear out during their stay in the washing machine, make sure that the machine is only doing the bare minimum. Use the delicate cycle on your machine, or aim for the lowest spin speed possible. [14] X Research source Double check that the water is cold, or around 20 °C (68 °F). [15] X Research source"

As tempting as it may be to dry out your shoes within an hour, the process won’t do you any favors. [16] X Research source Instead, most drying cycles will wear down your trainers, making them uncomfortable (if not impossible) to wear altogether. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Place your washed trainers and laces in front of an open air source. Let your shoes air-dry to get rid of any water. While they likely won’t be dripping wet at the end of the wash cycle, it’s still a good idea to let them dry gradually. Open a window or use a fan if you’re in a greater rush to wear your trainers again. [18] X Research source If you’d prefer, an air conditioning vent or dehumidifier are also speedy alternatives to get rid of any moisture. Hang up your laces so they can receive a lot of open air, as this will speed up the drying process."

      "content": "Let the shoes and laces dry completely before you wear them. Wait until your trainers and laces are no longer damp to the touch before re-lacing your shoes and wearing them again. It may take at least half a day for your shoes and laces to be dry enough to wear. [19] X Research source If possible, fold the tongue over the toe of the shoe to speed up the drying process."
