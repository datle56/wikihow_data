As its name suggests, it’s designed for cars traveling in both directions to use it to make a turn. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "It’s for drivers to make a left turn or a U-turn if it’s allowed. The center turning lane is intended to be used for drivers to make left turns into driveways, parking lots, and other roads. You can also use the lane to make a U-turn if you need to travel in the opposite direction on the road. But look for signs that say that U-turns aren’t allowed before you do so you aren’t violating any traffic laws. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use your turn signal, slow down, and merge into the lane when it’s clear. Look over your left shoulder to make sure there isn’t a vehicle in the lane. Put on your turn signal so other drivers know that you plan to slow down and move into the turning lane. Slow your vehicle down, move into the center turning lane, and come to a stop. If the road is clear, you can make your turn! [3] X Research source Flip your blinker on about 100 feet (30 m) before you plan on turning.

      "content": "Enter the lane about 100 yards (91 m) or so before your turn. Some regions may have traffic laws that provide specific distances, while others may say a “reasonable” distance. Don’t enter the center turning lane multiple blocks away from your turn. You could actually get a ticket if you travel in the lane for too long. Stick to a reasonable distance and use the lane when your turn is coming up. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "No, it’s unlawful to use the turning lane as a merge lane.",
      "content": "No, it’s unlawful to use the turning lane as a merge lane. The center turning lane is meant to only be used for turning. If you use it for something else, such as merging or passing, you’re violating traffic laws and you could receive a hefty fine. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "It means you can only make a left turn.",
      "content": "It means you can only make a left turn. The two arrows on the center turning lane only sign can be a little confusing and make you think that you can turn either left or right. But it actually means you can only use the lane to make a left turn. Don’t use the lane for things like passing a vehicle or speeding up so you can merge into the road. [7] X Research source Some center lanes may also have two arrows painted on the pavement. They mean the same thing as a center lane only sign: you can only use the lane to make a left turn!"
