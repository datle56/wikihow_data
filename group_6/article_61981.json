In it the villainous Iago, who betrays Othello, the main character, says the line, “I will wear my heart upon my sleeve.” In the context of the play, Iago is confessing his crimes to the audience, and says that by doing so, he’s making his guilt clear and inviting punishment. [2] X Research source “‘It is as sure as you are Roderigo, / Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago. / In following him, I follow but myself; / Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, / But seeming so, for my peculiar end; / For when my outward action doth demonstrate / The native act and figure of my heart / In compliment extern, ’tis not long after / But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve / For daws to peck at. I am not what I am.’”"
