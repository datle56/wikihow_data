      "title": "Buy or gather some raw, unsalted, hulled sunflower seeds.",
      "content": "Buy or gather some raw, unsalted, hulled sunflower seeds. Hulled sunflower seeds — those without shells — will sprout more quickly. If you can only gather unhulled sunflower seeds, collect these in a bowl and allow them to soak overnight. In the morning, toss the seeds then pour them into a strainer. Try to pick out hulls as you go. Do not worry if some hulls remain."

      "content": "Allow the jar to sit for about eight hours. During this period, the seeds should begin to sprout. Wait until the seeds have nearly doubled in size and the sprout has begun to emerge. When sprouting sunflower seeds, always periodically check them so that you do not allow them to soak for too long."

      "content": "Wait. Let them sit in the jar, in a warm or room temperature location with no direct sunlight, for one to three days until they've finished sprouting. Rinse them and return them to the jar one or two times a day until they are done. You can also use a special sprouting bag instead of the original jar. Place the sprouting seeds into the sprouting bag and hang it over a sink or other area to allow draining. Continue to rinse every five hours or so."

From the time you take them into the sun, it takes roughly another two days for them to be ready to eat. Shorter if it's very warm where you live. Try them in salads, sushi, soup, or sandwiches. Enjoy!"

      "title": "Consider sprouting or growing greens.",
      "content": "Consider sprouting or growing greens. Either method will work for germinating sunflowers for planting, but you can also use the traditional plant germinating method that follows. Sunflowers are notoriously difficult to get to grow straight in their final location and are a favorite snack for birds. Sprouting them before planting might improve your chances of keeping them alive."

Consider planting them along a fence or your house, or behind some sturdy trees, to shield them from the wind. Keep in mind that sunflowers planted in pots will not grow as big as sunflowers planted in the ground. Sunflowers are drought-tolerant, but you should ensure they get plenty of water while they establish their roots. They can also survive in wet, humid weather, but you will need to make sure they are planted in well-draining soil, like a sand or loam mixture. [2] X Research source"
