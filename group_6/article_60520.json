      "content": "Put the biltong in a brown paper bag and store it in a dry cool, place. Wet biltong can quickly go bad if it doesn’t have good circulation, so store it in a clean, dry paper bag. This not only allows air to touch the biltong, it also dries the meat out even more. Keep the bag in a dark, cool area. [1] X Research source You can leave the bag out on the counter or in a cabinet, as long as it’s less than 70 °F (21 °C) and out of the sun. Keep the bag closed to help prevent pests. Usually, biltong is sold in slices or sticks. If you have a large piece of uncut biltong, you can store it in a paper bag or wrapped in newspaper."

[2] X Research source For dryer biltong, like stokkies, you only need to stir it once a day. [3] X Research source Mixing up the biltong allows all sides of the meat to be exposed to the air and reduces the risk of mold."

      "content": "Clean and dry your container and make sure the biltong is dry. Any excess moisture will speed up the meat’s decay, so pat dry the biltong with a kitchen towel and use a completely clean, dry container. [5] X Research source Use a wooden bowl if you can, and a plastic container only if you don’t have anything else."

      "content": "Partially fill the container and cover it with a paper towel. Don’t pack the biltong too tightly and leave some space at the top of the container so there’s good air circulation. Cover the top with a paper towel or piece of cloth. [6] X Research source If you are using a jar, seal the paper towel around the top with a rubber band. Sealing the container with a lid traps moisture and can cause the biltong to grow mold more quickly. Eat the biltong within a few days of opening to prevent it from going bad."

[7] X Research source Check the best-by date to ensure you eat it before it goes bad. You can also vacuum seal opened biltong (along with 1-2 oxygen absorbers ) and store it in the fridge. You can also keep open biltong in a paper bag in the fridge for around a week. Since fridges don’t have good air circulation, keep it on the counter or in a cupboard if you can."

      "content": "Check that it’s still good before eating. Open biltong lasts longer in the fridge, but probably not more than a week. Biltong mold is fluffy, white, or green. Since biltong is cured in salt, it may have white spots that aren’t actually mold. [9] X Research source If they’re crusty and flake off when you scratch them with a fingernail, they’re likely just salt. Don’t eat moldy sliced biltong. Vacuum sealed biltong can also grow mold, but it takes much longer (around 6 months)."

      "content": "Rinse uncut moldy biltong in vinegar and water, then let it dry. If your sliced biltong has gotten moldy, it’s sadly too late for it. However, if you have a large slab, wash off the mold with a solution of 30% vinegar and 70% water. Wipe it dry and hang it up again. [13] X Research source If the mold doesn’t come off, throw the biltong away. Small pieces of biltong have a small surface area to volume ratio, so mold is more likely to have infected the entire thing than if it was a large, uncut piece."
