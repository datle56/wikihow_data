      "content": "A composite chart blends charts into 1 while a synastry chart compares them separately. Synastry charts are also called comparison charts because you simply look back and forth between 2 people's birth charts to find similar planet placements. A composite chart blends 2 people's charts together by calculating the midpoint between their planets. This actually creates a whole new chart that just represents the relationship, not the individuals. [5] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. A synastry chart won't show you the dynamics or shared values of the relationship, since the information it gives just deals with the individuals. You might have also heard of a bi-wheel compatibility chart. To make this chart, you print off each person's birth chart and stack them on top of each other to look for similarities. It won't combine the energies of the chart as a composite chart does, but it can give you an idea of how you two work together."
