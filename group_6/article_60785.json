      "content": "Give your baby 3 to 5 minutes of tummy time 2 to 3 times a day. By playing on their bellies, babies can develop the muscles in their arms, legs, shoulders, back, torso, and neck that help them learn how to crawl. When you’re baby reaches 2 months old, increase their time to 15 to 30 minutes of tummy time daily. [1] X Research source Most babies can start tummy time sessions a day or two after they’re born, but the best time to start is when your child can pick their head up on their own. [2] X Research source Spread out a blanket on a clear area of the floor and place a rolled-up towel or blanket under your baby’s arms to help them prop themselves up sightly. [3] X Research source Put a toy or two within the baby’s reach to encourage them to interact with their surroundings and let them experiment with exploring on their own. [4] X Research source Supervise tummy time sessions at all times and try to have someone you trust sit in front of the baby to encourage bonding.

Sit with your baby in between your legs or on a blanket and gently encourage them to reach for toys that are just out of reach on either side of their body. [7] X Research source This can not only motivate them to move around, but improve their motor development. [8] X Research source Encourage your baby to look up and strengthen their back, neck, and shoulder muscles by placing toys slightly above their line of sight. Leaning, reaching, and twisting to the side can also help your baby get used to the feeling of rotating and putting light pressure on their arms and shoulders. [9] X Research source As your child gets more confident on their hands or knees, try encouraging them to reach for toys that might roll away when touched, like a soft ball, to get them to start moving forward. [10] X Research source Optionally, hold a mirror just out of reach of your baby and encourage them to move forward to get a closer look."

If your baby doesn’t crawl with their hands and knees yet, you can put them in the position, support their belly with your leg or a rolled-up towel or blanket, and have them reach for toys to play with. This can get them used to the crawling position and gain strength in their arms, neck, back, and shoulders. [11] X Research source As your baby’s muscles get stronger, you might be able to remove your leg or towel and use your hands to gently support their hips or tummy while they move.

Although walkers can encourage babies to move around, if they spend a lot of time in them they might get used to standing on their tiptoes, which can delay walking. Spending a lot of time in car seats or carriers can also delay your baby’s ability to sit up and look around on their own. [15] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Walkers can also be potentially dangerous and may cause injury. [16] X Research source If you do use a walker, bouncer, or seat, try to limit your baby’s time in it to no more than 20 minutes at a time.

While your baby is in tummy time or when they’re starting to move or shuffle around on their own, try to stand or sit away from them and encourage them to crawl towards you or reach to grab something from you.

      "content": "The average age for a baby to crawl is between 7 to 12 months. However, some babies crawl earlier or later. [19] X Research source If you notice your baby is using only one side of their body to crawl or you’re concerned about your child’s developmental progress, contact their health provider. [20] X Research source Babies who are slow to crawl might just be busy working on other skills or they may prefer to sit and explore the world by sight or touch. Like adults, babies have their own unique preferences and interests. If your child is bigger or heavier than is typical for their age, they might crawl later because it can be more challenging to push up and move that extra body weight. As long as your baby is moving both their legs and arms equally and has strong coordination, there’s probably no need to worry. [21] X Research source Some research shows that up to 15% of babies skip the crawling stage altogether and go straight to walking. [22] X Research source"

      "content": "Your baby may be ready to crawl if they want to sit up and roll over. Every baby is different and follows their own timeline, but the most common sign your baby is ready to move is when they begin to sit up and roll over. They might even get up on their hands and knees and rock back and forth, wiggle on their tummy, or scoot around on their bottom. [23] X Research source If your baby can’t support their head or sit up on their own, they might not be ready to crawl around on all-fours yet. Try not to force your baby to crawl before they’re ready. Every baby develops at their own pace and pushing them to learn a skill they aren’t ready for might delay their learning.

Your baby is just learning what works for them, and that’s totally fine. Some of the most common crawling styles for babies include: [25] X Research source The Classic Crawl: This is the traditional way babies crawl, where they alternate using one hand on one side of their body and one knee on the other to move forward. The Reverse Crawl: Your baby might scoot or crawl backward, pushing with their feet, hands, or bottom to get to where they’d like to go. The Downward Dog: This one is like the classic crawl, but your baby keeps their knees off the ground and moves with their hands and feet. The Crab Walk: Your baby might sit upright, bend one knee, and extend the opposite leg to scoot their butt forward. The Commando: Your baby might lie flat on their tummy and drag themselves forward using their arms. The Rolly Polly: Your baby rolls to get to where they need to go. The Walker: Your baby skips the crawling stage altogether and goes straight to walking."

Use outlet covers on any open outlets. Install baby gates on the top and bottom of all staircases. Place locks on toilet seats. Move any houseplants or fragile knick-knacks out of the baby’s reach. Install cabinet and drawer locks. Place corner guards on any short tables. Anchor your dressers, bookshelves, TV stands, and other large furniture with wall brackets. Keep window blind cords tucked somewhere up high. Use door knob covers and appliance locks to keep babies from opening doors. Set up a fireplace gate to baby-proof the fireplace . Store medicines, cleaning products, and other potential poisons out of your baby’s reach. Use a stove guard to protect your baby’s hands as they learn to walk."
