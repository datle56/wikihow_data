      "content": "Use a tub big enough to accommodate both feet. Soaking your feet in warm water softens the skin and nails so that they’re easier to groom. Just fill a small, clean tub or bucket with a few inches of warm water and slip your feet in.

      "content": "Scrub the bottoms and tops of your feet, as well as between your toes. The foot brush is the bristled tool in your pedicure kit. Use a gentle, circular motion to scrub your feet so you get them nice and clean. You can apply a little soap to the brush if you like. Instead of a brush, your kit may come with a foam foot buffer that’s more like a rough sponge. You can use it the same way you would a foot brush. [3] X Research source To keep your brush clean and sanitary, rinse it under warm running water after you're finishing using it. Then, soak it in rubbing alcohol overnight to disinfect it."

      "content": "Apply the scrub to each foot individually and massage your skin. The foot scrub will slough away rough, dead skin and help your feet feel baby soft. Be thorough—massage the scrub on the top and bottom of each foot as well in between your toes. Dunk your feet in the tub to rinse off the scrub. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a pumice stone",
      "content": "Use a pumice stone to smooth rough skin and calluses. The pumice stone is the rough black or gray stone in your kit (your kit may have a paddle-shaped foot file with a rough black side; that’s pumice stone). Use a gentle circular motion to scrub tough areas like your heels, the sides of your big toes, and the balls of your feet. [5] X Research source If you have any calluses, gently work on them with the foot file or pumice stone. Avoid rubbing too hard, since you don’t want to break the skin! Aim to smooth the skin (rather than trying to fully remove the callus)."

      "title": "The callus shaver is very sharp, so handle it with care.",
      "content": "The callus shaver is very sharp, so handle it with care. Callus shavers (sometimes called corn planes) allow you to slice through the thickened skin to remove a corn or callus. The tool's handle looks similar to a spoon or fork, with a stainless steel double-sided blade on the other end. Place the blade flat against your skin and gently swipe the tool over the callused area without applying any pressure. The blade will grab the top layer of skin and remove it. [6] X Research source Go slow and be gentle if you decide to use this tool. When used correctly, you shouldn't experience any discomfort, pain, or bleeding. Avoid using this tool on minor calluses. Save it for tough calluses or corns that don't get any better after you use a pumice stone or foot file."

      "title": "The orange stick is a thin wooden or plastic stick with a pointy end.",
      "content": "The orange stick is a thin wooden or plastic stick with a pointy end. Since the warm water soak softened up your cuticles, you only need to use a gentle pushing motion with the pointed end of the stick to push each cuticle back from the toenail. [7] X Research source Pushing back your cuticles is safer than cutting them (cutting can lead to infections). It also enhances the appearance of the nail beds so your toes look well-groomed. If your kit came with a cuticle cutter or nipper, you can use the tool to safely trim any hangnails you have. If your cuticles feel dry, rub a small amount of cuticle oil into them."

      "content": "Use a straight edged pair of toenail clippers for the best results. Trimming straight across helps to prevent ingrown toenails. Try to trim your toenails about even with the skin at the tips of your toes. Avoid trimming lower than that, since this can be painful and cause bleeding.

      "content": "Use a toe nail file to even out the edges and shape them. Use swift movements in one direction as you’re filing; avoid filing back and forth. It’s also important to hold the file flat against the nail, not at an angle (filing at an angle can weaken your nails). It’s totally up to you whether you want rounded toenails or a more squared look! [9] X Research source Avoid rounding out your toenails too much. Try to keep the edges of your toenails above the level of the skin to prevent ingrown toenails .

Apply your favorite nail polish and keep your toe separator in place until the polish is dry, which usually takes 10-15 minutes. [13] X Research source To speed things up, apply a quick-drying top coat over your polish. After about 60 seconds, you can remove the toe separator."
