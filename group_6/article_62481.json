      "title": "Exposure to direct sunlight.",
      "content": "Exposure to direct sunlight. The most likely reason a phone would overheat is extended exposure to direct sunlight. Whenever your phone heats up, it may quickly lose battery as well. If you are sitting outside on a hot summer day, consider leaving your phone inside or protecting it inside a purse or bag. If left exposed to the heat for too long, your phone's internal components can become permanently damaged. Never charge your phone while in direct sunlight. This will cause your battery to overheat and could permanently damage it."

      "title": "The CPU/GPU is overloaded.",
      "content": "The CPU/GPU is overloaded. If you are trying to run too many apps at once on your phone, the CPU may overload, causing the phone to heat up and use a lot of battery power. Likewise, streaming videos or playing games on your phone for several hours can put a lot of pressure on the GPU, making your phone hot and your battery run out faster. Other elements of your phone that rely on your CPU/GPU and could contribute to a hot phone with battery loss include: Using your phone while the screen brightness is high. Using a live or animated wallpaper or widget. Extended use of the camera app."

      "title": "Malware or virus infection.",
      "content": "Malware or virus infection. Clicking certain links or downloading fake apps can plant malware on your phone. Certain malware can make your CPU or GPU work harder than usual, increasing the temperature of these components and making your battery work harder. These viruses are frequently found on crypto mining sites, so be careful if you choose to mine for cryptocurrency."

      "title": "Your phone is installing a software update.",
      "content": "Your phone is installing a software update. It is very common for a phone to overheat while downloading or installing a software update, especially if your phone has to address a bug in the process. Do not worry if your phone heats up while updating, but consider bringing the phone to a repair shop if it does not cool down after the fact. To avoid battery drain during an Android or iPhone update, keep your phone plugged in until the update is complete."

      "title": "Remove your phone from direct sunlight and heat.",
      "content": "Remove your phone from direct sunlight and heat. If your issue is related to a hot environment, move your Android or iPhone to a cooler location. In most cases, the phone will cool down on its own. If you often need to use your phone in a hot car , consider buying a phone mount that attaches to your air conditioner vent."

      "title": "Close apps you aren't using.",
      "content": "Close apps you aren't using. If you have several apps running in the background on your Android or iPhone that you do not need, close them. If the problem is related to an app on your phone, closing apps should preserve your battery and cool down your phone. Consider force-stopping all such apps after closing them. Prioritize closing out of apps that consume a lot of CPU/GPU, such as the camera app, games, and media streaming apps."

      "content": "Limit background processes like Bluetooth or data roaming. If your phone is overheating and losing battery, it is best to disable any background processes you are not currently using. Bluetooth and data roaming, for example, can drain a lot of battery when enabled if they are not being actively used. [1] X Research source"
