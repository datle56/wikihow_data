      "title": "A waxing gibbous’ light is increasing and over halfway illuminated.",
      "content": "A waxing gibbous’ light is increasing and over halfway illuminated. As the moon makes its orbit around Earth, the amount of it that is illuminated and visible on Earth changes. When the moon is waxing, the portion that is lit up is increasing. So, during the waxing gibbous phase, you see more than half of the moon’s surface illuminated. This phase lasts about 5 to 7 days before the moon transitions into a full moon. [1] X Research source The waxing gibbous moon is illuminated on the right side while a small portion of the left side is dark. During this phase, the dark, left side gets smaller. The waxing gibbous moon is the phase between the first quarter moon, where the right half of the moon is visible, and the full moon, where the entire moon is illuminated. The waxing gibbous moon is the most visible from 3 pm to 3 am. Gibbous means “humped-back.” The illuminated portion of the moon looks like a rounded semi-circle. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "The waxing gibbous moon symbolizes finishing up a project. As the light of the moon increases into a full moon, so does your closeness to the culmination and completion of all your hard work. This waxing gibbous moon gives you the perseverance to make a final push to accomplish your goals. Use this phase to buckle down, focus on your tasks, and tie up any loose ends. You’re making huge strides to achieve your dreams, which you’ll be able to celebrate once the moon is full. [5] X Research source If you tend to feel stressed during the waxing gibbous phase, you’re not alone—many people find it to be one of the more difficult times of the month. Relieve your stress by taking breaks and breaking your tasks into manageable chunks. Then, take time for a walk or to enjoy a good book or show. While the waxing gibbous moon is about making 1 final push, don’t work so hard that you burn yourself out. Some projects take several moon cycles to complete, so this is your opportunity to check off smaller tasks."

      "content": "The moon has 8 phases that it cycles through over 29.5 days. The cycle starts with the new moon, which is invisible to you on Earth. It then begins to wax, with its illumination increasing on the right side. This culminates in the full moon, where the entire moon is visible. The moon then wanes and the illumination on the left side decreases as darkness creeps up on the right. This brings it back to the new moon and starts the cycle again. The individual moon phases are: [15] X Research source New moon : the moon is invisible because the illuminated side only faces the sun. Waxing crescent : a sliver of the moon is visible on the right side and its illumination is slowly increasing. First quarter : half of the moon is visible: the right half is illuminated and the left is not. This is called the first quarter because the moon is ¼ of its way through its orbit. Waxing gibbous : over half of the right side of the moon is visible. Full moon : the entire side of the moon that faces Earth is illuminated and visible. Waning gibbous : over half of the left side of the moon is visible, but the illumination is starting to decrease. Third quarter : half of the moon is visible: the left half is illuminated and the right is not. Waning crescent : only a sliver of the moon is visible on the left half. One-half of the moon is always dark and not illuminated by the sun. You never see the dark side of the moon on Earth."

Astrologists believe that blood moons bring change, disruption, and chaos. Supermoon : Occurs when a full moon gets unusually close to earth, making it look larger.

In astrology, Mars represents aggression, energy, drive, and sexuality. Saturn : The sixth planet from the sun in our solar system. Astrologically, Saturn represents hard work, discipline, responsibility, and karma. Pluto : Formerly the ninth planet in our solar system, until it was redefined as a dwarf planet.
