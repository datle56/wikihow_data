      "content": "Give your knee a break. If your knee is inflamed you should give it as much rest as possible. Activity on the knee will only increase inflammation. Rest will give your body a chance to heal the underlying cause. Rest your knee as much as possible. Most people still need to walk and do simple movements with a knee that has inflammation. If this is the case for you, at least try to avoid strenuous activity on the knee. If the inflammation has not improved after 1-2 days, you should see your doctor."

      "title": "Apply cold to the area.",
      "content": "Apply cold to the area. Inflammation can be reduced by icing the knee. Reducing the temperature of the area constricts blood vessels, which reduces swelling. It also decreases pain by numbing the area. Apply an ice pack for 15 minutes of every hour. Doing this for 3 to 4 hours in a row will reduce inflammation drastically. [1] X Research source You can use an actual ice pack to reduce inflammation. However, a bag of frozen vegetables works just as well. Wrap the frozen bag with a towel to protect your skin from the cold."

      "title": "Compress the area.",
      "content": "Compress the area. Putting some compression on a knee that has inflammation can prevent or reduce swelling. Compress the knee area by wrapping it in a compression bandage. Compression bandages are available at most drug stores and big box stores. [2] X Expert Source Jonathan Frank, MD Sports Orthopedic Surgeon & Joint Preservation Specialist Expert Interview. 31 July 2020. Be sure that you don't wrap the area too tight. A very tight bandage can cut off circulation to the rest of the limb. To make sure it's not too tight, ensure that you can slip one of your fingers under the bandage and lift the finger slightly. Also, if your toes or feet start to become numb, it is a sign that you need to loosen the wrap. Give yourself a break from the wrap every few hours. Wrapping your knee can also help to support the knee if you do need to walk on it. [3] X Research source"

Eliminate activities that aggravate your inflammation, such as high-impact exercises like running or tennis. [6] X Research source A lot of inflammation is rooted in injuries to tendons and muscles around the knee. High-impact exercises can exacerbate old injuries to these areas because of the force these activities exert on the joints. Similarly, daily activities can exacerbate knee problems for those who have conditions like arthritis. Scale back your activities to accommodate your needs."

This will allow the doctor to prescribe treatments that are tailored to your specific problem. [11] X Research source If you have repeated bouts of inflammation from an injury or condition like arthritis, talk to your doctor about them when you go in for a checkup. They may be able to give some suggestions about how to prevent and treat the problem. Knee inflammation can be broken down into acute and chronic.
