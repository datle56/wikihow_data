      "content": "One minute he’s all over you, and the next he pulls away. He might tell you how much he likes you and then go radio silent for a couple of days. Or he might flatter and flirt with you a ton but not ask you out again. When a guy goes hot and cold, it's either his way of trying to slow things down, or it's an unhealthy tactic to get you to chase him. Here’s how to handle hot and cold behavior: [1] X Research source If you’ve just met, give him time and space. Wait for him to reach out, and focus on yourself in the meantime. By not engaging in his games, you’re showing that you know your worth and won’t tolerate coldness. If you’ve been dating for a while, describe how his behavior makes you feel and ask for the behavior you’d like to see instead. For example, “I feel hurt and confused when you get distant. Could talk about what’s going on and schedule regular time together so we can connect more?” [2] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 2603 wikiHow readers, and 51% of them agreed that the best way to reconnect with a guy who has pulled away is to give him space and wait for him to reach out .

      "content": "Wait before jumping to conclusions when a guy gives mixed signals over text. He might send a text like “Hey how’s it going?” and then not respond after you reply. Or, he might like all your social media posts but not reply to your texts. Waiting’s not easy, but it’s normal for guys to respond a few hours later, as long as they reply within the same day. [3] X Research source But if he repeatedly doesn’t make an effort in his texts, here’s what you can do: If you don’t know each other well, check out his texting patterns over a few days. Look to see if he regularly starts conversations with you—that’s a good sign he’s really interested! If your guy ghosts you or leaves you on read more than a couple of times, your best bet is to move on. [4] X Research source If you’re dating, let him know that you’d like more consistent communication. Say something like, “I’d love it if we could check in over text once a day or so. How do you feel about that?”"

      "title": "He might be busy or disinterested if he doesn't communicate post-date.",
      "content": "He might be busy or disinterested if he doesn't communicate post-date. You two might go on an amazing date or a couple of dates and really feel like you’re clicking. But then, after the next fun outing together, you stop hearing from him. That kind of emotional whiplash can leave you wondering what’s going on! Here’s how to decode this classic mixed signal: [5] X Research source If you don’t want to text first, wait up to 3 days after the date and see if he texts you. Some guys might still be operating under the outdated assumption that they have to wait a certain amount of time before asking for a second date. [6] X Research source Reach out to him and take the initiative. Pick up the conversation where you left off by bringing up something from your date, and mention hanging out again. You could send a message like, “Hey, I still can’t believe you beat me at foosball. Can I get a rematch?”"

      "title": "Pay attention to how he makes it up to you after canceling plans.",
      "content": "Pay attention to how he makes it up to you after canceling plans. It certainly doesn’t feel good when someone cancels on you. Still, if he gives you a genuine apology and reschedules, he probably had a legitimate reason for canceling. However, look out if he doesn’t try to reschedule or if his flakiness becomes a pattern. [7] X Research source Here’s how to deal with flaky mixed signals: Set boundaries for what you will and won’t accept in your dating life. [8] X Research source Ask yourself, “If this behavior were still happening in one year, would I be okay with it?” If the answer’s no, it’s a good idea to address the situation. [9] X Research source Assert your boundaries by expressing what’s important to you, rather than blaming him. For instance, you could say something like, “I’d really like it if you could stick to our plans. That way I know when I’ll get to see you because I really value our time together.”"

      "content": "Sometimes it’s normal for your romantic date nights to change. As the relationship goes on, you two might end up staying in to watch a movie or ordering takeout rather than going out. Yes, it might feel like a mixed signal when a guy stops planning romantic dates, but it doesn’t immediately mean he’s lost interest. Here’s how to tell where you stand: [10] X Research source If you just met and you’ve noticed he prefers to “Netflix and chill” rather than go out, he might not be interested in a committed relationship. This is especially true if your conversations tend to stay pretty superficial or sexual in nature. [11] X Research source If you’ve been dating for a while, try to reignite the romance. Ask your guy if he’s down to try a new hobby with you, check out a new restaurant, or boost the romantic ambiance on your next date night with some candles and music. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Most people make the relationship official after 3 months of dating. Labeling the relationship means that you’re willing to make a commitment to each other (and it often means you’ll be exclusive). [13] X Research source So it can be absolutely gut-wrenching when a guy says he likes you but “isn’t ready” or doesn’t want to label your relationship. After all, studies show defining the relationship boosts relationship satisfaction. [14] X Research source If your guy won’t label the relationship, take a deep breath. You’ve got plenty of options: Give him time and focus on building trust. Some people find it hard to commit because of past relationship issues, and they just move at a slower pace.

He might not know whether or not it’s important to you to be exclusive and DTR. Say something like, “I’d really like to make our relationship official. How do you feel about that?” End the relationship if you two can’t agree. Sometimes, couples just don’t work out because of differing expectations. If you can’t find common ground, just remember there’s someone else out there for you."

      "content": "Be wary of jealous guys who don’t want to commit. It’s a huge sign of immaturity if a guy who doesn’t want to define the relationship gets jealous when you talk to other people. Relationships are about putting in equal effort, so jealousy from a noncommittal guy represents a double standard. Here’s some guidance for where to draw the line with jealousy: [17] X Research source Move on if he gets jealous of your friends. It’s normal and good for your well-being to maintain healthy friendships. Leave the relationship if his jealous behavior crosses into demanding behavior or accusations."

In the meantime, here’s what you can do: [19] X Research source Try to encourage him to talk by saying, “If you ever want to talk, I’m here.” Build trust by expressing appreciation. For instance, you could say, “I’m so grateful for you, and I really appreciate that you were there for me today.” Be vulnerable and share your own feelings. You could say something like, “I had a really rough day at work today. I wanted to get your thoughts on what I should do.”"

      "content": "He might seem all-in but suddenly pull away when things get hard. A lack of follow-through and emotional support can mean he’s not really interested. On the flip side, this could also mean he's not mature enough to understand the time and energy he can realistically give in a relationship. [20] X Research source Since emotional validation and consistency are crucial parts of a relationship, here's what you can do to clear up this mixed signal: [21] X Research source Talk to your partner about how it feels when he doesn’t follow through and what you’d like to see him do differently. [22] X Research source Steer clear of guys who shower you with compliments and promises when you first start dating. That behavior is called “love bombing,” and it’s a technique narcissists use to get you to trust them. [23] X Research source"

      "content": "It’s not necessarily a bad thing if a guy is still friends with his ex. However, when his behavior makes you feel uncomfortable or insecure, it’s okay to speak up. [24] X Research source For instance, it's totally reasonable to be upset if your guy turns to his ex for emotional connection, since that could be a sign of unresolved feelings. In turn, those unresolved feelings can make it tough for him to move on and truly connect with you. [25] X Research source Try this out if he talks with his ex: Check in with how you feel about the relationship overall. Romantic jealousy tends to get worse when you already feel insecure or uncertain about a relationship. [26] X Research source Let him know the behavior bothers you. Say something like, “Seeing you talk with your ex makes me feel pretty insecure. Could we talk about this?”"

If he doesn’t want to kiss you or hold hands in public, he might just feel self-conscious or come from a different cultural background where PDA isn’t acceptable. [27] X Research source A lack of PDA isn’t anything to be worried about unless you notice he’s also not affectionate in private. [28] X Research source In either case, it’s worth checking in with him to see what’s behind this hot-and-cold behavior. Here’s how to do it: Just say something like, “I’ve noticed you’re not into holding hands in public. What are your comfort levels for PDA?” Check in with him before you try and touch him in public. For instance, you could ask, “Is it okay if I kiss you? Or should I wait?”"

When a guy loses interest in sex, he might be stressed out, he might have low testosterone, or he might just have a naturally lower libido. Since a lack of sex doesn’t equal a lack of attraction, here’s what you can do: [29] X Research source Wait for him to initiate sex and avoid criticizing or blaming him. [30] X Research source Engage in other forms of touch like cuddling and kissing, without expecting sex."
