      "content": "Rehydrate the willow shoots with water. In order to use willow shoots to weave, you'll need to rehydrate them to make them pliable. Soak the shoots in water for a few days, until they will easily bend without breaking."

      "title": "Cut the base shoots.",
      "content": "Cut the base shoots. Choose several thick shoots that will serve as the basket's base. Use a hand pruner to cut 8 pieces of willow of equal lengths. The size of your base willow pieces will determine the circumference of your basket's bottom. For a small basket, cut each length to 30 centimeter (11.8 in). For a medium basket, cut each length to 60 centimeter (23.6 in). For a large basket, cut each length to 90 centimeter (35.4 in). Tip: Baskets can be made with any type of pliable reed, grass, vine or branch, but willow is a popular choice because it creates such a sturdy basket when it dries. You can cut your own willow or buy dried willow shoots from a craft store. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Slit the centers of 4 of the pieces.",
      "content": "Slit the centers of 4 of the pieces. Start by laying one piece in front of you on your work surface. Use a very sharp knife to make a 5 centimeter (2.0 in) vertical slit in the center of the willow piece. Do the same with three more of the base pieces, so that you have 4 pieces with slits in the middle."

      "title": "Construct the slath.",
      "content": "Construct the slath. This is the foundation of the basket base. Line up the 4 slitted pieces so that the slits are adjacent. Thread the 4 remaining pieces through the slits so that they lie flat and are perpendicular to the slitted pieces. You now have a cross shape composed of the 4 slitted pieces threaded through with the other 4 base pieces. This is called a slath. Each limb of the slath is called a spoke."

    {
      "title": "Insert two weavers into the slath.",
      "content": "Insert two weavers into the slath. Find two long, thin shoots of similar length. Insert the ends of the shoots into the left edge of the horizontal slit in your slath, so that the small shoots extend outward next to one of the spokes. These two thinner shoots are called \"weavers.\" Weavers are woven around the spokes to create the basket shape."

      "title": "Do a pairing weave to secure the slath.",
      "content": "Do a pairing weave to secure the slath. \"Pairing\" is a type of weaving that uses two weavers, creating a secure base for your basket. Separate the weavers and bend them to the right over the adjacent spoke. Place one weaver over the spoke and one weaver under the spoke and gather them on the right side of the spoke. Now bring the bottom weaver up over the next spoke on the slath, and bring the top weaver under the spoke. Turn the slath and keep weaving, bringing the weaver that is now the bottom weaver over the next spoke, and the top weaver under the spoke. Keep pairing around the 4 spokes until you've created 2 rows. Make sure each twist in the weave goes in the same direction. Weave tightly so that the rows lie snugly next to each other."

      "title": "Separate the spokes.",
      "content": "Separate the spokes. The third time around, it's time to separate the individual spokes to form the round shape of you basket bottom. Now, instead of pairing around the grouped spokes, separate them and pair around each one individually using the exact same weaving method. It might help to first bend each spoke outward so that they fan out like bicycle spokes. Ensure each spoke is separated by the same amount of space before you start weaving. Continue pairing around the spokes until the basket base has reached the diameter you want."

      "title": "Add new weavers when necessary.",
      "content": "Add new weavers when necessary. When you run out of length and need to add a new weaver, select one as close as possible to the side of the old weaver. Use a knife to create a pointed tip on the new weaver. Insert it between the weave of the last two rows and bend it to follow the path of the old weaver. Make sure it's securely in place, then use the hand pruner to trim off the end of the old weaver. Continue weaving using the new weaver. Don't replace more than one weaver at a time. Replacing two or more weavers in the same place could create a weak spot in the basket."

      "content": "Stake up the basket. Choose 8 long, medium-sized willow shoots to serve as the basket's \"stakes.\" These are the vertical pieces that form the structure of the sides of the basket. Use your knife to sharpen the ends of the stakes into points. Insert a stake alongside each of your spokes, pushing each one down into the weave as close to the center as possible. Bend the stakes upward so that they are pointing toward the sky. Use the hand pruner to trim the spokes back so that they're level with the edge of the weave, then tie the stakes together at their tips to keep them in place."

Sharpen the ends into points. Insert the shoots into the base of the basket on the left side of three consecutive stakes. Now do two rows of the weave as follows: Bend the far left weaver to the right in front of two stakes. Pass it behind the third stake and out to the front. Take the next far left weaver and bend it to the right in front of two stakes. Pass it behind the third stake and out to the front. Continue weaving this way, always starting with the far left weaver, until you have two rows of three rod wale. Untie the stakes at the top."

Bend it over the next stake to the left, pass it behind the stake to the left of that one, and pass it back to the front. Now insert a second weaver behind the stake to the right of the starting point of your first weaver and do the same - pass it over the stake to the left, under the stake to the left of that one, and back to the front. Continue adding weavers this way until there is one weaver next to each stake. When you insert the last two weavers, you'll need to lift up the first weavers a bit to make room to add the last weavers underneath. Use an awl or a long nail. This type of weaving is called French Randing. It's a popular weave that results in even, upright sides."

Continue weaving this way around the whole basket, always starting with the next weaver to the right. When you get back to the start, you'll see that there are two weavers behind the last two stakes. Both weavers need to be woven around the stakes. Do the bottom weaver first, then do the top weaver. For the last stake, do the bottom weaver first, then the top weaver. Continue randing until you've built up the sides as high as you'd like them to go, then trim the tips of the weavers."

The last two stakes won't have other stakes to weave around, since they'll all be woven into the rim.
