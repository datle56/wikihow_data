      "content": "On TikTok, zesty has become a derogatory term for gay or effeminate men. It’s often used to describe videos of men or boys acting in a way that is stereotypically feminine. Using “zesty” to mock someone for behavior they categorize as “feminine” or “gay” makes it a homophobic and sexist term. This type of name-calling is a form of bullying that can cause emotional and psychological harm. [1] X Research source Using homophobic language to mock men and boys who don’t conform to rigid gender norms suggests there’s a “right” way to be a male person and that they are doing it wrong or there’s something shameful about what they’re doing. [2] X Research source As long as they aren’t doing someone harm, no one should be made to feel shameful for behaving in ways that feel natural to them. This type of language is also misogynistic, because it suggests that there’s something wrong with behavior that’s traditionally associated with women and girls."

      "content": "Avoid calling people zesty since it's homophobic and a form of bullying. “Zesty” is most frequently used as an offensive way to make fun of effeminate and gay men on TikTok. While in the past, people may have used “zesty” in a more positive way to mean energetic or fun, it’s now most commonly used as a derogatory term. Even if you don’t use “zesty” as a negative term, the popularity of the negative usage can make people think you’re using it that way, too. Some people may claim they’re just joking when they use “zesty” in an offensive manner. However, even when slurs are used as jokes, they support harmful ideas about gender norms and negatively affect perceptions of gay people. [3] X Research source Homophobic language is often used on social media to protect the idea of traditional masculinity when a man or boy has positive emotions, but that doesn’t make it okay.

      "content": "Not necessarily, although that's how it's most commonly being used on TikTok nowadays. “Zesty\" originally was used to describe flavorful food or lively behavior. According to dictionaries, it means something has a strong, pleasant, and spicy flavor, as in a “zesty taco.” Zesty can also be used to describe something lively and pleasing, like a “zesty sense of humor.” [5] X Research source Unfortunately, these are older definitions, and neither is the most popular way the term is being used on TikTok at the moment. Because “zesty” is so commonly used in a derogatory manner, it’s best not to use it to describe someone, which might be taken as homophobic or offensive. Outside of TikTok, “zesty” is still commonly used to describe flavorful food."
