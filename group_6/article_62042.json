      "content": "Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius are the air signs of the zodiac. In astrology, air is the element of intellect and communication. The three signs ruled by it are curious and social, meaning they tend to seek out stimulating ideas and compelling conversations from other people. They also have a strong sense of idealism and justice, and dislike mindlessly following status quos. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Air signs tend to mix well with fire signs and other air signs. As a rule of thumb, signs of the same element tend to get along because of their similar values and interests. In other words, air signs make good pairs with other air signs. However, the signs that air signs are considered most compatible with are actually the fire signs: Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. [2] X Research source More specifically, air and fire signs of matching modalities (cardinal, fixed, or mutable) blend best. Some of these pairings might seem really different, and in many ways, they are! They’re “complementary” because their differences bring out each other’s strengths. When thinking about compatibility, consider how elements interact with each other in nature. Air nourishes fire, has a neutral reaction with water, and is the polar opposite of earth. Pairings of polar opposite elements are complicated. At first, their differences might be exciting to each other, but over time, they can lead to serious disagreements, often making them the least compatible elements."

      "content": "Gemini and Sagittarius: Witty Gemini and jovial Sagittarius are both mutable signs, which makes them adaptable and easy to get along with. They’re both sociable signs, although Sagittarius is more of an entertainer, while Gemini is more interested in interpersonal interactions. Sagittarius is also more impulsive than analytical Gemini, though these differences only embolden their electric relationship. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Libra and Aries:",
      "content": "Libra and Aries: Affable Libra and outspoken Aries are both cardinal signs, meaning they’re active and confident, making them natural leaders. Where they differ and might learn from each other lies in Libra’s people-pleasing disposition and Aries’ unfiltered boldness and honesty. Though they might find themselves getting into disagreements over having their way, their constant challenging of each other ultimately makes them a stronger coupling.

      "title": "Aquarius and Leo:",
      "content": "Aquarius and Leo: Eccentric Aquarius and expressive Leo are both fixed signs, leading them to be somewhat stubborn people who like marching to the beat of their own drum. These two signs find a lot of similarity in their creativity and desire to inspire others. Their individuality can sometimes cause them to not see eye-to-eye, though the combination of Aquarius’ innovation and Leo’s romanticism can lead to a fascinating shared outlook on life. [5] X Research source Theoretically, they are compatible because Aquarius is related to the mind and Leo to the body."

      "content": "In addition to sun signs, moon signs have a huge effect on compatibility. Your sun sign, or the sign that’s determined by your birth date, dictates how you express yourself. This aspect of yourself obviously plays a large role in your relationships with other people. But if your sun sign isn't compatible with someone else’s sun sign, check to see if your moon signs align. Your moon sign determines your inner emotional self, which is also an important factor in relationships. [6] X Research source Compatibility between moon signs and their elements is especially significant when it comes to evaluating emotional commitment in long-term relationships. How the signs relate to each other is the same for moon signs as they are with sun signs. For example, air moons and fire moons tend to get along on a deep level."
