      "content": "Purchase or borrow a guitar. Decide whether you want to learn on an acoustic or electric guitar. Acoustic guitars don’t require an amp or cords, so they are easier to set up when you’re first starting. On the other hand, electric guitars are often easier on your fingertips, which may enable you to practice for a longer period of time. Determine what kind of starter guitar you want based on your budget and the equipment that you already have access to. [1] X Research source Guitars with nylon strings are often easier to use at first than guitars with metal strings. [2] X Expert Source Nicolas Adams Professional Guitarist Expert Interview. 17 September 2019. It’s best to start on a 6 string guitar rather than an 8 string guitar. Classical guitar strings are higher on the fretboard, which makes it tougher to create clear sounds and is harsher on your fingertips."

      "title": "Tune your guitar",
      "content": "Tune your guitar to standard tuning with an electric tuner. In standard tuning, your strings should be set to E, A, D, G, B, E, starting from the top string. Turn on the electric tuner and hold it next to your guitar. Then, strum the top string. Adjust the knob connected to the top string until the tuner reads an E. Move down to the second string from the top and adjust the knobs until it’s an A. Continue this process on the rest of the strings until your guitar matches standard tuning. [3] X Research source Before you start playing, your guitar must be in tune or it won’t sound good when you play it. Standard tuning is what most beginners use. The bottom string, or E, is two octaves above the top string but is still the same note."

      "content": "Place the guitar in your lap and hold the neck with your left hand. Sit down in a chair, straighten your back and square your shoulders. Place the guitar on your right thigh so that it sits comfortably in your lap. If you're left-handed and are using a left-handed guitar, you'll place the guitar on your left thigh and hold the neck with your right hand. [4] X Research source The body of the guitar should be resting against your torso. Use a guitar strap if you don’t feel like sitting down."

      "content": "Hold down the first fret on the top string. The frets are the square spaces on the neck of the guitar that are divided by small metal strips. Hold down the first fret of the top string with the tip of your index or middle finger. Your palm should be facing up and your fingers should be bent as you hold down the fret. [5] X Expert Source Nicolas Adams Professional Guitarist Expert Interview. 17 September 2019. Your fingers should be pressing down the strings in the middle of the fret, not on the metal strip."

      "content": "Pluck the top string with a pick and listen to the sound. Hold the pick between your index finger and thumb in your right hand. Move the pick over the top string to make a sound. If the string sounds muted or unclear, press down harder on the fret with your left hand. Continue strumming the top string until the note sounds clear. [6] X Research source A metronome may help you stay on beat."

      "content": "Move your left hand down the fretboard to play different notes. Move your hand from the first fret to the second fret. Try strumming and making a clear sound. Then, alternate playing the first and second fret. Try to stay on a specific beat and continue switching back and forth between the first and second fret as you strum. Once you feel comfortable alternating between frets, you can experiment with strumming different notes on the neck of the guitar. [7] X Research source As you get used to playing single notes, you’ll build up the muscle memory that will help you locate specific frets without looking at the guitar."

For instance, hold down the second fret of the 5th string and the fourth fret on the 4th string to play a B power chord. Hold that same position and slide your hand down a half step, or 1 fret, to play a C power chord. You can do this on any position on the 5th and 6th string.

The number on the tabs represent the fret that you should play, while the lines on the tabs represent the string that you'll play the note on. Tabs put the top string, or 6th string, on the bottom line, the 5th string on the second to bottom line, and so on. [17] X Research source Tabs do not designate how long to hold a note or chord, so you'll have to listen to the song that you want to play as you learn it. For instance, if the tab had 1-1-1 on the top line of the tab, that would mean that you strum the bottom string, or 1st string, 3 times in a row."
