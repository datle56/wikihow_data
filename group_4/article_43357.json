In other words, if he’s texting you more often or interacting with you more frequently on social media than before, he’s also thinking about you more often. Along with more frequent interaction, look for signs that he’s trying to be extra impressive—for instance, does he text you lots of little jokes or compliment the photos you post? [1] X Research source If you find out that he’s making less digital contact with his girlfriend at the same time, that makes it even more likely that his affections have shifted to you!"

      "content": "Check for frequent little looks, not staring, and dilated pupils. Whether he has a girlfriend or not, a guy who straight-up stares at you might end up being more of a creep than a catch. However, it’s a solid bet that he likes you if he makes lots of quick glances in hopes of briefly locking eyes with you. Playful eye contact is pretty much always a sign of affection! [2] X Expert Source Joshua Pompey Relationship Expert Expert Interview. 4 December 2019. If you do catch a look into his eyes, see if his pupils seem to be bigger than normal. Pupil dilation is a common sign of physical attraction. If a guy is in a committed relationship and shows signs that he's attracted to you, it may be time to walk away from the situation.

      "content": "Does he remove barriers so he can literally get close to you? If this guy’s attracted to you, he’ll want to get rid of any type of physical barrier between you. This includes things like a mug or glass at the table you're sitting at, a bag slung over his shoulder, or even his crossed arms in front of him. From there, watch for him to move in closer and find ways to make innocent physical contact with you. [3] X Expert Source Joshua Pompey Relationship Expert Expert Interview. 4 December 2019. He might inch closer towards you, bit by bit, as you’re standing in a group. Or, if you sit next to him at the lunch table, you might notice that his chair ends up a little closer to yours than to the person sitting on the other side of him. Once he gets closer, he’ll look for reasons to make even the slightest little physical contact with you. He might tap you on the shoulder to get your attention, for example, instead of just calling out your name. Or, he might brush his arm up against yours when moving past you to get to his seat."

      "content": "He’ll want to impress you and drop hints that he’s interested. Guys usually try harder at being good communicators when they really like someone. Why? They want to show off their personality and drop hints of their attraction—so watch for signs of flirting! In fact, keep an eye out for any of the following: [4] X Research source He talks about things that make him look good, like sports successes or academic achievements. He brings up topics that he knows (or at least thinks) you’ll find interesting. He flirts with you, probably either by lightly teasing you (“Good job, fumbles! Oh, I guess I’ll help you pick those things up”) or subtly complimenting you (“Did you do your hair differently today? It’s nice”). He asks meaningful questions to get to know you better.

      "content": "This is a sure sign that he’s paying attention and wants you to know it. The smaller the detail he remembers, the bigger the indicator it is that he likes you! You might experience examples similar to these: [6] X Research source You mention offhand once to a group (including him) that red is your favorite color. A week later, when he’s handing out notebooks for a group assignment in school, he hands you the red notebook and adds, “since it’s your favorite color.” You happened to say in passing 3 months ago that your birthday was on the first day of summer. Even though you’re keeping things low-key and aren’t having any kind of birthday party, he remembers to send you a quick “happy birthday” text on the right day."

      "content": "Does he seem extra happy when you laugh at his jokes or just smile at him? If he’s interested in you, he’ll always be looking for signs that you might be interested in him, too. Little signs of approval like smiling or laughing, or bigger signs like getting engaged in a conversation topic that he raised, will provide an obvious boost to his ego—and his hopes! [7] X Research source This works in the other direction as well. Does he seem extra bummed out when you don’t laugh at one of his jokes?"

      "content": "Does he dress to impress more when he knows you’ll see it? Guys don’t usually step up their grooming, dressing, and styling game for no reason. If it’s clear that he has upped his game, most especially when he expects to be around you, take it as a strong sign that he’s interested. [8] X Expert Source Joshua Pompey Relationship Expert Expert Interview. 4 December 2019. He’ll probably also try to impress with his body language by standing taller, holding his shoulders back, and sucking in his gut a bit more."

      "content": "Does he “light up” around you and seem “ho-hum” about her? Yes, it’s possible that this guy really likes you and really likes his girlfriend at the same time. But there’s a good chance that, if he’s really into you, he won’t be so into his girlfriend anymore. Watch closely for signs that he likes you. At the same time, look for signs of indifference with his girlfriend. [9] X Research source He might, for example, give a hearty laugh when you tell a joke but barely smirk when his girlfriend tells one. Or, he might keep his arms crossed when talking to his girlfriend but uncross them when facing you. Guys—and all people in general—usually aren’t as good at hiding their emotions as they think they are. If he just seems more excited about you than about her, then it’s probably true!"

      "content": "If he’s focused on you, he’s probably not putting much into his relationship. Ask yourself this: does this guy seem like he’s just “going through the motions” with his girlfriend? Do they have dull conversations (or barely talk at all)? Do they avoid physical contact or hug and kiss awkwardly? Do you get the feeling that he’d prefer to get out of the relationship? [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It’s also possible that he’ll try really hard to make it seem like their relationship still has a spark even if he’s no longer really feeling it. He could be just doing a poor job of trying to mask his true feelings for you. If his signs of affection towards her look fake, they probably are."

      "content": "Does he get easily frustrated or annoyed with her? If the guy is attracted to you, he’s probably blinded to the little things about you that might typically bother him. Likewise, if he’s now less attracted to his girlfriend, all the little things about her that he was blinded to before are probably now clearly obvious to him. [11] X Research source Some guys are just disagreeable in general and get annoyed easily with everyone. Here again, compare how he acts with you versus how he acts towards her in similar situations."

      "content": "Is he decreasing 1-on-1 time with her but increasing group time with you? If a guy doesn’t show any enthusiasm about spending time with his girlfriend, or even makes excuses not to spend time with her, it’s pretty clear that things won’t last. If he’s also going out of his way to find opportunities to hang out with you, then he’s almost certainly more into you than her. [12] X Research source For example, say you’re hanging out in a group and the girlfriend asks him if he’s going to take her to the movies tonight. Take it as a major sign if he turns towards you and says something like, “Hey, let’s make it a group thing—you guys want to come along?”"

      "content": "She’ll probably sense that his affections have shifted to someone else. True, some girlfriends are suspicious all the time, including times when they have no reason to be. But if she suddenly seems more suspicious of her boyfriend, add that to the other signs you’re picking up on that the guy’s interest has shifted in your direction. [13] X Research source If you’re friends with the girlfriend, she might confide in you about her suspicions. You may then be put in the awkward situation of confiding your own suspicions to her—that is, if you’re more interested in maintaining your friendship with her than you are in pursuing her current boyfriend!"

      "content": "If he’s telling you stuff he isn’t telling her, he clearly prefers you to her. Short of him telling you directly that he likes you and wants to break up with her, this might be the most obvious sign you can get. It gets even more obvious if he chooses to confide in you about the status of his relationship with her. Confiding in you means that he trusts you, and trust and affection often go hand-in-hand. [14] X Research source This might be harder to spot if you two were already close friends and are used to confiding in each other. If so, look for signs that he’s confiding in you more than before, and at the same time confiding in her less than before."
