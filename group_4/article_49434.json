      "title": "Write the date as the heading in the top left corner of the page.",
      "content": "Write the date as the heading in the top left corner of the page. If you're taking the trouble to write a letter by hand, it's nice to add a date on the top left corner of the paper (this is also called the heading of the letter). Many people save letters for years to come, and they like to be able to see what day and year it was written to reminisce about earlier times. Write out the date - for example, \"May 18, 2020\" - or abbreviate it using only numbers indicating the month, day and year. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Write a salutation beneath the heading.",
      "content": "Write a salutation beneath the heading. The beginning of a letter, whether it's handwritten or in the form of an email, is called a salutation . That's where you address the person to whom you're writing by name - for example, \"Dear Emily\" or \"Hello, Skylar.\" Think about the nature of your relationship with the letter recipient, as well as your own preferences and style, and choose your greeting accordingly. If you tend to like to write in a slightly formal style, using \"Dear\" in your salutation is a nice choice. It sounds typical, but think about it: calling someone \"dear\" is actually very sweet, and indicates that you care about him or her. However, you don't have to read into it; \"dear\" is as appropriate for a letter to your best friend as it is for a letter to an acquaintance you just met. For a letter that is more casual in tone, consider beginning it with \"Hi, [name]\" or \"Hello, [name].\" This greeting is appropriate for a friend or relative, but don't begin a business letter this way; it's a bit too casual. Write a more personal greeting for someone with whom you're intimate, or want to be. For example, \"Dearest [name],\" \"My [name]\" or \"Sweet [name].\" Be sure to end your greeting with a comma. It is also formally correct to begin the body of the letter on the next line. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Begin the body beneath the salutation with some pleasantries.",
      "content": "Begin the body beneath the salutation with some pleasantries. The body of the letter is where you'll write whatever you want to tell the recipient. The first paragraph is usually warm and lighthearted. It's a way to set the tone of the letter, letting the recipient know what's to follow will be more friendly than businesslike or serious. Use the first few lines to ask about the other person's health or reference the season. \"How are you doing?\" or \"How have you been?\" are common ways to start a letter. Asking a question helps make the letter feel like part of a longer conversation. If you'd like a reply to your letter, feel free to pepper it with questions throughout. You can also use the first paragraph to inquire more deeply about the recipient's life. For example, \"I hope little Julie has been enjoying kindergarten. I can't believe she's gotten so big!\" Referencing the time of year is another common letter opening. Think of it as the equivalent of making small talk before you launch into a deeper conversation. For example, \"I hope you've been having a wonderful fall. The trees in my neighborhood are more brilliant than they've ever been before. I think we're in for a cold winter, though.\""

      "title": "Share news and personal details.",
      "content": "Share news and personal details. Now it's time to get to the meat of the letter, your purpose for writing it. Why are you opening this correspondence? Do you want to get back in touch with a long-lost friend, express to someone that you are missing them, or thank them for helping you out in some way? Be forthright, open, and articulate to communicate your message effectively. Write about what's happening in your life. No matter what it says, your letter will probably be appreciated, but the recipient will feel much closer to you (and therefore the letter will be more effective) if it's revealing. Tell what events have occurred, what emotions you've felt, and what plans you have for the future. Don't create an airbrushed picture of your life; that defeats the purpose of a friendly letter. Avoid a holiday newsletter-style update; your friend will start skimming to the bottom if you just list everything you've accomplished since your last letter. You don't have to go too deep into your troubles but try to portray your life realistically."

      "title": "Reference topics that are relevant to the recipient.",
      "content": "Reference topics that are relevant to the recipient. What was your friend up to the last time you talked? Were they on the verge of breaking up with her boyfriend? Were they in the middle of a difficult season on the soccer team? Follow up by making references and asking questions to show you're interested in their life. You can also discuss topics of mutual interest. Write your thoughts on art, politics, current events, or any other subject that you'd discuss with your friend in person. Consider suggesting movies you've seen that you think the recipient would like, or books you've read that you want to recommend. Sharing good information is always welcome in letters."

    {
      "title": "End the body with a final paragraph.",
      "content": "End the body with a final paragraph. Write a closing paragraph sending your friend or loved one your best wishes. The last paragraph is usually lighter in tone than the body, but it should match the friendly feel of the entire letter. Try to end the letter on a note that will leave your friend with positive feelings. Reiterate the purpose of the letter. For example, if you invited your friend to come to a party, write, \"I hope you can come!\" If you simply wished your friend a happy season, write, \"Have a wonderful Thanksgiving!\" or something to that effect. Encourage the recipient to write back. If you'd like a response, write, \"Hope to hear from you soon,\" or, \"Please write back!\""

      "title": "Write a farewell phrase with your signature below the body.",
      "content": "Write a farewell phrase with your signature below the body. The farewell phrase you choose should be in keeping with the feel of your letter, whether it is traditional or more casual in tone. Like the salutation, it should be determined by your relationship with the recipient. Follow the closing by signing your name . [3] X Research source If you want to write a formal closing, consider \"Sincerely,\" \"Warmly,\" or \"Best wishes.\" If your letter is more casual in tone, try \"Yours,\" \"Take care,\" or \"Cheers.\" For a more intimate closing, choose \"Love,\" \"Much love,\" or \"Thinking of you.\" [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider including a postscript at the bottom of the letter. A postscript , or PS, is often included at the end of friendly letters (after the farewell phrase and signature) to add information that isn't important enough to mention in the body of the letter. You could also write a playful joke, or leave it out altogether. In any case, make sure it matches your letter's tone and leaves your recipient with the feeling you want them to have when they finish reading it. [5] X Research source"

So add a photo (or 2 or 3!) inside the envelope to supplement what you wrote about in your letter. Include a recent image of you, your family, or your pet, or a picture of where you went on vacation last. Their imagination will soar with your letter and visual inspiration to go by!"
