People have been swimming on their periods for eons! There's no reason why you shouldn't either. If you're worried about a heavy flow, remember that the water will temporarily reduce your flow. However, it won't stop it completely, so it's essential to wear a menstrual product even in the water."

Remember to change your tampon every few hours if you have a flow, and to never wear it for more than eight hours.

      "content": "Pads You can use a pad to swim , but it's not ideal for several reasons. Be aware that because pads are super absorbent, they can suck up a lot of water and become heavy and uncomfortable, a bit like a diaper. If they become slippery enough, they may even slide out of your suit. If you want to use a pad, use a product without wings to be discrete. [5] X Research source If you're used to using pads on your period and want to try something else, period swimwear might be the next best option. Period swimwear functions like a pad, but it looks discrete and only absorbs menstrual blood (not the pool water)."

      "content": "Dark-colored bottoms can help conceal leakage. If you don't want to wear shorts, but still want a little extra protection, try dark-colored swimsuit bottoms. Though your menstrual blood is not likely to leak through to your bikini bottom if you've inserted your menstrual product correctly, you can put your mind at ease by wearing a darker-colored swimsuit. Choose a cute color such as dark blue or dark purple and prepare for a fun day of swimming ahead. [6] X Research source You can also choose a suit that's a bit thicker in the bikini area so you don't have to worry about your tampon string or pad showing."

      "content": "Swim in shorts for a little extra protection. If you don't normally swim in shorts, you may feel comfortable donning a pair while you swim on your period. Though this is not necessary, if you are really nervous about your tampon string showing or your pad leaking, or if you just feel a little uncomfortable down there, you can wear shorts to give yourself some extra protection and to put your mind at ease. For extra peace of mind, buy them in a dark color. \"Board shorts\" often look great with bikini tops and is a style that does not draw any attention or curiosity. If you normally wear bikini bottoms and worry wearing shorts will draw attention, you can fib and say you could not find your swimsuit bottoms or had to borrow your brother's or something."

Pack a few more supplies than you think you'll need, just in case. If you want to change from a tampon to a pad once you're done swimming and change into normal clothes and underwear, bring those, too. [7] X Research source If you're wearing a tampon on a heavy day, change it every 3-4 hours. If you're wearing a menstrual cup or period swimwear, you're probably going to be just fine for up to 10 hours. Still, bringing an extra one just in case won't hurt. Even if you think you'll be OK without extra supplies, it's always good to have spares on hand in case one of your friends needs one!"

It's perfectly healthy, safe, and normal. [8] X Research source Menstrual blood has never been shown to attract sharks. Of course, avoid any shark infested waters anyway unless precautions are taken, but not because you're menstruating. Tampons will not absorb excessive amounts of water when swimming. If they did, Olympic swimmers, marine biologists, and scuba divers would not use tampons—and they do."
