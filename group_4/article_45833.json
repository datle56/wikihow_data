      "title": "Learn what acupressure is.",
      "content": "Learn what acupressure is. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), acupressure is an approach that utilizes various points along 12 basic meridians. [5] X Expert Source Karina Menali, L.Ac., DACM, Dipl. OM Licensed Acupuncturist & Diplomate of Oriental Medicine Expert Interview. 25 August 2021. These meridians are energy pathways that are believed to carry “qi” or “chi,” which is the Chinese term for life energy. The basic concept in acupressure is that if there is a blockage in qi, illness is a consequence. The application of pressure in acupressure can unblock these energy pathways and restore the easy and unimpeded flow of qi.

      "content": "Use the correct amount of pressure. When you do acupressure, you should try to use the right amount of pressure. Press the points with a deep, firm pressure when you stimulate the points. When you press the points, you may feel some soreness or pain, but it shouldn't be unbearable. It should feel somewhere between pain and pleasure. Your overall health determines the amount of pressure you place onto the pressure points. Some pressure points will feel tense when pressed. If at any time you feel extreme or increasing pain, gradually decrease the pressure until you feel a balance between pain and pleasure. You should not try to endure any pain during acupressure. If something feels so painful that it's uncomfortable or excruciating, then stop applying pressure. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose the proper pressing aids.",
      "content": "Choose the proper pressing aids. Since acupressure requires the pressing of pressure points, you need to make sure you use the right things to help you press the points. Most commonly, practitioners of acupressure use their fingers to massage and stimulate the pressure points. The middle finger works best to apply pressure to the pressure points. This is because it is the longest and strongest finger. You may also use the thumb. Some smaller, hard-to-reach pressure points can be pressed using a fingernail. [10] X Research source Other parts of the body, such as the knuckles, elbows, knees, legs, or feet can also be used. To correctly press a pressure point, you should press with something blunt. For some pressure points, the tip of the finger may be too thick. You can try a pencil eraser for small points. You may also consider using an avocado pit or golf ball."

      "content": "Recognize the symptoms of migraines. Migraine headaches generally are only on one side of the head. Most commonly, they occur at the forehead or the temples. The pain can be moderate to very severe and may be preceded by an aura. Most people with migraines also get nauseous, are sensitive to light, odors, and sounds. Moving around generally makes the headache worse. [14] X Research source An aura is a temporary disturbance in how you process environmental information. Auras may be visual, like flashing lights, blinking lights, or zigzags of light, or they may be the detection of smells. Other auras may be numbness that marches up either arm, speech disturbances, or confusion. About 25% of people with migraines also have auras. Migraines can be triggered by all sorts of things and vary from one person to another. Potential triggers include red wine, missing meals or fasting, environmental stimuli such as flashing lights or strong odors, changes in weather, lack of sleep, stress, hormonal factors, particularly a woman's period, certain foods, head trauma including traumatic brain injury, neck pain, and TMJ dysfunction."
