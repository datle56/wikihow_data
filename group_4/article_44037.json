[1] X Research source To find your core muscles, hold yourself in push-up position for about a minute or two and pay attention to what feels tired. It's usually not your arms. When you drop into a push-up position, or do any core-tightening exercise, tighten your ab muscles during each rep. Those are the muscles we're talking about. To do these exercise properly, breathe in when you're contracting the muscles and breathe out when you're releasing them."

When you're first starting out, aim for a couple sets of 30 crunches. Do them slowly, keeping your muscles engaged the whole time. Crunches should be difficult, not something to blow through as quickly as possible. Many people make the mistake of thinking that doing a couple hundred crunches every night will yield rock-hard abs in a couple of weeks. If that's all you're doing, it's unlikely you'll notice results. Crunches strengthen muscle, but don't burn much fat. Reader Poll: We asked 331 wikiHow readers for their favorite ab workout to target and strengthen core muscles, and only 11% of them said bird dogs. [Take Poll] However, bird dogs are a great alternative to crunches if you have back pain."

Control the hammer as it bounces, and then strike from the other side back toward your first side. Repeat sides, doing 10-15 reps on each. Try for three sets. [7] X Research source One of the important parts of the exercise is keeping the hammer from bouncing back and hitting you in the face. It's not just swinging, but controlling the hammer after you hit it. Be very careful while doing hammer swings. If your gym doesn't have a big hammer and tire for you to swing, you can still do this exercise with basic hand weights. Grip it like you would a hammer, with both hands."

Stay in your half-squat position, your core engaged through the exercise. Repeat the exercise for 30 seconds, and try for three sets.

As you work out your core, focus on burning calories and shredding fat around your midsection, to make sure your hard work shows. Even if you're working hard to tone your core, that layer of fat around your midsection can be hard to get rid of with strength training alone. Cardio exercise is the best and quickest way to get rid of that layer of fat, to put your toned core muscles on display.

Find a group of 10 exercises you like doing, then block them out into 60 second chunks and 30 second rests. Go through your routine 3 times and you'll be done in an hour or less. Consider supplementing your core exercises with other full-body aerobic workout routines. Look up a yoga, pilates, or a spin class in your area that you might check out, and alternate those workouts with your core training."

If you don't, you'll notice results more slowly than if you take periodic breaks. Try working out every other day during the week, then taking the weekends to do some other fun activity that gets you moving. If you do core-strengthening on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, get together with some friends to play basketball on Saturday, or go for a hike on Sunday to keep yourself moving, you'll stay healthy in a variety of ways."
