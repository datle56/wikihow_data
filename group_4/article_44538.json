      "title": "Quarantine the infected fish if there are healthy fish in the tank.",
      "content": "Quarantine the infected fish if there are healthy fish in the tank. Fin rot is contagious, so if your sick fish is in a tank with other fish, remove the affected fish. Put the fish in a clean tank or container with a low-flow sponge filter , a heater and thermometer , and a few decorations (like rocks or plants) so the fish has somewhere to hide. [1] X Research source Most people skip substrate on the bottom of quarantine tanks—not only is it easier to set up and maintain, but it makes it easier to observe the fish. Some people prefer to leave their fish in the main tank for treatment in case the other fish are infected but aren’t showing signs yet. [2] X Research source Use the same type of water for your quarantine tank that you use in your main tank. For instance, if you buy water from your local fish store (LFS) for your main tank, use that in your quarantine tank as well. This will make the move less stressful for your fish."

      "title": "Clean your main tank thoroughly.",
      "content": "Clean your main tank thoroughly. Poor water quality is one of the most common causes of fin rot, so give the tank a good cleaning (whether you quarantined the sick fish or not). To properly clean your tank, Morton recommends that you “Scrub the glass, clean the gravel, do a water change, and clean the filter media.” [3] X Expert Source Craig Morton Aquarium Specialist, Aquarium Doctor Inc. Expert Interview. 21 July 2020. If you have sand substrate in your tank, use a siphon to suck up any visible detritus. Use a scraper to clean algae and other gunk off the sides of the tank. Clean your filter thoroughly with fresh tank water, then put in new filter media. Don’t use tap water as it could contaminate the filter. If you notice any rough or sharp decorations in your tank that could have injured your fish, remove them while you’re cleaning."

      "title": "Do a 50% water change.",
      "content": "Do a 50% water change. Siphon or scoop about half of the water from your tank, then refill it with conditioned water. [4] X Research source Consider visiting your LFS for reverse-osmosis deionized (RO/DI) water if you have a freshwater tank or commercially-prepared saltwater if you have a marine tank. This water should have consistent parameters, preventing big swings when you do water changes. It’s a good idea to clean your tank before you do the water change—cleaning the tank will likely stir up sand, algae, and other debris, and a water change will help remove some of this. Try to ensure the fresh water is about the same temperature as your tank water to avoid temperature swings that can be stressful for fish."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check your water parameters.",
      "content": "Check your water parameters. Use aquarium test strips or a test kit to test your water after you change it. Your ideal parameters will depend on the fish you’re keeping, but generally, the pH should be around 7.0–8.0, the ammonia and nitrites should be 0 (or undetectable), and the nitrates should be under 30–50 ppm. [5] X Research source If your parameters are still off, plan to do another 20–25% water change in 1–2 days. Keep doing these smaller water changes until your parameters are where they should be. Consider taking a water sample to your LFS—they’ll be able to test more parameters and give you personalized advice on how to get your tank healthy again."

      "title": "Give your fish an antibiotic if it doesn’t improve.",
      "content": "Give your fish an antibiotic if it doesn’t improve. If your fish’s fin rot doesn’t start improving within a few days, try adding an antibacterial fin rot treatment to its tank. Follow the dosage directions on the label—you’ll usually add a certain amount of medication based on the gallons of water in your tank, then change the water after about a week to remove the medicine. [6] X Research source Erythromycin is a common antibiotic used to treat fin rot, but some medications will include minocycline , trimethoprim , or sulfadimidine . Morton recommends API Bettafix for treating fin rot. [7] X Expert Source Craig Morton Aquarium Specialist, Aquarium Doctor Inc. Expert Interview. 21 July 2020. Stephens says, “Fin rot can also be accompanied by fungal infections, which look like white cotton-like growth and redness of the fins.” [8] X Expert Source Marshall Stephens Aquarium Specialist Expert Interview. 3 January 2023. If this happens, add an antifungal medication like methylene blue to the tank. [9] X Research source Remove or turn off your charcoal filter before adding the medicine—otherwise, the filter will remove the medicine from the water."

      "title": "Treat with aquarium salt in freshwater tanks if antibiotics aren’t available.",
      "content": "Treat with aquarium salt in freshwater tanks if antibiotics aren’t available. Aquarium salt (not marine salt or table salt), also called NaCL rock salt, can sometimes help fish to overcome a bacterial infection. Dissolve the salt in a little of your tank water, add it to the tank, then remove it with regular 30% water changes once your fish starts to recover. [10] X Research source For mild cases of fin rot: Add 1 tbsp (20g) of salt for every 3 US gal (11 L) of water in your tank. For fin rot where the fins are starting to deteriorate: Add 1 tbsp (20g) of salt for every 2 US gal (7.6 L) of water in your tank. For more advanced fin rot: Add 1 tbsp (20g) of salt for every 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water in your tank."

      "title": "Consider using an air pump or an airstone when you put medication into the tank.",
      "content": "Consider using an air pump or an airstone when you put medication into the tank. Medications tend to leech oxygen from the tank water—adding supplemental oxygen will help keep your fish healthy. Set up an air pump or air stone in your tank to inject more oxygen into the water. [11] X Research source If your fish is a Betta, set the air pump on low—a high current can be stressful for Betta fish."

      "content": "Fin rot is an infection that causes a fish’s fins to deteriorate. Fin rot is usually a bacterial infection and is typically caused by poor water quality, stress, or injury. Over time, the fish’s fins can deteriorate to the point that they’re completely gone, and the infection can then attack the fish’s body. Once the infection progresses to this point, it has the potential to be fatal. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "The first sign is usually discoloration on the edge of the fin.",
      "content": "The first sign is usually discoloration on the edge of the fin. If your fish is in the early stages of fin rot, you may see a line of discoloration along the edges of its fins or tail. This discoloration could be white, brown, red, or black. You may also notice that the fins turn cloudy, look inflamed, or have red streaks running through them. [13] X Research source Depending on the color of your fish and the shape of its fins, it can be difficult to spot fin rot at this stage. Some fish will also develop white or gray slime on their fins.

      "title": "As fin rot progresses, the fish’s fins will become ragged.",
      "content": "As fin rot progresses, the fish’s fins will become ragged. Stephens says, “The most common symptom of fin rot is deteriorated fins.” At this point, the infection has progressed enough that small pieces of the fin have started to fall off. This leaves the edges of the fin with a jagged appearance, and they’ll start to look shorter. [15] X Expert Source Marshall Stephens Aquarium Specialist Expert Interview. 3 January 2023. At this point, the fin will likely regenerate as long as there’s some healthy tissue remaining. If you see holes in the fins, rather than deterioration along the outside edge, the fin rot is likely caused by a fungal infection rather than a bacterial one. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Eventually, the fin may deteriorate entirely.",
      "content": "Eventually, the fin may deteriorate entirely. If it does, you may see red streaks appearing on the fish’s back, sides, or along its tail. This means the infection is attacking the fish’s body. Unfortunately, once this happens, it can be very difficult to save the fish, which is why it’s so important to act quickly when you first notice symptoms. [17] X Research source If the fish’s fins or tail are completely gone, they will not regenerate."

      "title": "You may notice your fish seems lethargic or stops eating.",
      "content": "You may notice your fish seems lethargic or stops eating. Fighting fin rot can be stressful for your fish. As the illness progresses, you may notice that your fish is spending a lot of time near the bottom of the tank, and it may not eat much. [18] X Research source You may also notice your fish rubbing along the substrate, glass, or tank decorations—it’s probably doing this to relieve discomfort caused by the infection."

    {
      "title": "Fin rot is caused by stress.",
      "content": "Fin rot is caused by stress. Although the infection is caused by fungus or bacteria, the root cause of fin rot is almost always environmental. The most common reason for fish to develop fin rot is poor water quality—infrequent water changes can cause your water parameters to be too high or too low, stressing the fish and making it vulnerable to disease. However, there are other factors that can lead to fin rot, like: [19] X Research source Too many fish in the tank Injury from sharp or rough tank decorations Being bullied by tankmates Contact with an infected fish Cold tank water Overfeeding or feeding old food Handling or moving the fish"

Consistency is the key here, so you can’t skip out on maintenance.” [21] X Expert Source Marshall Stephens Aquarium Specialist Expert Interview. 3 January 2023. Find the schedule that works for you—some people prefer to do smaller, frequent water changes, while others prefer larger water changes spaced out more frequently. Morton recommends “Changing 25% of the water in your fish tank every two weeks.” [22] X Expert Source Craig Morton Aquarium Specialist, Aquarium Doctor Inc. Expert Interview. 21 July 2020. Use test strips or a test kit to monitor your water parameters—this will give you a good idea of when you need to do water changes."

      "title": "Make sure the tank is not overcrowded.",
      "content": "Make sure the tank is not overcrowded. Though it may be tempting to fill your tank with lots of fish, overcrowding can lead to high stress levels and a higher risk of disease for your fish. Morton recommends that you generally should only have about “1 inch (2.5 cm) of fish per 2 gallons (7.6 L) of tank space.” [23] X Expert Source Craig Morton Aquarium Specialist, Aquarium Doctor Inc. Expert Interview. 21 July 2020. If certain fish are nipping or biting at each other, this may be a sign that your tank is overcrowded or that those fish aren’t compatible with each other. You may need to remove the more aggressive fish from the tank—move them to another tank, try to rehome them, or see if your LFS will take them. Certain fish are known to be fin nippers, including tiger barbs, serpae tetras, black widow tetras, angelfish, catfish, pufferfish, and targetfish."

      "content": "Feed small amounts of high-quality food. Stephens says to keep your fish healthy, “Choose the right size and type of food for your fish, and feed only as much as your fish can eat in about 30 seconds. Also, avoid food that just goes straight into the filter or down to the bottom.” [24] X Expert Source Marshall Stephens Aquarium Specialist Expert Interview. 3 January 2023. Overfeeding your fish can lead to a poor immune system and put your fish at a higher risk of diseases. It can also introduce too much bacteria into the tank."

      "content": "Can fish recover from fin rot? Yes, fish can recover from fin rot, especially if you act quickly once you notice the first symptoms. However, if the illness progresses to the point that the fish’s entire fins or tail or gone, it will not regrow them, and it will have a harder time recovering."
