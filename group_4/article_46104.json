For instance, do 10 consecutive lat pulldowns before taking a short break. Aim to do 3 sets total for each machine. If you can’t do 3 sets of 10 reps, cut back on the weight you’re trying to lift. Alternatively, if you feel like you can easily do 15 or 20 reps per set, increase the weight a bit. A good strength training session should take around 30-60 minutes. Aim to do 2-3 sessions per week, allowing 48 hours of rest between sessions."

Start with a very light weight, such as 5–10 lb (2.3–4.5 kg). Use the same technique as with a body-weight dip. If your gym doesn’t have parallel bars, there are triceps dip variations that require nothing more than a bench.

Whether you’re walking, jogging, or running, stay centered on the walking surface and keep your feet beneath you. If you can’t keep up the pace, slow the machine down! [19] X Research source With a preset program, you’ll start slow as a warmup, get moving a bit (or a lot) faster during the main part of the workout, then slow down again to finish up. You can manually increase or decrease the treadmill’s speed as desired, but try to follow the preset as-is if you’re new to using a treadmill. Most treadmills let you manually or mechanically increase or decrease the incline of the walking surface; increasing it ups the intensity while decreasing it reduces the intensity. A light- to moderate-intensity treadmill workout should last around 20-30 minutes. If you’re doing a high-intensity running workout, it may last only 5-10 minutes."
