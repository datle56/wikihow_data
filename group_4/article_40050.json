      "content": "Soak your nails in lemon water for 5 minutes. Add 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of lemon juice (the juice from about 1/4 of a lemon) to 1 ⁄ 2 c (120 mL) of very warm water in a small bowl and mix together well. Soak your nails in the mixture for about 5 minutes. Pat your hands with a clean, dry towel to remove excess water. Use a cuticle stick to carefully push back your cuticles . Finish by rubbing in a dab of your favorite moisturizing lotion. [1] X Research source Add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of honey to the mixture to promote healing and enhance hydration. Avoid soaking your nails in lemon if they are cut or damaged. The acid can lead to painful burning and stinging. You can use this remedy once a week to soften up your cuticles."

      "content": "Plunge your nails into vinegar if you want a simple solution. It doesn’t get much easier than this. Fill a small bowl about one-third of the way full with undiluted distilled white vinegar. Soak your nails for about 5 minutes. Rinse your hands, then pat them dry with a clean towel. Vinegar is acidic and can burn and sting wounds. If your nails or fingers are cut or damaged, do not soak them in the vinegar. An added bonus if you plan to paint your fingernails after your soak: the vinegar will help your nail polish last longer. The acidic vinegar removes oil from your nails, allowing the polish to adhere better. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Massage coconut oil onto your nails to soften your cuticles.",
      "content": "Massage coconut oil onto your nails to soften your cuticles. Coconut oil is a natural emollient, meaning it works specifically to soothe and soften. It also has antibacterial properties, which makes it great to use if you have hangnails, cuts, or scrapes. Coconut oil also helps to strengthen your cuticles. Add 2 drops to each nail bed. Use your thumb to really work the oil into your cuticles. After a thorough massage, put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves to trap the moisture and allow the oil to soak in. Remove the gloves after 10 minutes and wipe off any excess oil that wasn’t absorbed. You can use cuticle oil if you want something specifically designed for your cuticles.< [3] X Expert Source Mia Rubie Nail Artist Expert Interview. 23 April 2020.

      "content": "Drop 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of raw honey into a small bowl. The honey encourages the skin to retain moisture which helps nourish your cuticles and nail beds. It not only cures fungal and bacterial infections—which is a health risk associated with cracked and damaged cuticles—it also works to prevent them. [4] X Research source Make sure you use raw honey rather than regular honey, as the regular honey tends to lose a lot of enzymes and antioxidants during the pasteurization process.

      "content": "Add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of aloe vera gel to the raw honey. Aloe vera is an antimicrobial agent that works to fight against bacterial and viral infections. Its nourishing properties help heal dry, cracked cuticles and work to remove dead skin cells, making your skin feel soft and smooth. [6] X Research source Use fresh aloe vera from a plant if you have one at home. Just be sure to wash the leaf before cutting it open and scooping out the gel. If you don’t have your own aloe vera plant, you can purchase a commercial gel from your local drugstore or department store. However, it will not have as many healing properties as fresh aloe."

The oil continues to work by strengthening the cuticle tissue.

      "content": "Use lotion daily to keep your cuticles soft. Apply the lotion or hand cream at least once a day, but ideally, after each time you wash your hands or whenever you notice your skin is dry. A small scoop of coconut oil massaged into your hands also works great. Put a heavy layer of lotion on your hands at night before bed, and then sleep in a pair of white cotton gloves to retain the moisture. [9] X Research source Spa gloves or even loose rubber gloves will also work. Select a thick, high-quality lotion or cream for the best results. Cheaper lotions tend to be heavily scented, but lack the elements required to help your skin retain moisture."

      "content": "Push back your cuticles with an orange stick about once a week. This will prevent the cuticles from becoming overgrown, which can lead to dryness and more risk of damage. Use the flat surface of a cuticle pusher or orange stick to gently push the cuticle back towards the bottom of your nails. Run the tool along the bottom of your nail bed to smooth out the cuticle. [10] X Research source Take care not to press too hard, because it can be painful and/or damage your cuticle."
