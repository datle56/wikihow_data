Hold onto both of them, pull them up, and tie them in a bow at the center of your hairline. [7] X Research source Be careful not to tie the ribbons too tightly—otherwise, you'll cut off a lot of circulation to your hair. Remember, that blood flow is really important for hair growth .

      "content": "Buy a high-quality silk or satin bonnet. Go for either satin or silk—these sumptuous fabrics prevent friction so your hair doesn’t get snagged or break. Your hair will just glide against these gentle materials. Plus, both silk and satin lock in moisture. Steer clear of bonnets with cotton lining and other drying fabrics that absorb moisture, because dry dehydrated hair is prone to frizz. These materials are too rough for your lovely tresses. To decide if a silk bonnet or satin bonnet is best for you, think about these trade-offs: [11] X Research source Silk Pros : Eco-friendly, breathable, helps regulate your body temp while you sleep, keeping the hair hydrated Cons : Pricey, so some companies pass off bonnets as “silk” when they’re not Satin: Pros : Cheap, ultra-smooth, extremely protective of your hair Cons : Only the inner lining of bonnets have satin, so they’re a little less comfy Tip : When you pick out your bonnet, look for any exposed elastic, which is a sign of a poorly sewn band that might pull out your hair."

      "content": "Get a bonnet that’s the right size for your head and hair. Measure your head from your forehead to the nape of your neck. Compare your measurement to the options on a company’s size chart for hair bonnets. When you get the right bonnet for the size of your head, it'll stretch enough to accommodate all your hair. [12] X Research source If your measurement is 52 centimetres (20 in), you might read one manufacturer's size chart and see that you'll fit into a \"Medium\" bonnet, which is 52 centimetres (20 in) relaxed and stretches all the way to 56 centimetres (22 in). If you want your bonnet fit over your ears, wrap the measuring tape around your ears when you take your measurement. If your bonnet's band is tight, it can damage delicate strands and put pressure on your hairline, which cuts off circulation and prevents hair growth. [13] X Research source If your bonnet’s band is loose, your bonnet can easily fall off while you sleep, so you won’t enjoy all its benefits. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Invest in an extra large bonnet for very long hair or voluminous afros. When you have hair with a lot of length or volume, go for an extra large bonnet , a specialty type of sleeping cap. For long tresses or dreadlocks, look for an extra large bonnet that drops down to your back . For an afro, go for an extra large—sometimes called “jumbo”—bonnet that’s really wide and circular . [15] X Research source Whether you need an extra large bonnet that drops down for long hair or one that stretches to accommodate a wide afro, look for the manufacturer’s measurement, which is given as a diameter. For example, if your hair is 17 inches (43 cm) long, get an extra large bonnet that has a diameter of 17 inches (43 cm). For an afro that’s 14 inches (36 cm) wide, buy an extra large bonnet that’s 14 inches (36 cm) in diameter."
