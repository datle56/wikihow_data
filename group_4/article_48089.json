      "content": "OBJ (￼) is a Unicode replacement character. OBJ (￼) is not an emoji itself, but rather a replacement character found in the Unicode system. Used by most computers, Unicode maps letters and symbols, including emojis, to short lines of code. This way, characters can be represented from device to device, in different fonts, and in different applications with few errors. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "OBJ (￼) appears when an object is not recognized. Although Unicode covers thousands of characters, it still has gaps, especially when it comes to the frequently updated emoji keyboard. When Unicode can’t recognize an object, your phone or computer will return the object replacement character: OBJ (￼). [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Unicode support is outdated or mismatched. Most devices use more recent versions of Unicode. However, some apps may be behind on updates and not support characters added later. On the other hand, some software may create their own characters outside of Unicode or not use Unicode entirely, which will also return the OBJ (￼) error on incompatible devices.

      "content": "New emojis have been created. New emojis may be added before you get the proper Unicode updates. If you suddenly see more replacement characters where you think emojis should be, there has likely been an update added to keyboards everywhere. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "iPhone’s Voice-to-Text feature has glitched.",
      "content": "iPhone’s Voice-to-Text feature has glitched. iPhones use a speech recognizer tool that turns bites of speech into objects before changing them to text. Sometimes, this tool is not completely compatible with other software, which may see the speech objects but not know what word or letter to match them with. As a result, it returns the OBJ (￼) placeholder instead. [5] X Research source"

If you find yourself in this situation, search for an app with an emoji library you can then install and use on your phone or computer. The correct library will let you see what emoji people send you and let you send your own. [8] X Research source"
