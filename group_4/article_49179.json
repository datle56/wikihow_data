Twist the towel back and forth as you move around the wheel to trap dirt onto the towel. [1] X Research source If you don't have access to an automotive interior cleaner, you can mix water and all-purpose cleaner in a 3:1 ratio to create a cleaner that's safe for your car's interior. [2] X Research source A leather cleaner is also a good option since some steering wheels are made with vinyl leather. Spritz it onto a microfiber cloth before wiping down the surface of the wheel."

      "title": "Spool your paracord.",
      "content": "Spool your paracord. Organizing your paracord into a small bunch will allow you to wrap more efficiently. This will also prevent the cord from getting tangled, causing a major headache. Either find a spool to wrap your paracord on, or simply wrap it around your hand then tie a hair tie around the cord."

Be sure to tighten this knot before proceeding with the rest of the wrap. [3] X Research source To tie a cow-hitch knot: Create a loop on one end of the paracord, keeping the remaining spooled cord in your right hand. [4] X Research source Throw this loop OVER the steering wheel, allowing it to hang below the wheel. [5] X Research source Open the loop. [6] X Research source Hold the spool and the tag end of the cord in your right hand. [7] X Research source Pass the spool and tag under the wheel. [8] X Research source Reach through the loop with your left hand. [9] X Research source Pull the spool and tag up through the loop, transferring the spool from your right to your left hand. The tag end should now be on the left, and the spool on the right, allowing you to continue the wrap to the right. [10] X Research source Cinch the knot down. Pull on the tag and the spool to tighten the knot. [11] X Research source"

Remember that the leather will need to be tight on the wheel, therefore cut slightly smaller than the actual wheel, to account for stretch. You can also purchase pre-cut steering wheel leather. These packages generally come with the needle and thread."

It holds securely and adds a touch of elegance to both leather and alcantara. To cross stitch, follow these steps: Starting with the first pre-pierced hole, run needle 1 through from left to right, then follow with needle 2 from right to left (through the same series of holes). Follow this pattern, alternating which needle goes from left to right versus right to left, until you've reached the end of the leather section. [26] X Research source If you prefer, you can use other stitching methods, such as a diamond-shaped stitch, or a hexagonal-shaped stitch."
