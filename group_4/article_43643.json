      "title": "Yes, “Thank you very much” is grammatically correct.",
      "content": "Yes, “Thank you very much” is grammatically correct. “Thank you very much” is a common English expression and a polite, friendly way to express your appreciation for someone’s help or support. It’s a stronger way to say “Thank you,” so you usually use it when you want to express that you’re extremely grateful. It also has a formal tone, so it’s appropriate to say it in professional contexts or to authority figures, as well as to friends and family. [1] X Research source For instance, it’s correct to say “Thank you very much” when someone does you a favor, congratulates you, compliments you, or helps you with something. In the phrase “Thank you very much,” “very” is an adverb that means “extremely,” “exceedingly,” or “greatly.” So, it emphasizes your gratitude and appreciation. Example sentences : “Thank you very much for your help today. I appreciate you staying late to get everything set up for the event tomorrow.” “That was so kind of you to buy me flowers for my first day of work. Thank you very much.”"

      "title": "“Thank you very much” is more formal than “Thank you so much.”",
      "content": "“Thank you very much” is more formal than “Thank you so much.” “Thank you very much” and “Thank you so much” are both grammatically correct and polite ways to express your appreciation and emphasize that you’re extremely grateful to someone. However, “Thank you very much” is more formal while “Thank you so much” is more casual. So, stick to saying “Thank you so much” in less formal contexts. Say it to people you know well, like friends, family, and close coworkers, or in quick and casual professional situations. While both phrases are sincere and friendly ways to give thanks, some people find “Thank you very much” more genuine than “Thank you so much,” and vice versa. This is simply personal preference and may come down to which phrase is used more where you live. For instance, if “Thank you so much” is used more often where you live, you might find it less genuine because people say it a lot."
