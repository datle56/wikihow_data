  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Introduce yourself and your relationship to the bride.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself and your relationship to the bride. Begin your speech by introducing yourself and how you know the bride (or the couple). As the maid of honor, you’re likely a relative or good friend of the bride, but it’s important to remember that not every guest will know who you are. Greet the room and briefly explain your relationship. [1] X Research source For example, “Good evening, everyone. My name is Rachel, and I’m the sister of the beautiful bride.” Or, “Hi, everyone. My name is Penny, and I’ve known this lovely couple since college.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Highlight the bride and talk about what makes her special.",
      "content": "Highlight the bride and talk about what makes her special. Briefly offer the newlyweds a few compliments, then turn your attention to the bride. In traditional weddings, the maid of honor speech is mainly directed at the bride, while the best man’s speech is directed at the groom. Share a few heartfelt sentiments about the bride, highlighting what you love about her and what makes her special. Talk about who she is and what she was like before meeting her spouse. There will be time to talk about them as a couple later. [2] X Research source For example, “Ashley has always been an incredible big sister. She’s kind and thoughtful but isn’t afraid to be hard-headed when it comes to things she’s passionate about. I’m so lucky to have her as a role model. Or, “Since you’re all here at the wedding, I’m sure you already know just how smart, talented, and amazing Kenzie is. She’s always been there for me through thick and thin, and she’s the best friend a person could ask for.” If there isn’t a bride or there are two brides, your main focus should be on the person who asked you to deliver the speech and whose side of the aisle you stood on during the ceremony, if applicable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reflect on the couple’s relationship.",
      "content": "Reflect on the couple’s relationship. Many maid-of-honor speeches start by focusing on the bride and then transition into how the relationship has changed her for the better. This is the time to offer compliments to the bride's partner and mention all the great things about their relationship. Talk about things like when they first met, when you knew they were in love, or how you knew they were meant to be. [3] X Research source For example, “I knew Melissa was the one for Valerie because they always matched each other’s wit. I mean, the banter was crazy! It was like watching a rom-com in real life.” Or, “When Sarah first brought David home, we all knew right away that it would last forever. We’d never seen someone who could make her smile so much, and he always looked at her with so much affection.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Share one or two personal anecdotes about the bride or the couple.",
      "content": "Share one or two personal anecdotes about the bride or the couple. It’s one thing to say that the bride is funny or that the couple is meant-to be. But to deliver an amazing maid of honor speech, it’s important to show it. Think of your favorite memories or stories that reflect how you want to portray the bride or the couple. These can be funny or sweet, but they should tie into the overall theme of your speech. [4] X Research source For example, if you want to highlight how romantic the bride is, say something like, “You all probably know that Bella is a hopeless romantic, but did you know that she used to force me to play weddings with her as a kid? Let me tell you the story…” Or, if you want to talk about how the couple met, say something like, “Not to brag, but I’m actually the reason these two got together. Let’s take a trip down memory lane to a little bookshop five years ago…” Remember, your focus should be on the couple, not yourself. Make sure your anecdotes are mainly about the bride or the couple and that they reflect them in a positive light. It’s okay to add a few jokes here and there, too, but don’t go overboard. Try to focus on jokes that the whole audience can enjoy, as well, rather than including a bunch of inside jokes between you and the bride that will go over everyone else’s heads."

    {
      "title": "End your maid of honor speech with well wishes and a toast.",
      "content": "End your maid of honor speech with well wishes and a toast. Make sure all of the elements of your speech tie together nicely at the end. Consider ending with a romantic quote, and offer the newlyweds your best wishes. Raise your glass and propose a toast to the couple to conclude your speech. [5] X Research source For example, “You two are the perfect couple, and I’m absolutely blessed to call you my friends. Here’s to the Johnsons—may you continue to make each other laugh for many years to come.” Or, “Your love is so inspiring, and it’s been so special to watch it grow. I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. Here’s to the happy couple!”"

    {
      "title": "Ask the couple which topics are off-limits.",
      "content": "Ask the couple which topics are off-limits. You may want to include funny stories or memories in your maid of honor speech, but it’s important not to accidentally embarrass the bride. Ask what, if any, topics you should avoid including in your speech, e.g., exes, previous marriages, drinking and other vices, “adult” humor, and negativity about marriage or the bride’s partner. If someone could be offended, it’s a good idea not to include it, but run it by the couple first to make sure. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t make it about yourself.",
      "content": "Don’t make it about yourself. Remember, this day is about the new couple, so your speech should celebrate them and their love. Don’t focus solely on your relationship with the couple, but their relationship with each other. After introducing yourself, try to keep the attention directed at the newlyweds. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Write your speech on index cards.",
      "content": "Write your speech on index cards. While it’s a good idea to be able to deliver your speech without staring at a piece of paper the whole time, you likely won’t be expected to memorize it entirely. Write your speech or at least the key talking points on some index cards in case you freeze up or forget where you were. [8] X Research source It’s possible to write your speech on your phone, but the light from the screen may distort any wedding photographs being taken."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice your speech ahead of time.",
      "content": "Practice your speech ahead of time. After you’ve written your speech, recite it aloud. Repeated practice will help you catch any awkward sentences or anecdotes that don’t flow well. Then, practice delivering your speech in front of an audience to find your rhythm and become more comfortable with public speaking . Plus, those listening to your speech can give you feedback on what areas you should work on. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t drink too much before you give your speech.",
      "content": "Don’t drink too much before you give your speech. If there’s alcohol at the wedding and you enjoy drinking, try to keep it to a minimum until after you give your speech. It’s perfectly fine to let loose and have a fun time, but it’s important to have a clear head when making your speech so you can deliver it thoughtfully and sincerely. Plus, drinking too much could make you slur your words, which wouldn’t be ideal for a speech. [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Speak slowly and take pauses during your speech.",
      "content": "Speak slowly and take pauses during your speech. If you’re nervous, it can be easy to rush through a speech because you want to get it over with. But your speech is a happy moment that the couple will want to remember! Take a few deep breaths and speak slowly and clearly. If you make a joke, pause for a few seconds to give the audience time to laugh. [11] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Be energetic, and don’t forget to smile.",
      "content": "Be energetic, and don’t forget to smile. Show the audience that you’re happy to be there. While you likely don’t want to pace around the stage, try not to stand in one place, stiff as a board. Walk around, smile at the audience, and don’t be afraid to laugh. If it seems like you’re enjoying delivering the speech, the audience will likely have more fun, too. [12] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t put too much pressure on yourself.",
      "content": "Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Your speech should be genuine and heartfelt but don’t worry about making it perfect. Putting unnecessary pressure on yourself will prevent you from enjoying the moment, and it may make you more likely to stumble over your words. Remember, everyone is there to have fun. Don’t dwell on minor mistakes; focus on celebrating the couple. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Maid of honor speech for a sister Good evening, everyone. Thank you all for being here to celebrate Beth and Greg. As most of you know, I’m Beth’s older sister, Fiona. Beth is the best little sister I could ask for—even though she used to steal my Barbie dolls’ clothes all the time. She’s funny, thoughtful, and in love with love. When we were kids, she always dreamed about what her future husband would be like. And although she always swore she’d never marry a redhead, it’s clear why Greg is her perfect match. When Beth first met Greg, he saved her cat from a tree—literally. Ever since then, he’s been her knight in shining armor. He would do anything to make her smile, and he doesn’t run away when things get tough. It definitely takes a strong man to survive in our crazy family, and I’m so happy that you’re now a part of it, Greg. It’s been so special to watch my baby sister fall in love, and I wish you both nothing but happiness as you start your life as a married couple. Here’s to you, Beth and Greg!"

      "content": "Maid of honor speech for a best friend Hi, everyone. Wasn’t that ceremony beautiful? I think I’m still crying. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Christina. Lana and I have been best friends since kindergarten. We first bonded over our love for Hannah Montana , but I’m so glad that our relationship has blossomed beyond that. There are so many reasons to love Lana that there’s no way I could name them all. But to start, she’s the absolute funniest person I have ever met. Her sense of humor is unmatched. At least, that’s what I thought until she met Hailey. These two need their own comedy show. I laugh until I can’t breathe whenever I’m around them. But one of the best things about Hailey is that she knows when to be serious. She knows how to get Lana to open up and be vulnerable. It’s truly amazing how soft Lana becomes when Hailey’s around. I know Hailey will always be there for her, and for that I am so grateful. I’m honored to call both of you my friends, and I’m so excited to see where your journey takes you next. Now, I’d like everyone to raise their glass in celebration of the happy couple. Cheers!"

And I’m mainly here to embarrass Gina and Louis by telling the story of how they first met. Gina and Louis actually met at a Halloween party. Gina was dressed as a taco. Louis was dressed as a hot sauce bottle. I was dressed as Taylor Swift, but that’s neither here nor there. It was immediately clear that these two were a match made in culinary heaven. Plus, anyone who’s not afraid to wear a goofy costume is okay in my book! As a couple, Gina and Louis are like a perfectly mixed cocktail—Gina is the fun, fizzy soda, and Louis is the reliable, steady whiskey. They make every moment a delight, with just the right amount of buzz and warmth. Their adventures together are always filled with love and laughter. So, let’s raise our glasses to Gina and Louis.

From the moment I met Olivia, I knew we were destined to be best friends. We’ve shared countless memories together, like late-night talks, spontaneous adventures, and endless laughs. And now, as I stand here watching her radiant smile, I couldn’t be happier. Olivia, you’ve always been the epitome of grace and kindness. You’ve gotten me through some of my darkest days, and I am eternally grateful to have you in my life. And then there’s Alex. From the moment Olivia met him, I knew he was her soulmate.

      "title": "How long should a maid of honor speech be?",
      "content": "How long should a maid of honor speech be? The sweet spot for maid of honor speeches is generally 2-3 minutes, and they should be no longer than 5 minutes. There will likely be other speeches, so it’s important to have time for all of them while keeping the audience’s attention. 2 to 5 minutes is typically enough time to honor the couple without taking up too much time, but ask the bride for a timeframe if you want to be sure.

      "content": "Does the maid of honor have to give a speech? It’s typically expected that the maid of honor will give a speech, especially if other members of the wedding party are planning on giving one. However, it’s not required. [15] X Research source If you feel nervous about giving a speech, talk to the couple. Together, you may be able to come up with a way to honor the newlyweds in a way that feels comfortable for you. In some cases, the newlyweds may choose not to have speeches delivered at their wedding. If you’d still like to honor them, consider writing them a heartfelt letter instead. Remember, everyone gets nervous about public speaking. Make every effort to deliver a speech if you were asked to by the bride. It’s her day, after all, and it will probably mean a lot to her. If you really don’t think you can deliver a speech, let the bride know how you feel. She’ll probably understand and can work something else out."

      "content": "When does the maid of honor give a speech? While each wedding is different, in the traditional wedding speech order, the maid of honor gives their speech after the newlyweds’ parents. The maid of honor is then followed by the best man.
