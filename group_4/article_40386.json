      "title": "Look for sloppy stitching.",
      "content": "Look for sloppy stitching. Gucci pays close attention to detail, so their stitching will be even and neat. If thread is pulling out or if it seems uneven on a bag, that bag is likely a fake. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Examine the back of the label.",
      "content": "Examine the back of the label. The back of the label should have the serial hand-stamped on it. The letters should be small and close together. If they are widespread apart, it's likely a fake. [3] X Research source Also look for the copyright symbol (a circle with an R in it). The label should also have \"Gucci\" on it. Look specifically at the \"u,\" which should be less bold on the right than the left. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the seams.",
      "content": "Check the seams. Where seams meet, the pattern should line up precisely. Also, letters and logos won't be cut in half with the real thing. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Feel the leather.",
      "content": "Feel the leather. The leather shouldn't be tough, but rather, soft and supple. Obviously, that is harder to see online, but in person, you should feel the leather. [6] X Research source On Gucci bags, the leather should be pebbled napa leather. Microsuede is a dead giveaway for a fake. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for glue lines.",
      "content": "Look for glue lines. If you can see glue spilling out anywhere, it likely isn't a Gucci. Check where the different types of materials meet, and look at the lining inside for glue. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Check for rust.",
      "content": "Check for rust. The metal on Gucci bags should not rust. Look closely at the places where the metal meets the leather or canvas. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for the sheen.",
      "content": "Look for the sheen. Gucci bags are usually canvas. When you tilt them in the light, they should be lightly shiny. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Examine against the real thing.",
      "content": "Examine against the real thing. That is, visit a store to see the real thing in person. Counterfeiters will often get parts of the bag wrong, especially on the inside, such as pocket locations or lining color. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Look at the \"About Us\" page.",
      "content": "Look at the \"About Us\" page. Authenticate sites will have information on their store and a mission on their about me page. Authenticate sites are more likely to have the real thing. [13] X Research source Of course, fake stores can set up a fake \"About Us\" page. However, if it's missing, it's a giveaway of a low-quality store."

      "content": "Examine whether it's a site with one seller. Sites such as Amazon and eBay feature multiple sellers, so it's more difficult to tell if you have a quality seller.
