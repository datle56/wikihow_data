      "title": "The 👻 represents an actual ghost, and by extension, anything paranormal.",
      "content": "The 👻 represents an actual ghost, and by extension, anything paranormal. On a very literal level, the 👻 is a ghost, and it’s often used to signify an actual ghost. However, it can really be used to signify anything supernatural or paranormal. For example: “Have you ever seen a 👻?” “I heard this story about a spirit in the woods where I grew up. I never saw it, but a friend of mine said they heard the voice of a 👻 late one night.” “Tell me a 👻 story! I’m bored.”"

      "title": "A ghost emoji can stand in for anything related to Halloween.",
      "content": "A ghost emoji can stand in for anything related to Halloween. The 👻 kind of looks like the old “white sheet with eyeholes cut out” costume that kids wear on Halloween. On top of that, ghosts are a popular staple of any Halloween décor. Someone could say: “Are you going to the 👻 party at Ben’s this weekend?” “What are you dressing up as for 👻?” “I can’t wait to go trick-or-treating this year 👻.”"

      "title": "The ghost on its own 👻 may refer specifically to Snapchat.",
      "content": "The ghost on its own 👻 may refer specifically to Snapchat. You may not have noticed since the app’s logo doesn’t have a face, but Snapchat’s logo is a ghost. This is a pretty straightforward substitution. You can use the 👻 to refer to the social media app. For example: “Do you have 👻?” “Did you see the 👻 I sent you?” “I don’t know anyone using 👻 anymore. Everyone is on TikTok.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "A 👻 can be a reference to “ghosting” someone.",
      "content": "A 👻 can be a reference to “ghosting” someone. Ghosting refers to the practice of totally disappearing and going unresponsive—usually over text or when you meet someone online. The 👻 can replace the word “ghosting,” but because it’s such a funny-looking emoji the implication is usually that someone isn’t all that upset about being ghosted. [1] X Research source “Remember that date I was looking forward to? They 👻 me. Can you believe it?!” “I’m 100% going to 👻 you if you don’t text me back about tonight lol.” If you text someone and they don’t reply for 24 hours, you might just send a single “👻.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "The 👻 can be used to express a goofy, random tone.",
      "content": "The 👻 can be used to express a goofy, random tone. Just look at that little ghost. Really look at it. It’s ridiculous! This silly little ghoul is so goofy-looking that it’s often used to convey general dopiness and absurdity, but in a really fun and playful way. [2] X Research source Examples might include: “Guess who got up at 3 am and didn’t go back to sleep 👻” “She asked me what my favorite fast food was, and I went all 👻 and said ‘ketchup.’” “I’m feeling all 👻 today. Might go to the mall and yell at strangers.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "The 👻 can stand in for death in an ironic, playful way.",
      "content": "The 👻 can stand in for death in an ironic, playful way. If you just look at the words “I’m dead,” “it’s killing me,” or “I’m dying,” you might mistakenly think someone is seriously in trouble. The 👻 can be used to emphasize that you’re 100% not being literal so that the other person knows they have nothing to worry about. [3] X Research source For example: “I drank way too much last night. I’m dying over here 👻.” “I might turn into 👻. I’m seriously dying at work today.” “I’m dead 👻. That’s actually hysterical.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "A 👻 can stand in for “boo,” meaning “love” or “babe.”",
      "content": "A 👻 can stand in for “boo,” meaning “love” or “babe.” This cute little emoji can be used a little flirtatiously if you don’t want to be super forward. [4] X Research source However, this is more of a fringe use, so don’t be shocked if they don’t totally get what you’re getting at. You might say: “Hey 👻.” “You know you’re my 👻.” “What’s good 👻👻!?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "A 👻 might mean that someone feels unseen or unimportant.",
      "content": "A 👻 might mean that someone feels unseen or unimportant. Ghosts are often depicted as translucent, or see-through. As a result, some folks like to use the 👻 to imply that they’re not being respected or seen by others. Again, since the 👻 looks kind of silly, the implication here is often that people aren’t that upset about it. You might send something like: “Guess who was ignored again at the daily meeting? 👻” “I feel like a 👻 today. Nobody wants to hit me back to hang.” “You ever feel kind of 👻? Sometimes I feel like people don’t even notice me…”"

      "title": "You could use a 👻 put a fun spin on a convo about the paranormal.",
      "content": "You could use a 👻 put a fun spin on a convo about the paranormal. There isn’t a whole lot that’s scary about the ghost emoji, so if you want to have a more upbeat conversation about poltergeists or ghost stories, throw a 👻 in there to set the tone for the conversation. You could say: “My mom used to believe in 👻 and that was always so funny to me. She said she had a 👻” “I just saw the spookiest thing 👻!” “👻. Did I scare you?”"

      "title": "You might send a 👻 to decorate a text about Halloween.",
      "content": "You might send a 👻 to decorate a text about Halloween. The upbeat little 👻 emoji has a certain whimsy and joy about it. If you’re excited about Halloween, throw in a 👻 to let the person know you’re really getting into the holiday spirit. You might say: “I can’t wait! It’s 👻 season! Candy and costumes—get ready!” “What are you dressing up for this Halloween? I can’t decide, but I’m totally amped! 👻” “It’s 👻 time! I am going to consume all the candy in the land this year.”"

      "content": "Employ a 👻 if you want to seem fun, playful, or absurd. If you’re using the 👻 in the zanier kind of way, throw it in somewhere so that whoever you’re talking to knows that you’re just being a goofball. This is an especially fun way to be kind of cute and warm while you’re putting your chaotic energy out there. For example: “I ascended. I have not slept in 24 hours. Let’s goooo 👻” “We are full on 👻 mode today. I’m turning up at school.” “I rue the day my enemies confront me 👻 👻 👻 👻”"

      "content": "Use a 👻 to indicate that you’re just messing around. The 👻 emoji is super versatile and inventive, but the throughline is that it’s silly. Just looking at the 👻, it’s kind of an enigma. Ghosts are supposed to be scary, but that emoji has a goofy look, it’s tongue sticking out, and it’s arms at its side like it’s ready to party. Use it to indicate you’re playing around by saying things like: “I want to party so hard this weekend that my eyes roll back in my head 👻” “You ready for me? I’m bring that whacky 👻 energy today.” “👻. That’s me showing up at your house in the middle of the night.”"

      "content": "Throw a lone 👻 out there if someone hasn’t gotten back to you . If you’re waiting on a reply from someone and you think they might have totally forgotten about you, send a single 👻 to sort of go, “Hey…did you ghost me?” This is much friendlier than confronting them about not responding or sending the super passive-aggressive “?” message.

      "content": "Be playful or coy with your crush by sending a 👻. The tongue-out look isn’t quite as suggestive as the 👅 (tongue emoji) or the 😋 (licking emoji) but it’s kind of in that ballpark if you use it in a flirty way. [6] X Research source If you’re texting your partner or your crush, you might say: “What’s up?! I miss you 👻.” “How are you! 👻” “You know you’re my little spooky scary cutie-pie 👻.”"
