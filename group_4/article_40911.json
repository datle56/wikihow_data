Set the colander or steamer basket inside the pot so it hangs on the lip of the pot. Make sure the water isn’t touching your veggies, or it could draw out their flavors or change their texture.

Set a heat-proof plate on the foil and pour your vegetables on it."

      "content": "Cover the pot and steam the vegetables until they’re tender. Put a lid on the pot to trap the steam inside so your vegetables can thaw and cook through. Most frozen vegetables are fully cooked and contain salt, so they can be steamed quickly and without salt. If you’re unsure whether your veggies are fully cooked, stick them with a fork. If they feel tough or hard in the center, then steam them a bit longer.

      "content": "Add 2–3 US tbsp (30–44 ml) of water to the bowl. The water in the bowl helps create steam, as well as keep your vegetables from drying out while they cook. Make sure the water only covers the bottom of the bowl, which should only take about 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) at most. If any of your vegetables are completely submerged, then you have too much water. [13] X Research source Avoid putting any more water in the bowl since it could make your vegetables soggy."

Just leave a small crack or opening on top so the steam can eventually escape. That way, pressure won’t build up inside the bowl. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Microwave your veggies on high for 3–5 minutes.",
      "content": "Microwave your veggies on high for 3–5 minutes. Put your vegetables in your microwave and set it to high power. Steam your vegetables in the microwave for a few minutes so they can thaw and warm up. If your vegetables still aren’t completely thawed or cooked through, then put them back in for 1-minute increments until they feel warm. [15] X Research source Be careful not to overcook your vegetables since they could turn mushy. Larger, firmer vegetables like potatoes, brussel sprouts, and broccoli may take a few minutes longer to cook through since they have thicker pieces. Poke the veggies with a fork and if they still feel tough in the middle, microwave them for another minute."

Since your microwave might not have turned all the water to steam in the bowl, carefully pour out any water that’s still leftover so the vegetables don’t get soggy.
