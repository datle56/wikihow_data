      "content": "If you sync contacts to your Android or iPhone from multiple accounts, you probably have duplicate contacts. For example, if you add a Gmail account to your iPhone and allow it to sync your contacts, your Gmail contacts will download to your iPhone. Then, if you already had a contact's phone number on your phone with a certain name, you'll now have a duplicate contact that could have a different name. You can fix this by deleting duplicates or merging contacts. If you have an Android, you can easily delete duplicate contacts using the Google Contacts app. [5] X Research source If you have an iPhone, go through your contact list and merge any duplicates you find. Then, adjust the names in your contacts to fix them in WhatsApp. [6] X Research source"

If you're using the same Apple ID or Google account to sign in to multiple phones (for example, if your whole family shares one Apple ID and has multiple iPhones), changes made to the contacts on one device will affect other devices, which also affects contact names in WhatsApp. Using unique Apple IDs for each iPhone and unique Google accounts for each Android will resolve this problem."
