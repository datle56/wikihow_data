      "content": "Add a second task. This is optional. If you wish, you can add a second task to the tag. What this does is when you tap an NFC tag for a second time, it performs a different task. This can be useful, but to start off with, don't add one until you get the hang of it. NFC tags can be re-written when you want, so don't worry about wasting a tag. Select 'done'."
