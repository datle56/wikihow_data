Some of these may be the same, such as raising your hand in class. Some may be different, such as dealing with hall passes or strict dress codes. But some of these will be difficult and different.

While staff will not demand perfection, your behavior will likely be held to a higher standard than in elementary school.

      "content": "Avoid drama and gossip. Naturally, people talk about other people's problems, behavior, and lives. While being informed of the social goings-on at school is healthy, unfortunately at times there may be lots of gossip and some seriously malicious rumors floating around. [4] X Research source Try to ignore rumors, even when they’re about you, and if anyone talks or asks you about a rumor, tell them to ignore it and not spread it around. Never start rumours; they only break friendships, create enemies, hurt feelings, and make things worse for everyone. Rumours have been known to cause loneliness, depression, anxiety, and even suicide. If you have an issue with someone, talk to them directly. Be kind. If someone is talking nastily about someone, feel free to react with kindness. For instance, if there is gossip about a breakup between two people, you can react by saying, \"That would be too bad if they broke up. But I don't see how that's any of my business.\" For rumours of a person's sexual orientation, know that a lot of people are LGBT+ and there is nothing wrong with it. If people are, they are, but you still shouldn't spread rumors about it because they might not be, or if they are they might not want people to know. Help stop rumours by standing up for people and not participating by spreading the rumor. Protect other people's privacy and mistakes. You wouldn't want someone spreading your personal secrets around, would you? Drama is unnecessary. Some people think that a life has to be filled with drama to be important and appreciated by others. It does not. Focusing on the things, people, and ideas that are really important is better than worrying about who is going to ask who to the dance. If you hear something worrying about a fellow student, particularly if you think they might harm themselves or others, rather than telling other students, tell a member of staff and they can deal with it appropriately."

While potentially having a romantic partner can be exciting, it can also be quite awkward to deal with middle school romances. Middle school romances do not tend to last long. Remember that movies, TV, and other media may portray middle school dating in an unrealistic way. Your results will vary. Some date, some do not. Do not feel like you are the only person who does not have a significant other, or have to be in a relationship. Most people will not be. You will mature at your own rate. In middle school, physical maturity is in a rapid state of development. Some seventh graders may look like they could sneak into high school prom, while others look much younger."

You've probably heard that you’ll have to change your clothes in front of others or maybe you've never been very good at gym and you feel embarrassed. What you have to remember is that everyone is worried and embarrassed, so you're not alone. You might feel like everyone is watching you while you change, but they are really focusing on getting themselves changed. Nobody will look at you, because they are too busy thinking you are watching them. Everyone wants to just keep to themselves and change as quickly as possible! In most middle schools in the U.S., you will not usually be forced to shower after class. While once this was almost universal practice, most PE teachers find there is not enough time for showering after class as there was in previous decades, and many are sensitive to this fact that it was a problematic time for students and staff alike. In most school locker rooms, you can usually change in a bathroom stall or shower stall if you prefer. A good strategy is to change your shirt first, when you change your pants, as your shirt will hide your underwear if you tend to be rather shy. If you wear a skirt or dress, you can change your bottoms under that. If you feel self-conscious about being on your period while you’re having to change, just wear dark underwear. No one will notice at all and if they do, they probably won't care as they likely go through the same thing. Middle school is all about those changes going on your body; if you feel nervous about them, talk to your parent or guardian, another trusted adult or a mentor/counselor. PE classes may not be the harsh physical activities portrayed in media or endured by your parents. In more recent years many schools now focus more on \"life activities\" that are not as competitive or intense. While competitive sports like soccer, football or field hockey may still be in the curriculum, it is also common to have units on yoga, cup stacking, rock climbing, cooperative games, pickleball , and archery."

      "content": "Don’t sweat the little things. You’ll be a much happier person and it will be much easier to deal with problems and the stress of middle school if you learn to worry only about the problems that really matter. This can be hard to do, and will probably take a long time to learn, but it’s worth keeping in mind. For example, don’t worry about stuff like losing a game (it’s just a game!), feeling left out (you’ll find your crowd someday and you’re probably not as alone as you feel), people making accusations about you (their drama is theirs, not yours, ignore them), or other kids teasing you (their opinion of you doesn't matter). Instead, worry about things like injustice, current events, and the world around you. These are things that matter and that you should always worry about: because if you don’t worry, you won’t do anything about it, and if people don’t do anything then the problems will never get better."

      "content": "Don't be afraid to be different. There will be many times where you will feel different and alone. You might be afraid because you find yourself having a crush on the \"wrong\" person. You might feel like no one understands you because you like the \"wrong\" things. You might feel left out because you and your parents don't look like everyone else. But it is very important for you to understand that no matter how alone you feel, no matter how \"wrong\" or weird you think you are, there are so many people just like you. Someday you're going to meet them and you're going to find better friends and family that you never thought you would... and you will be more happy than you ever thought you could be. You might notice, for example, that while all the other girls are giggling over boys, you don't feel the same way. You might find yourself wanting a very close relationship with another girl. This shouldn't make you feel like there is something wrong with you because there is nothing wrong with you. Give things time and take things slow. You don't need to worry about having all the answers. You might think that you're weird because your family doesn't look like or doesn't talk like everyone else's. Maybe your parents don't speak English. Maybe you have two dads. Maybe your dad is black and your mom is Asian. The important thing to understand is that families come in all shapes and sizes, and as long as you love each other, that's all that matters. You are just like everyone else. No matter how your family looks."
