    {
      "title": "Move your two pieces inward.",
      "content": "Move your two pieces inward. The Chinese checkerboard is shaped like a star. When the game starts, you have the option to move one of four pieces at the base of your point of the star. Move the piece all the way on the right forward and to the left. At your next move, move the piece all the way on the left forward and to the right. You should be left with the two pieces sitting right next to each other one step in front of all the rest of your pieces. [1] X Research source The idea behind starting inward is that you can make a direct route towards the center of the board. You also don’t want any lone wolf pieces, so keeping two pieces near one another is better than moving one forward alone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move your first two pieces outward.",
      "content": "Move your first two pieces outward. One other common opening move is very similar to the inward opening move. Rather than moving your two pieces forward and closer to each other, move them forward and further away from each other. That means the piece all the way on the right will move up and to the right and the piece on the left will move up and to the left. This is a less common but still viable strategy. [2] X Research source Moving your pieces outward is a fine opening move too. It also sets you up for a route directly across the board while keeping your pieces close to other pieces."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid using any other variation of opening move.",
      "content": "Avoid using any other variation of opening move. If you watch really good Chinese checkers players you’ll notice that they always start with one of two opening moves – the two moves listed above. If you don’t start with one of these two moves you are immediately putting yourself at a strategic disadvantage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set up your checkers correctly.",
      "content": "Set up your checkers correctly. The best way to get a few checkers out of your area is by moving the checker on the right or left of the triangle toward your opponent's checkers. Then, you use one of the second checkers from the corner of the triangle and hop it over the third and fifth checkers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your pieces toward the center of the board.",
      "content": "Keep your pieces toward the center of the board. Similar to chess rules, if you keep your pieces away from the side they are less likely to become stranded. A great way to get pieces along the middle of the board is by setting up a zigzag line of your pieces. Then you can take the last piece in the line and hop over the other pieces. In Chinese checkers you can move forward by hopping over the pieces in front of your checker. So if you have one piece in the back and a zigzag of other pieces across the board, you can hop all the way down the line of your pieces."

    {
      "title": "Avoid stragglers.",
      "content": "Avoid stragglers. You generally want to move your marbles as a group rather than having a lead scout marble or a marble stuck in the back. If you have a marble in front or stuck in the back it is unable to use your other marbles to travel forward. Similarly, if you have a marble way in front it is of no use to the marbles behind it. Marbles can hop on one another to travel forward but they have to be next to each other for this to work. Always look to jump your last marble forward so it doesn't get left behind.

    {
      "title": "Use a very direct route.",
      "content": "Use a very direct route. [4] X Research source The goal is to fill the entire tip of your opponents star with your pieces before they do the same to you. Because speed is important, you want to move your pieces as directly through the center of the board as possible. This obviously depends on how your opponent moves, but you don’t want to be moving your pieces off into unused portions of the board. You may think you are keeping them safe, but in reality you’re just taking them out of the game and making it more difficult for yourself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try a defensive strategy.",
      "content": "Try a defensive strategy. [5] X Research source Some players utilize a stay at home strategy. This means keeping one checker in the very tip of your star so that your opponent can never completely fill up your star. Keep in mind that you will be unable to win this way, since eventually you will need to move it out in order to fill up your opponents star. Some consider this strategy unsportsmanlike."

    {
      "title": "Anticipate your opponent.",
      "content": "Anticipate your opponent. You are allowed to make as many jumps during a turn as you want. However, that's not always the best strategy. [6] X Research source Try to pay attention not just to your own tactics but also to what your opponent is trying to accomplish. Blocking your opponent is one of the biggest parts of Chinese checkers. Put yourself in your opponent’s shoes and imagine what the next best move would be. Now think of other possible good moves, and try to guess which one you think they will do. It might serve you well only to make a few jumps and then block your opponent from being able to move to the space that they wanted to. Constantly assess your opponent’s intentions."

    {
      "title": "Move your pieces into every other row to fill up your goal area.",
      "content": "Move your pieces into every other row to fill up your goal area. This strategy is more efficient than working from the back to the front. You’ll be able to fill your goal area with fewer moves given that you can continue to hop over your own pieces. If you can occupy the goal area more quickly than your opponent then you’ll be more likely to win. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Practice against friends.",
      "content": "Practice against friends. The more you play the more comfortable you’ll be with the game and the more intuition you’ll develop. It’s much easier to anticipate moves if you have seen them before. Play as much as possible."

      "title": "Play online against computers.",
      "content": "Play online against computers. [8] X Research source If you can’t find people to play with you can always play online. Many websites have free Chinese checkers available. Set the computer difficulty to a setting that is appropriate for your skill level."

    {
      "title": "Play against yourself.",
      "content": "Play against yourself. This may seem silly, but if you are playing against yourself you’ll force yourself to think about the counters to every single move that you normally make. If you play against yourself, you’ll be aware of the ways that you can counter your opponent. You will also be aware of the ways that they can counter your favorite moves when you play for real."
