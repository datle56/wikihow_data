      "content": "Getting stuck together is known as a “copulatory tie,” and it’s completely normal. Called a “tie” for short, sticking together or getting stuck back-to-back is a perfectly natural occurrence that can last anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes after the male dog has finished ejaculating. There’s no need to intervene! [1] X Research source The breed of the dogs may influence how long they remain stuck together. Dogs that haven’t bred before and dogs that are nervous after mating may also take longer to unlock."

If the dogs are becoming overactive, anxious, or playful, leash them to keep them under control until they’re unstuck."

      "title": "Why do dogs get stuck together after mating?",
      "content": "Why do dogs get stuck together after mating? The male dog’s penis, or bulbis glandis, expands and the female dog’s vaginal muscles tighten, creating a copulatory tie. Usually, the dogs will stand butt-to-butt until the swelling subsides. The copulatory tie can prevent another male from mating with the female before fertilization has occurred. It may also prevent sperm from leaking out, which increases the chances of pregnancy. Dogs may wait back-to-back as a defense mechanism to protect themselves from other animals, as mating is a vulnerable act in the wild."

      "title": "Does a tie mean the female is pregnant?",
      "content": "Does a tie mean the female is pregnant? Not necessarily, but it can improve the chances of fertilization. Pregnancy can also occur without a tie, called slip mating, but is less likely. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Does it hurt the dogs?",
      "content": "Does it hurt the dogs? It can be uncomfortable or even a bit painful, especially if this is either dog’s first time breeding. Dogs without experience may not know the most comfortable position to wait out the tie. Still, don’t try to separate them, which would cause more pain and potential injury. Just wait it out and do your best to keep them calm. [7] X Research source The female dog may bark, howl, or make other noises while she’s tied to the male. This could just be her way of communicating with him, and may not indicate that she’s in pain. [8] X Research source"
