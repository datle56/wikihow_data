      "content": "Put on your bra. You should choose a bra with some padding: this conceals the extra padding you add. It's advisable to also wear your top while you stuff so that you can make adjustments accordingly. Depending on how large you want to go, you may need to use a bra that is two to three cup sizes larger than you usually wear. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Push your breasts up in the cups. Put your hand into the bra and gently cup your breast tissue, moving each breast up and towards the center. This creates the cleavage that your socks are going to hold up."

      "title": "Choose your socks.",
      "content": "Choose your socks. The sock thickness and size depends on how much you want to increase the appearance of your breasts. Use thick socks for maximum boost. This is great for parties or for dramatic cleavage. For a subtle boost, try using thin hosiery socks. This may be preferable for everyday use, formal occasions or slinky dresses that require just a bit more bust. Whatever thickness you choose, try to use soft socks to avoid chafing."

    {
      "title": "Fold your socks.",
      "content": "Fold your socks. Again, how you fold may depend on the type of sock. A good rule of thumb is that the sock should be folded in on itself once. Fold the sock in half with the heel at the center. Tuck the toes into the top of the sock enough so that the fold is the right size to fit into the bottom of your bra cup. Adjust the fold so that it's flat."

      "content": "Create an X-back for dramatic cleavage. Straps that cross in the back tend to pull the breasts together, creating more cleavage. You can convert your bra into an X-back by grasping the straps together behind your shoulder blades and lacing them through a paperclip or safety pin. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy a pair of breast enhancers.",
      "content": "Buy a pair of breast enhancers. Silicone and foam are common materials; one might be a better choice than the other, depending on your breast size and the shape you're after. Silicone inserts are easy to use, have a naturally squishy feel, and are particularly good for creating high, dramatic cleavage.
