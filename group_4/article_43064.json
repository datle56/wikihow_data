      "content": "Choose the right means. There are lots of different ways to tell a girl that she's beautiful and they don't always mean just saying \"You're beautiful\" to some girl. Anyone can do that. If you want to stand out, you've got to get a little creative. Choose how you want to deliver the compliment. Do you want to talk to the girl in person, or do you want to do something like write her a letter or text her telling her about how beautiful you think she is. Writing a letter is fun and old-fashioned and something very few people do nowadays. She'll definitely remember a letter telling her she's beautiful."

This could be as simple as giving her a flower (or an origami flower) or small, individual token when you give her the compliment. You could give her a small item and say 'I just wanted to make sure you know how beautiful you are.'"

      "content": "Pick the right time. Just blurting out 'you're beautiful' to a girl probably isn't going to do much for her or you, especially if either of you are drunk. Telling a girl she's beautiful (if you're looking to do it properly) needs to be properly timed. [2] X Research source [3] X Expert Source Mark Rosenfeld Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 29 July 2021. Try to do it at an unusual time. Most girls have been told they're beautiful when they're all dressed up for a night out.
