It’s true—we identify personally with our home environments, so when things around us aren’t tidy, chances are that our minds aren’t, either. [1] X Research source That won’t do for a spiritual bath, so start by cleaning your bathroom , and pay special attention to your tub, where you’ll be relaxing. Take this opportunity to throw out or consolidate any empty or almost-empty bath products, organize your bathroom counter, and wipe down that mirror, too."

Light a candle (or seven) of your favorite scent and place it on the edge of the tub, where you won’t accidentally knock it over. Also arrange any energy crystals you might have on the tub’s edge.

      "content": "Set your intention while filling your bath. Turn on the tap and listen to the rush of water. Let it enter your mind and start washing away your worries and negative thoughts, even before you’re in the tub. Then, set and focus on your intention for this spiritual bath. Ask yourself: how are you trying to feel afterward? What troubles do you want to get off your mind? [5] X Research source Do you want to be more firm in your boundaries? Think of what you want this bath to help you with and focus on it in your mind. For example, if you want to work on letting go of your past, you might repeatedly think to yourself, “I’m using this bath to cleanse myself of my past and prepare myself for my future.” Other intentions might include: “I’m taking this spiritual bath to reset my negative thoughts,” or, “This spiritual bath is help me feel safer and happier,” or even, “This bath will renew my energy and determination.” Also, visualize the future you want for yourself by imagining yourself living that life—working a successful career, finding a life partner, etc."

Then, soak and enjoy your bath for 10-15 minutes—any longer and you might start to prune! [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This allows you to really immerse yourself in the energies and let your spirit be cleansed. For example, you might say a prayer of gratitude like, “Thank you for this rejuvenating and healing bath, and for all the wonderful things in my life.” Take a minute to think of a list of things you’re grateful for while you bathe. You might say a mantra like, “I am cleansing my body and spirit,” or, “My energies are restored and renewed,” or, “This bath makes me happier and healthier.” You may also call upon your spirit guide to intensify the spirit bath’s energy and guide you through the ritual.

      "content": "Climb out and air dry for 30 minutes while you close the ritual. After your bath, it’s best to air dry to really let the oils and energies work their way into your body. Lay a towel or two on your bed, lie down, and relax by breathing in for 10 seconds, then out for 10 seconds, repeatedly. Focus on letting your muscles relax one at a time, starting with your toes, then feet, and working your way up to your head for the best soothing effect.

      "content": "Spiritual baths are baths meant to help you relax and meditate. A bath on its own is a great way to relax while washing up, but a spiritual bath takes it to the next level. During a spiritual bath, you set a meditative intention (something you want to reflect on or work toward) and focus on self-care, self-improvement, and cleansing your energies as well as your body. Spiritual bathers enjoy customizing their own experience by adding flower petals, essential oils, crystals, and other spiritual objects to their session.

      "content": "Spiritual baths are rooted in a deep history of bathing. While spiritual baths as we know them were recently popularized on TikTok and other social media platforms, they come from some old traditions. Water as a spiritual signifier is an idea that’s been around since Ancient Greece. [10] X Research source Christianity and other religions use them to baptize or anoint their followers. A spiritual bath is a way of participating in that history in a more personalized and customized way. Many cultures both ancient and modern have gods or spiritual beings tied to water, like the Egyptian god of the Nile, Sobek, or the Aztec goddess Chalchiuhtlicue who represented every natural form of water."
