If you've been told you need to use a VPN to connect to your company or organization's network, you'll need to gather some information from your organization. The information you'll need varies by network, but you'll typically need to install a special app or program, for which you'll need a unique username and password. Your IT department will determine if your computer is compatible with the VPN software, help you make your computer compatible if it is not, and help you access to the VPN. Your IT department may give you a default VPN password then allow you to set your own. Use a password that is unique, but easy to remember and do not write it down or stick it anywhere near or on your computer. Avoid using birth dates, the names of close family members or anything that someone else might be able to guess. Contact your IT department immediately if you have to reinstall or upgrade your operating system or restore your computer to an earlier point. You may lose your VPN settings."

If you're using a VPN for personal reasons, such as for online anonymity or to access sites in other countries, you have many options. There are both paid and free VPN services available, and both have merits: Free VPNs are usually only free because they tend to limit the amount of data you can use, throttle your network speeds, have ads, and/or can only be used on one device at a time. They can be handy if you only need a VPN once in a while, such as when you're using public Wi-Fi at a café or library.

Some popular free VPN options you can check out are ProtonVPN , WindScribe , and Speedify . If you are looking for a solution that hides your activity from surveillance, gives you plenty of data without throttling your speeds, and is more reliable, go for a well-reviewed paid service.

Before signing up with a service, search the internet for its name and \"reviews,\" and try to find out about peoples' personal experiences with the product. Reddit is a great place to search for honest reviews. You may want to check out VPN services that don't log your activity—the problem is, it's hard to know which providers are really telling the truth. ExpressVPN is a service that was proven to not log customer data when Turkish authorities raided their data center in search of customer information. [4] X Research source"

If you are using a company's VPN, or most personal software, this will grant you secure access to your network. You may see a new window that looks like your desktop at work, also known as a virtual desktop, where you can access your company resources. Or, you may need to launch your web browser and enter a secure web address where you can access your company's resources. If you're using a VPN service that restricts how much data you can use or how much time you can spend using it, only activate it when you need to secure your IP address."
