      "title": "Jot down your thoughts without censoring yourself.",
      "content": "Jot down your thoughts without censoring yourself. No matter how you brainstorm, gathering your ideas is integral to nailing a memorable and romantic proposal. You can grab a notebook and jot down your thoughts in a stream-of-consciousness style. You could also do this on your Notes app, or even use a voice memo app if writing isn’t your thing. Focus on how much you love this person and what you’d like them to know about how you feel about them. Don’t worry too much about delivering an organized play-by-play, just make sure you have mental bullet points of what to say when the time comes. [1] X Research source Examples: “I love how she always smells like ____…\" “The cute way she eats [_____], savoring each bite…” “How well she took care of me when [_________]…”"

    {
      "title": "Speak from the heart.",
      "content": "Speak from the heart. Tell them how you truly feel and stick to your authentic self, which is exactly who your future fiancée fell in love with. You want to sound like yourself, so use language you would typically use. That way, you won't sound rehearsed or stiff. Examples: “You know I’m not the best with words, but__________.” “Before you, nobody had ever made me feel like _________.” “You inspire me every day to_____________.”"

      "title": "Take a walk down memory lane.",
      "content": "Take a walk down memory lane. Reminiscing on the past seems like the natural next step in your proposal. Looking back together at those sweet and pivotal moments in your relationship when you began to realize that this had lifelong potential is a great way to start clueing your partner in to your intentions. Where did you meet? Or go on your first date? When did you realize your partner was “the one”? Was it the first time they made you a homecooked meal? Or maybe it was on your first weekend getaway, when you saw the cherry blossoms bloom in Washington D.C. These personal touches make for a thoughtful proposal. [2] X Research source Examples: “The trip we took to ____ to see the ________” “Remember how we ate at ______ on our first date and you hated the _____?” “I’ll never forget what you wore that day...\""

      "title": "List the reasons why you love them.",
      "content": "List the reasons why you love them. Maybe it’s because they treat every person they meet with kindness and respect. Maybe it’s because they love to learn, or make beautiful art. Maybe it’s because of their one crooked tooth, which really makes for a stellar and unique smile. Whatever your reasons, this is a great time to explain just how highly you think of them. This isn’t about showering them with random compliments. Instead, let your significant other know with thoughtful consideration exactly why it is that you want to marry them. Examples: “I love the way you ________.” “You’ve shown me the meaning of unconditional love by _______.” “You’re the only person who ________…”"

    {
      "title": "Look toward the future.",
      "content": "Look toward the future. You’ve spoken from the heart, reflected on the past, and told them all the reasons why you're madly in love with them. Now it’s time to look ahead, and to share your vision of a future together. Whether it’s children, travel, or building an empire, reaffirm that building a future together is the ultimate goal. Where do you see yourself in five years? 10? 50? Old and gray, with a house full of grandkids? Or on a fabulous, post-retirement transatlantic cruise? Come what may– sickness, health, that sort of thing– make sure your partner knows you want to do it all with them. Examples: “Whatever the future holds, all I know is want you in it…” “I love imagining you as the mother of my children…” “I know we can weather any storm that comes our way…”"

      "content": "Pop the question. If you’ve gotten to this point, you’ve definitely done the leg-work–pun intended. Get down on one knee if you’re not already there. Then, say the four little words that all of this has been leading up to: “Will you marry me?” Some believe this is the most important question you will ever ask, followed by the most important answer you will ever receive."

      "content": "Keep your speech short and sweet. Although there's a few checkboxes to check, try not to overwhelm yourself or your partner with a long, drawn-out novel of a speech. Stick to the main points and don't delay asking the question-- you've got this!"

    {
      "title": "Use language that sounds like you.",
      "content": "Use language that sounds like you. It's important to articulate yourself well during this memorable moment, but you don't want to sound like anyone else. Even if deferring to 18th-century poetry does feel appropriate for the occasion, use words that come naturally and genuinely speak on your feelings toward your partner. After all, a love like yours is a rare thing indeed!"

      "title": "Don’t be afraid to get emotional.",
      "content": "Don’t be afraid to get emotional. If you get emotional in the process– even better! Your partner will likely get choked up, too. Your shared vulnerability can only enhance this precious, once-in-a-lifetime moment, so don’t be afraid of surrendering to those feelings of nervousness, excitement, and tenderness.

      "content": "Practice your proposal ahead of time. Try to strike a balance between practicing what you want to say and letting the emotions flow in the moment. Remember, you don't want to wing it, as this memorable event will likely be talked about between you two for the rest of your lives."
