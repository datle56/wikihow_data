      "content": "Understand how processors and motherboards work. Your computer's motherboard is essentially one large circuit board which provides the base into which you'll plug your computer's other components, including the processor. Since processors' sizes and connectors vary depending on the model, you will need to ensure that your selected processor works with your current motherboard."

      "content": "Know your computer's limitations. While you can upgrade virtually all Windows desktop processors and motherboards, upgrading a laptop's processor is often impossible; even if your laptop model supports changing the processor, doing so is a tricky process that is more likely to harm your computer than help it.

      "title": "Determine the type of processor socket used by your motherboard.",
      "content": "Determine the type of processor socket used by your motherboard. If you're using Speccy to find your motherboard's information, you'll click the CPU tab and look at the \"Package\" heading to determine the socket. You can click the Motherboard tab and then review the \"Chipset\" heading to see your processor's chipset, though the service you'll use to check processor compatibility usually determines this for you. If you decided not to use Speccy, you can enter your motherboard's name and model number, followed by \"socket\" and \"chipset\", into a search engine and search through the results. Alternately, you can almost always find the socket type listed on the motherboard around the CPU socket."

You'll have to find a processor based on your current motherboard's socket size and chipset: Go to https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Support/CPU-Support in your computer's web browser. Click the Choose Socket drop-down box, then select your motherboard's socket number. Click the Choose Chipset drop-down box, then click chipset number (usually, there is only one number here). Click the \"Search\" icon to the right of the chipset number, then review the names of compatible processors in the pop-up window."

While you can easily type your processor's specifications and the phrase \"supported motherboards\" into a search engine and review the results, using a CPU support site to do the work for you is easier: Go back to https://www.gigabyte.com/Support/CPU-Support in your computer's web browser. Click the Choose Processor Series drop-down box, then select your processor's name. Click the Choose Model drop-down box, then click your processor's model. Click the \"Search\" icon to the right of the model number, then review the list of compatible motherboards in the \"Model\" column."

Now that you know which processors will work with your computer's motherboard, you can select the one best-suited to your price range, computational needs, and region. Always shop around to find the best deal. You may be able to find the same processor for significantly less online than in a store. If you're buying a new motherboard as well, make sure you compare different website and store prices before ordering it."

To remove the heat sink, you may have to unclip it from the motherboard, unscrew it, or slide it out. Since each heat sink has a different design—and, thus, a different installation process—you'll need to consult your heat sink's instruction manual for model-specific removal steps."

      "content": "Plug in your new processor. Your processor should only fit into the slot one way, so don't force it; just gently place the processor in its slot and check to make sure that it's level. If the processor is tilted or won't seat properly, try rotating 90 degrees until it does fit. Try not to touch the connectors on the bottom of the processor, as doing so may harm the processor."
