      "content": "Pick your contest. Go online and use your favorite search engine to find contests near you, or in the closest major city. Choose a contest where you’ll be eating food you enjoy, as this will make training and competing easier. Decide whether you want to compete over speed and quantity, or something else. Most contests will require you to try to eat the largest amount of a certain food in a timed competition. This means you’ll need to train to eat a lot of food as quickly as you can. Other contests may just want you to eat their Mega-Hot spicy wings. Make sure it’s a contest you’re allowed to compete in. Some are reserved for “amateurs,” and they’ll bar professional eaters from competing. [1] X Research source This means that if you’ve already earned money from winning an eating contest, you won’t be allowed in. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn the rules of the contest to train properly. There are lots of strategies competitors use to win, but some won’t be allowed at certain competitions. Check your competition’s website or call to ask about specific strategies and requirements, including: [3] X Research source Dunking, which means that you “dunk” foods into liquids before putting them in your mouth. This makes solids easier to chew and swallow. Anything-goes eating, which allows you to do anything you want to eat food faster. Picnic-style eating, which means that you need to eat food how it’s meant to be eaten. You can’t dunk, mash food up into balls, or separate items that go together (a hotdog and a bun, for example)."

Write down all the different elements of the meal you’ll be eating, and think about how you’ll tackle each one. Determine what parts of the contest will be easiest and hardest for you based on your current eating habits. [4] X Research source For example, if you know your mouth gets dry when you eat lots of bread, stuffing buns in your mouth is going to be tough. Plan to address this in training, and strategize by sipping liquids with the breads."

      "content": "Learn to swallow bigger bites for speed eating. Start by training with water. Take a big gulp, tilt your head back, and allow gravity to help you swallow. Increase the amount of water until your mouth is completely full, and try to swallow this gulp. Practice daily. [6] X Research source Once you’re comfortable with water, graduate to soft foods like rice and quinoa. You can then do more difficult foods, like steak. Move slowly through this process, as you don’t want to choke. Never do this kind of training without another person present. If you do have a problem, you need to be able to get help quickly."

Begin eating large amounts of low-calorie, high-fiber foods that fill you up quickly. [7] X Research source How much you need to eat depends on your size and competition. Some competitive eaters will eat several pounds of cooked or raw cabbage, for example, in a single sitting while in training. [8] X Research source High-fiber foods will make you feel fuller earlier, and you’ll stay full longer. This will make training with them more difficult than with other foods, because you’ll be fighting against that feeling of fullness.

While some competitive eaters also train by chugging gallons of water or milk in a single sitting, this could be dangerous for your health. Stick with the cabbage."

As a general rule, try doubling what you’d normally have. For the beginning of the week, consider eating a light breakfast and having the large meal at lunch.

If your contest is in the late afternoon or evening, you can add some light solids to your breakfast, such as eggs or cereal. You may also want to exercise before the contest, as this could increase your hunger level. Don’t overdo it, as you don’t have a lot in your body to keep you going.
