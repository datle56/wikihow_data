      "content": "Soften cuticles with cuticle remover or softener. Before you use a cuticle pusher or nippers, it is important to use a cuticle softener or remover. This will make it easier to push back the cuticles and also to remove any excess skin with the nippers. [1] X Research source Try soaking nails in a solution of warm water with a few drops of hand soap in it. Let the nails soak for about five minutes. Then, remove the nails from the water and dry them off with a towel. Apply a drop of cuticle softener to each cuticle and rub it around gently."

      "content": "Push back the cuticle. Use the rounded edge of your cuticle pusher to gently push back the cuticle. Do this for all of the nails. [2] X Research source Make sure that you do not force the cuticle back. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Just push it back gently. If the cuticles are difficult to push back, then you might want to soak the nails in warm water for a little longer."

      "content": "Use pointed end of the cuticle pusher to scrape away dirt and debris. The cuticle pusher should have a pointed end on the opposite side. You can use this side of the cuticle pusher to scrape away any debris or dirt that is near the cuticle. [4] X Research source Be careful with this tool. Do not try to stick it under the cuticle."

      "title": "Squeeze excess skin with the cuticle nippers.",
      "content": "Squeeze excess skin with the cuticle nippers. After you finish pushing back and cleaning around the cuticle, check for any excess skin around the cuticle area that might interfere with painting the nail. If you spot any excess skin, then you can use the cuticle nippers to remove it. [5] X Research source To use the cuticle nippers, open the nippers and place them over the excess skin. Look for skin that is sticking out or that appears ragged. Then, squeeze the nippers to sever the skin from the cuticle and then release. Do not squeeze the skin and pull! This may result in bleeding. After you release the nippers, the skin you squeezed should come right off or you should be able to brush the skin away."

      "content": "Trim nails with a straight edge clipper. If the nails are much longer than you want them to be, then you will first need to use a straight edged nail clipper to bring down the length. [6] X Research source A straight-edged nail clipper will result in some square edges, but it will also allow you to be more accurate. Clip only a small amount of the nail at a time. Otherwise, you may end up trimming too much."

      "title": "File your nails.",
      "content": "File your nails. Next, you will need to file down any rough edges left on the nail. Use a nail file to smooth out ridges and to start to shape the nail. [7] X Research source There are some important things to keep in mind when you file nails. Make sure that you: Start with a fine nail file. Nail files have grits like sandpaper, so choosing a nail file with a high number grit will mean that it is finer. A lower number grit nail file will have a coarser edge. It is best to start with a high grit or fine nail file to avoid tearing or damaging your nails. File your nails in one motion. Do not use a sawing motion to file your nails. Instead, place the file against one edge of the nail, move it in a swift forward motion, and then remove it from the nail and start over. Hold the edge of the nail file flat against the edge of your nail. If you angle the file, then this can thin out the nailâ€™s tip and weaken it."

      "title": "Buff nails for a smooth finish.",
      "content": "Buff nails for a smooth finish. After you are done filing, use a nail buffer to smooth out the tops of the nails. This will improve the texture of the nails and make it easier to apply and even coat of nail polish. Use a back and forth motion to buff your nails. Some nail buffers also include a shine edge that you can use to give nails a natural shine after you finish buffing them. Buffing your nails is a good nail care practice as long as you do not do it too often. Buff your nails no more than once per week. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Dispose of items that are not reusable. Some items cannot be cleaned, so you will have to dispose of these after you use them. For example, emery board cannot be properly disinfected because the material is too porous. Throw these items away along with: [9] X Research source Wooden cuticle pushers. Cotton balls and swabs. Paper towels. Toe separators."

      "title": "Disinfect your instruments.",
      "content": "Disinfect your instruments. After you have washed your tools to remove the debris, you will also need to disinfect them. This often requires soaking the tools in a disinfectant solution. When disinfecting your tools, always keep in mind that: [11] X Research source Spraying your tools is not enough. It is important to immerse tools in disinfectant so that they are fully covered. Ultraviolet cabinets are not a suitable replacement for disinfectant. They may be used for storage, but only after items have been properly cleaned and disinfected. You need to mix disinfectant fresh every day. Disinfectant solution cannot be reused day after day."
