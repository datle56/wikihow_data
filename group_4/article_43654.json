For example, if you’re thanking your boss or someone you have a professional relationship with, your note should be more formal. If you’re addressing a friend or family member, it’s usually okay to be more casual."

      "content": "Start the note with your thanks. When starting a thank you card, Claytor says, “The first thing you start off with is the person’s name, like ‘Dear Sally, thank you so much for…’ and you put in the specific.” Identify your purpose for writing (in this case, expressing thanks or gratitude) at the beginning of your note. This lets the recipient know what to expect from the rest of the note and shows that you have strong communication skills."

Directly mention whatever you’re thanking the person for, whether it was a gift, a specific task they helped you with, or anything else. Let them know why you appreciated their efforts so much, and how their help impacted you. Being specific helps personalize the letter so the recipient knows you’re truly grateful."

Claytor advises, “Give a compliment to the person you’re sending the thank you card to, like ‘You’re a lovely person’ or ‘You’re easy to talk to.’ In business, say ‘Regards,’ ‘Best regards,’ or ‘Warm regards.’ For personal, I always use ‘With love.’”"
