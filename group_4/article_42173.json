      "content": "Pour 1 cup (240 ml) of boiling water into a large glass bowl. Use either a kettle or pot and boil 1 cup of water. When the water starts bubbling, remove it from the flame. Then pour it into a large glass mixing bowl. [1] X Research source Pour the water gently so it doesn’t splash and burn you. Use an oven mitt while handling the pot for extra safety. This amount of water should fill about 1/3 of the bowl. If the bowl you’re using is larger than this, double the Jello servings. This recipe is for small packets of Jello, which contain 6 oz. (170 g). If you’re using large packets, which hold 12 oz. (340 g), boil 2 cups (480 ml) instead."

Continue stirring until all the mix dissolves. [2] X Research source Don’t forget that the water is hot. Be careful holding or grabbing the bowl."

      "content": "Add 1 cup (240 ml) of cold water to the mixture and stir for 2 minutes. Pour the cold water in and stir at the same time. Stir for at least 2 minutes so everything mixes together. [3] X Research source If you stir for less time, the Jello won’t be as firm. This is important because the Jello needs to be very firm to support an object."

    {
      "title": "Leave the Jello in the refrigerator for 4 hours.",
      "content": "Leave the Jello in the refrigerator for 4 hours. This gives the Jello plenty of time to cool and firm up so it supports the weight of the object. Place the bowl out of the way where no one will disturb or knock it over. [4] X Research source If there is uncovered food in your refrigerator that might transfer to the Jello, cover the bowl with plastic wrap. If not, then leave the Jello uncovered while it's setting. The Jello needs to be very firm for this to work, so don’t take it out early. There are “speed-setting” tricks to make Jello set faster, but don’t use them for this trick. The Jello won’t be firm enough."

      "title": "Wash the object you’re using if you plan to eat the Jello.",
      "content": "Wash the object you’re using if you plan to eat the Jello. Keep everything sanitary by washing the object with soap and warm water. Then rinse it off thoroughly to remove any suds. [5] X Research source Placing office supplies like staplers into the Jello is a common workplace prank. For party desserts, try using plastic fish and blue Jello to look like a lake. Other toys and action figures also add a fun twist to this project. If an object is heavier, like a stapler, make sure it has a flat surface area so it sits on top of the Jello rather than poking through. Also if you’re going to eat the Jello, don’t use a small or sharp object that could injure someone. Be especially careful if you’re serving the Jello to children. Use large objects that they can’t swallow. Check any objects you use for small pieces that might break off. Remove these before encasing it in Jello."

Let it sit for a few minutes to make sure it doesn’t sink. [6] X Research source If the object does start sinking, take it off and put the Jello back into the refrigerator for another hour. If the object keeps sinking after that, it may be too heavy. Consider using a different object."

[8] X Research source If you’re using a large bowl and this serving size doesn’t cover the object, try adding another Jello packet or 2 and using more water. Add 1 cup (480 ml) of hot and cold water for each packet you use."
