      "content": "Choose a supplement from a reputable manufacturer. Since MSM is increasingly popular as a health product, there are many brands currently selling variants of MSM powder. There isn’t much regulation for health supplements, so it can be difficult to decide which brand is reputable. A good strategy is to always investigate the manufacturer. The US Office of Dietary Supplements recommends directly contacting manufacturers and asking to speak with someone who can answer all your questions. If you have trouble getting a representative on the phone, this is a red flag. [2] X Research source Search for the manufacturer online and see if they have a good reputation. If you do an internet search and find that a manufacturer has had legal problems or safety violations in the past, avoid their product. Ask the manufacturer or retailers for the full nutrition facts for this supplement. If they don’t provide this information right away or offer excuses, this is a bad sign. Obtain full information before putting anything into your body. Check with an independent organization like the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) Dietary Supplement Verification Program, which assesses the safety and reliability of dietary supplements. Visit their website at https://www.quality-supplements.org/ . If possible, get the supplements from a pharmacy rather than the internet. That way you can ask the pharmacist if there is a brand they would recommend."

      "content": "Take 1,000-2,000 mg of MSM powder per day. There is currently no agreed-upon dosage for MSM powder. Recommendations range from 2,000-8,000 mg per day. Each brand of MSM powder assigns its own dosage, so check the packaging for this information. When you find this information, start with a lower dosage to introduce it into your system slowly. Beginning with 1,000-2,000 mg per day allows your body to get used to the supplement and wards off side effects. [3] X Research source Trials have found that up to 6,000 mg per day has no adverse side effects. Larger doses are untested, so there is no information on their safety. It is good practice to avoid using products that suggest a higher dosage. [4] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source"

      "content": "Measure out the correct dosage, mix it into a glass of water, and drink it. Use a measuring spoon or cup and carefully measure out the correct dosage. Pay attention to the amount you’re using and be sure you don’t use too much. Scoop the listed dosage into a full glass of water and stir for a few seconds. MSM powder is water soluble, so most of it may dissolve. Then drink the mixture. Wash it down with another glass of water if you feel remnants of powder in your mouth. [5] X Research source An eating spoon is not an accurate way to measure a health supplement. Use something that gives you an exact measurement. Some MSM supplements say they can be mixed into juices or smoothies. It is very specific to each brand, so follow the listed instructions."
