Most educational entrepreneurs need at least one full year between beginning this process and officially opening their schools. Take a look at this sample timeline: September/October: Contact accrediting bodies and review state education laws. November: Prepare your school’s mission statement. December: Check out possible buildings and study local demographics. January: Assemble your board of directors and start enrollment for the school. February: Work with the board to finalize your mission statement and incorporate the school. March: Have your proposed building inspected by the fire department and school officials. Initiate any necessary construction work. April: Interview and hire faculty and staff. Design school curriculum. May: Review student enrollment applications and send out admission letters. June/July: Purchase or collect donated furniture and teaching equipment. Assemble classrooms and equip the school with internet/phone services. August: Begin orientation meetings with faculty and staff. September: Open the school for its first academic year!"

Ask a few parents or influential people in your community to apply for the positions, especially if they have a vested interest in education. Reach out to people who have financial, legal, and management experience that can bring their skills to your school. [2] X Research source When you’ve found someone you want to join your board, send them an email or schedule a lunch where you can tell them about your mission and the need for your school. Find a compelling way to describe your path and how it’s brought you to this step. Then, schedule a meeting (in-person or over Zoom) to tell your potential board members more about why you need their expertise and how they will serve your community. If someone does commit, make sure you agree on the amount of time, financial support, and skills you need from them."

      "content": "Decide if you want to start a public or private school. Outside the public school system, you can start a charter or magnet school and keep it public. However, starting a charter school is an extremely complicated (and expensive) process, which makes it an unlikely choice for first-time school founders. It may be best to start with a private school business model . Review the options below to choose the best school type for you: [3] X Research source Charter schools are free to attend but run on an application system. Charters are granted by the state along with 3-5 years of funding. If the school fails to meet expectations, the charter is not renewed. Because charter schools run independently of the public school system, they can offer unique learning environments and specializations. However, teachers have a constant pressure to go above and beyond that can lead to burnout. Magnet schools are another type of public school that specialize in certain areas, e.g. technology, science, history, or the arts. Some magnet schools admit students based on achievement, while others operate on a lottery system. Traditional private schools operate completely separately from public school systems, which is why they charge tuition and fees to attend. Private schools can be nonprofit or for-profit, and they can also be religious or non-religious. Microschools or learning pods are schools with class sizes of 15 or less. The students are usually of varying ages, and the schedule and curriculum are built around their needs. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Decide between starting a religious or non-religious school.",
      "content": "Decide between starting a religious or non-religious school. Typically, you would only start a religious school if you have strongly-held religious beliefs yourself. Moreover, you should believe that religion is a fundamental part of education. Religious schools must be private, and they typically draw in families that follow that religion in their personal life. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that some religious schools only hire teachers and administrators that identify with that religion—this could limit your school’s performance or perception of inclusivity. In some states, it’s also required for religious schools to be sponsored by or affiliated with a religious institution, such as a church, synagogue, mosque, or temple. Non-religious schools are based on secular teachings that aren’t bound by any specific religious beliefs. Rather than having religion-based policies and curricula, non-religious schools usually develop a set of core values that are upheld by teachers and students."

For-profit schools are generally managed by one owner or proprietor, most commonly a corporation that owns several schools in several locations. For-profit schools can be more overwhelming to manage, but the owner truly does have the final say in every decision related to the school. [6] X Research source Non-profit schools, on the other hand, are run by an active board of trustees. This board is typically in charge of the hiring process and pass down management of the school for generations. It’s much easier to raise funding for nonprofits, as they’re permitted to accept tax-deductible contributions from community members and businesses. However, you first have to apply for tax-exempt status with the IRS in order to be recognized as a nonprofit organization. [7] X Research source"
