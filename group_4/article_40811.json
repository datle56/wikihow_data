      "content": "Understand the different aspects of a manual vehicle. Unlike automatics cars, manuals, or stick shifts, have three pedals. The brake and gas pedals are in the same locations as the locations you would find them in an automatic car. However, manual cars are equipped with a third pedal called the \"clutch.\" [1] X Expert Source Ibrahim Onerli Driving Instructor Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. This is the pedal furthest to the left. The gear shift of a manual car is also slightly more complicated than an automatic car. Manuals have several different gears ranging from 1 to 5, depending on the type of car (some have a sixth gear). Then, like all cars, they have the \"R\" for reverse. Putting the gear shift into the center position will put it into neutral."

      "content": "Make sure the car is in neutral. Before starting the vehicle, make sure the gear shift is in the neutral position. This is when the gear shift is in the center position - you should be able to easily shake the gear shift. This is because it is detached from the transmission and should freely move. Some drivers may leave their car in first gear when they put it into park just in case the brake gives out. If you were to start the car in first gear then it will cause the car to jump forward causing damage to the transmission of the vehicle, its exterior, and the vehicle's surroundings."

If the foot is removed from the clutch before the car is put into neutral, the car will jump. Now that the car is in neutral, the driver can release the clutch while keeping their foot on the brake pedal."
