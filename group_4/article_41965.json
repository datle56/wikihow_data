    {
      "title": "Use a 1:1 volume substitution of whole wheat flour for white flour.",
      "content": "Use a 1:1 volume substitution of whole wheat flour for white flour. For instance, replace 1 cup (135 g) of whole wheat flour with 1 cup (120 g) of white flour. Whole wheat flour is denser and heavier than regular white (all-purpose) flour, so substitute by volume rather than weight. [1] X Research source Inversely, you can also substitute whole wheat flour for white, all-purpose flour using a 1:1 volume ratio. Cookies, muffins, brownies, chocolate cakes, and quick breads still taste great when made with whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour."

    {
      "title": "Replace only 1/3 to 1/4 of the white flour at first.",
      "content": "Replace only 1/3 to 1/4 of the white flour at first. Because whole wheat flour is denser and has a different flavor than all-purpose flour, only substitute a portion of the flour in your recipe. As you become accustomed to the taste and texture and learn how to adjust your recipes to accommodate for the heavier flour, you can replace more of it. [2] X Research source In some recipes, you may not notice a change because you’re substituting such a small amount of the white flour—but you’ll still get whole wheat flour’s nutritional benefits."

      "title": "Add 2 teaspoons (9.9 ml) of liquid per 1 cup (135 g) of whole wheat flour.",
      "content": "Add 2 teaspoons (9.9 ml) of liquid per 1 cup (135 g) of whole wheat flour. Whole wheat flour absorbs liquid more slowly than all-purpose flour. [3] X Research source Therefore, you will need to add additional liquid, such as water, to the mixture to prevent the finished product from being too dry, says Britten. You can also use regular milk or buttermilk for additional liquid. As whole wheat flour absorbs liquid more slowly, whole wheat dough will be stickier than all-purpose flour dough."

      "title": "Use orange juice to combat the bitter flavor of whole wheat flour.",
      "content": "Use orange juice to combat the bitter flavor of whole wheat flour. Whole wheat flour has a much stronger flavor than regular flour, and it can sometimes impart a bitter flavor to baked goods. To combat this, try replacing 2–3 US tbsp (30–44 ml) of the liquid used in the recipe, such as water or milk, with orange juice. [4] X Research source The orange juice is sweet and full of natural sugars, so it will compensate for the bitter flavor of the whole wheat."

      "title": "Adjust the baking time as needed.",
      "content": "Adjust the baking time as needed. Professional baker Lisa Britten notes that whole wheat flour can take longer to cook when compared to white flour. Instead of relying only on the time in the recipe, use other tools, like the toothpick or touch tests, to tell when your baked goods are done. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Substitute all the white flour over time in most baked goods.",
      "content": "Substitute all the white flour over time in most baked goods. As you become accustomed to the whole wheat flavor, you can try substituting more and more of the white flour with the whole wheat. Work up to replacing all of the white flour for most baked goods like pancakes, cookies, muffins, dense quick breads (like banana or zucchini bread), and brownies. [6] X Research source Avoid a total substitution for yeast-based baked goods (like bread) and light, fluffy pastries like angel food cake. The whole wheat flour’s density could ruin such recipes by preventing rising and adding a gritty texture. An alternative to substituting is to look for recipes developed using whole wheat flour. These will likely be more successful than a total substitution in terms of achieving the right flavor and texture."

      "title": "Replace up to 1/2 of the white flour if you're baking bread.",
      "content": "Replace up to 1/2 of the white flour if you're baking bread. Bread needs to rise in order for it to come out well and taste good. To ensure that your bread rises and bakes as it should, don't replace more than 1/2 of the amount of white flour needed. [7] X Research source For example, if your recipe calls for 2 cups (240 grams) of white flour, use 1 cup (120 grams) of white flour and 1 cup (135 grams) of whole wheat flour. Let dough rest for 25 minutes before kneading it if you’re using whole wheat flour. This will help the whole wheat flour work its best. [8] X Research source Dough that contains whole wheat flour may also take longer to rise. Adjust baking times as needed."

      "content": "Sift the whole wheat flour to introduce more air into it. You can use a real sifter, or you can simply use a spoon to slowly sprinkle the whole wheat flour into the bowl of ingredients. This will add more air into the flour, making it a bit less dense so your bread can rise properly. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Use wheat gluten to help whole wheat bread rise.",
      "content": "Use wheat gluten to help whole wheat bread rise. Whole wheat flour doesn't allow bread to rise as normal flour does, which is why you need to add wheat gluten. For every 2-3 cups (270-405 g) of whole wheat flour, add 1 tablespoon (7.5 g) of vital wheat gluten. [10] X Research source Wheat gluten can be found in the natural food section of your grocery store."

      "title": "Try using white whole wheat flour for a lighter texture and flavor.",
      "content": "Try using white whole wheat flour for a lighter texture and flavor. For softer baked goods like cakes and muffins, regular whole wheat can produce a harder, chewier result, notes Britten. To overcome this, try using white whole wheat flour instead. [11] X Research source White whole wheat flour is made from a softer, lighter-colored type of wheat, whose taste isn't as strong as regular whole wheat. Use spelt flour (a kind of whole wheat flour) in most baked goods for a nutritional boost. It resembles all-purpose flour more than some other whole wheat flours. [12] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Whole wheat flour is made from the whole wheat grain.",
      "content": "Whole wheat flour is made from the whole wheat grain. Wheat grains are ground without being separated to maximize the flour’s nutritional benefits. Whole wheat flour contains bran, germ, and endosperm, making them more fibrous and nutritious—as well as denser and brownish in hue. [13] X Research source Whole wheat flour contains more fiber, iron, potassium, vitamins B and E, and protein than all-purpose flour. It also has a higher gluten content than white flour. [14] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "All-purpose flour only contains part of the wheat grain.",
      "content": "All-purpose flour only contains part of the wheat grain. The brown covering is removed from the grain, which is why all-purpose flour is also known as white flour. The endosperm of the wheat is ground into all-purpose flour. While softer in texture, it’s also lower in nutritional value. [15] X Research source Enriched all-purpose flour has added nutrients like iron, but is still not as nutritional as whole wheat flour."
