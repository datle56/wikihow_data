      "content": "Start with some basic stretching exercises . Doing basic stretches may not make you look like a contortionist, but they will help you to develop the flexibility you need to stretch like a contortionist. Try starting with some simple stretches, such as a: Forward bend. For this stretch, just stand with your feet shoulder width apart and fold your upper body down towards the ground and try to touch your toes. Hold the stretch for about for about 30 to 60 seconds. Quad stretch. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and then bend one knee. Grab your foot with your hand and pull your foot in closer to your butt. You should feel a gentle stretch. Hold for about 30 to 60 seconds and then switch to the other side. Chest opening stretch . Reach your arms out to your side so that they are even with your shoulders and then push out your chest. Hold this stretch for about 30 to 60 seconds. Reclined leg stretch. Lie on your back on a padded mat with your legs on the ground. Lift your left leg as high as it will go without changing the position of your right leg. Grip your thigh or calf with your hands. Straighten your left leg completely, and hold this position for about 30 to 60 seconds. Then repeat with the other leg."

      "title": "Breathe",
      "content": "Breathe into the stretch. While you hold a stretch, make sure that you continue to breathe. Taking slow deep breaths will help you to relax, which might help you to stretch your body further. As you exhale, you may feel tension release, allowing you to potentially sink deeper into the stretch. Try taking a slow deep breath in through your nose as you count to five. Then, slowly exhale as you breathe out and count down from five. Repeat this breathing exercise as you hold the stretch."

      "content": "Push yourself a little further every day. To increase your flexibility, you will need to make stretching a part of your daily routine. Try to set aside about 10 minutes to stretch different muscle groups every day and try to push yourself a little further every day to gain flexibility. Try to keep track of how far you can stretch your body in each position. For example, can you reach your knees? Your calves? Or your toes when you do a forward bend? How far can you stretch your arms behind your back? You might want to jot these details down in a journal or ask a friend to take a picture to help you monitor your progress."

[3] X Research source If you do not already have a strength training routine, then consider starting one to condition the muscles that you are stretching. Along with 150 minutes of moderate cardiovascular activity every week, the CDC recommends that adults perform muscle training exercises on two or more days per week. The exercises should target all of your major muscle groups.

You should end facing behind you, with your hands at your feet. [5] X Research source Kneel with your knees as wide apart as your hips, and your thighs and body perpendicular to the ground. Rotate your thighs inward, and tense your buttocks. Keep your hips as relaxed as possible, and press the tops of your feet and your shins into the ground (or mat). Put the palms of your hands on the tops of your buttocks, with your fingers pointed downward. Lean back while keeping your head up. Touch your hands to your feet, and try to lift your pelvis up toward your ribcage while you lengthen your spine as much as possible. To keep yourself from falling, push your hips forward. Rotate your arms so that the inside of your elbow faces forward, and place the palms of your hands on your feet. Be careful not to squeeze your shoulder blades tightly together. Allow your head to drop backward carefully. When you are done, put your hands back to your butt while pushing your hips forward. Slowly straighten out, first from the lower back and working your way to your upper back, neck, and finally head."

You will end up with your stomach on the floor, your head facing forward, and your hands gripping your ankles. Your body will form the shape of the “bow,” and your arms will form the shape of the “string.” [6] X Research source Lie on your stomach with your hands stretched along your sides, with the palms facing upward. Bend your knees as far as you can, to bring the heels of your feet close to your buttocks. Reach behind you and grip your ankles. Do not grip the tops of your feet. Your knees should be the same width as your hips. Lift your thighs away from the ground, as you push your heels away from your buttocks. This will raise your upper torso and head off the ground. Press your shoulder blades against your back to open your chest, while you press your tailbone toward the floor. Try to keep your back muscles as relaxed as possible.

Your feet should be pressed firmly to the floor. Put your hands on the floor near your ears, with your palms down and your fingers facing your feet. Point your elbows at the ceiling. Keep your hands and feet on the floor, while you stretch your back off the ground. Continue to stretch your back until your legs and arms are completely straight. (It may take time – months, possibly years – to achieve this degree of flexibility.) To successfully do a bridge bend, you need to have strong and fully developed shoulders. Young children (under 5) should not attempt this stretch."

To avoid injury, have a friend or coach help guide your body while you first attempt to master this position. Stand and raise your arms straight over your head, with your palms facing up and your fingers pointed behind you. Stretch your body backward in an arch, and look at the floor. Over time, try to bend a little bit further back until you can touch a wall or piece of furniture behind you. Make sure to have some cushioning under your head to protect you. Ask a friend to spot your back as you bend backwards to prevent injury. Face backward toward the floor, while holding this position."

      "content": "Work towards doing the splits. This classic posture is incorporated into many contortionist poses. Warm up your muscles for at least 15 minutes before beginning the splits, by stretching your legs out in front of you while sitting on the floor. Try to touch your toes. Kneel on the floor with your back straight, and stretch one leg in front of you. Choose whichever leg you like – you may find you are naturally more flexible on one side than the other. Position your back leg so that your shin is pressed against the floor and your knee is bent. Slowly lower your body toward the ground, gently stretching the muscles of your thighs as you go. If you feel pain, stop. Each time you attempt the splits, you should be able to go a little lower toward the ground. Keep your hands on the ground at your sides, to support your weight. When your legs form a perfect 180 degree angle and your pelvis is touching the ground, you have achieved the splits. Hold your position for 30 seconds, then release."

You can make modifications to just about any pose. For example, you can: Bend your knees slightly if the pose calls for straight legs. Focus on one part of your body at a time, such as just contorting your arms or just your legs, not both at the same time."

You'll be able to stretch more, while avoiding joint injuries. [7] X Research source [8] X Research source If you experience discomfort in your knees when stretching thigh muscles, place a small pillow below your buttocks, between your legs. To open back muscles more safely, place a cushion under the small of your back while you lean backward with your arms stretched outward and resting on the floor. Try using a balance ball to stretch your stomach muscles and practice back bends in a safer way."
