Starting from the right column (the ones place), we need to solve the problem \"0 - 1.\" In order to do this, we need to \"borrow\" from the digit to the left (the twos place). This has two steps to it: First, cross out the 1 and replace it with a 0, to get this: 1 0 1 0 - 101 = ?

If you can't figure out how to reach this answer, here's how to convert the problem back to decimal : 10 2 = (1 x 2) + (0 x 1) = 2 10 . (The sub numbers indicate which base the number is written in.) 1 2 = (1x1) = 1 10 . Therefore, in decimal form this problem is 2 - 1 = ?, so the answer is 1."

For example, here's how to solve 11000 - 111 . We can't \"borrow\" from a 0, so we need to keep borrowing from the left until we turn it into something we can borrow from: [5] X Research source 1 0 1 10 0 00 - 111 = 1 0 1 1 10 0 10 0 0 - 111 = (remember, 10 - 1 = 1) 1 0 1 1 10 0 1 10 0 10 0 - 111 = Here it is written more tidily: 1011 10 0 - 111 = Solve column by column: _ _ _ _ 1 = _ _ _ 0 1 = _ _ 0 0 1 = _ 0 0 0 1 = 1 0 0 0 1"

The other two methods are still useful, since you may need to check by hand on a test, and they will make you more familiar and comfortable with binary numbers: Add in binary to check your work. Add the answer together with the smaller number, and you should get the larger number. Using our last example (11000 - 111 = 10001), we get 10001 + 111 = 11000, which is the larger number we started with. Alternatively, convert each number from binary to decimal and see whether it is true. Using the same example (11000 - 111 = 10001), we can convert each number into decimal and get 24 - 7 = 17. This is a true statement, so our solution is correct."

Simply cross out the first digit, and you'll have the answer to the original subtraction problem: [11] X Research source 1 010 = 10 Therefore, 101 - 011 = 10 If you don't have an extra digit, you tried to subtract a larger number from a smaller one.

This method is called the \"two's complement\" method, since the \"reverse the digits\" steps results in the \"one's complement,\" and then the number 1 is added. If you'd like a more intuitive understanding of why this method works, try it in base ten: [12] X Research source 56 - 17 Since we're using base ten, we'll take the \"nine's complement\" of the second term (17) by subtracting each digit from nine. 99 - 17 = 82 . Change this into an addition problem: 56 + 82 . If you compare this to the original problem (56 - 17), you can see that we've added 99. 56+82= 138. But since our changes added 99 to the original problem, we'll need to subtract 99 from the answer. Again, we'll use a shortcut, just like in the binary method above: add 1 to the total number, then delete the digit on the left (which represents 100): 138 + 1 = 139 → 1 39 → 39 This is finally the solution to our original problem, 56-17."
