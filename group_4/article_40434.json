[1] X Trustworthy Source Social Security Administration Independent U.S. government agency responsible for the administration and management of Social Security Go to source If you are an employer seeking to verify the work eligibility of a potential employee, this information is the first thing you should check. The first shows a person's name and social security number, and authorizes that person to work without restriction. The second, in addition to the name and number, notes that the person is \"valid for work only with DHS authorization,\" meaning the person is allowed to work on a temporary basis so long as they have authorization from the Department of Homeland Security. Finally, a card that bears a name and number and states \"not valid for employment\" represents an individual who has been issued a social security card for a non-work purpose and is not eligible for employment in the United States."

      "content": "Check the name on the card. It should match the name on the person's other forms of identification, such as a driver's license or passport. Most of the time, when you will be checking the veracity of a person's social security card, you will also have access to other forms of identification for this individual. Make sure the name is spelled the same across all of these documents. The social security card also has a line for the person's signature. Make sure this signature matches other instances of the person's signature, both in spelling and handwriting format."

      "content": "Check the basic features of the card. The card should be printed on banknote paper, [2] X Research source similar to the paper used for currency, and has a distinctly different feel and weight from regular paper. The card should bear the words \"Social Security\" on the front, along with the SSA's official seal. It should also have the words \"This number has been established for\" printed across the seal, and the person's name and social security number should be printed on the front. There should be a place for the person's signature, and blank space enough so the person can sign his or her name. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Social Security Administration Independent U.S. government agency that administers Social Security and related information Go to source The back should not be blank, as the back of a valid social security card contains official information such as where to mail found cards and certain identifying numbers for the card itself. [4] X Trustworthy Source US Social Security Administration Independent U.S. government agency that administers Social Security and related information Go to source You should also pay attention to the actual card itself. It should not look like it was cut with scissors or other home implement. [5] X Research source The sides should be clean, and at least one of them should show evidence the card was perforated at one point (able to be easily torn off a larger piece of paper). The card should be not laminated, as this is prohibited by the SSA due to the fact this process may compromise some of the security features on the card. Looking at the card with a magnified lens should reveal no smudging or running of the ink used on the card."

[6] X Trustworthy Source US Social Security Administration Independent U.S. government agency that administers Social Security and related information Go to source You can ask the person whose card it is when it was issued (for U.S. citizens, usually at birth, unless the card was re-issued because it was lost or stolen), and then check this list [7] X Trustworthy Source US Social Security Administration Independent U.S. government agency that administers Social Security and related information Go to source provided by the SSA detailing how the card has changed throughout its history to determine which features should be on a particular individual's card."

[8] X Trustworthy Source US Social Security Administration Independent U.S. government agency that administers Social Security and related information Go to source The background of the card should be an erasable random blue-tinted pattern, meaning any attempt to erase information on the card would erase this pattern as well. Planchettes—small, multi-colored disks—are randomly placed in the paper used to make the card, and should be visible to the naked eye. They are yellow, pink, or blue. Some areas on the front of the card should be raised such that you can feel them when you touch the card. This type of printing is known as \"intaglio\" printing, and is also used on U.S. currency due to the fact it is difficult to replicate."

In an effort to comply with the Social Security Act, the SSA is required to ensure, as best it can, that a social security card cannot be counterfeited.

You will want to compile a list of the suspect's name, address, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and the social security number they are using. The more information you can provide, the better.
