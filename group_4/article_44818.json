The wound is a quarter of an inch (0.65 centimeters) or more deep. Even if you can stop the bleeding, larger wounds should be treated by a professional. An object is embedded deeply into the skin. If you can’t see anything, but suspect an object remains in the wound, seek medical attention. The patient stepped on a nail, or the wound was caused by a rusty fishhook or other rusty object. A person or animal has bitten the patient. Bites are prone to infection. The affected area is numb or the patient cannot move the body part normally. The wound shows signs of infection, including redness and swelling around the affected area, increasing pain or a throbbing sensation, pus or other discharge, or the patient experiences chills or a fever (see Part 4).

However, puncture wounds to the feet or other places that get dirty may require a bandage to prevent debris from entering the wound.
