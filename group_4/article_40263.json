Just like English, Canarese moves from left to right horizontally. When consonants appear together without a vowel in between, the second consonant is written as a special conjunt symbol, usually below the first. [9] X Research source When Kannada is written using English language characters, you will sometimes find that vowels in the middle of words are capitalized to represent the long vowel sound. However, this convention is not uniformly practiced."

In contrast, in aDike a is short as in \"aristocrat\". mEle (here E is as in Baby). prIti (here I is as in Meeting) hOda (here O is as in roam) pUjari (here U is as in fool) The consonants which are capitalized are: aDike (the D is as in \"Dog\"); lower case d is soft). koTru (here T is as in \"Tom\"); lower case is soft. chELige (here L is a sound with no equivalence in English; lower case is as in \"lamb\") kaNNu (here N is nasal; lower case is as in \"no\")"

      "content": "Understand Kannada verbs. Kannada, unlike western languages, does not have infinitive forms for its verbs. Rather, they take the form of \"singular, nonpolite imperatives.\" [11] X Research source In most cases, unconjugated verbs take the form of verb stems. [12] X Research source Because of this, when looking at a Kannada language dictionary, you will find verbs by their verb stem rather than in a constructed, infinitive form. For example, see the conjugation of \"to walk\" in Kanadda below. to walk - naḍeyalu I walk - nānu naḍeyuttēne you walk - nīvu naḍeyalu he walks - avaru paricayisuttade she walks - avaḷu naḍedu it walks - idu paricayisuttade they walk - avaru naḍedu we walk - nāvu naḍeyalu Notice that all of the conjugated forms maintain the root \"ade\" somewhere in the word."
