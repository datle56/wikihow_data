For example, you might try the following warmup routine: [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source March in place for 3 minutes. Lift your legs high and pump your arms while you march. First go forwards, then switch up and go backwards. Stand with your fists out in front of you. Alternate placing each of your heels on the floor in front of you for 60 seconds. Aim for 60 heel digs in 60 seconds. Stand up straight and alternate bringing up each knee to touch the opposite hand. Keep doing this for 30 seconds and try to do 30 knee lifts total. Do 2 sets of 10 repetitions of shoulder rolls. With your arms hanging loose at your sides, roll your shoulders forward 5 times and backward 5 times, then repeat the process. You can also do this while marching in place! Stand with your knees shoulder-width apart and your arms stretched straight out in front of you. Keep your back straight and bend your knees gradually to lower yourself by about 4 inches (10 cm), then gradually come back up again. Repeat this 10 times."

Tighten your core and keep your back straight as you push up from the floor with your arms until your elbows are straight, then slowly lower yourself back to the floor. Ideally, you should not let your belly touch the floor before pushing back up again. Try doing 3 sets of 10 reps to start. As you get more comfortable with pushups, you’ll be able to do more in a set. If you’re not comfortable with a full pushup yet, allow your knees and shins to rest on the floor and just push up your upper body.

You may need to drink more if it’s hot or you’re sweating heavily. [26] X Research source A great time to drink some water is during a break in between exercise sets. For example, if you do 2 sets of 20 squats, take a drink of water after the first 20 and after the last 20. If it’s really hot, humid, or you’re doing intense or long-lasting exercise (e.g., more than an hour), drink a sports drink to help replace lost electrolytes.
