      "content": "Feed the cat outside if it won’t come inside. Stray cats are often shy and won’t come inside near people. Place a bowl of cat food outside at the same time each day. This helps to get the stray cat used to the routine. [1] X Research source If the cat won’t eat the food, try placing the bowl further away from the house. Try feeding the cat different types of food, such as cat biscuits or packets of cat food. These can be purchased from a pet store. If the cat has been on the streets for a long time, it may not be used to typical foods and will take a while to get used to its new diet."

      "title": "Bring the food inside once the cat is comfortable eating near the house.",
      "content": "Bring the food inside once the cat is comfortable eating near the house. Place the bowl of food inside the front door and ensure that nobody is around to scare the cat.

This will help to increase the chances of the cat coming inside."

      "title": "Shut the door behind the cat while it is eating.",
      "content": "Shut the door behind the cat while it is eating. Close all the windows and doors in the house to stop the cat from escaping. It is likely that the cat will hide for a little while once it realises that the front door is closed. This is normal behaviour for a stray cat and overtime, it will slowly become more confident. If the cat makes loud noises, starts clawing at furniture, or is terrified of people, this may indicate that it is feral. In this scenario, it is best to open the door and let the cat outside."

      "content": "Isolate the stray cat from other pets until it is tested and vaccinated by a vet.

      "title": "Take the cat to a vet to check if it has a microchip.",
      "content": "Take the cat to a vet to check if it has a microchip. If the cat has a microchip, this means that it has had an owner at some point. Ask the vet to give you a copy of the contact details of the most recent owner of the cat or see if the vet can contact them for you. Contact the owner to ensure that they don’t want the cat and that they are happy for you to adopt it. A vet will typically charge around $50 for an appointment, but most will scan stray cats for free. Contact your local vet to receive a quote. If the cat won’t go into its carrier, place a bowl of food into the cage to tempt the cat inside."
