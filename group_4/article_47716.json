A balance beam scale can be read by adding the top number (from the top bar with the small sliding weight, indicated by an opening or an arrow, such as 7 or 32) with the bottom number (from the bottom bar with the large sliding weight, indicated by an opening or an arrow, such as 50 or 100) when the scale is balanced.
