      "content": "Start with a T-shirt style bodysuit if you’re warming up to the trend. Go with something easy, comfortable, and familiar to see if bodysuits are your thing. T-shirt style bodysuits are perfect for layering with casual outfits because they look polished and seamless, and they won’t come untucked. Opt for a capped sleeve for a more feminine look. For example, you could style a simple outfit with a white short-sleeved bodysuit and a pair of belted boyfriend jeans, complete with a pair of suede ankle boots."

      "content": "Go for a backless or sheer-backed bodysuit for a sexier option. Bodysuits with mesh or lace panels give your outfit a daring, night-out feel.

      "title": "Look for a bodysuit made of very stretchy material if you’re tall.",
      "content": "Look for a bodysuit made of very stretchy material if you’re tall. Finding a bodysuit that fits comfortably can sometimes be difficult for taller people, just like trying to find a 1-piece swimsuit. Since there are no straps to adjust on a bodysuit, you don’t have as many options for fit. [3] X Research source Look for materials with high percentages of rayon, nylon, or spandex for the most stretch. [4] X Research source For example, look for a bodysuit made of rayon. This fabric is extra stretchy and works as a cheaper imitation for silk, linen, or cotton. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear a blazer over your bodysuit to make it more work-appropriate. Since bodysuits already look crisp and seamless, all you need to do is add a blazer for work. You could go for a simple, classic option, such as classic black or a masculine grey tweed. You could also mix things up and add a pop of color with a red or forest green blazer. For example, you could pair a black and white striped bodysuit with a classic black blazer and some burgundy tailored trousers. Finish the look with a pair of black heels. For a funkier, colorful outfit, you could pair a white turtleneck bodysuit with a red blazer, some fitted dark-wash jeans, and a pair of black riding boots."

For an easy outfit, pair a gray long-sleeved, lace-up bodysuit with some distressed medium-wash, high-waisted skinny jeans.

Go for simple leather belts that give a clean, professional touch to your outfit in neutral colors like brown or black. Metal buckles can also add a touch of interest. For example, you could use a black belt to transition between 2 form-fitting pieces, such as a white long sleeved bodysuit and a pair of fitted black pants.

For a pop of color, tie on a neck scarf with a floral pattern in red, yellow, and navy."
