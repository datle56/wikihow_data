Prescription pantoprazole usually comes in 40mg tablets and your doctor will tell you to take 1 or 2 tablets a day depending on what health condition you're treating.

      "content": "Plan to take pantoprazole 30 to 60 minutes before your first meal of the morning. The medication will work more successfully on an empty stomach, so try to take your tablet 1 hour before breakfast. This will give the medicine time to shut down the acid pumps that cause heartburn before you start eating. Studies show that taking pantoprazole in the morning is more effective than taking it in the evening. [2] X Research source If you're supposed to take pantoprazole twice a day, take a dose in the morning before breakfast and another 1 hour before dinner. Try to time the dosages so they're 12 hours apart."

      "title": "Swallow the tablet whole using water.",
      "content": "Swallow the tablet whole using water. Instead of crushing, chewing, or breaking the tablet, swallow it whole with water. This will help the medication break down in your stomach properly. Crushing the medication can make the pantoprazole release too quickly in your stomach. [3] X Research source If you struggle to swallow the coated tablets, ask your doctor about taking liquid pantoprazole."

      "content": "Get your prescription of oral suspension granules fulfilled. If you can't swallow pantoprazole tablets, your doctor can prescribe liquid pantoprazole. When you get the medication from the pharmacy, the pantoprazole will be granular and in several pouches. Each pouch will be 40mg once you properly rehydrate the granules. [4] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Keep in mind that you should never divide the amount in the pouch. If the doctor prescribes the liquid pantoprazole, it's because you'll need to get at least a full 40mg a day. The granule form is also good for people with Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes who canâ€™t take anything by mouth."
