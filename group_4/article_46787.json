      "content": "Slide one slice of bread into each toaster slot. You can also toast just one slice of bread. In this case, choose a slot, and slide it in. The direction you orient the slice in the toaster doesn't matter, but most people like to insert it bottom-first. [1] X Research source You can toast many things other than bread but stick to toasting bread slices until you are more comfortable using the appliance."

      "title": "Set the toasting level.",
      "content": "Set the toasting level. Use the adjustment knob on the front of the appliance to choose how dark you want the toast to be. On most toasters, the dial runs from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lightest, and 5 being the darkest. [2] X Research source Consider setting the dial somewhere in the middle: 2 or 3. This way, if the toast is not dark enough, you can always toast it again. Some toasters have other settings, such as light, medium, or dark. Other toasts have options for waffles, toast, and bagels. In this case, choose the setting that best matches whatever it is that you're toasting."

      "title": "Lower the lever to start the toasting cycle.",
      "content": "Lower the lever to start the toasting cycle. Wait for the food to toast. Keep your nose peeled to smell for burning! The toasting process should not take longer than a minute or two, depending on how dark you want the toast. [3] X Research source Even though the toaster is timed and will pop the bread out on its own, you should never leave it unattended. If the bread starts to burn, you'll have to pop it manually. To pop the toaster manually, hold the top corner of the toaster down while you lift the lever up. You should only do this if things start to burn, however."

    {
      "title": "Remove the food.",
      "content": "Remove the food. When the lever pops back up, it means that the toasting cycle is done. The toaster may \"ding.\" Take the toast out using your fingers or a set of wooden tongs. Then, put your favorite spread onto your toast before consuming! Never use anything metal to take the toast out, or you may electrocute yourself."

    {
      "title": "Err on the side of caution.",
      "content": "Err on the side of caution. If you aren't familiar with the toaster, set the dial to a lower number rather than a higher number. You can always put the slice back in for a bit more heat—but you cannot un-burn a piece of toast! [4] X Research source For example, if you start with a medium setting, and the toast comes out too light, you can toast it again using a low setting."

    {
      "title": "Adjust the toast level to the toast eater.",
      "content": "Adjust the toast level to the toast eater. If you are making toast for someone else, ask them whether they prefer their toast darker or lighter. If they prefer their toast lighter, then set the dial to the low end: 1 or 2. If they prefer their toast dark, then set it to the high end: 3 to 5. If you can't ask the person what they like, choose a medium setting. This way, the toast will be neither too light or too dark."

    {
      "title": "Be careful not to burn the toast!",
      "content": "Be careful not to burn the toast! If you set the dial to the highest setting, then you are playing with fire. Thick slices may press directly up against the electric heat filaments, which can apply dangerous heat to the food item. If you accidentally burn your toast, hold it over a sink, then use a knife to scrape the burnt parts off. Be aware that there will be lots of crumbs! Watch your toast carefully as it heats. If you see it starting to burn, don't wait for it to pop. Push the level up manually!"

      "content": "Make sure that the toaster is plugged in. Most toasters require access to an electric wall outlet. If the toaster is plugged in but isn't working, check the cable for damage first, then plug the toaster into a different outlet. If plugging the toasted into a different outlet doesn't help, then the toaster might be broken. Don't use the toaster if the cable appears damaged in some way. Check for damage, such as rips, tears, or scorch marks."

      "title": "Practice toaster safety.",
      "content": "Practice toaster safety. Do not, under any circumstances, put a metal implement into the toaster while it is plugged in. Likewise, do not reach your hand into the toasting slots while the appliance is hot. The toaster works by firing metal filaments up to high heat using dangerous electrical currents. If you use your hand, you may burn yourself. If you put a fork into the slots, then you run the risk of electrocuting yourself. [5] X Research source If the toast gets stuck in the slots: try depressing the lever for a moment, then popping it up manually—quickly, with force—to fling the toast out the top of the toaster. Unplug the toaster before you try to remove food that is stuck. Then, use wooden tongs to remove the item. Wooden tongs will not conduct electricity!"

      "title": "Clean a toaster",
      "content": "Clean a toaster when it's not plugged in. Most toasters feature a flat, removable tray that slides in and out of the bottom of the appliance. This tray catches crumbs and burnt bits. Remove the tray and dump out the contents to clear space for more crumbs. If your toaster doesn't have a tray, unplug it first, then carry it over to a sink or trashcan. Turn it upside down and shake the crumbs out. You need to remove these crumbs; otherwise, they become a fire hazard."
