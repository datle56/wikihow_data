Just like the decimal number system uses ten different symbols to denote values from Zero to Nine , the hexadecimal number system uses sixteen different symbols to denote values from Zero to Fifteen . Any number can be written in either system. [1] X Research source Here's how to start counting in hexadecimal: zero through fifteen: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F sixteen through thirty-two: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F, 20"

[2] X Research source Similarly, the sixteen symbols used in the hexadecimal number system form the base of the hexadecimal number system. Whenever it's unclear which base is being used, subscript numbers are added to show the base. For example, 100 10 is \"100 in base 10\" and 100 16 is \"100 in base 16\" (which equals 256 10 ). Another term for \"base\" is \"radix\" (pluralized \"radixes\" or \"radices\")."

[3] X Research source We know automatically that \"5834 10 \" means 5x10 3 + 8x10 2 + 3x10 1 + 4x10 0 . Each digit in a multi-digit number has its own place value. Here are the place values in decimal, from right to left: 10 0 10 = 1 10 1 10 = 10 10 10 2 = 10x10 = 100 10 3 = 10x10x10 = 1000 10 4 = 10x10x10x10 = 10000 10 5 = 10x10x10x10x10 = 100000 & so on."

Here's how to convert from any number in hexadecimal to the same number written in decimal: [5] X Research source Write out your hexadecimal number: 15B30 16 Write each digit out as a decimal multiplication problem, using the place value in the chart above: 15B30 = (1 x 65536 10 ) + (5 x 4096 10 ) + (B x 256 10 ) + (3 x 16 10 ) + (0 x 1) Convert non-decimal symbols into decimal numbers. In our example, B = 11 10 , so that digit can be converted to 11 10 x 256 10 Solve the problem. Use a calculator or work it out by hand, and you'll get the answer in decimal. 15B30 = 65536 + 20480 + 2816 + 48 + 0 = 88880 10"

      "content": "Understand how colors on a computer screen are determined. All colors on a computer screen are determined by three values: red, green, and blue. All colors of light can be created by combining these three types of light in different proportions. On a computer screen, red, green, and blue can each be assigned any value from 0 to 255 (for a total of 256 possible values). [6] X Research source This doesn't match the \"primary\" colors you learned in school, because that color system is based on physical pigment (like paint), not light. The paint system is sometimes called \"subtractive color system\" and the light system (the RGB system described here) \"additive.\""

      "content": "Learn why hexadecimal is used for colors. HTML uses hexadecimal to describe colors. This is convenient, since a two-digit hexadecimal number can communicate exactly 256 10 possible values. This isn't a coincidence; the number 256 10 is due to limitations of old hardware, which could only handle 100000000 2 colors, or 256 10 . Because 2 4 = 16 10 , any binary system can be easily converted to a hexadecimal system with ¼ as many digits. [7] X Research source The subscript numbers tell you which base the numbers is written in. Base 2 is binary, base 10 is ordinary decimal, and base 16 is hexadecimal."

The first two digits are the red value, the next two are the green value, and the last two are the blue value. [8] X Research source Here are some examples: #FFFFFF is white, while #000000 is black. Any color with equal r, g, and b values (besides black and white) is a shade of grey, such as #121212, #5A5A5A, or #C0C0C0 #003000 is a very dark green. #003F00 is barely any lighter (you've only added F, or 16 10 green), but #00FF00 is the brightest possible green (adding an additional C0, or 192 10 ). More complex colors are created by using all three types of light. Try to guess #7FFFD4, #8A2BE2, or #A0522D."

This will give you a more intuitive understanding of hexadecimal, and let you read hexadecimal numbers without laboriously converting to decimal every time. As you'll see, one advantage to hexadecimal is that the number of digits doesn't increase nearly as fast as it does in decimal: Humans have A fingers, or 14 16 if you count the toes too. (Remember, the subscript 16 means a number is written in base sixteen.) In a residential area, drive below 19 16 miles per hour (or 28 16 kilometers per hour). A typical highway driving speed is 3C mph (or 64 16 kph). Water boils at D4 ºFahrenheit (64 16 º Celsius). The median U.S. income is roughly C350 dollars a year.

It does take some mental effort and practice to remember the new rules. Here are a few methods and tips: [9] X Research source Count up one by one, using hexadecimal digits. For instance to solve 7+5 in hex, count 7, 8, 9, A, B, C . Carry the one when needed. If your addition gets you past F, you \"carry the one\" as you would in a normal addition problem. For example, A+5 = F, A+6 = 10 16 , A+7 = 11 16 , and so on. Similarly, 3A+6 = 40 16 , 3A+7 = 41 16 , etc."
