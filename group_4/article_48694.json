      "content": "Male birds vocalize at night to attract a partner. Male birds tend to use their loudest and most complex songs to get the attention of willing females, so this kind of chirping can get pretty loud! Spring is breeding season for most birds, which is why night chirping is so common during this time. [1] X Research source Both nocturnal birds (birds that are most active at night) and diurnal birds (birds that are most active during the day) call for mates at night since it's quiet and there’s less competition. Diurnal male birds living in noisy daytime areas, like robins, wrens, and sparrows, will often save their mating songs for the evening hours. The barred owl is one of the best known nocturnal singers in the U.S. During mating season, they use a variety of rowdy gurgles, chirps, cackles, and hoots to compete for mates during the night.

      "content": "Birds vocalize loudly and aggressively when they spot a predator. These chirps are warning calls to other birds in the area so they know there’s danger lurking nearby. Other birds in the area sometimes even pick up the warning call and chime in with their own, creating a ripple effect that increases the volume. [3] X Research source Robins are diurnal birds, but they're known to keep chirping into the warm spring evenings. They're distantly related to nightingales (which are nocturnal birds), and will sometimes sing along with their cousins (and join in their warning choruses) late at night. If the chirping is keeping you up at night, consider investing in an ultrasonic bird repeller . This gadget emits a high-frequency noise that birds hate, but that's inaudible to the human ear."

      "content": "Sudden noises can make sleeping birds burst into song. Diurnal birds roost (sleep) in trees during the night, but loud, booming noises, like thunder and fireworks, will definitely wake them up. This is especially true if the sound vibrations shake the tree branches. For many birds, the automatic response to being startled awake is loud chirping. If birds tend to congregate in the tree right outside your bedroom window, try hosing the tree down with liquid bird repellent to keep them away."

      "content": "Roosting males will chirp loudly so other males won’t crowd them. Most types of birds are quite territorial, especially during breeding season. Males often chirp at night to warn other males to keep their distance since this where they do their breeding and nesting. [4] X Research source Diurnal birds spend most of the day protecting their territory, and that can spill over into nighttime, as well. Warblers, loons, meadowlarks, and willets are known to get very vocal when staking their claim to a particular area. If you live in the northern U.S., you've probably heard the common loon's haunting and wolf-like wail late at night. Male screech owls use a loud, whinnying call to scare off nighttime intruders that enter their territory. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Elevated light levels can make diurnal birds think its daytime.",
      "content": "Elevated light levels can make diurnal birds think its daytime. Diurnal birds instinctively start their morning chorus when they see light. Since urban areas are brightly lit at all times, the birds can get a bit disoriented about what time it is. Light pollution makes them believe its dawn, so they start chirping away. Song thrushes, dunnocks, and robins are diurnal birds known to extend their chirping into the evening hours. Robins are especially vulnerable to dim and even artificial light; once the sun goes down, they'll keep on foraging and chirping as long as there's some kind of light available."

      "title": "Birds that migrate at night often chirp to maintain communication.",
      "content": "Birds that migrate at night often chirp to maintain communication. Many types of diurnal birds migrate in flocks during the night. If a bird gets separated from the group, it might chirp as a distress signal so the others will hear. When it’s time for the flock to take a break or forage for food, they’ll chirp to stay in touch with each other and keep the group together. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Audubon Society Nonprofit environmental organization focused on conservation, citizen science, and public science education Go to source If a member of the flock finds a good food source, it might chirp loudly so the others know. [7] X Research source If you want the night chirping to stop, remove any bird feeders and water sources in your yard. Birds are more likely to roost and nest in areas close to food/water sources."

      "content": "Birds often hone their chirping chops during the evening hours. The guy with the prettiest song gets the girl, so to speak, so it's especially common for males to practice singing at night. Birds also practice to make sure their calls are clear and distinct so they can communicate with their flock, and many young birds get their song lessons from the adults at night. [8] X Research source Northern mockingbirds have a wide range of chirps and sounds in their repertoire—in fact, they're capable of remembering at least 200 songs. They're able to mimic the songs of other birds easily and are famous for rocking out late at night, especially during full moons. [9] X Research source"

Adult birds often leave the nest at night, and hatchlings may chirp for the same reasons a human baby cries—to let their parents know they're hungry, uncomfortable, or afraid. [10] X Research source"
