      "content": "Decide to be a commercial or consumer-driven business. When you start your cleaning business, you can choose between offering services primarily for commercial spaces or residential spaces. The clients you choose to cater to will determine what type of equipment you'll need, how much you'll charge, and the nature of the cleaning services. Commercial spaces, such as office buildings, usually require nightly or weekend-only janitorial-style cleaning. Washing the floors, cleaning the bathrooms, emptying trash cans, cleaning kitchen areas, and washing doors and windows is often included in this type of service. This type of work is steady and pays well. Homeowners hire maid services to do general cleaning and often tasks specific to the clients' needs. The maids usually work while the client is at home. Gearing your business toward residential cleaning services will mean having a diversity of clients, since most homes only need to be cleaned once a week or so."
