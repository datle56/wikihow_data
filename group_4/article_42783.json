      "content": "Taqwa means being conscious of Allah in your actions out of fear and respect. In the Islamic religion, taqwa means “piety” or “fear of God” and refers to considering Allah (the Islamic God) in everything you do out of respect, devotion, and fear of Him. Also known as “god-consciousness,” taqwa involves being careful of the things that you do because Allah is watching. Taqwa's purpose is to protect yourself from Allah’s punishment by avoiding sin and obeying His commands. [1] X Research source For example, if you’re trying to build taqwa , you’d avoid anything that is haram , as Allah forbids it. Taqwa is one of Islam’s core principles and guides many Muslims in their daily lives. It serves as a moral compass. People who devoutly practice taqwa in their daily lives are called muttaqin . While many Muslims follow taqwa’s principles, muttaqin follow them to a T."

      "content": "Taqwa appears in the Quran over 250 times. Pious devotion towards Allah is regularly encouraged throughout the Quran , with plenty of verses being dedicated to taqwa, from the practice of building it to its benefits. In verse 64:16, you’re encouraged to “Fear Allah as much as you can,” because when you do your best to guard against evil, taqwa will stand fulfilled. Other mentions of taqwa in the Quran include: [2] X Research source “Surely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous among you. Allah is truly all-knowing, all-aware.” - Surah Al-Hujurat 49:13 “O believers! If you are mindful of Allah, He will grant you a decisive authority, absolve you of your sins, and forgive you. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.” - Surah Al-Anfal 8:29 “Surely Allah loves those who are mindful of Him.” - Surah Ali ‘Imran 76 “Avoid committing sin, whether openly or in secret, for those who commit sin will be repaid for what they do.” - Surah Al-An’am 6:120 “You who believe, be steadfast, more steadfast than others; be ready; always mindful of God, so that you may prosper.” - Surah Al-Imran 3:200 “This is enjoined on whoever has faith in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make a way out for them.” - Surah At-Talaq 65:2 “This is the Book in which there is no doubt, guidance for the muttaqin.” - Surah Al-Baqarah 2:2 “So whoever gives charity and practices taqwa and verifies and believes in the good. We make easy for him the easy path.” - Surah Lail 92:5-7 “And whoever is miserly is miserly and careless or istighnaah and disbelieves in good things and disbelieves, I make him an easy way to the things of hardship.” - Surah Lail 92:5-7"

A person who has reached the first stage of taqwa regularly excels in good deeds, avoids anything that is prohibited by Allah, and fulfills any obligations or responsibilities they may have.

A person who is in the second stage of taqwa is still relatively righteous, as they fulfill their obligations and avoid things that are prohibited by Allah. But, their main focus is on ensuring that their responsibilities are met and that prohibitions are avoided. They tend not to focus on completing good deeds or voluntary acts of kindness.

Someone who is in the third stage of taqwa generally has fear and respect for Allah, but not enough to prevent them from avoiding bad deeds and things that Allah prohibits. They avoid shirk (deifying anything that isn’t Allah), but still partake in things that may be considered haram . In Qur’an, Surah Al-Fatir, 32 , those in the third stage of taqwa are referred to in the verse “among them there are oppressors to themselves.” [5] X Research source"

Whether it’s helping an old person cross the street, helping your family around the house, or even buying someone a meal when they’re down on their luck, good deeds are a great way to build taqwa . Consistently performing good deeds and being mindful of how Allah would guide you to perform them can increase your taqwa , so give back to the world in any way you can. [6] X Research source Example: Consider the Day of Judgement and how your actions will impact your experience in the afterlife. Perform these deeds out of the goodness of your heart, rather than with the expectation of being rewarded."

      "content": "Practice fasting. Fasting can help increase your fear of Allah by holding your mortal desires in his hands. By fasting and forbidding yourself from food and water, whether it be during Ramadan or in search of a more personal relationship with Allah, you will increase your taqwa and receive guidance from Allah. [7] X Research source Example: Participating in Ramadan is an example of taqwa , as you’re fasting for Allah. In Al-Baqarah 2:183 , it’s said that “O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous.”"

Being kind to those around you and following Allah’s teachings as outlined in the Quran and other religious texts is a surefire way to build taqwa . Avoid anything that’s considered haram , reflect on your place in the world and hereafter, and strive to adhere to Allah by doing things like salat (praying five times a day) and zakat (donating your wealth when able). [8] X Research source Example: Consider the potential consequences of your actions before taking them and ask yourself if they align with Allah. Imam Mekaeel Mohsin says the best way to be a good Muslim is to get closer to Allah and connect with him. Do this by practicing your 5 daily prayers and worshiping Allah."
