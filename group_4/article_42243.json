Obituary : Encourage your loved ones to write an obituary for their departed pet. They can post the story of their pet’s life on social media with photographs that illustrate ther bond. Focus on what your pet taught you during your life together. Licensed psychologist Adam Dorsay notes that \"animals teach us about death, about how to grieve, how to mourn, and how to appreciate the preciousness of life.\" Writing a kind of obituary also worked for the poet Lord Byron, who wrote a touching tribute to his dog Boatswain that’s etched into his pet’s grave. [4] X Research source Day of Honor : Those you know who have lost a pet can create a special day dedicated to their pet. It may be the pet’s birthday, the day they passed away, or the day they were adopted. Grieving friends and loved ones can take time on this day of honor to remember their furry friend, look at photos, and do something special like donate food to an animal shelter on their behalf. [5] X Research source New Pet : Though the grieving process is hard when losing a pet, your friend can continue to say yes to loving and taking care of animals. When they’re ready, help them think about adopting a new pet. A new pet doesn’t replace the one they lost, but it’s a great opportunity to continue sharing love with deserving animals who need it."
