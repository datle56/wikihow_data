Do not cut the ribbon yet. [1] X Research source It’s better to leave more ribbon hanging off the side than too little. You can always cut it shorter later."

[16] X Research source Make sure that you are only taping the top ribbon to the bottom ribbon; don't tape the ribbons to the box itself.

If you feel that your gift is lacking something, you can buy or make a matching bow, then secure it to the box. Instead of covering up all your hard work, set the bow off to the side so that the weaving is still visible. Don't be afraid to get creative! Try adding a nice tag, a pom pom or tassel, or even a pretty piece of foliage under the ribbon. [20] X Expert Source Amy Guerrero Arts & Crafts Specialist Expert Interview. 9 October 2020."
