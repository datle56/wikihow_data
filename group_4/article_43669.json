Before you start cooking, give the fish a quick sniff to tell if it’s gone bad —fresh fish has a mild scent, but it smells more sour and spoiled when it goes bad.

      "content": "Refreeze the fish within 1-2 days if you don’t plan on using it right away. Dip fatty pieces of fish (like mullet, mackerel, salmon, tuna, and trout) in a mixture of 2 tsp (6 g) of ascorbic acid and 1 US qt (0.95 L) of cold water for around 20 seconds. If you have lean fish (like cod, bass, catfish, flounder, and snapper), dip the meat in a saltwater mixture made with ¼ cup (64 g) of salt and 1 US qt (0.95 L) of cold water for 20 seconds. Then, cover up the pretreated fish in moisture-proof wrap , dividing each piece of fish with freezer paper .
