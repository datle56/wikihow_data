      "content": "Relationship: The two of you are exclusive. Suppose you’ve been hanging out for months, but they change the subject when you want to discuss whether you’re a couple. In that case, they likely want to keep things as they are and not commit to starting an official relationship with you. [1] X Research source Remember, you deserve to feel valued and appreciated, so if a fling isn’t cutting it for you, don’t be afraid to express your feelings and move on if necessary—you’re a catch! In an official relationship, both partners tend to be able to agree on their label status early on (partner, girlfriend, boyfriend), whereas someone in a fling may avoid this. A fling can transition into an official relationship at any time. Be open and honest about your desire for a relationship with your partner—if they feel the same way, it might be time to make things official."

      "content": "Relationship: They introduce you to their friends and family. Most people can agree that things are getting serious when their partner wants to introduce them to their family and friends. This is because people interested in starting a lasting relationship don’t mind their friends and family asking about you. [2] X Research source Alternatively, a partner in a fling may avoid having you meet their loved ones because they may be uncomfortable with speculation and don’t want to make things complicated, often called “pocketing.” Keep in mind that your partner might have a strained relationship with their family and not want to subject you to their unfair criticism or difficult personalities. If you want to meet your partner’s loved ones , it’s ok to politely ask! For example, you might say, “I can’t help but be curious to meet the people responsible for making you such a great person.” Reader Poll: We asked 1016 wikiHow readers who've been in a fling or situationship, and only 12% of them said they realized they were in a fling because their partner hasn’t introduced them to friends and family. [Take Poll] While this can definitely be a red flag, there could be other reasons they haven’t introduced you yet. Make sure your partner knows how you feel before making an assumption."

      "content": "Relationship: You have an emotional and physical connection. Serious relationships have both emotional and physical intimacy, while fling relationships are typically categorized by having a primarily sexual connection. Essentially, flings affirm physical attractiveness, not emotional compatibility. [3] X Research source For example, if your partner is only interested in sex and doesn’t make an effort to get to know you as a person, you’re likely in a fling. Surprisingly enough, physical intimacy is often easier for people to manage than emotional intimacy, as many people fear rejection. If you’re looking to get more serious, consider asking your partner to go on a date with you where you can chat, like going to a museum."

      "content": "Relationship: You stay in contact throughout the day. You had an amazing night together, but now it’s radio silence—what’s up with that? Unfortunately, someone in a fling may only reach out to you for physical connection and not try to grow their connection with you into something more. [4] X Research source For example, you won’t often find a partner in a fling texting you to hang out unless they’re looking to hook up. Relationship partners are there for you when you need them, whereas your partner in a fling is typically only there when they need you. If you’re constantly reaching out to your partner, but they continuously ignore you or make you feel like an afterthought, it might be time to move on . Remember, you don’t have to settle for someone who doesn’t fulfill your needs—there’s someone out there who will make you feel loved and appreciated."

      "content": "Relationship: You both make time for each other. For example, if you’re busy or tired at night and have expressed this to your partner but continue to only reach out to you last-minute, they’re likely just looking to hook up and are unwilling to make sacrifices or compromises for your sake. [5] X Research source Additionally, if your partner only wants to meet you at certain places during certain hours and is unwilling to display their affection for you publicly, they might be seeing other people and don’t want to be caught out and about with you. This may be especially true if your partner doesn’t or refuses to follow you on social media. If you’re concerned or uncomfortable about this, consider asking your partner if they’re seeing anyone else , and let them know if it’s important to you to keep your partnership exclusive."

      "content": "Relationship: You’re both prepared to make a commitment. A partner in a fling might be rebounding from a serious relationship. While it’s totally possible to enter into a wonderful relationship shortly after ending a serious one, these immediate connections made with another person shortly after a breakup are often considered “rebound flings.” [6] X Research source Unfortunately, a challenging or significant breakup can lead people to look for validation elsewhere, resulting in flings with little chance of them developing into something more. For example, if your partner reached out to you shortly after ending a relationship with their long-term partner, they might be looking for a casual fling and may not be ready to get into a serious relationship again. If you’re concerned about being in a fling, ask your partner how they feel about progressing toward an official relationship. While it may be painful if your partner expresses their inability or unwillingness, at least you’ll know where you stand and can make an informed decision to stay or go."

      "content": "Relationship: You involve each other in your life goals and plans. Planning ahead as a couple is seen as a sign of commitment and strengthening the relationship. If your partner avoids this and only makes plans for themselves, you may be in a fling. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mental Health Foundation UK charity working towards good mental health for all. Go to source For example, if your partner says something like, “I’m looking forward to finally booking a vacation in Greece,” but doesn’t ask if you’d like to come, they likely see you as a casual fling. If you’re not concerned about planning for the future or simply aren’t into commitment, flings are an excellent way to meet your romantic needs without the hassle of a relationship. Listen to your heart and do what works best for you!"

      "content": "Relationship: You have deep talks together. People interested in pursuing a relationship tend to want to learn everything about you, from little to big. In the case of a fling, however, you may often find you and your partner avoiding deep conversation and only connecting physically. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, a partner in a fling might keep their answers short if you ask them a question, like only responding with “good” if you ask them how things are going in their life. Tell your partner you’re interested in getting to know them better if you’re looking to transition from fling to relationship. If your partner denies or avoids getting closer to you, they’re likely only interested in staying a fling."

While there’s nothing wrong with being romantically and/or sexually experienced, a person with a history of short-term flings may be most comfortable having another fling with you rather than establishing something serious. [9] X Research source They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but that’s not always true. Many people went through numerous flings before finding the right person to get serious with. Ask yourself questions like, “Does my partner make me feel special?” or, “Does my partner have a wandering eye?” to help you determine if they’re playing with you."
