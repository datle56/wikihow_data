      "title": "Find inspiration for your story’s premise.",
      "content": "Find inspiration for your story’s premise. “Make sure you know what you want to write about” before you start drafting, emphasizes Sargent. You need a good idea that you’re excited to develop into a script. Find inspiration by reading great scripts, advises Hay. Rewatch your favorite films, shows, and plays, and jot down ideas for movies you want to see. Use a “What if?” question to generate ideas. You may also think about an overall theme for your story that you want to explore. [1] X Research source For example, “What if you went back in time and met your parents when they were your age?” is the premise for Back to the Future . “What if a monster rescued a princess instead of a handsome prince?” is the premise of Shrek . Carry a small notebook with you wherever you go so you can take down notes when you get ideas. Or, keep them in the Notes app of your phone."

      "title": "Pick a genre for your story.",
      "content": "Pick a genre for your story. Genre is an important storytelling device that lets readers know what sort of story to expect—it’s the category your script falls under based on its style, content, and plot. [2] X Research source Look at the movies or TV shows that you enjoy most and try to write a script in a similar style, since you’re likely already familiar with the tropes and plot beats (main events) of those types of stories. Advice for picking a genre: If you like big set pieces and explosions, consider writing an action film. If you want to scare other people, try writing a horror script. If you want to tell a story about a relationship, try writing a drama or romantic comedy . If you like a lot of special effects or wonder what could happen in the future, write a science fiction film. Combine genres to make something unique. For example, you may have a western movie that takes place in space (like the anime Cowboy Bebop ) or a romance movie with horror elements (like the film Bones and All )."

      "title": "Craft compelling characters with goals, flaws, and arcs.",
      "content": "Craft compelling characters with goals, flaws, and arcs. Every character in your script needs to want something—that’s their goal. Choose a main goal your main character, called a protagonist, pursues throughout the script. Give your characters flaws to make them more relatable and interesting. Finally, brainstorm who your character is at the beginning of the story versus how the events would change them—that’s their character arc. Don't forget to figure out a memorable name for your script’s protagonist! If you’re having trouble crafting characters, write profiles of them that describe what they look like, what they want, their history, and their strengths and flaws. These short writing exercises go a long way in making your characters feel developed. Most stories have an antagonist . Give them qualities similar to the protagonist so they’re equally matched, but make them opposing via their goals, beliefs, and methods of achieving goals. For example, your protagonist may be trying to save the world, but the antagonist may think the only way to save it is to destroy it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Write a 1-2 sentence logline summarizing the plot of your script.",
      "content": "Write a 1-2 sentence logline summarizing the plot of your script. A logline is a short summary of the main events in your film. Use concise, descriptive language to make your logline sound snappy and intriguing. Make sure other people understand what the main idea of your story is, including the protagonist, the antagonist, the conflict, and the genre. [4] X Research source For example, if you wanted to write a logline for the movie A Quiet Place , you may say, “A family is attacked by monsters,” but that doesn't give enough detail. Instead, if you wrote, “A family must live in silence to avoid being captured by monsters with ultra-sensitive hearing,” then the person reading your logline understands the main points of your script. Loglines are used in the screenwriting industry to help agents and readers decide if they want to read your script. If you’re trying to sell your script, you’ll also need to write a treatment—a 1-2 page summary of the script. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Brainstorm scene ideas on index cards.",
      "content": "Brainstorm scene ideas on index cards. Write down each event in your script in a document—try to keep it to 1-2 pages. Then, brainstorm potential scenes that could connect each event on individual note cards. This way, you can easily reorganize or remove scenes from your outline as you write. Write down all of your ideas, even if you think they're bad, since you may not know what will work best in your final script. If you don't want to use index cards, you may also use a word document or outlining software like Evernote or Scrivener . Lay your cards out on the floor or table so you can see all the scenes at once. Think about how each one develops characters and drives the plot forward—each scene should accomplish at least one, if not both, of those effects. Have events in the future take place early in your film if you want to make a mind-bending movie with twists, such as Inception ."

      "title": "Ask yourself the importance of each scene you want to include.",
      "content": "Ask yourself the importance of each scene you want to include. As you go through your outline, ask yourself questions such as, “What is the main point of this scene?” or, “How does this scene move the story forward?” Go through each of the scenes to see if they add to the story or if they're only there to fill out space. If the scene doesn't have a point or move the story, you can probably remove it. [6] X Research source For example, if the scene is your character just shopping for groceries, it doesn't add anything to the story. However, if your character bumps into someone at the grocery store and they hold a conversation related to the main idea of the movie, then you can keep it."

      "title": "Use high and low moments as your act breaks.",
      "content": "Use high and low moments as your act breaks. Act breaks help separate your story into three parts: setup, confrontation, and resolution. Screenwriters typically structure act breaks, or the ending of one part and the beginning of another, around high and low points in the story. Below is a more detailed look at each act and its break: [7] X Research source Tip: TV scripts usually hit act breaks when they cut to commercials. Watch shows similar to the story you're writing to see what happens just before they go to a commercial break. The setup , or Act I, begins at the start of your story and ends when your character makes a choice that changes their lives forever. In the confrontation , or Act II, your protagonist works toward their goal and interacts with your antagonist, leading up to the story’s climax. The resolution , or Act III, takes place after the climax and shows what happens afterward, as well as tying up any remaining plot threads."

Include the title of your script in all caps in the center of the page—not at the top but a few line breaks down. Put a line break after the title of your script, then type “Written by.” Add another line break before typing your name. Leave contact information, such as an email address and phone number, in the bottom left margins. [8] X Research source Some people underline the title, while others bold it. If the script is based on any other stories or films, include a few lines with the phrase “Based on the story by” followed by the names of the original authors."

      "content": "Use size 12 Courier font throughout your whole script. The screenwriting standard is any variation of Courier font because it's easy to read. Make sure to use 12-point font since it's what other scripts use and is considered industry standard. [9] X Research source Use any additional formatting, such as bolding or underlining, sparingly since it can distract your reader. Screenwriting software, like Celtx, Final Draft, or WriterDuet, all automatically format your script for you so you don't need to worry about changing any settings."

Scene headings, also called sluglines, should be aligned to the left margin 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) from the edge of the page. Type the scene headings in all caps. Include INT. or EXT. to tell readers if the scene takes place inside or outside. Name the specific location where the scene takes place, followed by a short dash, then the time of day it takes place. [10] X Research source For example, a scene heading may read: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY. Keep scene headings on a single line so they aren't too overwhelming. If you want to specify a room in a specific location, you can also type scene headings like: INT. JOHN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY."

Use action lines to denote what a character does and to give brief descriptions about what's happening. Keep action lines brief so they don't overwhelm a reader looking at the page. [11] X Research source Avoid writing what the characters are thinking. A good rule of thumb to think about is if it can't be seen or heard on-screen, don't include it in your action block. Instead of saying, “John thinks about pulling the lever but he's not sure if he should,” you may write something like, “John's hand twitches near the lever. He grits his teeth and furrows his brow.” When you introduce a character for the first time in an action block, use all caps for their name. Every time after that, write it as normal."

When switching from scene headings or action lines to dialogue, make sure the margin is set to 3.7 in (9.4 cm) from the left side of the page. Put the character's name in all caps so a reader or actor can easily see when their lines occur. When you write the dialogue, make sure it's 2 1 ⁄ 2 in (6.4 cm) from the left side of the page. [12] X Research source If you want to make it clear how your character is feeling, include a parenthetical on the line right after the character's name with an emotion. For example, it may read (excited) or (tense). Make sure the parenthetical is 3.1 in (7.9 cm) from the left side of the page."

Don't worry about spelling or grammar entirely—you just need to get your story written down. If you aim to do 1-2 pages each day, you'll finish your first draft within 60-90 days. Choose a set time each day to sit down and write so you don't get distracted. Some people write more easily in the morning, while others produce their best work at night.

Look for places where the story is confusing or where characters are doing things without moving the story forward. Write your notes down by hand so you can remember them better. [15] X Research source Try to read your script out loud and don't be afraid to act out parts based on how you think they should be performed. That way, you can catch dialogue or wording that doesn't work as well. Tip: If you can, print out your screenplay so you can directly write on it. Also, keep an eye out for inconsistencies, like a character’s description or age changing, or someone referencing something that hasn’t happened yet.

As you work through each revision, work from larger problems, such as dialogue or confusing action sequences, to minor problems, such as grammar and spelling. Start each draft in a new document so you can cut and paste parts you like from your old script into the new one. Name each version with a number after the title or the date you start making the changes so you can easily revisit old ones.

Common mistakes you may make when writing a script include using incorrect formatting, relying too heavily on tropes or cliches, leaving plot holes in the script, or having too much dialogue. [17] X Research source Here are a few ways to avoid these mistakes: Review formatting guidelines before revising. Ask your readers for feedback on whether the story feels predictable. While revising yourself, ask if there are new ways to present similar story beats or character arcs. Make sure every plot thread you introduce is resolved.
