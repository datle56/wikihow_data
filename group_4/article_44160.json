      "content": "No, it’s not possible to track a pet with a microchip. Microchips are not GPS tracking devices, nor do they have a battery. Because of this, microchips cannot transmit a signal to be tracked or located. Instead, microchips are used to store information about your pet—almost like a permanent ID collar. Medical and contact information can be stored in the microchip so that if your pet is ever lost, a clinic or shelter can scan the chip and find out how to contact you. [1] X Research source All in all, microchips are tools used to help contact a pet’s family and do not provide real-time tracking or location status."

If your pet is taken to a vet or shelter, they will scan the pet to see if it has a microchip. They will then be able to look up your contact information and notify you of your lost pet. [3] X Research source If you found a lost pet, bring them to a local vet clinic or shelter to have their microchip scanned. The vet should be able to help you get the owner’s contact information so you can return the pet safely."

Many shelters install the chips in every pet they adopt. If your rescue pet is lost, contact the shelter to see if this is the case for your pet. If so, the shelter may be contacted if your pet is found. [4] X Research source Make sure the shelter knows you want your pet back. Keep checking back with them to see if your pet has been found and returned to them, which may happen if the address on your adopted pet’s chip is still set as the shelter."

Think of a microchip like an ID card; it holds all of your pet’s personal information, which can only be accessed when scanned. On the other hand, a GPS tracks your pet’s location and whereabouts. [14] X Research source Say a dog goes missing. If the dog has a microchip, someone can bring the dog to a vet clinic and have their microchip scanned to find the name and address of the owner.
