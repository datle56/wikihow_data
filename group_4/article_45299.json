[1] X Research source If you find a key with a smiley face but the key also displays symbols and/or numbers, tap the key to open the number/symbol keyboard first—you'll find the dedicated smiley face key there. If you don't see a smiley face key, your emoji is probably buried in another key's menu. Tap and hold either Enter (usually an arrow at the bottom-right corner of the keyboard) or the comma ( , ). One of these keys should display a menu that has a smiley face key, which you can then select to open the emoji keyboard. [2] X Research source"

To turn on NumLk, just press the NumLk key on the keyboard. Depending on your keyboard, you may have to hold down the Fn key at the same time as you press one of the function keys (often F11 ). You can use the on-screen keyboard if you don't have a numeric keypad, or simply prefer to use it over NumLk. To open it, click the Search icon (it's usually a circle to the right of the Start menu), type osk , and then click On-Screen Keyboard .
