      "title": "Choose your infuser.",
      "content": "Choose your infuser. A tea infuser is a container used to steep loose leaf tea (taking the place of a traditional tea bag). All tea infusers have some place to hold the tea (a basket) and some kind of handle or cord. Select the infuser of your choice. Some common styles include: Tea ball with chain Tea ball with long handle Tea strainer (that sits on the edge of a mug) Novelty infusers shaped like robots, deep sea divers, or anything else."

    {
      "title": "Measure your tea.",
      "content": "Measure your tea. Depending on the type of tea you are using, add 1-3 tsp. (4.8-14.7 ml) of loose leaf tea to your infuser. It is important not to overstuff the infuser, as this can cause tea leaves to spill out into your tea. Many loose leaf teas will include recommended measurements, but here are some general guidelines: Green tea: 1-2 tsp. (4.8-9.8 ml) White tea: 2-3 tsp. (9.8-14.7 ml) Black tea: 1-2 tsp. (4.9-9.8 ml)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the infuser in your mug.",
      "content": "Place the infuser in your mug. Once you have measured your loose leaf tea and placed it inside your tea infuser, simply place the infuser inside your mug. Affix your infuser to the edge of your mug, or allow the chain/handle to hang over the edge."

    {
      "title": "Boil some water.",
      "content": "Boil some water. In order to brew tea, you should always use freshly drawn, cold water. If you have access to filtered water, this is even better. You will need about 8 oz. (1 cup) of water for one cup of tea. Place your water in a kettle and heat it until boiling."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure the water temperature.",
      "content": "Measure the water temperature. Once the water has reached a boiling point, remove it from the heat. Use a kitchen thermometer to check the temperature of the water. If the water is too hot for the type of tea you are brewing, allow it to cool down for a few minutes and check it again. Once again, you can follow the instructions included with your tea, but here are some general guidelines: White tea: 176-185 F (80-85 C) Green tea (Japanese): 158-176 F (70-80 C) Green tea (Chinese): 176-185 F (80-85 C) Black tea: 203 degree F (95 C)"

    {
      "title": "Add hot water to your mug.",
      "content": "Add hot water to your mug. Once your water reaches the appropriate temperature, and your infuser is in place, add the hot water to your mug. Then wait the specified length of time (you may want to set a timer). Follow the instructions included with your tea, or follow these guidelines: White tea: 3 minutes Green tea (Japanese): 1-2 minutes Green tea (Chinese): 2-3 minutes Black tea: 2-3 minutes"
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the infuser.",
      "content": "Remove the infuser. After the steeping time is up, remove your infuser. If you are finished making tea, you can discard the tea leaves and rinse your infuser under warm water. Otherwise, you can reuse the tea for another cup. Simply increase the steep time by 1-2 minutes. [1] X Research source If you compost food waste, you can add tea leaves to your compost pile."
