      "title": "Install batteries.",
      "content": "Install batteries. Batteries provide backup memory for the cash register in case of power failure and should be installed before you program any functions in the cash register. Take off the receipt paper cover and locate the battery compartment. You may need to use a small screwdriver to unscrew the lid to this area. Install the batteries according to the directions on the machine. Put the lid back on the battery compartment. Some battery compartments are located underneath the receipt paper area. Change batteries once per year to ensure that they will work properly."

Press the FEED button so that the register will catch the receipt and feed it through. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Program your register.",
      "content": "Program your register. Most registers have buttons that can be programmed to categorize similar items. These categories, or departments, can also be associated with taxable or non-taxable items. You can also set the date and time. The program function is usually accessed by either turning the key to PRG or P, or pressing the mode button to PROGRAM. Other registers may have a manual lever underneath the receipt tape cover that needs to be switched to a Program option. Many cash registers have at least 4 tax buttons. These can be programmed at different tax rates, depending on if you have a flat sales tax as some states in the U.S. do, or if you have other types of taxes, such as GST, PST, or VAT rates (depending on your location). Follow the specific instructions in your register's manual to program these functions."

If this is the case, you won't need to press the department button in the next step."

Subtract your overall total from the amount of money that you started with before your first transaction of the day. Put all your cash, credit card receipts and checks into a deposit bag and take them to the bank. Keep a written ledger of the currency, credit card transactions and checks. This will help with your overall accounting. Replace a base amount of money to the drawer for the start of the next business day. Be sure to store the money in a safe, secure location when your business is not open."
