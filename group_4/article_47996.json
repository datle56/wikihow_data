      "content": "SSB stands for “Send Snap Back” on Snapchat. If you receive a snap (a photo or video) from another Snapchat user with the term “SSB” attached, it means they want you to snap them a picture or video in return. You might also see a shortened version of SSB floating around: SB, or “Snap Back. [1] X Research source Generally, the person wants you to send them a snap that's somewhat similar to their original snap. So if a guy sends you a snap of his feet with the caption \"SSB,\" he's probably expecting you to respond with a snap of your feet or toes. You probably won’t see “SSB” in a text or on other social media platforms unless the person is talking about Snapchat, specifically."

      "content": "Respond with a snap of your own to keep the convo going. If your friend sends you a snap with the text \"SSB\" included, they probably want to see a pic or video of what you’re up to right now. All you need to do is send them a snap in return! They may also be trying to keep a Snapstreak going with you, since this is a really popular activity on Snapchat. To take a new photo or video, press the round button at the bottom of the screen. Then, snap the photo or video to your friend. You’re in a Snapstreak with another user if you’ve spoken to them every day for the past 3 days in a row. You’ll see a fire emoji next to the names of people who you’re in a Snapstreak with. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Ignore SSB if you don’t want to interact with the person. Just because someone asks you to send a snap back on Snapchat doesn’t mean you have to! It’s totally optional. If you aren’t in the mood or you don’t have time right now, just ignore them. You can always get back to them later if you want to. If the person is bothering you, feel free to block them ."

      "content": "SSB may be a Sex and the City reference that means “Secret Single Behavior.” You might come across this usage if you’re chatting with someone who’s a big fan of this TV series. “Secret Single Behavior” refers to the weird and quirky habits we all have when we’re alone and safe from prying eyes. [3] X Research source Carrie’s character mentions one of her SSBs: stacking saltine crackers, spreading grape jelly on them, and eating them standing up while she reads magazines. This is a quirky little thing she does when she's by herself."

I wanted to hang out with Todd.”"
