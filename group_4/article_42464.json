      "content": "Take up to 6 grams per day of MSM in tablet form. While the recommended daily dosage is up to 6 grams, divided into 3 doses, start at a lower dose and see how it affects you. Try taking a 1-gram tablet 3 times a day, and increase your dosage over the course of 1 to 2 weeks. To prevent an upset stomach, take each dose with a glass of water and a meal. [1] X Research source MSM is available in tablet, powder, and liquid forms online, at pharmacies, and at health stores. It's most often used for arthritis and muscle pain, so check your store's joint health section. Those who use MSM and report positive results say that it takes at least 2 weeks to notice effects."

      "content": "Mix powdered MSM with water if you don't like taking pills. Go with the oral dosage form that you're most comfortable taking regularly.

      "content": "Try a 5 to 10% MSM shampoo or cream instead of taking it orally. Oral supplements are more popular and more readily available, but you can also try using a topical product. Daily use of an MSM solution at concentrations between 5 and 10% might help hair loss. Read your product's instructions and use it as directed. [2] X Research source The study showed positive results within 20 days of beginning treatment."

      "title": "Make your own MSM shampoo if you can't find a product.",
      "content": "Make your own MSM shampoo if you can't find a product. If you can't find a store-bought MSM shampoo or cream, or if you don't want to splurge on one, making your own is relatively easy. Bring 2 cups (470 mL) of distilled water to a boil, then add 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 ounce (14 g) each of rosemary, sage, nettles, and lavender. Remove the mixture from the heat and let it cool for 30 minutes. [3] X Research source After 30 minutes, add 2 grams of powdered MSM. Let the mixture sit for 30 to 40 minutes, then strain it into a bowl. After straining it, combine 1 part of the herbal mixture with 2 parts of liquid castile soap in a plastic bottle, such as an empty shampoo bottle. For instance, combine 4 fluid ounces (120 mL) of the herbal mixture with 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of castile soap. Most stores that sell shampoo and bath products carry castile soap."

      "title": "Eat plenty of protein-rich foods.",
      "content": "Eat plenty of protein-rich foods. MSM is found in protein sources including eggs, fish, poultry, and legumes. [5] X Research source Most health organizations recommend eating 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram you weigh, or about a third as many grams as your weight in pounds. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source For example, if you weigh 140 pounds (64 kg), your recommended protein intake is 53 grams per day. A 3 ounce (85 g) serving of tuna, salmon, or trout counts as 21 grams of protein. A 3 ounce (85 g) serving of poultry counts as 19 grams of protein, and 1 egg counts as 6 grams. The healthiest way to add extra protein to your diet is to eat more legumes, such as beans or peanuts. Additionally, go for lean cuts of fish and poultry instead of fattier red meats."

      "content": "Go for garlic and onions. While garlic and onion contain MSM and other sulfuric compounds, they're most often consumed cooked instead of raw. Since MSM breaks down during the cooking process, try adding raw onion and garlic to salads and dressings."

      "content": "Add more Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and kale to your diet. Fruits and veggies are, in general, good sources of sulfuric compounds such as MSM. Leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables (such as cabbage) are especially good choices. [7] X Research source Leafy green and other fruits and vegetables also contain vitamins and minerals that promote healthy hair, skin, and nails."

    {
      "title": "Eat foods that contain MSM raw, if possible.",
      "content": "Eat foods that contain MSM raw, if possible. Cooking breaks down MSM, so you don't get as much from cooked foods as raw foods. While cooked foods still provide MSM and other beneficial sulfuric compounds, try to eat MSM sources raw if there's no risk of foodborne illness. For example, snack on unsalted peanuts or have kale salads with chopped onions and grated garlic."

However, you should still ask your doctor if taking an MSM supplement is right for you. They might recommend other treatment options or test for underlying conditions if you're experiencing premature or unusual hair loss.
