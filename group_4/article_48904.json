      "content": "Eat simple carbs the day before your race and for breakfast on race day. Normally, simple carbs aren’t the best foods to include in your diet, as your body burns through them quickly. However, quick energy is exactly what your body needs to finish a long, challenging race. Build your meals around simple carbs on the day before and the morning of your race to make sure your body gets the fuel it needs. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Simple carbs include foods like fruit, milk, vegetables, pasta, and bread. You can also find simple carbs in processed foods and desserts, but these foods aren’t the best choice for your body, as they lack nutrients. [7] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source For instance, on the day before your race, you might eat egg whites with sauteed veggies and a side of fruit for breakfast, a sandwich with fruit for lunch, and spaghetti for dinner. On the morning of your race, you could eat cereal with a chopped banana and milk."

You don’t want to get dehydrated during your race, and it might be hard to replenish your water stores while you’re running. Start sipping on water when you wake up in the morning, and try to drink about 16 fluid ounces (0.47 L) before the race actually starts. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In the days leading up to the race, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids.

      "content": "Start the race at a steady, moderate pace. It’s tempting to sprint out of the starting line so you can secure the lead, but that’s a mistake. Running too fast at the beginning of the race will tire you out sooner, leaving you little energy to finish the race. Instead, pace yourself so you are able to finish the race at a faster pace than the other runners. [12] X Research source Don’t let other runners psych you out if they choose to start off fast. Remember, they’re going to burn through all of their energy before the end of the race, so you can always pass them later."

At the beginning of the race, you’ll need to manage your energy levels so that you don’t run too fast, which may tire you out too soon. As you progress through the race, you can increase your pace occasionally to pass other runners. However, save your sprint for the end of the race. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Relax your shoulder and face muscles so you don’t waste energy. It’s natural to want to run faster to finish first, but tightening your shoulders and face won't accomplish this goal. In fact, clenching these muscles costs you energy that you could be using for a strong finish. Instead, keep your face and shoulders neutral and relaxed. Check in with yourself when you reach race landmarks and release any tension you're holding in your face or shoulders."

      "content": "Shorten your stride and use your arms to push yourself up hills. Hills are the most challenging part of a race for many people, but you can use them to your advantage. Take shorter steps, but keep your pace quick as you surge up the hill. Additionally, pump your arms to help drive yourself forward. This will help you keep your speed up on the incline. [15] X Research source Don't be afraid of hills because worrying about them will slow you down. Instead, view them as a chance to pass other runners who are struggling up the hill.

[21] X Research source It’s best to plan when you’ll begin your sprint, based on how long the race is and how far you can typically sprint. You'll likely want to sprint at least the final .25 miles (0.40 km). However, you can adjust this to fit your personal endurance levels."

Otherwise, you’ll be very sore the next day. [22] X Research source For instance, you might do a light jog for 5 minutes, followed by a 5 minute walk."
