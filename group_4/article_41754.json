      "title": "Stuff your shoes with several pairs of socks.",
      "content": "Stuff your shoes with several pairs of socks. For best results, roll the socks into tight balls before filling the toes of your shoes. Then, maintain pressure as you continue stuffing socks into your shoe, until your entire shoe is full. Pack the socks down as tightly as possible to help the shoe stretch. Try not to leave any room in the shoe. The more tightly you pack the socks, the more your shoe will stretch."

      "title": "Heat your shoes for about 1 minute using the medium setting on a hair dryer.",
      "content": "Heat your shoes for about 1 minute using the medium setting on a hair dryer. Hold the hair dryer about 6 inches (15 cm) above your shoe. As you heat the shoe, move the hair dryer continuously back and forth over the shoe to heat it evenly. Turn off your hair dryer after 1 minute, then check that the shoe is warm. If the shoe feels cool, try heating it up for another 30 seconds to 1 minute. Then, check it again. Although the hair dryer shouldn't damage your shoes, avoid using a high heat to be safe."

      "title": "Add more socks to the shoes while they're still warm.",
      "content": "Add more socks to the shoes while they're still warm. The heat will have expanded your shoe material slightly, so take the time to push the socks down into the shoe as far as they will go. Then, insert additional socks into the shoe. Pack them down as tightly as you can to help the shoe stretch. The heat should cause the shoe to expand a little and get flexible, which will allow you to add more socks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the shoes cool down with the socks inside, then check the fit.",
      "content": "Let the shoes cool down with the socks inside, then check the fit. The socks act as a mold for the shoe to help stretch it out. Leave the socks in place until the shoes feel cool to the touch. Then, take the socks out and check the fit to see if your shoes feel more comfortable. Check the fit by walking around and wiggling your toes. If your shoes are still too tight, you can try stretching them more. However, it may be best to try freezing or soaking them, which will provide a better stretch."

      "title": "Fill 2 plastic sandwich bags with enough water to fill your shoes.",
      "content": "Fill 2 plastic sandwich bags with enough water to fill your shoes. Get 2 plastic sandwich bags that have zipper seals. Add enough tap water to the bags to completely fill up the inside of your shoes. Then, remove the excess air from each bag before you seal them. Don't leave a lot of extra space between the bag and the sides of your shoe. The water must fill your shoes completely to stretch them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert the bags of water into the shoes, tightly seal them, and lace your shoes up.",
      "content": "Insert the bags of water into the shoes, tightly seal them, and lace your shoes up. Make sure the bags are deep enough that they fill the toe cavity. Then, lace your shoe around the bag of water. Once you're done, the bag should be securely in your shoe, like your foot would. [1] X Research source Use your finger to check for gaps between the bag of water and the side of the shoe. If the bag doesn't fill the shoe, you may want to add more water or possibly a second bag of water."

      "title": "Place your shoes in the freezer for at least 8 hours.",
      "content": "Place your shoes in the freezer for at least 8 hours. If you can, place your shoes on the top shelf so they get colder faster. Then, leave them in for at least 8 hours, or overnight. Make sure to remove your shoes after 12 hours so you don't damage them."

      "title": "Take your shoes out of the freezer, and let them dry for 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Take your shoes out of the freezer, and let them dry for 30 minutes. Though you can try to wiggle the bags of ice out as soon as you remove your shoes, the water will likely be frozen solid. Giving your shoes about 30 minutes to dry will make it easier to remove the bags. However, try not to leave them much longer than that, since the condensation may wet your shoes. [2] X Research source Your thawing shoes may leave a slight puddle, so lay a plastic bag down before letting them thaw, or thaw them in the sink for easy cleanup."

      "title": "Remove the water bags after 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Remove the water bags after 30 minutes. The bags of water should be easier to remove at this point. Wiggle them out carefully, then pour the water down the drain and discard or wash the bags."

      "title": "Let your shoes thaw before putting them on.",
      "content": "Let your shoes thaw before putting them on. It will probably take a few hours for your shoes to thaw. Wait until your shoes feel warm before putting them on your feet, then check the fit. Walk around and wiggle your toes to see if you like the fit."

      "title": "Slide on your shoes and lace them up.",
      "content": "Slide on your shoes and lace them up. Pull on a pair of socks to add a little padding inside the shoe, which will help stretch them. Then, put on your shoes exactly as you would for climbing, lacing them all the way up. [3] X Research source Wearing a thicker pair of socks might help you stretch out your shoes more because they will take up more space inside your shoe."

      "content": "Turn the shower on as hot as you can stand it. Warm water will ensure that the fabric expands as much as possible, so wait a few minutes for the water to warm up before soaking your shoes. [4] X Research source Hot water can scald your skin, so be very careful."

      "title": "Put your feet under the water until your shoes are soaked.",
      "content": "Put your feet under the water until your shoes are soaked. It doesn't matter if the rest of your body gets wet, so you don't have to get under the stream of water if you don't want to. Hold your feet under the water for about 1-2 minutes, and make sure to move around so every area of your shoe gets wet. You should feel the water inside your shoes, soaking through your socks. Keep in mind that the dye from your shoes may run when the shoes get wet. This shouldn't be a cause for concern."

      "title": "Walk around and wiggle your toes to help stretch the shoes.",
      "content": "Walk around and wiggle your toes to help stretch the shoes. The longer you keep your shoes on – and the more you wiggle your toes – the better! Wearing your shoes, and moving your feet, are the best way to stretch the fabric out. Be very careful as you walk around in your wet shoes because it's easy to slip. Try to walk on a towel or rug so that you aren't stepping into puddles."

      "title": "Climb in your shoes while they're still damp, if possible.",
      "content": "Climb in your shoes while they're still damp, if possible. The best way to make sure your shoes mold to your feet is to climb in them. However, make sure you're extra careful, and choose an easy climb, since your shoes may be slightly slippery and uncomfortable. If you typically climb indoors, confirm with the gym that you can climb in wet shoes before attempting to do so. It might also help to bring a towel so you can dry the wall after you're done. Climbing in damp shoes won't feel as comfortable as using dry shoes, but it will help stretch your shoes out quickly."

      "content": "Remove your shoes, then stuff them with newspaper as they dry. Pack the newspaper tightly in the toe cavity, then fill the rest of your shoes with the remaining newspaper. This will prevent your shoes from shrinking back up as they dry. As another option, you could use paper towels, washcloths, or socks to stuff your shoes."

      "title": "Let your shoes dry for 24-48 hours or until they're fully dry.",
      "content": "Let your shoes dry for 24-48 hours or until they're fully dry. Place your shoes in the sink or on a waterproof surface, and leave them for at least 24 hours. Once they're no longer damp, try them on to see if they fit! [5] X Research source"
