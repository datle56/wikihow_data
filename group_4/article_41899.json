      "title": "Get the rollers ready.",
      "content": "Get the rollers ready. Go ahead and plug in the hot rollers so that they're fully heated by the time you're ready to put them in your hair. If this is your first time using your set of rollers, read the manufacturer's instructions to make sure you use the equipment properly. Keep in mind that a hot roller set usually comes with a few different sizes of rollers and you will need to use all of them to cover your head. If you want to use only 1 size of rollers, then you may need to buy multiple mixed sets to have enough. Make sure the rollers are not too hot before applying them."

      "title": "Spray your hair with gentle hold hairspray.",
      "content": "Spray your hair with gentle hold hairspray. Start with completely dry hair, since your hair won't hold curls if you use this method with wet hair. Spray your hair all over with hairspray, which will help define your curls as the hot rollers go to work. It is also important for your hair to be dry since wet hair can steam and this may result in a burn on your scalp."

      "title": "Divide your hair into 4 or more sections.",
      "content": "Divide your hair into 4 or more sections. Use a comb to separate your hair out into 4 even sections. [1] X Research source You should have 1 on top of your head, 1 on the back center of your head, and 1 on each side of your head. Use a clip to secure each of these sections until you are ready to put in the hot rollers. If you have very thick hair, then you may need to divide your hair into 6 or even 8 sections for hot rolling."

      "title": "Roll the top and back center sections.",
      "content": "Roll the top and back center sections. Starting in the front, lift up a section of hair that is no wider than the roller. If you have long hair, then you may need to grab a smaller section to ensure that the rolled hair will not be too thick on the roller. Wrap the end of it around the first roller, moving up towards the roots. Roll your hair back towards the crown of your head so that the front of your hair pulls away from your forehead and over the roller. [2] X Research source Secure the roller in place with a roller pin of the appropriate size. Continue rolling your hair until you've rolled the entire middle section of hair. Roll your hair in different directions if you don't want uniform curls. Roll some sections of hair forward and some sections of hair backward. This will result in curls that look more natural. For small, tight curls, be sure to use the smaller rollers in your set. Use medium rollers for larger classic curls. Use the largest rollers first and then the smaller ones after those are all gone."

      "content": "Work on rolling the side sections. You can roll the side sections with the hair curling towards or away from the face, up towards the top of your head, or down towards your shoulder. Start with a small section of 1 of the side sections of hair and wrap it around a roller starting with the ends. Then, pick up another section and repeat. Repeat with the hair on the other side of your head until all of your hair has been rolled."

Secure each of the 4 sections with hair clips. [3] X Research source If you have very thick hair, then you may need to divide your hair into more than 4 sections."

      "content": "Roll the top and back middle sections. Take a piece from the front section of your hair that is no wider than the roller, and place it over a large hot roller. If your hair is long and/or thick, then you might need to use several rollers for each section. Roll the hair back toward your forehead, so that the hair pulls away from your forehead and the curler rests horizontally on the top of your head. Use a roller pin to hold it in place. Continue rolling sections of hair from the top and back sections until you've worked your way down to the nape of your neck. For loose, bouncy waves, roll all of your hair in the same direction. You can also try using different sized rollers in different areas to create waves of different sizes. Divide the back of your head into 2 to 3 sections. Don't put all of it onto 1 roller."

Use a comb to divide your hair into a top section, a back center section, and 2 side sections. Create a part on either side of your hair to separate the side sections, and keep them apart using large hair clips. Then, use the comb to divide the middle section into a top and back center section. [4] X Research source If your hair is very thick, then you may need to divide it into more than 4 sections."

Gather a small section of hair from just above your forehead. The section should be no wider than the roller. Hold the hot roller at the tips of your hair and roll down to the top of your head, so that the roller points from front to back instead of side to side.
