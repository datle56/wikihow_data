      "title": "Select a finance company specialty.",
      "content": "Select a finance company specialty. Finance companies tend to specialize in the types of loans they make as well as the customers they serve. The financial, marketing, and operational requirements vary from one specialty to another. Focusing on a single business model is critical to the successful creation and operation of a new company. Private finance companies range from the local mortgage broker who specializes in refinancing or making new loans to homeowners to the factoring companies (factors) that acquire or finance account receivables for small businesses. The decision to pursue a specific finance company specialty should be based upon your interest, your experiences, and the likelihood of success. Many finance companies are founded by former employees of existing companies. For example, former loan officers, underwriters, and broker associates create new mortgage brokerage firms specializing in a specific type of loan (commercial or residential) or working with a single lender. Consider the business specialty that attracted you initially. Why were you attracted to the business? Does the business require substantial start-up and operating capital? Is there an opportunity to create the same business in a new area? Will you be competing with other similar, existing businesses?"

      "content": "Confirm the business opportunity. A new finance company must be able to attract clients and produce a profit. As a consequence, it is important to research the expected market space where the business will compete. How big is the market? Who presently serves potential clients? Are prices stable? Is the market limited to a specific geographic area? How do existing companies attract and serve their customers? How do competitors differ in their approach to marketing and service features? Identify your target market, or the specific customers you intend to serve. Explain their needs and how you intend to meet them.}} Describe your area of specialization. For example, if your market research indicates a growing number of small start-up companies needing loans, describe how the financial products and services you offer are strong enough to gain a significant share of that market. Consider the companies already in the competitive space. Are they similar in size or dominated by a single company? Similar market shares may indicate a slow-growing market or the companies’ inability to distinguish themselves from their competitors."

Will potential clients visit a physical office, communicate online, or both? Will you need a financial partner such as a mortgage lender or a bank? Mortgage brokers act as intermediaries between borrowers and lenders, sometimes with discretion up to a dollar limit.

[3] X Research source In most cases, equity in the company is used primarily for the company's operations, rather than the source of loans to customers. Secondary lenders provide funds to the finance company that is subsequently loaned to customers; the customers' loans collateralize the lenders' loans to the finance company. This is because profit is made in the spread, or the difference between your cost of acquiring capital and profit from lending it out. Any funding request should indicate how much you need, how you intend to use the money, and the terms of the loan or investment."

A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is similar to a corporation in that it protects its owners from personal liability for debts or actions incurred by the business. However, they have the tax advantages of a sole proprietorship or partnership. A corporation typically files taxes separately from the shareholders. Be aware that corporations pay double federal income tax, meaning taxes are assessed when profit is earned, and then again when it is distributed to shareholders.

You will then furnish the requisite documents and pay any fees.

Safety-and-soundness regulations protect creditors from losses arising from the insolvency of financial institutions. Compliance regulations aim to protect individuals from unfair dealings or crime from the financial institutions. Financial regulations are carried out by both federal and state agencies. [7] X Research source Federal financial regulation agencies include the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the National Credit Union Administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). State regulatory agencies may have additional requirements that are even more stringent than those set by the SEC.

      "title": "Obtain financing.",
      "content": "Obtain financing. You will need to finance your company according to your business plan, using a combination of equity and debt financing. Initial startup costs will be used for meeting reserve requirements and the building or rental of office spaces. From there, much of the company's operating capital will be lent out to customers. Be aware of Federal and State laws regulating the private solicitation of investors. Adherence to securities laws regarding the information provided to potential investors and the qualifications of the investor will apply in most circumstances. Sources of debt financing include loans from the government and commercial lending institutions. Money borrowed with debt financing must be paid back over a period of time, usually with interest. The Small Business Administration (SBA) partners with banks to offer government loans to business owners. However, these loans can only be used for the purchase of equipment, not lent out to others. The SBA helps lending institutions make long-term loans by guaranteeing a portion of the loan should the business default. Finance companies face the problem of having to raise large amounts of initial funding to be successful. They also often have to deal with a slew of other challenges before they become profitable. Without accounting properly for issues like fraud, it's very easy for a finance company to go out of business. [11] X Research source"

Customers looking for a loan will want to do business in a place that projects a trustworthy and sound image. Take into account the reputation of the neighborhood or of a particular building and how it will appear to customers. Also consider how customers will reach you and the proximity of your competitors. [12] X Research source If your target customers are small local businesses, for example, they may not want to drive to a remote location or deal with heavy city traffic to meet with you. If you are not sure, contact your local planning agency to find out if your desired location is zoned for commercial use, especially if you plan to operate out of your home. Leasing commercial office space is expensive. Consider your finances, not only what you can afford, but also other expenses such as renovations and property taxes. In today's connected world, it's also possible to run a finance company online, without a location for physical interaction with customers. While you'll likely still need an office for your employees, not having a retail location can save you some regulatory hassle expense."
