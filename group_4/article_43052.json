I woke up with a severe headache, and my doctor asked me to come into his office right away. I’ve gone ahead and attached last night’s homework assignment to this email. Please let me know if I’ll miss any in-class or homework assignments today, so I can have them completed before I return. I expect to return to class tomorrow, but I will keep you updated if my condition worsens. Thank you, Alison Smith"

I will be flying out tomorrow morning and won’t be home until Saturday. Though the report is due on Thursday, can I request a few days' extension? Most of the research is complete, but due to the circumstances, I'd like to take this next weekend to finish it once I’m home. My apologies for missing these two classes. Sincerely, Janet R."

[7] X Research source For instance, if you know you have a doctor’s appointment on March 16th, email your teacher about your upcoming absence on March 8th.

Ask your doctor’s office for an absent note before leaving the office, even if you don’t think your instructor will ask for one. It’s always better to have it just to be safe."
