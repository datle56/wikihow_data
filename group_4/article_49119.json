      "title": "Consider your audience when asking questions.",
      "content": "Consider your audience when asking questions. Not every question will be appropriate or understandable in every context. Before you start playing Would You Rather, consider where you are and who you're playing with to make sure you don't ask any questions that might offend or confuse the other players, and if anyone feels uncomfortable answering a certain question, respect their choice and try a safer question. For instance, if you're playing with kids, many of the questions above might not be appropriate. Even if you're only playing with adults, if you're playing in the workplace, for instance, avoid questions that may come off unprofessional or overly explicit, like any sex-related questions. Consider also how well you know the people you're playing with before asking an intimate or saucy question."
