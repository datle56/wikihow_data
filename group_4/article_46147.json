Depending on your age, weight, and condition, you may need to take one or multiple tablets as part of this single dose. [4] X Research source Oral ivermectin typically comes in 3 mg tablets, so you may be prescribed 1-4 tablets for your single dose.

      "content": "Take the medication on empty stomach, 1 hour before breakfast. Ivermectin is absorbed more quickly and efficiently on an empty stomach, which is the case right after you wake up in the morning. For the best results, take the medicine first thing in the morning, then wait at least an hour before eating.

      "content": "Drink a full glass of water with your ivermectin dose. For safety when swallowing, and to help spur the absorption of the medication, it’s best to drink 8 fl oz (240 ml) of water when taking your dose of ivermectin. Pop the tablet in your mouth, take a big sip of water, swallow the tablet, and repeat the process if you’re taking additional tablets. Then finish off the glass of water.

      "content": "Watch for side effects and report them if they’re serious. Most people who take oral ivermectin experience only mild side effects, or none at all. The side effects are usually caused by the dying worms, rather than by the medication itself. [7] X Research source Possible side effects include headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, diarrhea, and swelling of the face or eyes. These typically occur within 1 day and last for no more than 1-2 days. If any of the above side effects are moderate or severe, or if you have any difficulty breathing or seeing, contact your doctor right away."

If you’re using oral ivermectin to kill worms, your doctor may also prescribe a corticosteroid to deal with inflammation that may be caused by the death of the worms. It’s very important that you follow your doctor’s instructions carefully when taking a corticosteroid, as they can cause significant side effects. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You may be prescribed corticosteroids for several days or a week, then have to taper off the medication with lower doses over several days.

Finish by washing your hands with soap and water again. You won’t need to use the ivermectin again, but you should repeat this combing process at least once per week for 3 weeks.
