      "content": "Use your fingers or the edge of a credit card to flick the stinger out. Flick the stinger sideways to ensure it doesn't break off in your skin. The stinger still has venom inside it—removing it as quickly as possible limits the amount of venom that enters your bloodstream. The less venom in your bloodstream, the milder your reaction will be. [1] X Research source Take care not to squeeze the stinger, which could release more venom and defeat the purpose of removing the stinger. If you don't see a stinger, all that means is that you were likely stung by a yellow jacket, a hornet, or a wasp rather than a honey bee. Only honey bees lose their stingers—the others remain intact."

      "content": "Washing the area cleans off any residual venom and bacteria. Any dirt or bacteria present around the sting could lead to infection, so it's important to make sure the area is clean before you attempt to treat it further. Cool water can also help ease the pain and inflammation from the sting. [2] X Research source If you're worried about a possible allergic reaction, mark the swollen area carefully with a pen after washing it so you can keep track of any spread."

      "content": "Oral antihistamines, such as Benadryl, relieve your whole system. Even if you've never had a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting, an oral antihistamine can help. By reducing your body's allergic reaction, you'll have less pain and itching to manage. [3] X Research source An oral antihistamine can also blunt what might've been a more serious reaction—but only if you take it as soon as possible after being stung."

      "title": "Elevating the affected area above the heart can reduce swelling.",
      "content": "Elevating the affected area above the heart can reduce swelling. Depending on the location of the sting, the amount of swelling might seem alarming. However, it's usually no cause for concern and will typically go away within a few hours. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if you get stung on your hand, your hand may swell to twice its normal size! While it might look bad, it's typically no cause for concern. Elevating your hand will help the swelling go down faster."

      "content": "Wrap an ice pack in a towel and place it directly on the sting. You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables. Just make sure you're not putting anything frozen directly on your skin. Leave the ice pack on for 10-15 minutes, then take it off. You can repeat this every couple of hours as needed if it gives you some relief. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If the swelling moves to other parts of your body, especially your face or neck, it could be a sign of an allergic reaction. Call emergency services or get yourself to an emergency room or urgent care clinic as quickly as possible."

      "content": "Hydrocortisone and antihistamine creams numb the skin and calm itching. Scratching a bee sting can make it worse by spreading the venom and potentially leading to infection. If you can resist the urge to scratch, applying a cool layer of Benadryl cream or calamine lotion will help. Most of these creams combine an antihistamine with a topical steroid to reduce the symptoms at the source.
