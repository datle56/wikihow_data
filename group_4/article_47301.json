      "title": "Wash your new towels before you use them.",
      "content": "Wash your new towels before you use them. New towels can have chemical finishes on them, and they may contain dust and bacteria from sitting on the shelf at the store. Thoroughly washing your new towels will get rid of these things so your towels are clean when you go to use them for the first time."

      "title": "Check the label on your new towels for washing guidelines.",
      "content": "Check the label on your new towels for washing guidelines. Look for the label along the edge of one of your new towels. Some towels must be washed in hot or cold water, or they can’t be machine dried. Follow the washing instructions on the label so you don’t damage your new towels."

      "title": "Separate your white and colored towels.",
      "content": "Separate your white and colored towels. The dyes in new towels transfer more easily in the wash, so your white towels could end up changing color if you wash them with colored towels. Do 2 separate loads so your new towels keep their color."

    {
      "title": "Wash your new towels in their own load.",
      "content": "Wash your new towels in their own load. Don’t add clothes or other laundry to the machine, especially for the first wash. The dyes from the new towels could discolor your other laundry, or dyes in your clothes could stain your white towels."

      "content": "Set the color in new colored towels with 1 cup (236.6 mL) of white vinegar. Pour the vinegar into the washing machine with the towels. Use half the amount of detergent you’d normally use. Then wash the towels in warm water (unless the label on the towels says not to). Wash your new towels like this for their first 2-3 washes.

      "title": "Machine dry your towels with a large piece of nylon netting to remove lint.",
      "content": "Machine dry your towels with a large piece of nylon netting to remove lint. As the dryer runs, the towels will hit against the nylon netting and the lint will fall off them. Look for a piece of nylon netting at your local fabric store. [2] X Research source Make sure the lint catcher in your dryer is cleaned out before you dry your new towels."

      "title": "Air-dry microfiber towels.",
      "content": "Air-dry microfiber towels. Hang them on a clothesline or drying rack so they fully dry and don't develop mildew. Avoid washing microfiber towels in the dryer or overtime they'll get damaged by the heat. [3] X Research source If you have no where to air-dry your microfiber towels, machine dry them on the lowest heat setting possible."

      "title": "Make sure your towels are fully dry before putting them away.",
      "content": "Make sure your towels are fully dry before putting them away. Slightly damp towels can develop mildew if they’re folded up or hung in a way that keeps them from drying. Check your new towels over when you take them out of the dryer to see if they’re completely dry. If they’re not, throw them back in the dryer or hang them up to air dry. [4] X Research source Be careful not to over-dry your towels. Over-drying can damage the fibers in towels."

      "content": "Avoid washing your new towels with fabric softeners and dryer sheets. Softeners and dryer sheets contain waxes and chemicals that can damage towels and make them less absorbent. It’s OK to use softeners and dryer sheets occasionally, but leave them out as much as possible. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash your new towels every few days.",
      "content": "Wash your new towels every few days. Don’t use your towels more than 3-4 times without washing them or they could develop a bad odor and bacteria. Washing your towels on a routine basis will keep them clean and fresh for longer. Schedule 2 days a week to wash your towels so it’s easy to remember."

      "title": "Clean your new towels with bleach if needed.",
      "content": "Clean your new towels with bleach if needed. Use color-safe bleach on your colored towels, and non-chlorine bleach on your white towels. Make sure you’re washing the towels on their own so the bleach doesn’t get on your other laundry. Bleach will help remove stains from your new towels and make your white towels look more vibrant.
