According to Ruiz, “If you choose a major that not only aligns with your professional and personal goals but also aligns with your talents and strengths, it will always be a more pleasant experience. It will always be something that's going to be more interesting to you as you're studying.” Whether you can still graduate on time or maintain any scholarships or financial aid with a different major depends on the specific program, degree, and school you attend. Chat with an advisor before making any speedy decisions. Not sure which major to pick? See what wikiHow users suggest on the \"Advice needed - what should I major in?\" forum page."

Ruiz agrees that you should reach out to a college career advisor if you're worried about what you’ll do after you graduate. “Students pay fees to support things like the career center and the career office. They should use them while they’re on campus because once they graduate, they may not be accessible anymore, depending on the university.” The earlier you can voice your concerns about your major or career prospects, the better. An advisor can help you identify jobs available to you with your major and experience or, if time allows, switch up some of your coursework to include a new concentration, minor, or even a new or additional major."

You can still study other subjects, even if you’re sticking with a major you’re not totally enthusiastic about. Look at your school’s course catalog and sign up for an elective that interests you if you have room in your schedule. It could be something niche or specific, like a photography class or a history seminar on a specific era, or even a broad gen ed class like philosophy. [1] X Research source Are you able to add a minor that’s more interesting to you, or even double major? Depending on your schedule and coursework, you may only need a handful of classes to supplement your major. Electives are a great way to expose yourself to new ideas, subjects, and people. You never know when something you learned in a random college class will come back to help you later in life or in your career!"

Research opportunities for internships, summer jobs, or part-time work outside your major to build up your resume and explore the field. Is it what you thought it would be? Do you find it more aligned with your passions and skills than your current major? College is a great time to dabble in multiple interests and learn more about what you really want out of your life and career.

What are the rest of the classes like? What jobs should you look at after graduation? What are the general career prospects? Most professors will be happy to chat with you and answer your questions the best they can! Talk to older students in your program, too. Find out why they chose this field and what they plan to do after graduation. If you see yourself in them, you may just be in the right major. Also check out campus events or clubs related to your major to see if you find them interesting or inspiring. Feel free to network within other majors, too. For example, if you regret not going to art school, chat with a professor in the art department to see what classes you could take or how you could gain work experience in the field with your current major."

Maybe the classes you’re in this term aren’t super interesting or you’re struggling with one specific course related to your major. These are definitely reasons to second guess yourself, but take a breath and think about your degree program as a whole. Are there more interesting classes you’ll take later? Do you enjoy most aspects of your major, even if it can be dry or difficult at times? Are you still passionate about what you’re studying? [2] X Research source If you think your doubt is just a bump in the road when you look at the bigger picture, then you might be fine to continue with your major. However, if you’re struggling to come up with meaningful reasons to keep going, it may be time to switch things up. Remember, there’s no right or wrong reason to stay in a major or leave it—it’s all about what feels correct to you! Even if you’re close to graduating and can’t switch majors, there’s plenty you can do to expand your knowledge and skills and find your dream career ."

The “major to career pipeline” isn’t totally straight or linear; lots of people end up having satisfying careers that have little or nothing to do with what they went to school for!

The soft skills you acquire in majors like the arts, humanities, or liberal arts make you a fantastic candidate for most jobs, even if you’re lacking certain hard skills (you can always take a class or get a certification to expand your skill set, and some employers offer on-the-job training as well). Some of these coveted soft skills include: [4] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source Strong written and oral communication skills. Interpersonal skills like teamwork, mediating conflict, or interviewing others. Critical thinking and problem-solving skills. A willingness to learn and grow in a new position or field.

There’s nothing that says you can’t have a day job related to your major and a side hustle or serious hobby that you love after work.

Your hobby might turn into a small side hustle, then a part-time job, and then maybe even your whole career!

[6] X Research source For example, you could take coding classes at your own pace for a lot less money than enrolling at a university if you wanted to shift into a computer science-related field.

      "content": "Consider pursuing a Master’s degree in a different field or subject. A Master’s may be a good call if you want to pivot careers entirely and need high-level training or education. Most programs are 2 years and are fairly intense, but the exact time and money requirements vary by program and school. Ruiz offers the following advice for submitting a strong grad school application if your work experience doesn’t line up with your intended new degree: “The most impressive applications are going to have a high GPA [and] a fair amount of activities that show leadership engagement on campus because you're trying to show your graduate campus that you can lead others and be engaged at their campus.” When it comes to essays, “[show] something different than the remainder of your application. If your resume is largely professional, then you may want to share some personal experiences or other pieces of yourself in your essays. So, that way, it's not necessarily repetitive.” Ask a professor you worked with for a recommendation if “they liked you and you did good work. Ask them for letters of recommendation if they've had good experiences with you.” Tip: When you’re applying to programs, look for professors who match your academic interest. However, Ruiz says it’s far more important to “understand the program and university before understanding the professors, as a professor might only teach one or two classes, but the university is going to be something that [you’re] there for anywhere between two to four years.”"

      "content": "Yes; 36% of Americans would change their field of study if they could. According to a Gallup poll, 51% of Americans who went to college would change their degree type, school or institution, and/or major if they could do it all over again. Out of everyone surveyed, 36% said they would change their field of study completely (this was the biggest reason participants would want to redo college) and 12% said they would get a different type of degree. 28% said they would go to a different school or institution, but were satisfied with their degree or field of study. [8] X Research source So, if you’re feeling frustrated with your major choice, know you’re not alone! A lot of people struggle with choosing the major or degree that’s ultimately right for them. Choosing a major is a big decision at a young age that can be influenced by your interests at the time, advice from peers, family, or counselors, finances, and/or the schools that are available to you and what they offer (or don’t).

In a survey by Dreambound, 56% of respondents said they would have chosen a different major simply because they were more interested in or passionate about other subjects. [9] X Research source The data implies that young people may be choosing a major without exploring other options they may be interested in, based on the salaries they hope to earn later, or due to outside pressure from family or peers to pick a specific field. While there are a lot of factors to consider when picking a major, the data shows that following your passion is a big part of having no regrets later on (even if you don’t ultimately end up working in that field)."

But when I started working, I realized how competitive it was and how hectic it is piecing together a living through freelancing, teaching, and other side work—not the lifestyle I envisioned. But, my music degree made me self-disciplined, analytical, detail-oriented, and able to “trust the process” when learning new things. All of these skills have been super valuable in every job I’ve ever had.” - staff writer Dan H. His advice: “Major in what you’re passionate about and give it your all, even if you’re not sure how a career in that field will shake out.
