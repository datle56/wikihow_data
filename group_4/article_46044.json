      "content": "Drink the powder with milk or water for a simple use. Mix 1 tablespoon (5 g) of the powder into a glass of about 1 cup (240 mL) of water or milk. The water or milk can be left cold or warmed up first if you prefer it that way. It’s a quick and easy way to get the possible benefits of fenugreek powder, including lowered appetite and blood sugar levels. You could also eat the powder plain, but putting it in a drink makes it more enjoyable.

      "content": "Combine the powder with coconut oil if you need a moisturizer. Pour up to ½ cup (80 g) of fenugreek powder into a mixing bowl. Stir in about 1 ⁄ 2 c (120 mL) of liquid coconut oil until it turns into a paste. You could also add essential oils, such as 6 drops of rosemary oil, or 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of aloe vera gel. Aloe vera gel and essential oils are often used to clean and protect skin. [6] X Research source Another option is to use lemon juice in place of the coconut oil or add amla juice to the mixture.

      "content": "Apply the paste to your skin using a cotton ball or your hand. Dab the wash or moisturizing mixture onto acne or other problematic areas first.

[7] X Research source The paste can also be applied to your scalp to condition your hair and encourages hair growth. Pastes with yogurt, lemon juice, or coconut oil work best since they are easier to spread."

      "content": "Wash the fenugreek mixture off after at least 20 minutes. If you have the time, wait 40 minutes or more to ensure the face wash or moisturizer has plenty of time to work. It can be a little messy, so you may want to cover your clothing up with a towel if the paste doesn’t adhere well to your skin. Then, rinse all of the paste off under warm water. [8] X Research source For the best result, reapply the fenugreek paste mixture 2 or 3 times a week. Space out the applications evenly throughout the week."

      "title": "Season vegetables by sprinkling them with fenugreek powder.",
      "content": "Season vegetables by sprinkling them with fenugreek powder. Toss vegetables with about 1 tablespoon (5 g) of the powder. Alternatively, mix the powder into a dressing to use on a salad. For example, combine 1 tablespoon (5 g) of fenugreek powder with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of lime juice and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil. You could also add honey and salt for additional flavoring. The powder can be added directly to vegetables or a dressing. It has a slightly sweet, nutty flavor similar to maple syrup. Honey and salt are good options for hiding the flavor if you don’t like it. Sprouted fenugreek seeds and leaves are more commonly used in salads. If you don’t have them, the powder is a fine substitute."

      "content": "Use the powder for flavoring if you’re making dessert. Rice pudding is one popular way to incorporate fenugreek powder into a dessert. Start by boiling about 1 cup (200 g) of basmati rice in 4 cups (950 mL) of milk. Then, add about 4 tablespoons (16.8 g) of sugar along with the powder and any other spices you plan on using. Let the rice simmer for about 20 minutes while stirring it to prevent it from burning. [11] X Research source For example, try mixing ¼ teaspoon (0.7 g) cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon (0.5 g) of cardamom, and ¼ teaspoon (1.3 g) of fenugreek powder. The powder could also be used to flavor cakes, cookies, and all sorts of other desserts. Some people don’t like the fenugreek flavoring in sweet food, but it often makes a dessert sweeter and more unique without having to rely on a ton of sugar. You can also incorporate powdered fenugreek in your pancakes and bread."
