      "title": "Check your email during working hours.",
      "content": "Check your email during working hours. Most people keep a smart phone on hand at all times to respond instantly to work- or school-related emails. If you can, limit yourself to checking and replying to emails during working hours (around 9am-5pm). Tell your boss and coworkers that if they contact you outside of those hours, they can expect you to reply the next morning. This also helps create boundaries between your work life and home life. If you absolutely need to check your email outside of working hours, use a laptop or desktop computer."

      "content": "Use a watch to tell time. It's simple but effective to invest in a wristwatch to tell time throughout the day. Using a watch means you won't have to look at your phone to check the time, which can lead to checking notifications or scrolling through time-sucking apps. [1] X Research source Look for a watch that also keeps track of the date to be able to check it without relying on your phone. Use an alarm clock to wake up on time rather than using your phone's alarm. Alternatively, find clocks while you are out and about. Many stores and banks display the time, date, and temperature. If all else fails, ask someone for the time or date if you really need to know."

      "content": "Look up directions ahead of time and write them down. If you're going somewhere new, use a computer to look up directions ahead of time. Either memorize the directions, if you can, or write them down, making note of any landmarks you need to look out for. If you get turned around, don't be afraid to ask someone for help to point you in the right direction. [2] X Research source For longer road trips, consider investing in a GPS if you are worried about getting lost."

      "content": "Check the weather before you go out rather than checking it on your phone. Watch the news or check the weather to see the forecast for the upcoming day or days rather than checking the weather on your phone. If there is a chance of rain or cold weather, make sure to layer up and bring an umbrella with you. [3] X Research source If the weather is unpredictable where you live, it's always a good idea to bring some light layers and an umbrella with you, regardless of what the forecast says."

      "content": "Make plans for meetings in advance. While it can be convenient to text someone and arrange plans within a matter of minutes, it also ties you to your phone. Instead, get in the habit of making plans at least a day or so in advance. Call up friends to invite them to meet up and make work-related meeting plans over email in advance. Then, you won't need to rely on texting or instant messaging in the moment. [4] X Research source Letting people know that you won't have a phone with you when you meet up can also prompt them to pay extra attention to where you are meeting and show up on time."

      "content": "Bring a camera with you if you want to take photos. One of the most convenient aspects of owning a smartphone is being able to have a high-quality camera on you at all times. However, if you want to depend less on your smartphone, consider investing in a digital camera instead. There are many small point-and-shoot digital cameras that are only slightly thicker than a smartphone. Or, you can go for a DSLR and invest some time and effort into improving your photography skills. [5] X Research source Ask yourself if you will really need a camera before leaving home. If you're going out for a meal or running to the store, you probably don't need to bring a camera with you."

If you're worried about being bored while you commute, wait in lines, or simply have a few minutes with nothing to do, start bringing a book with you. You'll always have something to do that never runs out of battery power. [6] X Research source You can also consider carrying a small sketchbook or journal and pencil, a crafty hobby such as knitting or crocheting, or you can try simply being in the moment without doing anything whenever you have a few minutes to spare."

If you simply don't want to be distracted by incoming messages, try using \"do not disturb\" mode. Start with a limited amount of time, like an hour, when you'll disconnect.
