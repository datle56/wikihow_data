If you have friction pegs (traditional wooden or bone tapered pegs), push carefully but firmly towards the crosspiece while turning, otherwise the peg will slip after you let it go. If you have trouble turning the peg and getting it to stay, google up \"peg dope\" for ideas of what materials to use to change the grip of your peg. [4] X Research source"

Since a lyre often plays in only one key at a time, consider tuning to \"Just Intonation\" based around the key note of your lyre. Several of the better smartphone tuners have an option to tune by JI (make sure to designate the keynote of your instrument around which all the tuning will be based). [6] X Research source"
