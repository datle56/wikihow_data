      "title": "Pull your shirt as far down as possible.",
      "content": "Pull your shirt as far down as possible. To start, put on your shirt and button it. Grab the shirttails and pull them down towards the floor. This gathers any extra material at the bottom of the shirt and brings the material tight over your chest for a professional look."

      "title": "Pull your trousers over your shirt.",
      "content": "Pull your trousers over your shirt. If you haven't already put on your pants, do so. Pull them up to your waist and push the bottom of your shirt inside them. Pull up the zipper and fasten the button. The bottom of your shirt should comfortably sit inside the waist of your pants. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Put on a belt.",
      "content": "Put on a belt. When you wear a tucked-in shirt, it’s almost always advised to wear a belt, even if you don’t need one to keep your trousers up. When you fasten the belt, line the buckle up so that it sits in the center of your waist, just above your zipper. [2] X Research source Wearing a belt helps keep your shirt tucked in and looks more professional."

    {
      "title": "Pull your shirt out a bit.",
      "content": "Pull your shirt out a bit. Grab the bottom edges of the sides of your shirt and give them a light tug to bring some slack back into the shirt. Don't pull too much; aim for only about an inch or so of material. Doing this gives your shirt just a little slack so that if you turn or bend, you won't pull your shirttails out of your pants. It can help to do this part in front of a mirror. If you accidentally pull a little too much material out of your pants, it may leave a \"poofie\" section of extra fabric at the bottom of your shirt that may not give you the look you want."

      "title": "Line up the buttons of your shirt with the fly of your pants.",
      "content": "Line up the buttons of your shirt with the fly of your pants. Finally, give yourself a quick once-over examination. For a good tuck, the line formed by the buttoned-up edge of your shirt should match up with the line of the fly on your pants. This is called the \"gig line,\" and, while it's not always something you'll want to spend the time and effort getting just right, it helps you achieve the most professional look possible. [3] X Research source Since your belt buckle should be in the center of your body, your gig line should intersect it or lie quite close to it."

      "title": "Tuck your shirt in as normal and unbutton your pants.",
      "content": "Tuck your shirt in as normal and unbutton your pants. The military tuck (named for its frequent use in the military) helps prevent the fabric of your shirt from bunching at the front and becoming loose. [4] X Research source To start, tuck in your shirt as you normally would, then unbutton your pants. You’ll be folding the fabric back in on itself, so you need a little slack in the pants to give you room to work."

      "title": "Gather the fabric at the sides of your shirt in your hands.",
      "content": "Gather the fabric at the sides of your shirt in your hands. Put your hands down at your sides and grab the shirt material that's closest to them. Pinch it between your index finger and thumb on each hand, then pull the material away from your body slightly until the shirt is tight across your chest. [5] X Research source Don't pull so hard that you pull your shirttails out of your pants. Your shirt should stay tucked into your pants through the whole process."

    {
      "title": "Fold the fabric back over itself.",
      "content": "Fold the fabric back over itself. Now, push forward with your thumbs as you pinch the edges of the shirt. The material should double up on itself, forming a new \"flap\" of material. Fold this flap back over the sides of your shirt. The material should now be tight and fitted all around.

If done correctly, your shirt should now have a tight, sleek appearance all around your midsection. Note that this tuck has a notorious reputation for coming undone, so you may want to practice the thumb motion used to make the tuck so that you can keep things nice and tight! [7] X Research source Some folks prefer keeping their pants buckled while doing the military tuck. If you do this, you won't have quite as much room to work, but you also won't need to deal with the hassle of keeping your shirt tight while you're fumbling with your pants."

      "title": "Half tuck",
      "content": "Half tuck As the name suggests, the half tuck involves tucking the front half of your shirt into your pants while the back hangs out loose. Loosely tuck the front of your shirt into your trousers as you normally would. Then, shrug your shoulders to loosen it up without untucking it altogether. Smooth out any creases and make sure the back of the shirt is hanging freely. [8] X Research source This look is also called the French tuck. Another version of the half tuck involves tucking in just one side of the front of your shirt. For example, the left side would be tucked in while the right would hang out freely. If you do choose to do the half tuck, know that it’s best for casual situations and probably isn’t appropriate to wear to formal or professional events. While the half tuck is meant to intentionally look disheveled, many people aren’t a fan and think it just looks like you’ve forgotten to tuck in your shirt. However, if you like the look, go for it! Don’t worry about what others think."

      "content": "Underwear tuck The underwear tuck is a great option if you’re also wearing an undershirt. First, tuck the excess fabric of your undershirt into your underwear. Then, put your shirt and trousers on and tuck your shirt as you normally would. This often pairs well with the military tuck. [9] X Research source Some people prefer to tuck their regular shirt into their underwear to prevent it from coming untucked, but if you twist or bend, it may cause your underwear to ride up where others could see it."

      "title": "Wrap tuck",
      "content": "Wrap tuck A wrap tuck is a stylish tucking option often preferred by women. Unbutton the bottom 2 or 3 buttons of your shirt so it’s easier to wrap each side around your body. Wrap the side with the buttons across your stomach and tuck it into your pants. Repeat the process with the other side. The finished look gives the shirt an angled appearance rather than having a straight line down your body, which adds dimension to your outfit. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Open front tuck The open front tuck is another stylish method for women. Put on your favorite undershirt, camisole, or bralette, and leave your shirt completely unbuttoned. Fold the shirt up underneath itself, then tuck it in all the way around. Make sure it meets at the middle of your waistband or belt buckle to achieve the desired look. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "In general, tuck in button-up dress shirts. Though there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to fashion, the vast majority of dress shirts are designed to be worn tucked-in. Because of this, you'll usually want to have your dress shirt tucked in with one of the methods above. [13] X Research source While there are plenty of casual situations where it's just fine to wear an untucked shirt , tucking is generally better for a more professional or formal appearance. It’s best to always tuck in dress shirts that hang past your hips. In these cases, the extra material can make your shirt look a bit like a flowing nightgown or even a dress, which will rarely be the sort of impression you'll want to make."

      "title": "In general, leave polos and tees untucked.",
      "content": "In general, leave polos and tees untucked. Just as most dress shirts are made to be worn tucked, most polos and tees are meant to be worn untucked . When properly-fitted, these sorts of shirts should hang right up against your belt or the waist of your pants. Look at the way the bottom of a polo or tee differs from the bottom of a dress shirt—most will have a flat bottom edge, rather than long shirttails in the front and back. [14] X Research source The exception here is when you have to wear an exceptionally long tee or polo. In these cases, tucking the extra material in usually makes you look a little better. You can tuck in normal-length polos and tees as well, but this can sometimes give them an overly-tight appearance. One good way to tell if you should tuck in a shirt is to look at the hem. In general, tuck in the hem if it’s curved, like on most dress shirts. T-shirts and polos typically have a straight hem (meaning it goes straight across your body), and those hems aren’t usually tucked."

Some of these situations are unique to certain jobs that demand formal behavior, but some, like job interviews, are things that almost everyone will encounter. Below are just a few examples of when you may need to tuck in your shirt: [16] X Research source Job interviews Meetings with new or important clients Meeting with strangers Serious work events (layoffs, new hires, etc.) Note that for many jobs, normal working days require tucked-in shirts or even suits."

In these cases, an untucked shirt may not be seen as disrespectful, but may not be the best for first impressions. In these situations, you may want to look as nice as possible either to make yourself attractive or to show that you're taking things seriously. Here are just a few ideas for when you may want to keep your shirt tucked in: Visits to fancy night clubs or restaurants First dates \"Serious\" parties, especially when you don't know many people attending Art exhibitions and sit-down concerts"

For instance, if you're staying in for the night, heading to a close friend's house, or just dining at a casual restaurant, there's no need to tuck in your shirt. Casual hangouts and other events where you won't be judged on the way you look have no need for tucked-in shirts. Unless you just want to look classy 24/7, you can usually skip them.

      "content": "Use dress shirt stays. Shirt stays , sometimes known as shirttail garters, are elastic straps that connect the bottom of a dress shirt to your socks or feet. Follow the instructions on the package to clip the stays to your shirt; using shirt stays is one of the most reliable ways to ensure your shirt won’t come untucked. [18] X Research source There are also magnetic shirt stays and shirt stay belts if you want something a little less complicated. These may not work as well, however. There are many different stay designs. Image consultant Shelley Golden describes one as “a type of brace that clips onto your shirt and hugs below your knee. It's almost like an elastic band that holds your shirt in. You could also tuck it on the side and tuck it into your underwear.”"

      "content": "Try rubber grip tape. Many tailors use rubber grip tape to help keep shirts in place. These are thin, sticky strips of rubber that can be attached to the inside of your trousers’ waistband to prevent your shirt from coming untucked. [19] X Research source When purchasing grip tape, be careful not to buy the type that’s used for skateboards, as this can rub against your skin and create holes in your shirt."

      "content": "Make use of the extra buttons inside your trousers. The buttons hidden on the inside of some trousers aren’t just for decoration. Use these buttons to keep your shirt tucked by hooking the material around and behind them. Not all pants have these buttons, however, so if yours don’t, you’ll need to use another method."

      "content": "Choose a shirt that isn’t too big or too small. If your shirt is too big or too small, it likely won’t tuck properly and may leave you with an awkward silhouette. A shirt that’s too big will pull out of the sides of your pants when you tuck it in, while a too-small shirt will come untucked because the hem is too short. Be sure to choose a dress shirt that’s the correct size and fits you comfortably. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "Don’t tuck in your shirt without a belt.",
      "content": "Don’t tuck in your shirt without a belt. It’s best to wear a belt when you wear a tucked-in shirt, even if you don't need it to keep your pants up. Dress shirts are generally meant to be worn with belts and look most professional when paired with them. Leaving a belt off can make the waistline look somewhat naked and exposed, especially when you're wearing a shirt that contrasts greatly with the color of your pants. [21] X Research source If you really hate wearing a belt, there are alternatives. For instance, suspenders and side-tabs accomplish the same purpose of keeping your pants up."

      "content": "Don’t untuck after having your shirt tucked in. Once you make the decision to tuck your shirt in, don't turn back! Tucking your shirt in ruffles the material at the bottom of the shirt as it's stuffed into your trousers. When you're wearing the shirt tucked-in, this is impossible to see because your trousers are in the way. However, as soon as you un-tuck your shirt, these wrinkles become visible. These can be quite visually unappealing, especially on light-colored shirts, so keep your shirt tucked in."
