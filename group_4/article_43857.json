      "title": "Hold the javelin up and behind your head.",
      "content": "Hold the javelin up and behind your head. Before you begin running, lift the javelin above your shoulder so that the javelin is parallel to the ground, and about level, or a bit higher, with your brow. Make sure your bicep is also parallel to the ground and your elbow is slightly bent as you extend your throwing arm behind you. [1] X Research source Hold your opposite arm extended and up in front of you to counterbalance you. Turn your palm toward the sky, creating a natural platform for the javelin to rest on. Read about different grips if you aren’t sure how to hold the javelin."

      "title": "Run for about 10 steps while holding the javelin in position.",
      "content": "Run for about 10 steps while holding the javelin in position. After you have the javelin in position, start the “approach.” Begin running towards your target with the javelin. [2] X Research source If you are a beginner, take about 9-14 steps, allowing more time for the next “phase” of the approach, which we’ll explain in a moment. More experienced throwers often take more steps, though. As you take your approach run, make sure that you: Keep your hips high and run on the balls of your feet. Let your free arm swing across your body. Flex the arm carrying the javelin to fix its position, keeping it level with your head."

    {
      "title": "Withdraw the javelin further behind you as you run.",
      "content": "Withdraw the javelin further behind you as you run. The withdrawal phase is when you get your body into the proper throwing position. Speed up as you run, and as the foot opposite your throwing arm hits the ground, pull the javelin back, extending your arm behind you and priming your throw. [3] X Research source Keep your head facing in the direction of your target. Turn so that the left side of your body is facing your target as well."

    {
      "title": "Run in “crossovers” to build speed.",
      "content": "Run in “crossovers” to build speed. Now that you’ve withdrawn the javelin, it’s time to tweak your stride so that you can have max speed while still being prepared to throw. This stride is known as a “crossover.” To do crossovers, run in a strafing motion so that your body is angled toward your target. Your front foot pulls you forward, then your back foot pushes you forward. [4] X Research source Keep your center of gravity on your back leg as you run, angling your body slightly back, as well. As your front foot finishes its stride, your back foot “crosses over” in front of it, giving the stride its name. Keep your back foot close to the ground, while your front foot lifts higher."

    {
      "title": "Take your final stride as you approach the line.",
      "content": "Take your final stride as you approach the line. This is the “pre-delivery stride,” or impulse step, and is the step you take just before you throw the javelin. On your final crossover, make sure your shoulders are parallel with the javelin, and swing your front arm in front of your body, ready to swing it back as you throw. Land on your back leg, and spring your body forward, stabilizing yourself as your front leg makes contact with the ground. [5] X Research source Wait for your left foot to touch the ground before you initiate the throw. Straighten your torso as your left foot touches the ground, swiveling your body at the hips. Keep your throwing hand above shoulder level."

      "title": "Throw the javelin, releasing when your hand is far from your shoulder.",
      "content": "Throw the javelin, releasing when your hand is far from your shoulder. Now, it’s all about following through with the momentum you’ve built! Throw your front arm back across your body to initiate the swivel, and use that swivel momentum to propel your throwing arm forward and up over your head, leading with the elbow. At the moment where your hand is as far from your shoulder as possible, at its peak, release your grip. [6] X Research source Many experts recommend 33 degrees as the optimum angle at which to throw and release the javelin. Aim to have your throwing arm over your head, in front of you, and not behind your back, when you release the javelin. Remember, you must release the javelin before you cross over the foul line.

      "title": "Follow through into the recovery position to avoid injury.",
      "content": "Follow through into the recovery position to avoid injury. You’ve built up a lot of momentum, and now you need to release it without hurting yourself. Let that momentum take control, and simply guide your throwing arm diagonally and down across your body. Your back leg comes forward to catch you so that you’re now facing the opposite direction as when you started. Take a couple more strides if you need to as you come to a stop. [8] X Research source Pro throwers sometimes even fall forward due to the extreme momentum they build up from throwing the javelin and following through, but the goal is always to stay on your feet."

      "title": "American grip",
      "content": "American grip This is an ideal grip for beginners since it’s natural and easy to understand. Rest your index finger on the back of the whipcord grip, wrapping around the javelin. Rest your thumb parallel to the javelin along the grip, pointing backward. Then, wrap your other three fingers around the grip, holding it firmly but not tightly. [9] X Research source With this grip, your index finger transfers most of the energy from your body to the javelin, “pushing” the javelin forward through the whipcord grip. No matter your grip style, you must hold the javelin by the whipcord grip, and nowhere else along the javelin. Your fingers can touch the javelin itself, but your hand must be in contact with the grip."

      "content": "Finnish grip Grasp the javelin by the back end of the grip, with your index finger resting off the grip and pointing behind you, more or less parallel to the javelin. Rest your thumb on the back edge of the grip, and wrap your other 3 fingers around it so that your middle finger rests along the back edge of the grip. [10] X Research source With this grip, your index finger stabilizes the javelin, while the rest of your fingers transfer the force from your body."

      "title": "V grip",
      "content": "V grip Rest the grip of the javelin in your palm. Position your index and middle finger on either side of the javelin, straddling the back edge of the grip and forming the signature “V.” Further down, wrap the rest of your fingers around the grip of the javelin, squeezing it into your palm firmly, but not tightly. [11] X Research source This grip channels the power through your index and middle finger, “pushing” the javelin forward, almost like throwing a baseball."

      "content": "Hold the javelin above your shoulder, with your grip behind you. Lift the javelin above your shoulder so that the javelin is parallel to the ground, and about level, or a bit higher, than your eyes. Keep your bicep parallel to the ground and your elbow slightly bent as you extend your throwing arm behind you. [12] X Research source Hold your opposite arm relaxed and extended and up in front of you to balance you."

      "title": "Lean onto your back foot and extend the javelin behind you.",
      "content": "Lean onto your back foot and extend the javelin behind you. Some throwers perform a small step in place with their back foot to “prime” themselves. Bend your back knee so that your body leans back, keeping the javelin parallel with your brow. Position your back foot at about a 45-degree angle from your target. [13] X Research source As you do, extend your arm behind you while keeping your elbow raised, priming the throw."

      "title": "Step forward and swivel your hips to face the target.",
      "content": "Step forward and swivel your hips to face the target. Now, take a step with your front foot, then swivel your hip to face your target. [14] X Research source As your hip swivels, your back foot also turns to face the target. This swivel motion initiates the momentum that fires the javelin. It’s a quick motion—think of it as “popping” or “firing” your hip, but don’t overdo it!"

      "title": "Rotate your torso and throw the javelin up and over your head.",
      "content": "Rotate your torso and throw the javelin up and over your head. Let your shoulders follow your hip, rotating your torso to face your target. As you do, bring the javelin up over your head, propelling it up and forward. Aim to get your elbow up and over your ear, then release the javelin when your hand is as far from your shoulder as possible at the end of the throw. [15] X Research source Follow-through, stepping forward with your back foot and letting your throwing arm come down across your body. Standing throws are excellent practice for running throws."
