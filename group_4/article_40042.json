      "title": "A Soft Dramatic body type has an hourglass figure with long, angular bones.",
      "content": "A Soft Dramatic body type has an hourglass figure with long, angular bones. Soft Dramatic is one of the 13 Kibbe body types developed in David Kibbe’s Metamorphosis: Discover Your Image Identity . Each body type in the Kibbe system falls on a spectrum of yin to yang—with yin being more soft and feminine and yang being more sharp and angular. The Soft Dramatic is a yang-dominant body type with yin elements. [1] X Research source The bone structure of a Soft Dramatic is long and angular, but the shape and amount of body flesh softens the overall shape to give it that yin quality—which is what distinguishes the Soft Dramatic from the Pure Dramatic. An extremely slim Soft Dramatic individual will lose some of their softness and become more yang. Conversely, any weight added to a Soft Dramatic body will typically be concentrated in the bust, hips, waist, upper arms, upper thighs, and face. Regardless of weight fluctuation, a true Soft Dramatic does not have short limbs, a small stature, a boyish figure, or delicate facial features."

      "content": "Soft Dramatics have a wide and long bone structure. They are usually taller than 5ft 5in (165cm), but not always. [2] X Research source Their long vertical line often makes them look taller than they actually are. Soft Dramatics also have long and full arms and legs. Their hands and feet can be narrow or wide, but they’re most frequently described in terms of their lengthiness. [3] X Research source The shoulders of a Soft Dramatic are straight and equal to the width of the hips, while the waist is defined but moderate in width compared to the rest of the body. These even proportions between the hips, waist, and shoulders are what give the Soft Dramatic their hourglass body shape."

      "title": "Soft Dramatics have full and rounded hips and bustlines.",
      "content": "Soft Dramatics have full and rounded hips and bustlines. A Soft Dramatic will often have a large and full chest with equally rounded hips. They are moderately fleshy on their upper arms and thighs, but they carry most of their flesh around their hips and bust. [4] X Research source If extremely slim, however, the Soft Dramatic may lose some of this flesh and appear more similar to the Pure Dramatic type."

      "title": "Soft Dramatics have soft, full, and prominent facial features.",
      "content": "Soft Dramatics have soft, full, and prominent facial features. Most often, these include large eyes, full lips, and fleshy cheeks—all of which contribute to the yin aspect of the Soft Dramatic body type. [5] X Research source Their eyes may be straight or almond-shaped and can be averagely-spaced or wide-set, but they’ll almost always be large and dominant on the face. A Soft Dramatic has wide and clearly defined cheekbones with a similarly defined jaw. Their chin may be prominent and is often square-shaped. The Soft Dramatic nose is also long and defined but lacks the sharpness of the dramatic type. Their nose may also be slightly wide."

      "content": "Soft Dramatics often have a Deep Winter or Deep Autumn coloring. A Soft Dramatic will usually have a distinct coloring with a rich or vivid contrast between their features. For this reason, they often fall into the Deep Winter or Deep Autumn seasons, but they can really belong to any seasonal color palette. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Silhouettes",
      "content": "Silhouettes Aim for a “T” silhouette in the majority of your outfits—picture a broad shoulder line with a long, narrow fit throughout the length of the body. Choose bold and geometric silhouettes that draw out your long vertical line but soften them with draped, flowing fabrics. [7] X Research source Avoid wide, oversized silhouettes that make you appear boxy or take away from your natural shape."

    {
      "title": "Necklines",
      "content": "Necklines Choose necklines that add a bit of sharpness or drama, such as plunging V-necks, square necklines, and large cowls. Necklines with flamboyant details (like ruffles or sequins) also work well. [8] X Research source When you do wear a higher neckline like a crew neck or turtleneck, make sure the garment is made with a lightweight, soft fabric that hugs your frame."

      "title": "Jackets & Outerwear",
      "content": "Jackets & Outerwear Choose coats and jackets that are soft and flexible enough to hug your body. Select outerwear pieces with clean lines that end at mid-thigh—the combination of which will lengthen your height. Add softness with wide collars, but keep the waist definition with design details like a simple belt or tie. [9] X Research source The best jackets and coats for Soft Dramatics include wrap jackets, waterfall collars, shawl collars, and fur-trimmed collars. These options combine softness and waist definition while also adding drama to your shoulders and overall silhouette. [10] X Research source You can make a jacket with a straight silhouette work as long as the fabric is soft enough to still reveal your natural shape. Since your options for outerwear are relatively basic, add drama with accessories (e.g., brooches and pins) or colored fabrics."

      "title": "Skirts",
      "content": "Skirts Embrace your vertical line with long skirts made out of soft materials with a straight but flowy silhouette. While maxi skirts are your best bet, knee-length skirts may work if they balance out the overall verticality of your outfit. In both midi and maxi lengths, opt for skirt styles like wrap skirts, slip skirts, and bias-cut skirts with vertical or diagonal details. [11] X Research source Avoid mini-skirts as they may shorten your vertical line. Avoid large, full skirts and A-line silhouettes unless you balance them out with a top that preserves the “T” silhouette. Avoid tightly-fitting or overly-feminine skirts. These styles may make you look overly delicate or add too much fuss to your look."

      "title": "Dresses",
      "content": "Dresses Accentuate your ideal “T” silhouette with dresses that are broad in the shoulder and slimming at the waist. Your perfect dress will have a long silhouette in a soft fabric that drapes and flows along your body. Look for dresses with sharp details like V-necks and slits to lengthen your vertical line. Dropped waist dresses work well on you, as well as dresses with larger patterns proportionate to your height and limbs. Oversized or ornately detailed dresses can work as long as the entire dress is visually balanced and adheres to the “T” silhouette. If you want to embellish your dress or draw the eye to certain areas, try shirring, ruffles, gemstones, and embroidery."

[12] X Research source When choosing jeans, look for pairs that hug your hips and thighs with a straight or flared leg. [13] X Research source Avoid stiffly tailored pants with too many structural elements or sharp lines. [14] X Research source Conversely, avoid baggy pants that hide your natural shape. Stay away from tight and restrictive silhouettes for the most part, although skinny jeans may work if paired with a same-colored knee-high bot."

      "content": "Tops, shirts, & sweaters Choose tops and shirts that embrace your subtle elegance with soft edges and draped lines. Opt for soft fabrics, satiny textures, and draped materials—although soft cotton works well for more casual tops. Try a cotton top in a wrap-silhouette that hugs your natural waist and bust line. When it comes to sweaters, go for anything with broad shoulders and an elongated neckline. For example, you may choose knits with draped necklines and flowing silhouettes while staying away from chunky knits or knits that feel overly delicate. Add in soft details like wide collars, large bows, side knots, and ties—the oversized look of these design features adds some flair without any fussiness. [15] X Research source Avoid tops that add any excess bulk to your lines. For example, stay away from poofy blouses, wide shapes, and unconstructed silhouettes. [16] X Research source"

The length of the gown will emphasize your long vertical line, while its silhouette will hug your hips and natural hourglass shape. [17] X Research source Opt for draped dresses and dropped-waist dresses, especially if they have a wide V-neckline or some type of broad shoulder. A body con or clingy dress may work as long as it doesn’t detract from the sophistication of your overall look. You can also incorporate slits and other vertical details to accentuate your length and height."

Choose garments that have a soft and round feeling to them and are able to hug your natural silhouette. Some of the best fabrics for your Soft Dramatic body type include drapey jerseys, silks, crepes, and soft cottons. These fabrics provide softness as well as a subtle and sensual elegance. [18] X Research source Choose medium-weight fabrics only if they’re able to conform to the shape of your body. Avoid heavy-weight fabrics, particularly if they’re especially stiff, rough, or unbending. When you do need a thicker fabric, try something soft and plush with a deep pile."

Try mixing dark bases with brighter hues to create a polished color palette, or add a little bit of glamor with shiny or metallic prints. When wearing a lighter color like a pastel tint, balance out the paler shade with a bold silhouette or a fully monochromatic look. Avoid any neon hues, multi-color shades, or watercolor blends. Avoid patterns that are too symmetrical, delicate, or cutesy. Instead, choose patterns with animal print, bold geometric or abstract shapes, and oversized florals. You can further personalize your wardrobe and discover the best colors and patterns for you by finding your seasonal color palette ."

For a more casual shoe, try a pointy-toed mule or a narrow-toed boot. [19] X Research source While many bold colors can work for your shoe choice, nudes will enhance the Soft Dramatic color palette and further elongate your shape. Avoid chunky shoe styles, as they will shorten your vertical line and add visual weight to the bottom of your look. Likewise, stay away from any delicate or frilly styles that take away from your natural sophistication and elegance."

Follow these style tips for each type of accessory: [20] X Research source Bags and purses: Soft-shaped and oversized bags with ornate details, clean leather textures, and unique handles. Avoid tiny or fussy bags, except a streamlined clutch for formal events. Hats: Glamorous and dramatic hats that are oversized or round with ornate details. Belts: Bold, wide belts with ornate buckles and interesting details. Jewelry: Sparkly, shiny, and bold statement pieces with colorful gems or intricate designs.

[22] X Research source Avoid any blunt or overly-layered cuts, such as a bob or wolf cut. Similarly, avoid any sharply geometric or asymmetrical styles, including straight bangs and side bangs. If you dye your hair, choose rich and bold colors like a strong red, bright platinum, or rich brunette or black.

[24] X Research source For a formal look, try liquid eyeliner, bold brows, and bright-colored lips. [25] X Research source For a more casual daytime look, choose one facial feature to emphasize—if you do a strong brow , for instance, pair it with light mascara and a neutral lip color. Opt for bold and strong lines that emphasize your full lips and large eyes. You can likely pull off bolder styles that make softer faces and body types look overdone or artificial. Dark lip colors, dramatic cat-eyes, and lengthy false eyelashes look tasteful and natural on you."
