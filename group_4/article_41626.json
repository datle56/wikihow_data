      "content": "Remove the toppings and put them in a separate container. If you can, scoop the toppings off the bowl and transfer them to an airtight container. You can put the container in the fridge, or you can leave it out at room temperature if it’s just nuts or seeds. [1] X Research source If you mixed your toppings in with the smoothie, don’t worry about scooping them out. Toppings left on top of the smoothie can get soggy when you store them."

      "title": "Pour the smoothie into an airtight container.",
      "content": "Pour the smoothie into an airtight container. Carefully scrape your smoothie base into a plastic or glass container. Seal the container with a lid so that it’s airtight. [2] X Research source Glass jars usually seal better than plastic containers, so you should use those, if you have them."

      "title": "Store the smoothie portion in the freezer.",
      "content": "Store the smoothie portion in the freezer. Put your airtight container into the freezer on the bottom shelf to keep the smoothie portion cold enough. Smoothie bowls have a tendency to get watery in the fridge, which is why they need to go in the freezer. [3] X Research source Eat your smoothie bowl within 1 day for the best flavor and texture."

    {
      "title": "Thaw your smoothie at room temperature for about 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Thaw your smoothie at room temperature for about 10 minutes. When you want to eat your smoothie bowl again, take it out of the freezer and set it on the counter. Let it warm up for about 10 minutes so that it isn’t too hard to eat. [4] X Research source It doesn’t need to get warm, but it should be easy to eat with a spoon."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir the smoothie to mix the liquids together.",
      "content": "Stir the smoothie to mix the liquids together. Take the lid off your container and pour your smoothie into a bowl. Use a spoon to recombine the ingredients and get the consistency right. [5] X Research source If your smoothie bowl is too watery, put it in the blender and add some plain yogurt or avocado. If your smoothie bowl is too thick, blend in some ice or fruit juice to water it down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add your toppings and enjoy your smoothie bowl.",
      "content": "Add your toppings and enjoy your smoothie bowl. Grab your toppings out of the fridge or add some fresh ones to top off your smoothie bowl. Eat your smoothie bowl before it warms up all the way to avoid making it watery or soupy. [6] X Research source Smoothie bowls only freeze well once, so if you don’t finish your smoothie bowl this time, you should probably throw it away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pack the toppings in an airtight container.",
      "content": "Pack the toppings in an airtight container. You can put your nuts, seeds, cut fruit, and drizzles into separate airtight containers the night before. That way, you can grab them without needing to cut anything up, and they won’t get soggy from sitting on top of a smoothie all night. [7] X Research source If you’re only adding nuts or seeds, you don’t have to worry about packing them up. However, if you want to add chopped fruit or a drizzled topping, prepare them ahead of time so you don’t have to rush around in the morning."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blend the frozen ingredients.",
      "content": "Blend the frozen ingredients. For your smoothie base, try to stick with frozen fruit, then add your liquids. Use a blender made specifically for blending smoothies, like a Nutribullet or a Vitamix, for the best consistency. [8] X Research source Smoothie bowls are slightly thicker than regular smoothies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour the smoothie into a thermos.",
      "content": "Pour the smoothie into a thermos. Once your ingredients are blended enough, carefully pour them into a large thermos that has a lid. Fill up the thermos about 3/4 of the way full to leave room for the toppings. Seal the lid so that it’s airtight to keep your ingredients cold. [9] X Research source Make sure your thermos is insulated enough to keep your smoothie cold."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store the thermos in the fridge overnight.",
      "content": "Store the thermos in the fridge overnight. Before you go to bed, pop your thermos into the fridge to keep it cold. The dual insulation from the fridge and the thermos will keep the smoothie from melting, and it will already be in a to-go container. [10] X Research source You can find cheap thermoses online or at most home goods stores."

    {
      "title": "Add your toppings in the morning before you leave.",
      "content": "Add your toppings in the morning before you leave. On your way to work, school, or errands, grab your smoothie out of the fridge. Drop your toppings into the thermos and grab a spoon to take with you to enjoy your bowl! [11] X Research source If you realize you have a little more time, you can always pour your smoothie base into a bowl and then add toppings. Otherwise, keeping it contained will let you take it with you wherever you go. If your smoothie base has separated at all, give it a quick stir with your spoon before you dig in. Since your smoothie is in a thermos, it should stay cold for about 6 hours. Try to eat it within that time frame for the best smoothie bowl experience."
