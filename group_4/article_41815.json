      "content": "Firmly press the edge of the blade (not the point) into the cable at a right angle (perpendicular to the cable) about an inch from the end. The object of this cut is to cut through the outer jacket, layers of foil and / or braids and finally the dielectric foam (usually white in color) that surrounds the center conductor. There will be some opposition to the blade as it sinks deeper into the cable. When the blade approaches the halfway point through the cable, ease up on the pressure of the blade. This will occur when the blade has reached the center conductor of the cable, which is at the halfway point through the cable. It is very important to not damage this center conductor by nicking it with the blade."

      "content": "Hold the razor as before, aligning the blade on the jacket about 5 ⁄ 16 inch (0.8 cm) back from the cut made in the previous step. The purpose of this cut is to penetrate the jacket only, and leave the braid intact. The cut will be perpendicular to the cable like the first cut. Many \"F\" connectors specify that the braid not be removed, while others prefer it removed. Plan to leave it in place for now, as it can be removed later, if needed. The braids are woven around the length of the dielectric foam, and lie just beneath the outer jacket. The individual wires that make up the braid are thinner than a hair, and are easily cut. Gently press the blade into the jacket and run it around the cable, in the same manner as was done in the first cut to the center conductor. Once the blade has cut around the circumference of the jacket, press the tip of the blade against the jacket at this cut and gently cut towards the end of the cable. Again, try not to cut the braid."
