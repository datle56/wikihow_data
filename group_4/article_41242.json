Stop whatever you’re doing and tune into what you’re feeling in your body and mind. Note what type of thought you’re having, then decide objectively if it’s a fact or pseudofact—in other words, is it a truth that you know about your partner, or is it an opinion, judgment, assumption, or expectation? [2] X Research source For example, if you haven’t heard from your significant other for hours, you might think they’re cheating. But, if you know they had a busy day at work, realize that they might’ve gone home to nap. Consider what evidence you have for these thoughts to be facts. Instead of allowing yourself to think of the worst-case scenario, consider the most realistic explanation instead. The vast majority of the time, your worries and concerns will lack concrete evidence, so reframing them in this way and refusing to accept them at face value will help to reduce negative thinking. If you do have evidence for these thoughts, address them directly with your partner !"

Just identify what it is that set you off and what about the situation is making you feel anxious. Remember that you’ll never be able to address your concerns and curb your overthinking without knowing what’s causing you to feel that way. It may help to write down your concerns whenever you notice yourself feeling worried, anxious, or distrustful toward your partner.

While it’s important not to avoid your negative thoughts in order to get to the root of them, it’s okay to distract yourself if you’ve already reflected on your thoughts but still feel anxious or upset. Improve your mood by finding some funny videos to watch online, or do something fun or productive like blasting music, having a mini dance party, taking a walk, or having a hot shower. [4] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source You could also call someone in your support network to distract you and/or talk you off the ledge. Call your mom just to check in, or phone up a friend to talk through your feelings and get their perspective on whether it’s realistic or rational. However, you may want to avoid calling friends who are fellow overthinkers! Remember that distraction is okay to use temporarily, but you should ultimately address the underlying worry causing your thoughts and feelings. If these issues are not addressed, it can cause you and your partner to become irritated with each other, and the lack of trust may continue to build as a result."

You can also use an app like Headspace or Calm to guide you if you’re a newcomer to meditating and mindfulness. [5] X Research source Keep a daily journal of your thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Looking back, you’ll be able to see the overall picture of your overthinking and piece together how you can make lasting changes in your life and relationship.

Your overthinking might come from a self-esteem issue where you worry that you don’t measure up or that your partner deserves better. One way to combat these thoughts is to repeat positive mantras to yourself each morning (or whenever you’re feeling down). For instance, you might say, “I’m beautiful. I’m intelligent. I’m worthy of love.” [8] X Research source It’s difficult to have a healthy mind if your physical health is in disarray. Try to get at least seven hours of sleep a night, exercise three times a week, and eat a healthy diet . Try to get your heart rate up for at least thirty minutes per day. You could try yoga, dance classes, jogging, strength training, or whatever movement feels best for you and your body. Be sure to also make time for yourself apart from your partner. Though spending time together is good, your relationship with yourself is critical. Take at least one day a week to do something that’s just for you. Remember that you’re not just a person in a relationship; you have a whole identity apart from that. By focusing on yourself and your own sense of identity and self-worth, you’ll be better able to reflect on and identify the past experiences and insecurities that have helped your anxious overthinking to thrive.

What would you like from me?” They might ask for a bit of space from you, and that’s okay! Give it to them and allow them time to miss you.

If you’re not sure whether or not you’re overthinking (or if you haven’t identified as an overthinker in the past), then it’s important to recognize the signs that you’re engaging in these thought patterns. You may find that your overthinking is coming from past traumas or an anxious attachment style, or you may realize that your overthinking is stemming from real problems in your current relationship. Here are some signs to look for that indicate anxious overthinking: [20] X Research source You constantly analyze what your partner says and does. You may seek out hidden meanings or negative implications in something that they’ve said, which is likely to lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. You dwell on past issues or conflicts. If you’re also bringing up old hurts and fights that have occurred in the relationship, it may prevent the two of you from healing your issues and create more resentment. You might also create a situation where your past issues overshadow your present dynamic—which may be great as is! You imagine worst-case scenarios for the future of your relationship. If you find yourself excessively worrying about the future of your relationship and imagining situations like infidelity or heartbreak, then these anxieties can emotionally drain both you and your partner. You constantly seek reassurance from your partner . Are you always asking your partner to repeatedly express their love and commitment to you, even when you know objectively that they already have? If you constantly need to hear “I love you,” you’re likely an over-thinker and may struggle with deep-rooted insecurities. You struggle to enjoy the present moment due to negative thoughts.
