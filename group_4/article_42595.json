      "content": "Put on loose, easy-to-remove clothes over sexy lingerie. Let’s be real: you can perform a great striptease in the spur of the moment wearing a ratty old T-shirt and granny bloomers, but if you want to make things a little more special, or if you’re nervous, plan your outfit ahead of time. Consider lacy or semi-transparent undergarments, stockings with garters, and a couple layers of sexy, easy-to-remove clothing over top, such as a trench coat or jacket over a dress or skirt. [1] X Research source If you’re feeling bold, you can wear the trench coat over nothing at all! Just remember that the more clothes you wear, the longer it will take you to strip—and the more anticipation you’ll be able to build."

      "title": "Set the mood with music and lighting.",
      "content": "Set the mood with music and lighting. Good music and lighting can make your striptease all the sexier. Opt for chill, mid-tempo background music and dim, romantic lighting—candles provide a great atmosphere! In general, a strip tease will last for a few minutes to 10 minutes, so curate a playlist of 3 or more songs to be safe. You can also use furniture as props in your striptease: consider placing one chair for your partner to sit in, and one for yourself to use during the performance."

      "content": "Seductively take off your coat or jacket. Stand directly in front of your partner while you remove your top layer. Maintain eye contact as you deliberately undo the buttons or zipper one by one. If you have long hair, shake your head and let your hair flow out as you strip. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Walk around playfully for a couple minutes.",
      "content": "Walk around playfully for a couple minutes. Don't be in a rush to get naked; the \"tease\" part of a striptease will get your partner excited. Tell your partner to stay seated on the chair, and walk around the chair showing off your body from the front, back, and sides. Tug at the straps on your dress or bra, or the buttons on your shirt, as though you are about to take them off any second. If you're wearing a low-cut shirt, bend forward over your partner briefly. Sit on a chair and slowly part your legs while giving your partner a sexy smile. Grab and stroke yourself around your breasts, crotch, or any body part your partner finds sexy."

      "title": "Slowly remove your next layer.",
      "content": "Slowly remove your next layer. Pose daintily with your legs together and your weight on one leg, or go for a power stance and stand with your legs spread apart. Just keep your eyes on your partner the whole time to drive them wild. [3] X Research source If you’re pulling a top over your head, cross your arms over your chest as you lift your hands up over your head. Button-up shirts are perfect for stripping, since you can turn each button into its own mini-performance. Remove the buttons slowly, one by one, as you continue to move around and pose. Once all the buttons are undone, slip the shirt down low over your shoulders, turn your back to your partner, and let the shirt fall to the floor."

      "title": "Remove your skirt or pants.",
      "content": "Remove your skirt or pants. Skirts are generally better for beginners, since they’re a bit easier to remove smoothly, but wear whatever makes you comfortable. Carefully pull the pants or skirt down while sticking your butt out at your partner. A zippered skirt is great for beginners, since you can remove it easily and unexpectedly while striking almost any pose. A short, clingy skirt is another good option, and can be pulled up to reveal your butt before shimmying it off. If you’re wearing jeans, kneel, then push your jeans down to your knees while you stick your butt out at your partner. Sit back on your butt or your hip to pull the jeans off the rest of the way. It can be helpful to practice removing your jeans beforehand, especially if they’re tight! [4] X Research source"

Keep teasing your partner between items of clothing, or ask \"Are you ready for more?\" a few times before giving in. Lower the straps of your negligee or similar loose item of clothing over your shoulders and let it fall, or shimmy it down to the floor."

      "content": "Play with your stockings. You might want to leave your stockings on, especially with a sexy garter belt. On the other hand, a simple pair of nylon stockings can be a great prop. Put your leg up on a chair and roll the stockings off slowly, then snap them away slingshot style, or pretend to tie your wrists together. These are great visuals and good methods for adding a bit of cheeky humor to the mood. If you can walk around and pose gracefully with heels, you could leave them on as well as the stockings. If you’re worried about tripping, it might be best to remove the shoes! Try wearing a pair of stockings one size too large, with a garter belt to keep them on. This gives you more freedom of movement during your striptease. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Research source Try slipping them off while standing with your legs straight, or lay on your back and pull them up to your feet, where you can flick them off. If you're wearing a sexy garter belt, wear your panties over it, so you can keep your garter belt on."

Pants are notoriously the most challenging and therefore least sexy item of clothing to remove, but don’t stress if you stumble or have trouble! Not taking yourself too seriously will, ironically, make your striptease all the more appealing.

If a first-time partner is interested in having sex tonight, they'll be more comfortable and likely to do so if they can set the pace their clothes are removed. If pausing to ask a question every few minutes feels too awkward, try holding a button, zipper, or bra strap, then looking at your partner with a raised eyebrow and questioning look instead. You could also let your partner know ahead of time that they can call it quits or take a break at any point, or set up a safe word they can use if they need to stop or slow things down."

[10] X Research source If they're wearing a T-shirt, trap their arms in it. Pull up the lower hem of the T-shirt until the shirt is pulled partly over your partner's arms, but the collar is still around the neck. Hold your partner playfully in this position while you kiss or nibble their skin, before tugging it off the rest of the way.
