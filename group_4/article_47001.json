      "content": "Determine the design type of the trunk. The design of your trunk can typically be determined by looking at the shape of the lid. Some trunks, like flat tops, are more valuable because their tops have extra storage space, and the style can also determine which time period during which the trunk was made. [10] X Research source Common antique trunk types include dome tops, bevel tops, flat tops, and Jenny Linds. Examine features like hinges, locking mechanisms, and corner protectors to determine a specific model. Special features can also help you determine if you have an original or a reproduction, as originals typically have more detail. [11] X Research source"

Some wear and tear is normal, but look out for holes, dents, rust, and missing pieces.

Try to find a local antiques dealer who can examine the trunk in person for the best results. [15] X Research source To get an appraisal from an expert, you may need to pay for their services. It’s better to have someone look at the trunk in person, as photos and descriptions can be difficult to examine.
