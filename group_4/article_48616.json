      "content": "Use baking soda. Baking soda can be used to effectively whiten teeth in the space of a few minutes! This is due to the fact that baking soda is a mild abrasive which helps to scrub stains from your teeth. [1] X Research source To use, wipe your teeth with a dry towel and any remaining saliva. wet your toothbrush and dip it in some baking soda. Then brush your teeth as normal, paying special attention to the 16 visible teeth at the front. You should brush for about three minutes. Be aware that, over time, baking soda can wear down the protective enamel on your teeth. Therefore, it is not a good idea to use this treatment everyday. Stick to using it once or twice a week for whitening results without the risk of damage."

      "content": "Use hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide can be used to bleach your teeth, making them whiter. It is completely safe to use, provided you avoid swallowing it. [2] X Research source One way to use the hydrogen peroxide is to dip a clean face cloth in the liquid, then use the soaked cloth to gently rub your teeth. The hydrogen peroxide will remove stains chemically, while the cloth will help to remove them physically. Alternatively, you can rinse out your mouth with a cap full of hydrogen peroxide (which also helps to kill bacteria and freshen breath) or dip your toothbrush in the hydrogen peroxide and use it to brush your teeth."

If you need to keep teeth looking white, it's a good idea to avoid certain foods and drinks that can stain your teeth, such as coffee, black tea, red wine, grape juice and curry. [5] X Research source If you do drink any of the above-mentioned beverages, you can prevent them from staining your teeth by drinking them through a straw, or by rubbing a light layer of petroleum jelly over your teeth beforehand. Alternatively, you can chew a stick of sugar-free whitening gum after eating or drinking these items. This can help to absorb any newly-formed stains, making your teeth look whiter.

      "title": "Use whitening toothpaste.",
      "content": "Use whitening toothpaste. Although whitening toothpastes will not dramatically improve the whiteness of your teeth in the space of an hour (they are more effective over time), they can still help to remove stains and make teeth look brighter. Whitening toothpastes contain abrasive particles which polish the teeth and wear away stains (without damaging tooth enamel). They also contain chemicals (such as blue covarine) which bind to the surface of the teeth, making them appear whiter. [7] X Research source To use whitening toothpaste, place a pea-sized amount on your toothbrush, and brush using small circular motions, holding the toothpaste at a 45-degree angle from the gums."

      "content": "Use whitening strips . Whitening strips are coated with peroxide gel, which bleaches the teeth and helps them to look whiter. [8] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. You will typically use two sets of strips per day, for 30 minutes each -- giving you a whiter smile in only 60 minutes! Whitening strips can be purchased over-the-counter at the drugstore or supermarket. Avoid purchasing a brand that contains the ingredient \"chlorine dioxide\" as this can damage the enamel on teeth. To use the strips, remove them from the package and apply one strip to your top teeth and one to your bottom teeth. Leave them on for 30 minutes. Some strips will dissolve by themselves after use, while others will need to be removed. For best results, continue to use the whitening strips twice a day over a two week period."

      "title": "Use a whitening pen.",
      "content": "Use a whitening pen. Like the whitening strips, whitening pens use a gel containing peroxide in order to bleach the teeth. To use, remove the cap and twist the pen to release the gel. Stand in front of a mirror and smile widely, then use the pen to \"paint\" the gel onto your teeth. Keep your mouth open for about 30 seconds to allow the gel to dry. Try not to eat or drink anything for 45 minutes following the treatment. For best results, repeat this process three times a day for up to a month."

      "title": "Use a whitening tray.",
      "content": "Use a whitening tray. A whitening tray is another great option for quickly whitening your teeth. They can be purchased over-the-counter or can be custom-made by your dentist. To use a whitening tray, squirt a small amount of the concentrated peroxide gel provided into the tray (which looks like a plastic retainer) and fit it over your teeth. Depending on the type of tray, you may only need to wear it for half an hour, or you may have to leave it on overnight. Although a single use will leave your teeth looking brighter, if you want significantly whiter teeth you will need to use the tray multiple times. Although custom-made trays from your dentist can be pricey (usually costing around $300), they are specially molded for your teeth, making the treatment more effective than store-bought \"one size fits all\" trays."

A bleaching gel is applied to your teeth, then a rubber shield is placed over your gums. A laser or white light is then directed towards your teeth, activating the bleaching gel. Depending on how white you want your teeth, you may need to return for several sessions. However, each session only lasts about 30 minutes. [10] X Research source"
