      "content": "Opt for a shampoo with lots of pigment if your hair is brassy. Remove the bright, harsh tones from your hair with a silver shampoo that includes extra color pigment. If you don’t want to spend extra money on a visit to your hairstylist, see if a twice-weekly silver shampoo can bring some new life into your hair routine. You can also use this type of product to extend the life of your highlights. [4] X Research source This product works especially well for blonde hair that has lost its shine. To find a pigment-rich product, look for a more versatile shampoo. For instance, a silver shampoo that works on highlights, blonde, and silver hair will likely have more pigment in the formula."

Individuals with white hair can also try adding this product to their beauty routine! [5] X Research source In many cases, products made with centaurea extract smell great, too! This type of formula is also excellent for people with gray hair! [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Swipe the shampoo into your hairline and work your way down. Use your shampoo-covered hands to coat your hair completely with product. To ensure that all your hair gets covered, work with 1 inch (2.5 cm) sections of hair at a time. Start from the base of the hairline, using long and slow rubbing motions to knead the shampoo into your hair. [9] X Research source Don’t worry if your hands look purple while you’re applying the shampoo. Wash your hands thoroughly once you’re finished to remove the purple tint. Focus on scrubbing your scalp whenever you use shampoo. [10] X Expert Source Charlie Adams Professional Hair Stylist & Board Certified Haircolorist Expert Interview. 21 July 2021."

      "content": "Let the shampoo sit in your hair for 3-5 minutes. Wait at least 3 minutes before rinsing out the silver shampoo from your hair. If you’re in the shower, take this time to continue your beauty routine. [11] X Research source Depending on your hair type or the specific product you’re using, you might want to leave the shampoo in your hair for a longer amount of time. [12] X Research source This part of the process helps the silver shampoo to soak into your hair and combat any harsh, brassy tones. You can also apply silver shampoo specifically to any yellow-looking sections of hair. Apply the product while your hair is dry, and then let it sit for 10-15 minutes before rinsing it out. Then, wash and condition your hair as usual—this should cancel out a lot of those yellow tones.

Use your fingers to coax out any remaining product, and try to angle your head so the running water hits your scalp directly. [14] X Research source Don’t be alarmed if the water looks purple as it rinses out. The product shouldn’t tint your shower or sink."

      "content": "Rub in some purple conditioner and let it sit for 1 minute. Squeeze or pump a coin-sized amount of silver or purple conditioner into the palm of one hand. After rubbing your hands together, use your fingers to swipe the conditioner into your hair. Start from the ends of the hair and work your way up, rubbing it in slowly as you go. Wait at least 1 minute for the product to set into your hair. [15] X Research source Try to avoid applying the conditioner at your roots, as this will make your hair feel a lot heavier. Overall, focus on the ends of your hair whenever you use conditioner. The ends of your hair are older, dryer, and more brittle than the hair closer to your scalp, so they need the most conditioner.

Don’t leave the cold water on for too long—only keep it on for 30 seconds or so until all of the product is gone. Once you’ve finished rinsing, use a towel to pat your hair dry until it’s no longer dripping wet.
