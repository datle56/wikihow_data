      "content": "Apply a low-cut filter to remove the inaudible low frequencies. The human voice doesn’t have a lot of detail in the lower frequencies. However, lots of static and background noise, like the mic rumbling or the A/C running, exists in these lower frequencies. You can apply a low-cut (or high-pass) filter to reduce these frequencies without altering the person’s voice. [1] X Research source Depending on the person’s voice, set the bass roll-off start around 60 to 90 Hz. A deeper voice may start lower, while a higher voice may start higher. According to Williams, the acoustics of the room you are in affects the amount of bass the mic is able to pick up."

      "content": "Adjust the tone of the fundamental frequencies. The fundamental frequencies of a human voice are the frequencies our vocal cords vibrate to create sound. [2] X Research source This is typically found between 100 and 400 Hz. This is where the main body and definition of the voice lie. The average fundamental frequency for adult men is about 125 Hz, and for women, about 200 Hz. For children, it can be between 250 and 400 Hz. [3] X Research source Increasing the fundamental frequency can make a voice sound boomier. However, increasing it too much can reduce the clarity and make it sound muddy. If the vocal recording sounds muddy or has overwhelming bass, you may want to reduce the fundamental frequencies by about 3 to 5 dB Too little of the fundamental frequency can make a voice sound thin and weak. If the mic that was used lacks bass , you may want to increase the fundamental frequency range to compensate by about 3 to 5 dB The fundamental frequency range can change from one word to the next. Use a wide Q factor when adjusting within this region. The Q factor determines the number of surrounding frequencies that are adjusted in a graphic EQ line . The wide Q factor creates a wide valley or peak, while a narrow Q factor creates a small V-shaped dip or point. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Fix hollow or boxy tones.",
      "content": "Fix hollow or boxy tones. Too much frequency in the 300 to 800 range can make a voice sound boxy. This can happen naturally if the vocals were recorded in a small room or sound booth. If it sounds like the voice was recorded in a small room, you may want to reduce these frequencies slightly. Reducing these frequencies too much can make the voice sound hollow. Adjustments to these frequencies should be subtle using a narrow Q filter."

      "title": "Reduce unwanted nasally resonance.",
      "content": "Reduce unwanted nasally resonance. The frequencies between 800 Hz and 2 kHz are where the nasal cavity resonates. Boosting these frequencies can make the person sound more nasally or like they are speaking or singing with a cold. If the person’s voice sounds a bit nasally, you may want to reduce some of the frequencies in this region. A person’s nasal cavity resonance usually remains pretty consistent. Once you figure out where their nasal cavity resonance lies, make subtle adjustments using a narrow Q factor. The only exception where you might want to boost these frequencies is if the person has a naturally nasally voice or is singing or speaking with a nasally voice intentionally (i.e., doing a cartoon character voice)."

      "title": "Make adjustments to the presence or harmonic frequencies.",
      "content": "Make adjustments to the presence or harmonic frequencies. The frequency range in which the human voice is easiest to understand is within the 2 kHz to 5 kHz range. These are the harmonic frequencies. Adjusting these tones can make the vocals more intelligible. You may want to reduce these frequencies slightly if the voice sounds too aggressive. If the voice is too muffled, you may want to increase these frequencies just slightly. You may not even need this step, depending on your recording equipment and atmosphere. If it sounds ok to you, you can skip this step. Adjustments in this range should be very subtle, with no more than 1 or 2 dB corrections. Use a wider Q-factor of about 1.2 when adjusting these frequencies."

      "title": "Make the vocals brighter.",
      "content": "Make the vocals brighter. Increase the high frequencies to make the voice sparkle. The higher frequencies between 8 and 20 kHz can make the vocals sound crisper and airier. To make the vocals sound bright, create a high shelf of about 1 to 1.5 dB starting at about 8 to 10 kHz."

    {
      "title": "Correct vocal sibilance.",
      "content": "Correct vocal sibilance. The sibilance frequencies are between 5 kHz and 8 kHz. This is the range in which the “T”, “S”, and “Sh” sounds are most audible. Too many of these sounds can be piercing and distracting. However, reducing them may make the voice sound darker. If the voice already sounds too dark or you are working with a muffled recording, you may want to increase these frequencies. If you feel the sibilance sounds are too strong, but feel that reducing the sibilance will make the voice too dark, you may want to consider using a De-esser effect to remove some of those sounds instead."

      "title": "Make sure the vocals stand out in the mix.",
      "content": "Make sure the vocals stand out in the mix. If you are recording vocals for a song, consider the other instruments in the mix and how you EQ them. If there are too many instruments competing for the same frequencies, the vocals can get buried in the mix. You may want to reduce the number of instruments during vocal-heavy parts of a song, or mix your other instruments so that they don’t occupy as many of the same frequencies as your vocals. For example, reducing the high frequencies of guitars will allow the presence and brightness of the vocals to cut through in the mix. Also, boosting the mid-tones of the guitars will allow them to cut through in the frequency space where vocal mid-tones have been reduced. Listen to your audio mix on various speakers to make sure it sounds decent in different situations. Don’t just use your computer speakers. Listen to it on your phone, car speakers, TV, smart speaker, etc. Make sure it sounds good in all these situations so the listener doesn’t have to apply EQ settings of their own."
