The stream also won't change if you tab out of the application, and will automatically end if the application is closed. You may not want to use streaming if Discord doesn't recognize your game, if you're trying to stream multiple applications at once, or if you're playing a game that crashes a lot. Screen sharing will, as it sounds, share your entire screen to the stream. If you tab out of a game, the viewers of your stream will be able to see that, and the stream won't end automatically if you close any applications. You may not want to use screen sharing if you have private information on the screen, if you're playing a windowed game, or if your screen share has worse video quality than your stream."
