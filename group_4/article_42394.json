      "content": "Find a reputable parlor. When looking for a good parlor, you should look for several things that indicate the parlor is a good one. You can ask for recommendations from friends, but always check out the place for yourself. It's a good idea to go in a day or two before you want your piercing to look around and ask questions. The whole studio and the people working in it should be clean. Ask if they use an autoclave (a type of cleaning unit) and if they use new needles and gloves for each person. Look to see if there is a separate area for piercing and tattooing. Check to see if they use a piercing gun. Guns are not safe, as they cannot be disinfected properly. Talk to the piercers. Ask about their experience and how long they've been piercing. Also, check whether they use hypoallergenic jewelry, made from materials such as gold (14- or 18-karat), stainless steel, titanium, or niobium.

      "content": "Watch the piercer. If you're at a reputable parlor, the piercer will walk you through the steps as they're cleaning items and preparing to pierce you. The piercer should wash their hands and use single-use gloves. They should show you that all instruments are either one-time use or have been through an autoclave. Also, they should clean your lip and shave the area with a one-time razor (if you need it). [2] X Research source If you aren't comfortable with their cleanliness, walk out. Pay attention to what the piercer says. At a reputable parlor, your piercer will provide information on what you should do for aftercare. In fact, it's a requirement that piercers provide this information in many areas. Don't be afraid to speak up with questions. You have a right to ask."

Oral piercings need to be rinsed regularly while they are healing. You should rinse your piercing four to five times a day, after every time you eat (particularly meals) and before you go to bed to help reduce bacteria. You can use either a salt solution or an alcohol-free mouthwash (that's both antibacterial and antimicrobial). To make the salt solution, dissolve a teaspoon of (non-iodized) salt in a cup of warm water. To rinse, just swish the mouthwash or solution around the inside of your mouth, particularly near your piercing, for fifteen to thirty seconds."

You can wash it off with antibacterial soap, for instance. You can also use an antibacterial spray on it once it's clean. [4] X Research source Try using a cotton swab to apply a bit of liquid antibacterial soap to the area. You can dilute the soap a bit if that makes it easier. Rub it all around the piercing, getting it thoroughly wet. Try to rub off any dried bits. After it's wet, you can turn the piercing as needed. Rinse off the soap. Do not use hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, or antibiotic ointments, gels, or creams."

Red streaks going out away from the piercing are particularly problematic, as that means the infection is spreading quickly. Also, watch for thick discharge, especially if you see a lot of it. It will likely smell bad. If your infection worsens, you may get a fever, sweating, and/or chills. You may also get nauseated, vomit, or become disoriented."
