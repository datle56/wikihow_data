If you are using one of these operating systems, begin the easy Tor installation by downloading BlackBelt Privacy at this link . The download is about 20 megabytes, so it will finish with a couple minutes over most internet connections. You should then ensure Firefox is installed because the BlackBelt Privacy installer will look for it and use it set up a Profile for browsing over Tor. If you are using a different operating system, use the instructions for setting up Tor manually instead."

If you don't know which one of these to choose, one of the following three options are probably what you're looking for: [1] X Research source Choose \"Tor Client Only Operator\" if you want to use Tor's network without joining it yourself. Choose \"Censored User\" if you are living in a country that censors internet traffic. Choose \"Bridge Relay Operator\" if you want to both use Tor, and help other people stay private by relaying through your computer."

      "content": "Consider the Tor Browser instead. While the above steps can make your Firefox reasonably private, it is easy to slip up and reveal your information. Firefox also has a much more rapid development time than Tor does, so there is a significant chance that security flaws related to Firefox and Tor interactions will go undiscovered and unpatched. The Tor Browser , which you may have already downloaded while setting up Firefox Tor, automatically uses maximum privacy settings, and should be used when there are significant stakes involved, such as punishment from a repressive government. The Tor Browser is a modified version of Firefox, so the layout and functionality may be fairly easy to learn."
