      "title": "Guys often feel shy and unsure around the person they like.",
      "content": "Guys often feel shy and unsure around the person they like. Look for signs of blushing, stuttering over his words, or visibly fidgeting around you. He might also seem reluctant to say “goodbye.” Did he used to act more casually at the beginning of your friendship but now he’s suddenly more awkward? If so, he's likely crushing on you. [1] X Research source For instance, he might suddenly stumble over a sentence or give shorter, one-word answers when he's usually a big talker. His body language might also reveal his nerves; look to see if he cracks his knuckles, sways his arms back and forth, or crosses his arms."

      "title": "Hanging out solo means he's looking for more from your relationship.",
      "content": "Hanging out solo means he's looking for more from your relationship. If your guy friend likes you, he'll want to hang out all the time—especially when it’s just the two of you. He might even cancel other plans to spend time with you. Does he check in daily and ask if you’re free? You just might be dealing with a lovesick guy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Texting frequently means he’s trying hard to connect with you.",
      "content": "Texting frequently means he’s trying hard to connect with you. Think about his recent texting habits—does it seem like he's been texting you more lately? You can even scroll back through your text history to check. If you’re getting a lot more texts now than you did a couple of months ago, he might have feelings for you. [2] X Research source Does he check in daily? Regular \"What's up?\" or \"How are you doing?\" texts are a big sign that he's constantly thinking about you. He'll also be quick to shoot back a reply when you text him . He might get busy sometimes, but generally, he'll do his best to reply fast."

      "title": "Soft, casual touches signify that his feelings are more than platonic.",
      "content": "Soft, casual touches signify that his feelings are more than platonic. Notice if he hugs you often, brushes up against you while talking, hands you things you can't reach, or \"accidentally\" bumps into you. When your guy friend suddenly seems more \"touchy\" than usual, it’s a sign that he has secret feelings for you . [3] X Expert Source JT Tran Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. For example, he might sit close enough to you that your thighs touch or casually touch your arm while you chat and laugh. Do you feel like there's any sexual tension between you when you exchange a touch? That tension is another big sign that he likes you."

    {
      "title": "Compliments are his way of showing you how much he likes you!",
      "content": "Compliments are his way of showing you how much he likes you! Take note when he pays you heartfelt compliments . If he does it often and praises more than just your looks (like your talents and personality), it's a subtle signal that he's into you. He'll also compliment you more often than anyone else, which is a surefire sign of affection. [4] X Research source He'll pick up on all the little details of your appearance. He might say, \"Are those new glasses? They look great!\" He might also say things like, \"You look really nice in that shirt. It brings out your eyes,\" or, \"You're the smartest person I know!\""

      "title": "Guys might drop hints about their true feelings when they like you.",
      "content": "Guys might drop hints about their true feelings when they like you. Think about what he's said lately: does he mention how close the two of you are or how much fun it is to be around you? When a guy considers your friendship special and starts to like you, he'll tell you how much he values your presence in his life. For instance, he might say, \"I don't know anyone who gets me the way you do,\" or, \"I love that we’re always here for each other. I trust you with anything.\" He's also testing the waters to see if you value the friendship like he does. If you do, reciprocate and tell him why it's so special to you!"

      "title": "Open-ended questions mean he's trying to get to know you better.",
      "content": "Open-ended questions mean he's trying to get to know you better. Because they require more than a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer, a guy who likes you might ask lots of open-ended questions to build a stronger bond with you. He'll also ask you how you're feeling and what you're up to because he wants to know more about your life. For example, he might ask questions like, \"What's your greatest passion in life?\" or \"What goal is at the very top of your bucket list?\" He might also be the first to notice when you're feeling happy or sad and ask questions like, \"Hey, are you okay?\" or \"Do you want to talk about it?\""

      "title": "A guy who likes you will want to know all the details of your life.",
      "content": "A guy who likes you will want to know all the details of your life. Think about how often your guy friend remembers something small you told him about, like your favorite color or your Starbucks coffee order. When a guy likes you , he'll put extra effort into actively listening to you and noting what he hears. Every detail is valuable in his mind! [5] X Research source If you mention liking salted caramel, a guy who likes you might bring you a bar of it the next week because he saw it and thought of you. He might also follow up on the things you tell him. For example, if you were nervous about a work presentation, he'd be the first to ask how it went."

      "title": "He’ll feel jealous if he thinks there’s someone else you like.",
      "content": "He’ll feel jealous if he thinks there’s someone else you like. Pay attention to his reaction if you're dating someone: he'll likely be very critical of that person. Even if you're not dating someone but mention another guy, your friend will probably ask questions about him—and your relationship status. If it seems like there’s another guy in the picture, he won’t like it. [6] X Research source Try mentioning another male friend and see how he reacts. If he immediately asks who this friend is and how you know them, he's jealous. When your guy friend constantly criticizes the other guys you date, it's also a sign that he cares about your well-being and happiness."

      "title": "Discussing romance can make him feel awkward if he already likes you.",
      "content": "Discussing romance can make him feel awkward if he already likes you. When you mention romance, does he clam up or seem disinterested? Conversely, if you ask about his love life, he might get a little tongue-tied or pointedly declare that he's still single and looking for someone as a way to signal that he's interested in you. [7] X Research source Try asking him whether he's been seeing anyone. If he reacts awkwardly to the question, he might be secretly crushing on you. Your guy friend might also bring up romance and ask you whether you're looking for someone to watch for hints that you like him."

      "title": "Especially confident guys may enjoy openly flirting with you.",
      "content": "Especially confident guys may enjoy openly flirting with you. If your guy friend playfully teases you, makes innuendos, or has a habit of scandalizing you, he has more on his mind than friendship. Ongoing flirtation means he finds you attractive and is likely interested in you. [8] X Research source Some guys just use flirtation to goof off. However, persistent flirting is almost always a sign of something more. If he keeps doing it, he likes you!"

      "title": "When a guy likes you, it's hard for him to resist checking you out.",
      "content": "When a guy likes you, it's hard for him to resist checking you out. Does your guy friend seem to look over at you for long periods? Does he always smile or seem flustered when you spot him? Try and catch your guy friend in the act of staring! If he does it often, it’s a sign that he can’t stop thinking about you. [9] X Research source If your guy friend quickly looks away, blushes, or tries to pretend he wasn't staring after you catch him, that's another sign he's into you. Similarly, your guy friend might make prolonged eye contact while talking, looking at you for way longer than he looks at anyone else."

      "title": "Introducing you to friends is a sign he wants to show you off to them.",
      "content": "Introducing you to friends is a sign he wants to show you off to them. If your guy friend starts asking you to hang out with his friends or spend time with the rest of his family, he likely has feelings for you. It’s a sign that he wants the people in his life to see how great you are and like you as much as he does. [10] X Research source For example, he might ask you to go to a work event as his plus-one or invite you to be a guest at a family dinner. This goes both ways; he'll also show more interest in meeting the important people in your life, including parents and other close friends."

      "content": "Making plans means he hopes you'll be part of his life for a long time. Consider the plans your guy friend has made with you lately. Are any of them made weeks or months in advance? If he’s making future plans that involve you, whether they’re one-on-one or with a group, your guy friend is trying to tell you that he likes you and wants you to stick around. For instance, he might ask you to go to a concert several months away or plan a standing \"date\" each week to watch a show you both love."
