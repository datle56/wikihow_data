This can be an awkward conversation to bring up, but it is also a light-hearted and fun conversation once you both agree not to judge each other. What fantasies or styles do you like? What silly but sexy ideas rev your engines? Do you share any? Remember, this isn't a deep, serious conversation, but it brings up the sort of conversational intimacy that can lead to discussion of oral sex: Start the conversation with something like, “Do you have any fantasies that you’ve always wanted to try?” Make lists of your top five dream places to have sex, even if some of them are unlikely or humorous. Browse through a sex book or website like Kama Sutra, noting fun or adventurous positions to try. Share any fantasies or secret desires together, asking hers as well. If you can find ways to make both of you happy, this conversation will get much easier. [2] X Expert Source Nicole Moore Love & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 6 October 2021."

You need to be upfront if you expect your partner to be the same. Remember that your sex life is shared, not yours alone, and to make this about both of you, not just them. \"I'd like to find ways to bring more oral sex into our lives.\" \"I think the two of us should start exploring oral sex, if we're both comfortable.\" \"I really enjoy us going down on each other, and I'd like to try and make it a more important part of our sex life.\""

They may or may not have much to say, and what they says might not be to your liking. You have addressed your desires, and even if your partner says no, they ate aware of what you'd like. It will stay in their head, and if you're nothing but supportive, respectful, and understanding then your partner may feel more confident and trusting once they have had a chance to think about it on their own terms. [3] X Research source It’s normal to get emotional as you listen to your talk, especially if they ate telling you no. Try to control your emotions and keep them in check so your partner feels comfortable opening up to you."

The things that go on in the bedroom are communal, not services that are given for a job well done, no matter what that job is. If you want your partner to feel valued and comfortable (and thus more likely to find common ground), don't treat this like a transaction—treat it like a conversation.

Some people feel like they might gag and choke; others just fear getting it wrong or feel too vulnerable. [5] X Research source If you can understand why your partner is not interested in performing oral sex, you two can have a much more open and honest conversation. As your partner opens up, don’t try to dismiss their concerns or treat them like they’re invalid. You might not agree, but for your partner these are real issues.

Oral sex is a two-way street, and while you absolutely don’t have to do any sexual acts that you don’t want to, your partner may be more open to oral sex if you suggest reciprocation. This is a great way to not only put your partner at ease, but slowly incorporate new things into your shared sex life without making them initiate everything. [8] X Research source Try something like, “Would you be more comfortable if I went down on you? We could try it out and see how you feel.” Never use oral sex as a passive aggressive bargaining chip—\"I did it, now you should too.\" This will likely make your partner uncomfortable, which is not a great recipe for a healthy sex life."

More often than not, sex is a fluid, often-awkward, and always fun activity that only you two share. [10] X Research source Having a light-hearted attitude may seem like useless advice, but people are way more willing to try something new when they can laugh off any initial issues or awkwardness If you like something in the moment, let them know! This is the best way to build comfort, trust, and a great shared sex life. If something goes \"wrong,\" simply smile! If something goofy happens, like you fall off the bed somehow, don't be afraid to laugh—it won't kill the mood. Successful sex lives are about feeling calm and comfortable, and no one is more at ease than when smiling and laughing with their significant other."

If you feel like oral sex is something you want, but it is maybe moving things too quickly, start with smaller adventures. Make a bigger deal of foreplay, which is a safe way to take small risks and learn more about each other. Try some dirty talk . Kiss all over each other's bodies, getting comfortable with every inch of each other. As these thresholds are crossed, oral sex will become less of a big topic and more of a natural next step. [11] X Research source Not sure whether or not your partner is enjoying something? Check in by asking, “Does that feel good?” This gives them a chance to either tell you to keep going or to redirect you somewhere else. Let her know when you like something that they are doing, too.

[12] X Research source If you've discussed ways to bring oral sex into your relationship, and several weeks or months pass without any change, bring the conversation back up during a quiet, respectful moment outside of the bedroom."

Make sure they knows, if you hold their head or hair while engaging in such intimate relations, you'll always maintain enough control of yourself to be able to avoid restraining your partner's head in the heat of passion. [13] X Research source It's fine, and can even be desirable, to hold hair out of the way, or place your hand on your partner's head or shoulder, but it should be in a way that's very gentle and comforting. If your partner becomes uncomfortable and wants to stop early, that's okay.

This isn't a debriefing, and you don't have to do it every single time you sleep together (it will get old, fast), but you should feel free to talk about your sex life together. After the act, as you're hanging out and cuddling , ask what your partner enjoyed. Figure out if there are some things they can do without, and be sure to keep it light and laugh-filled. You're a couple, and you likely discuss every meal you cook after eating it—there is no reason you can't share this same openness after sex. [14] X Research source Keep the conversation light by asking something like, “So, how was that for you?” or, “Any notes for me?” If you are just exploring oral sex, let your partner know how much you enjoyed it! Staying silent may make them feel like it was unappreciated or, worse, that they are no good at it and shouldn't keep exploring."

Oral sex is frequently something one partner does for the other, letting them relax while you pleasure them exclusively. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't enjoy it and feel comfortable as well (you absolutely should!) but that you should place their pleasure first as long as it falls in your comfort zone. If your partner is uncomfortable about oral sex, ask why. Sometimes, people are incorrectly led to believe their genitals are \"dirty\" or \"shameful,\" and that no one wants to be there. Assure your partner, for you, that this isn't the case. [17] X Research source Are there things your knows they don't like? Things they know she love?"

If you want your partner to be honest about their feelings, you've got to do the same. Not everyone feels equally comfortable with oral sex, and that's okay—this is why you're talking about it. In order to best help your partner enjoy oral sex, you'll need to be comfortable too. That means admitting if parts of oral sex make you uncomfortable or, on the flip side, if you'd really like to start giving oral sex more often than you do now. What stuff is off limits to you? What things would you like to add or try in the future? How do you feel about performing oral sex?"

If your partner is not comfortable talking during sex, or giving feedback, consider a simpler system—perhaps they can tug your hair lightly if they like something, or they can tap your shoulder if what you're doing isn't quite working. If your partner seems to enjoy something, keep doing it. Pleasuring your partner is not some complex game of chess—stick to what works! If you don't prioritize her pleasure, your partner may feel like she has to lie about orgasming in order to make you feel better.

New positions, experiments, and tricks are an exciting part of your sex life, but that doesn't mean they should be surprising! Asking consent doesn't mean killing the mood or stopping sex in its tracks -- you can easily make it a part of foreplay or light dirty talk (ex. \"I really want to ______, would you like that?\"). Consent is an ongoing process between lovers, not a single conversation, but this actually makes it easier to stay on the same page in bed.
