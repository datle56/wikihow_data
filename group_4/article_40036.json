      "content": "Socially inept people struggle to navigate social situations. They may feel nervous or anxious in social settings, not pick up on social cues or body language, say the wrong things, and worry that others are harshly judging them. Therefore, socially inept people often struggle to make and maintain connections. Initiating interactions is difficult, and friendships or relationships that are established may not last long. [1] X Research source Socially inept people may overthink their actions in social settings and dwell on perceived mistakes. However, they may also understand social situations, and fail to engage with others by not reading the room properly or by paying more attention to themselves than to others. Many socially inept people also struggle with anxiety. Social anxiety is not the same as social ineptitude, though social ineptitude may contribute to social anxiety. Social ineptitude refers to general difficulty navigating social situations, while social anxiety refers to fear or insecurity in social situations.

[5] X Research source Have you ever left a conversation only for your friend to say, “Did you get their number? They were flirting with you!” and felt utterly oblivious? Difficulty understanding social cues may cause you to overcompensate by overanalyzing people’s expressions or body language.

Whether it’s family Thanksgiving or happy hour with your coworkers, if you're socially inept, you might tend to hang out by yourself or cling to your friend or partner. Interacting with others, especially if you don’t know them well, just seems like too big a feat. It may feel as if people just don’t seem to take to you. Socially anxious people may also implement barriers to interaction. For instance, they may text (or pretend to text), or go to the bathroom just to escape for a few minutes.

It may be tempting to ignore the problem, or to just avoid socializing altogether, but acknowledging your struggles is the first step to overcoming your social ineptitude or anxiety . By accepting you are having difficulty interacting with others, you can take steps to improve your social skills and make meaningful connections. Nobody is perfectly socially adept all the time. It is common to feel nervous or anxious when speaking publicly, for example. [15] X Research source For some people, it can feel really uncomfortable to be in a group setting, and social skills may feel challenged especially in larger settings. Remember that people with active and fulfilling social lives work hard at them and make time for them. It is true of anything, when you put energy and focus towards something over time you get better at it and also begin to see payoffs. Be patient and consistent."

It takes practice, and many people who are good at it only got that way by enduring lots and lots of failure. The more you practice striking up conversations with people, the easier it will become over time. [16] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source First, think of people you already know who you can possibly get to know better and reach out to them and initiate a time to get together or go do something fun. It can be helpful to expose yourself to small social situations made up of 1-2 people that you feel comfortable with and where concerns about being judged or doing something embarrassing are not present. This can provide you with opportunities to practice communication skills and solicit feedback without fear of judgment. As you become more familiar with these skills, you can expose yourself to bigger groups until it feels more natural and fluid to be in social settings.

Observe the people involved in the discussion: What are they talking about? Just as importantly, what is the emotional tone of the conversation? Listen carefully to what everyone is saying for a few minutes and wait for a pause or a lull in the conversation before saying something. [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Before you tell a joke, ask yourself: is this the right time and place?

When you’re obsessing over whether you’re coming off awkward or not, you’re not fully engaged in the conversation you’re having. Practice devoting your full attention to the person speaking and not to what you’ll say next or how you’re coming off in the interaction. This will help you become more socially adept and make the person you’re interacting with feel seen and want to spend more time with you. [18] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Make occasional “Hmm” and “OK” sound while someone is speaking to suggest you are paying close attention.

If their eyes dart around too much while you speak, they may be distracted, bored, or looking for an out. Tell the difference between a genuine smile and a fake smile: a genuine smile engages the entire face, whereas a fake smile only engages the mouth. If someone is standing close to you, this may indicate they are interested in what you have to say. If you notice them step away, this may suggest they want to disengage."

What does your body language tell other people? If your posture is stiff and forced, this may make you come off as uncomfortable. If your eyes shift around the room while someone speaks to you, this may make you come off disengaged. Practice implementing open, loose body language and good eye contact to come off as more approachable. [20] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Open body language may consist of a head tilt, a smile with teeth (if appropriate), and good (but not too intense) eye contact. These are signs you are interested in what someone is saying. Practice mirroring the body language of the person you’re talking to. Mirroring is a subconscious sign that you are interested in connecting and engaging in the conversation. Avoid clasping your hands, crossing your ankles, or rubbing your neck, as these may make you appear closed off and uncomfortable. Don't overthink your posture too much, as overthinking can lead to the same stiff, uncomfortable posture you want to avoid!"
