To protect your energy and cleanse your aura, put one hand on your solar plexus and reach out with the other hand. Say, \"What's mine is mine. And anything doesn't belong to me, I return to its source cleansed and purified.” Heart and Sacral Chakras that are opened up can add a green or an orange shade to a yellow aura."
