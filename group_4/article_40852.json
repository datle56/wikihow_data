When the onset of symptoms is delayed, the duration of the problem can last for days to weeks. Chronic symptoms should be promptly evaluated by a doctor especially if you are having hematemesis or hematochezia, which is bloody vomit or diarrhea, respectively. The symptoms of food poisoning include nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, sweating, and fever."

      "content": "Sip on water. You may want to let your stomach settle for an hour or so, but then you need to start introducing fluids to prevent dehydration. Take small sips of whatever liquid you can most easily tolerate, and continue to drink as much as possible throughout the day.

Taking small sips of water may help calm nausea and will provide your body with a small and steady dose of this essential liquid. If your stomach is not ready for liquid, then try putting ice chips in your mouth and let them dissolve. Try sucking on a ginger candy or drink some ginger tea. Ginger can help with digestion and treat stomach upset, diarrhea, and nausea."

      "content": "Take sips of a sports drink that contains electrolytes. Diarrhea and vomiting also cause your body to lose essential electrolytes. A good way to replace the lost electrolytes is to sip on a caffeine-free sports drink (not an energy drink) once you can hold it down. Other products are available for adults and children that help to replenish fluids and restore electrolytes. These products are called electrolyte replacement drinks. Types of sports drinks include Gatorade and Powerade, to name a few. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist for a specific recommendation."

When you contract food poisoning, or develop any other form of gastroenteritis, the symptoms of the condition can cause dehydration to occur very rapidly. You can become dehydrated within 24 hours if you are unable to retain any liquids and the symptoms continue. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The signs of dehydration include fatigue, loss of appetite, flushed skin, poor skin turgor, heat intolerance, light-headedness, dark-colored urine, and a dry cough. Clearly some of the signs can be difficult to determine since many overlap with the symptoms of food poisoning. In some cases, food poisoning can be severe or caused by a toxin so dangerous that professional medical attention is essential. An example of this is B Cereus infection, which secretes a toxin that creates gastrointestinal distress. This commonly occurs after you eat infected fried rice.

If you do not urinate at all or produce very little urine of a dark color, seek emergency care for your food poisoning. Dehydration also causes significant weakness and fatigue. If you are so weak you can barely move or if you are so tired you can hardly stay awake despite adequate sleep, you may need medical attention. You should consult a medical professional well before you have symptoms such as extreme weakness and problems sleeping. The doctor will be able to give you fluids to resuscitate you."

Dehydration is a result of frequent vomiting and persistent watery diarrhea. The diarrhea is your bodyâ€™s way of getting rid of the unwanted toxins that are causing the stomach problems. If you can endure it, let your body do its job. However, if the watery diarrhea is continuing, then it is also contributing to your poor hydration status. At some point you have to determine if you want to slow the process by using the loperamide which can help to prevent dehydration. Loperamide should be taken as follows: 4 mg, followed by 2 mg after each loose stool. Chronic use of loperamide is not recommended."

If you are still nauseous and have diarrhea, medications may be given through the IV line, such as odansetron for severe nausea, to help you feel more comfortable. Blood tests will be performed to establish the severity of your condition. Additional tests may be done to attempt to determine the source of the contamination. This may or may not be possible.
