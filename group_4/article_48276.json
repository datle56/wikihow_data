      "title": "Deal a ton of damage with this card’s Psychic Infinity attack.",
      "content": "Deal a ton of damage with this card’s Psychic Infinity attack. Mewtwo is already one of the most powerful Pokémon, so it makes sense that its mega evolution packs a real punch. Psychic Infinity inflicts an additional 30 damage points for each Energy card you’ve played onto this Pokémon. The attack isn’t affected by Weakness, so you can knock out your opponent really quickly. [1] X Research source Mega Mewtwo EX has 210 HP (Hit Points), so it also puts up a great defense. Make sure you also have a Mewtwo EX card in your deck since you’ll need to play that before you can use Mega Mewtwo EX."

    {
      "title": "Knock out your opponent with this card’s powerful VSTAR Power.",
      "content": "Knock out your opponent with this card’s powerful VSTAR Power. This special Charizard card has the “Star Blaze” VSTAR Power that deals a whopping 320 damage to your opponent. Pair that one-time power with its Explosive Fire attack that deals 100 extra damage if Charizard is also damaged, and you have one of the strongest cards in the game. [2] X Research source Charizard VSTAR has 280 HP, so it can take a few big hits from your opponents as well. You’ll need to play Charizard V before you’re able to play Charizard VSTAR, so put a couple of copies in your deck."
    },
    {
      "title": "Block damage with one of the highest HP Pokémon cards.",
      "content": "Block damage with one of the highest HP Pokémon cards. Copperajah has one of the beefiest defenses in the game with a total of 340 HP. This card packs a punch too since its Dangerous Nose attack does an added 100 damage to Basic Pokémon (a card labeled Basic in the top left corner). If you play the 4 Energy cards required on this card, the G-Max Hammer attack deals 240 damage to wipe out your opponent’s Hit Points. [3] X Research source Put a Copperajah V card in your deck since you’ll need to play this card."

    {
      "title": "Shaymin’s abilities let you draw cards and retreat easily.",
      "content": "Shaymin’s abilities let you draw cards and retreat easily. Shaymin EX’s “Set Up” ability activates as soon as you play it and lets you draw back up to 6 cards so you have more options in your hand. With Shaymin’s Sky Return attack, it deals damage before it returns to your hand with all the cards attached to it. [4] X Research source Shaymin EX only has 110 HP, but it’s still powerful since it can easily return to your hand to avoid other attacks. Shaymin EX is banned from competitive play, but you can still use it to play Pokémon for fun."

      "title": "Arceus’ ability lets you search your deck for the cards you need.",
      "content": "Arceus’ ability lets you search your deck for the cards you need. Use Arceus’ “Starbirth” VSTAR Power to search your deck for any 2 cards and put them in your hand so you can play them right away. Arceus’ Trinity Nova Attack also deals 200 damage and lets you find 3 basic Energy cards in your deck to attach to your Pokémon so they’re able to attack sooner. [5] X Research source Arceus VSTAR has 280 HP, so it’s great defensively too. Keep a copy of Arceus V in your deck since you’ll need to play it first before you’re able to play this card."

      "title": "Steal your opponent’s attacks with Gengar’s Phantom Gate move.",
      "content": "Steal your opponent’s attacks with Gengar’s Phantom Gate move. Use Phantom Gate to choose any attack from one of your opponent’s Pokémon and use it as your own as long as you have the Energy requirement. Pit Mega Gengar EX against other powerful Pokémon to damage them just as much as they damage you. [6] X Research source Gengar has 220 HP. Since Mega Gengar EX is a mega evolution, you’ll need a Gengar EX in your deck to play this."

      "title": "Reset the game with this powerful Trainer card.",
      "content": "Reset the game with this powerful Trainer card. As soon as you play Lysandre’s Trump Card, you and your opponent each shuffle your discard piles into your decks. Since you normally lose the game when you run out of cards in your deck, playing this card at the right time could help you make a comeback and win. [7] X Research source Lysandre’s Trump Card is banned in competitive matches, but you can still use it if you’re playing Pokémon casually."

    {
      "title": "Deal tons of damage for all the Energy on you and your opponent.",
      "content": "Deal tons of damage for all the Energy on you and your opponent. Mewtwo EX was one of the most powerful cards when it was released. Use its powerful X Ball attack to do an additional 20 damage for every Energy card on Mewtwo and the defending Pokémon. Since Mewtwo EX already needs 2 Energy to use the attack, you’ll already deal 60 damage. [8] X Research source Mewtwo EX has 170 HP and is only weak against other Psychic cards, so it’s tough to take down unless your opponent also has a Mewtwo. Mewtwo EX’s Psydrive attack deals 120 damage, but also makes you remove an Energy attached to the card."

      "title": "Heal damage and use other Pokémon’s attacks with this strong tag team.",
      "content": "Heal damage and use other Pokémon’s attacks with this strong tag team. Using Mewtwo & Mew’s “Perfection” ability lets you use attacks from any card on your Bench or in your discard pile with “GX” or “EX” in its name as long as you have the Energy. With its Miraculous Duo GX attack, you’re able to deal 200 damage and heal all the damage on all of your Pokémon. [9] X Research source Mewtwo & Mew Tag Team GX has 270 HP. Since this card is a Basic Pokémon, you’re able to play it right away without other prerequisites."

      "title": "Search your deck for cards using Tapu Lele’s Wonder Tag ability.",
      "content": "Search your deck for cards using Tapu Lele’s Wonder Tag ability. As soon as you play Tapu Lele GX, look for a Trainer card with the “Supporter” label in your deck and add it to your hand. Since Supporters have a wide variety of powerful abilities, Tapu Lele lets you make surprising plays when your opponent least expects it. [10] X Research source Tapu Lele GX has 170 HP, but it doesn’t have any weaknesses so it’s great at defending. Tapu Lele GX also has the powerful Energy Drive attack, which does 20 damage for each Energy attached to both Active Pokémon that isn’t affected by weaknesses or resistances. Use the “Tapu Cure” GX Power once per game to heal all the damage from 2 of your Benched Pokémon."

    {
      "title": "Draw new cards and prevent damage with this small Pokémon.",
      "content": "Draw new cards and prevent damage with this small Pokémon. Even though Cleffa may look weak at first glance with only 30 HP, it’s surprisingly resilient in a match. Use its Eeeeeeek attack to shuffle your hand into your deck and draw 6 new cards. Even though the attack puts Cleffa to sleep, its “Sweet Sleeping Face” ability prevents it from taking damage until it wakes up. [11] X Research source Use Cleffa in the early game since it’s a colorless card that fits into any deck and lets you look for stronger cards in the meantime."

    {
      "title": "Force your opponent to discard and deal lots of damage with this Fire-type.",
      "content": "Force your opponent to discard and deal lots of damage with this Fire-type. Charizard GX’s Crimson Storm attack does 300 damage at the cost of 3 red Energy cards attached to it. Even more impressive is this card’s “Raging Out” GX attack that forces your opponent to discard a total of 10 cards off the top of their deck. Near the end of the game, using this ability could force your opponent to lose if they run out of cards. [12] X Research source Even Charizard GX’s weakest attack does 70 damage so it’s perfect for taking out weaker Pokémon. Charizard GX has 250 HP, so it’s a great defensive Pokémon too. Charizard GX evolves from Charmeleon, so put a copy in your deck."

    {
      "title": "This card’s high HP and strong attacks are perfect for a Steel-type deck.",
      "content": "This card’s high HP and strong attacks are perfect for a Steel-type deck. At 330 HP, Aggron VMAX is one of the most powerful defenses in the game. Use its Crackling Stomp attack to deal 150 damage and make your opponent discard from their deck. When you get 5 Energy on this card, Aggron’s Max Take Down does 270 damage to quickly knock out another Pokémon. [13] X Research source Aggron VMAX does 30 damage to itself each time it uses Max Take Down, so be careful if it's already been hurt."
    },
    {
      "title": "Double this Pokémon’s damage with the flip of a coin.",
      "content": "Double this Pokémon’s damage with the flip of a coin. Mega Aggron EX’s Megaton Slam attack normally does 120 damage. If you flip a coin and land on heads, the damage doubles and inflicts 240 points to your opponent’s HP. If you land on tails, however, then all of your Benched Pokémon take 20 damage instead. It’s a risky play, but it may be worth it to knock out a strong Pokémon with a single hit. [14] X Research source Mega Aggron EX has 240 HP, so it’s great for absorbing strong attacks too. Play Aggron EX before you play this card."
    },
    {
      "title": "This card’s high HP and powerful attacks are perfect for a Grass-type deck.",
      "content": "This card’s high HP and powerful attacks are perfect for a Grass-type deck. Dhelmise VMAX has 330 HP, so it’s one of the strongest Grass-types in the card game. Attack with its Swinging Chain to deal 30 damage unaffected by Resistance for each green Energy attached to the card. Once you have a few more Energy attached to Dhelmise EX, use its Max Anchor attack every other turn to deal a whopping 240 damage. [15] X Research source Make sure you have Dhelmise V in your deck since you’ll need it to evolve into Dhelmise VMAX."

    {
      "title": "Leave your opponent paralyzed and vulnerable with an Exabolt attack.",
      "content": "Leave your opponent paralyzed and vulnerable with an Exabolt attack. When you attack with Mega Ampharos EX, choose if you want to deal 50 extra damage and paralyze the defending Pokémon. If you do, Mega Ampharos also takes 30 points of damage, but your opponent’s paralyzed Pokémon won’t be able to hurt you until they heal. [16] X Research source Mega Ampharos EX has a total of 220 HP. Make sure you have an Ampharos EX in your deck so it can evolve into this Pokémon."

    {
      "title": "Draw extra cards and damage 2 Pokémon with this Water-type.",
      "content": "Draw extra cards and damage 2 Pokémon with this Water-type. If you discard an Energy card from your hand, use Radiant Greninja’s “Concealed Cards” ability and draw 2 more cards. When you’re ready to attack, use Moonlight Shuriken and discard 2 Energy attached to this card to deal 90 damage to 2 different Pokémon. [17] X Research source Radiant Greninja has 130 HP. You can only have 1 Radiant Pokémon in your deck at a time."

      "content": "Zoroark GX does serious damage and lets you draw cards. Use this card’s “Trade” ability to discard a card from your hand to draw 2 new cards. When it’s time to attack, use Riotous Beating to deal 20 damage for each Pokémon you have in play. Otherwise, use the GX attack Trickster to use one of your opponent’s attacks against them. [18] X Research source Zoroark GX has 210 HP. Make sure you have a Zorua GX in your deck so it can evolve into this card."

      "title": "Poison and paralyze your opponent with this card’s vicious attack.",
      "content": "Poison and paralyze your opponent with this card’s vicious attack. Mega Venusaur EX’s Crisis Vine attack only hits for 120 damage, but its special ability stops the defending Pokémon right in its tracks. Once you leave your opponent paralyzed and poisoned, they take damage every turn but they’re not able to damage any of your Pokémon. [19] X Research source Mega Venusaur EX has 230 HP. Make sure you put a Venusaur EX in your deck since you’ll need it to play this card."

      "content": "Protect your Steel-type Pokémon with this strong card. Use Lucario and Melmetal GX’s Full Metal Wall attack to protect your Steel-type Pokémon so they take 30 less damage for the rest of the game.

    {
      "title": "Put your enemy to sleep and flip coins for a huge attack.",
      "content": "Put your enemy to sleep and flip coins for a huge attack. Whenever you attach an Energy card to Malamar EX, your opponent’s active Pokémon is put to sleep and can’t attack. Once your opponent is vulnerable, use the MAXamar attack and flip a coin for each Energy card attached to Malamar EX. For each heads, you hit your opponent for 60 damage. [21] X Research source Malamar EX has 170 HP. Since this card is a Basic Pokémon, you don’t need to play any other cards before playing this one."

      "content": "Multiple resistances make Mega Rayquaza EX tough to beat. Mega Rayquaza EX is already pretty strong with 230 HP, but its Wild ability reduces incoming damage from Grass, Water, Fire, and Electric Pokémon by 20 points. Pair this impressive ability with the massive 300-damage Dragon Ascent attack, and this card is sure to sweep the most powerful of opponents. [23] X Research source Dragon Ascent makes you discard 2 Energy attached to Mega Rayquaza EX, so time your attack when you have a few extra Energy in your hand to play.

When you want to take out a chunk of your opponent’s HP, use Freeze Shock to deal 150 damage. Just plan according since you can’t use it 2 turns in a row.
