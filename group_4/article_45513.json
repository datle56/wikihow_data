If you’re worried about frozen pipes, leave all the working faucets open slightly. A small trickle of running water from working faucets can prevent further freezing and help melt the ice.

      "content": "Presume it’s the pipes in the exterior walls if you have no water. If a large area of your house has no water, look in the most likely and accessible areas first before you start tearing apart walls. Since exterior walls end up bearing most of the cold, that’s the most likely location for frozen pipes. Keep narrowing down the search. Be sure to check: [2] X Research source Pipes in or near uninsulated crawlspaces, attics, or basements. Pipes near cold air vents or cold concrete. Outdoor valves and spigots. Outdoor pipes can freeze, but check these last, as most systems are designed to keep standing water out of these pipes."

      "content": "Search for cracks and leaks to confirm busted pipes. Freezing water can cause pipes to crack from the change in pressure, usually splitting the pipe lengthwise or causing cracks in the joints. If you find an active leak, you’ve located the frozen (and unfortunately broken) pipe. [3] X Research source If you find a leak, close the main shut-off valve immediately.

      "content": "Feel or tap exposed pipes to confirm which section is frozen. Assuming there are no leaks or cracks, find the section of the pipe with frozen water using one of the following methods. Feel the temperature of the pipe with your hand or use an infrared thermometer to locate areas significantly colder than other pipes. Tap the pipe with a screwdriver handle or other object, listening for a more solid, less \"hollow\" sound. If you rule out all exposed pipes in the affected area, skip to the section on unfreezing pipes inside walls."

      "content": "Wait for the pipes to thaw on their own if there’s no rush. If this is a pilot house, vacation home, or you simply aren’t in a rush, just shut off the main water supply and wait it out. Your pipes will eventually thaw as the weather warms up and everything will go back to normal. [5] X Research source The main water supply is likely in your basement. Look for the large pipe coming into your home and connecting to your hot water heater. Close the valve on that pipe to shut your home’s water off."

      "title": "Shut the water off if your faucets produce no water.",
      "content": "Shut the water off if your faucets produce no water. If you turn a faucet on and nothing comes out, it means at least one of your supply pipes is frozen shut. Turn the water main off to take the pressure off of the frozen pipe. If that pressure keeps building up, you could accidentally burst a pipe. [6] X Research source If water does come out of all of your faucets (even just a little), it’s better to leave the water open and run it than it is"

      "title": "Leave the faucet slightly open and let the water run.",
      "content": "Leave the faucet slightly open and let the water run. Open the faucet attached to the frozen pipe, and open nearby working faucets to a trickle. Running water is much less likely to freeze than standing water. If the running water passes through or near a frozen area, it may even help thaw the ice over the course of an hour or two. [7] X Expert Source David Balkan Professional Plumber & CEO of Balkan Sewer & Water Main Expert Interview. 29 April 2021. If you see any cracks in any pipe, turn off the main water supply to your house immediately and close all faucets. How long it takes for a pipe to thaw depends on how much ice is in the pipe, how big the pipe is, and how cold it is outside. Generally speaking, it should take at least a few hours to thaw."

      "content": "Use a hair dryer or heat gun to slowly thaw the pipe. If the pipe is exposed and you have a section that’s frozen, turn on a hair dryer and run it back and forth along the frozen pipe. Keep it moving and do not place the dryer directly against the pipe, as uneven or sudden heating can rupture the pipe. If your pipes are metal, you can use a more powerful heat gun instead of a hair dryer. [8] X Research source PVC pipes can be damaged at temperatures as low as 140 °F (60 °C). Never use a heat gun or anything stronger than a hair dryer. Outdoor valves often have fiber washers or other non-heat-safe materials inside them. Heat them slowly and cautiously."

[9] X Expert Source David Balkan Professional Plumber & CEO of Balkan Sewer & Water Main Expert Interview. 29 April 2021. Do not overlap electrical heat tape. Wrap it around the pipe only once or in a spiral pattern. Do not worry about this damaging your pipes. This kind of tape is designed to keep the pipes safely warm, not so hot they’ll warp or break."

Hang up tarps or blankets to trap the heat in a smaller area, if necessary. For large rooms, use several heat sources to ensure safe, even heating of the pipe. [10] X Research source Do not leave any space heaters or heat lamps unattended. They can cause fires if they get knocked over or malfunction."

Replace with freshly soaked, hot towels every 5–10 minutes until the pipe thaws. [11] X Research source Do not leave cold wet towels around the pipes—that’s just going to make the towels freeze onto your pipe."

      "content": "Add salt to frozen drains where you can’t reach the pipe. Salt lowers the melting point of ice, causing it to melt at colder temperatures (this is why you salt a sidewalk after heavy snow). Pour a tablespoon (15 mL) of salt down the drain of the frozen pipe, and wait for it to thaw the frozen water in the pipe. [12] X Research source You can try dissolving the salt in a 1/2 cup (120 mL) of boiling water first, but adding hot water to frozen ice can burst the pipe. It’s fast if it works, but it’s probably not worth risking it."
