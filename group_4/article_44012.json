Bring them behind your back, cross them over each other, then bring them back to the front. Tie them off as desired. [1] X Research source Position the straps at about waist-level. If this is a crop-style top, position them at your rib cage instead. For a more unique look, tie the straps off to the side instead of in the middle of your torso. You can tie the straps in a double knot, a bow, or a half-bow."

Pull them behind your back, cross them, then bring them back to the front. Tie them into a single knot. Next, grab both straps and pull them under the knot so that they come out the top. Let them dangle in front of the knot, hiding it from view. [2] X Research source This works best for crop tops and woven blouses, not knitted. Tie the knot at about bust-level. If you won't want any dangling straps, continue to wrap and tuck them around the knot until they disappear."

      "content": "Wrap the straps into a bun for a unique look. Put the shirt on, cross the straps in front of you, then tie them into a single knot. Take both straps and, treating them as a single strand, fold them around your index and middle fingers to create a small loop. Wrap the rest of the strands around the base of the loop to make a bun, then tuck the ends under the knot. [5] X Research source This style works the best for crop-style, woven blouses. Make the knot just below your bust."

      "content": "Cross a scarf in front of your chest to make a classic halter. Put on a strapless bra, then drape a scarf across the back of your neck. Make sure that it's centered, then cross the tails over your chest, covering your bust. Bring the ends behind your back, then tie them into a tight knot, right below the bra strap. [6] X Research source Each side of the scarf should only cover 1 breast. If the scarf is very wide, fold it in half lengthwise first. A single knot should be enough. If you're worried about the scarf slipping, or if you have enough material left, do a double knot."

Pull both ends of the scarf behind your back, then tie them into a knot at about waist-level. [7] X Research source You can do a single knot or a double knot here.
