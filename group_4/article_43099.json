      "title": "Hormonal acne is caused by excess oil in the skin.",
      "content": "Hormonal acne is caused by excess oil in the skin. The main culprit of hormonal acne is sebum: the oily substance your sebaceous (fat) glands produce to keep your skin protected. When your hormones increase, your sebaceous glands get larger and create an overproduction of sebum. This sebum makes your skin oily, causing acne breakouts. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Bacterial acne is caused by bacteria infecting your pores.",
      "content": "Bacterial acne is caused by bacteria infecting your pores. We all have small amounts of natural, good bacteria on our faces. But if our pores become clogged with oils or dead skin cells (which our body sheds regularly), these microbes can infect our follicles, which results in pimples and zits.

      "title": "Hormonal acne and bacterial acne can co-exist.",
      "content": "Hormonal acne and bacterial acne can co-exist. Because hormonal acne clogs your pores, hormonal breakouts create perfect environments for bacteria to get into your skin and spread. Therefore, there’s a chance both sebum and bacteria are giving you pimples and you should be treated for both types of acne.

      "content": "If you have acne flare-ups as an adult, it’s probably hormonal. While acne mostly affects people in their teen years, you become more hormonally active as an adult (especially if you’re an adult woman). You're biologically closer to reproductive age. You’re likely more sexually active. Because of this, your hormones are oscillating, causing acne.

      "content": "If your acne happens on a regular schedule, it’s probably hormonal. If your acne comes around the same time every month and a half or so, it’s probably due to your hormone cycle. (This is especially common for women on their periods.) On the other hand, if your acne pops up randomly and unpredictably, it’s probably bacterial.

If you’ve been suffering from insomnia lately, or you’ve been suffering from anxiety or another stress-related problem, your skin has broken out as a response.

If you eat a lot of refined (non-complex) carbs, added sugars, or meals rich in omega-6, your body may be suffering from inflammation, which is causing bacterial acne.

      "content": "If it’s inflamed and cystic, it’s probably both. If you’re suffering from pustules (pus-filled pimples) or papules (pimples without noticeable heads), odds are an initial hormonal break-out has caused bacteria to enter your skin and block your pore. The contents of that pore have then spilled out and reddened the nearby skin, resulting in more cystic and painful zits. [13] X Research source Getting rid of cystic acne is often a process combining hormonal and bacterial treatments. Since everyone’s acne is different, see a dermatologist to see which methods are best for your skin."

      "title": "Develop a regular skincare routine.",
      "content": "Develop a regular skincare routine. Since hormonal acne happens cyclically, treatment for it should be regular too. Find a facial cleanser with an acne-fighting chemical like salicylic acid and apply it to affected areas as often as twice a day (once in the morning, once at night). Dermatologists also recommend using a retinoid gel or cream a few times a week. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Both salicylic acid and retinoid may cause redness or dry skin. Exposure to sunlight may worsen these side effects. Do not use a retinoid product regularly while also using benzoyl peroxide to treat acne."

      "content": "If you’re a woman or AFAB, consider taking hormone-regulating pills. Certain oral contraceptives, like spironolactone and birth control, are recommended by dermatologists in treating hormonal acne for women. If your hormonal acne is severe and other treatments just aren’t working, these medications may be a good option. Just be sure to consult your doctor first!

      "content": "Consider taking oral antibiotics. In intense cases, oral antibiotics like doxycycline and azithromycin can help fight the spread of bacteria in your body. However, these should be taken for as short a time as possible and used alongside other facial cleansers to prevent bacteria from developing a resistance to the medication. [19] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Oral antibiotics are available through prescription only.

      "content": "Practice excellent hygiene habits. If you’re suffering from bacterial acne, you have to be extra diligent in maintaining good hygiene to prevent acne. Wash your face twice a day, avoid touching your cheeks and forehead, exfoliate regularly, and avoid irritants to your skin (tight clothing, severe sunlight) to keep break-outs in check. [20] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re regularly getting acne in the same spot on your skin, you probably need to change your clothes to a more breathable type of fabric."

      "title": "Fungal acne is neither hormonal or bacterial.",
      "content": "Fungal acne is neither hormonal or bacterial. If you’re suffering from itchy, red bumps on your skin, chances are you’re not suffering from a break-out, but from folliculitis (an inflammation of your skin’s hair follicles). While sebum production and bacteria exacerbate fungal acne, it’s mainly caused by yeast infecting your pores. The good news: this means it’s unlikely you’ll suffer from any pimples or zits. The bad news: fungal acne cannot be treated like hormonal or bacterial acne, and anti-yeast remedies are necessary. Usually, fungal acne can be treated with regular use of antifungal shampoos and soaps , which are available online and in most grocery stores. In severe cases, fungal acne may require oral antibiotics. Consult your doctor if your folliculitis is particularly severe, long-lasting, or painful."
