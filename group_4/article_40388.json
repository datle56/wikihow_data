      "title": "Find the red “Levi's” tab on the back right pocket of your jeans.",
      "content": "Find the red “Levi's” tab on the back right pocket of your jeans. Almost all pairs of Levi’s jeans have a red tab, making it a well-recognized icon all around the world. It is a good starting point for identifying Levi’s Jeans as authentic or fake—if the tab isn’t there, they’re likely fake. [1] X Research source All genuine Levi’s have the “Levi’s” tab. However, on a few styles of jeans, the tab may be a different color like green, yellow, or white. Make sure the tab is in the right place on your jeans. On most authentic Levi’s, the tab is sewn 1 to 1 ¼ inches (2.5-3.2 cm) below the top of the left-hand stitching on the back right pocket. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Ensure that the stitching around the tab is clean and consistent.",
      "content": "Ensure that the stitching around the tab is clean and consistent. If the stitching is messy or looks tampered with, the jeans may be a fake pair of Levi’s. A lot of counterfeit manufacturers un-stitch the denim of regular jeans and sew in the tab to make them look like genuine Levi’s. [3] X Research source Levi’s prides themself on their impeccably straight stitching all around the jeans, even on the tab."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check if the font and size of the letters are consistent with Levi’s.",
      "content": "Check if the font and size of the letters are consistent with Levi’s. Compare the “Levi’s” inscription on the tab to other pairs of Levi’s that you know are genuine. If the font looks like a different type or appears too large or small, you may be looking at a counterfeit pair. [4] X Research source For instance, check your pair of jeans against images of Levi’s on Levi’s website ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for a capital “E” or lowercase “e” on the tab.",
      "content": "Look for a capital “E” or lowercase “e” on the tab. Prior to 1971, the tab on most Levi’s jeans read “LEVI’S.” After 1971, most tabs are printed with a lowercase “e.” [5] X Research source However, this isn’t a hard and fast rule, as many recent jeans have the capital “E” tab again. If you’re looking at a pair of vintage jeans made before 1971 and the tab has the lowercase “e,” they are likely fakes. 1 in every 100 pairs will only have a ‘registered mark’ instead of “Levi’s.” This is because they have to change the ribbon on the machine and run through a label without Levi’s stitching on it.

      "title": "Look for the high-quality leather patch on the back of the waistband.",
      "content": "Look for the high-quality leather patch on the back of the waistband. This leather patch is another way of identifying an authentic product; it is present on all Levi’s and is consistent with most other pairs of jeans. Some content might vary, however, they will all have very similar characteristics: [7] X Research source The patch is printed with “LEVI STRAUSS & CO.,” “SAN FRANCISCO, CAL.,” and “ORIGINAL RIVETED” at the top of the patch. The bottom of the patch lists the jean’s style number (e.g., 501) and the waist and length measurements. The patch features the iconic 2 horse design. If there aren’t 2 horses on the patch, the jeans are likely fake. The color of the leather patch is the same shade of brown on most pairs of Levi’s. The patch won’t be too pale or too dark and the tag will not fade in the wash."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the design of the patch for any errors.",
      "content": "Check the design of the patch for any errors. The model/style of the jeans and the waist and leg measurements of authentic Levi’s are almost always printed in black text. This is because they make the stock patch first and then print these details onto each individual pair of jeans. Off-center labels and spelling mistakes also indicate that the pair is fake. [8] X Research source Ensure the patch is flush with the top of the waistband and the stitching is straight and neat. A haphazardly sewn-on patch is a sign of a fake. Note : The design of the patch has varied over the years. If you are comparing your patch to another, ensure the jeans are from the same time period."
    },
    {
      "title": "Feel the patch’s texture and softness.",
      "content": "Feel the patch’s texture and softness. Authentic Levi’s patches are either made out of durable leather or tough jacron paper. Both materials have a little bit of texture and feel soft and worn; the material shouldn’t feel too smooth or too hard. A lot of fake manufacturers use cheap, flimsy leather or a substitute. If the patch feels like it is covered or has a plastic feel to it, this may indicate that your jeans are counterfeit."

      "title": "Check the top of the buttons for “LEVI STRAUSS & CO.”",
      "content": "Check the top of the buttons for “LEVI STRAUSS & CO.” The waist buttons on Levi’s are made of silver or copper that doesn't wear or fade over time. While the design of the button has changed a few times over the years, an authentic button will always have “LEVI STRAUSS & CO. S.F. CAL.” embossed onto the front side. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look at the back of the waist button for the jean’s style number.",
      "content": "Look at the back of the waist button for the jean’s style number . On the back of the waist button, there is a 3 or 4-digit number (code) stamped into the hardware. This refers to the model or style of the jeans (e.g., 501). If there’s no code on the back of the button, it’s likely a fake pair. [10] X Research source On modern styles, this is usually a 3 or 4-digit number, however, it can sometimes vary with vintage pairs of Levi’s."

    {
      "title": "Check the interior care label for a matching style number.",
      "content": "Check the interior care label for a matching style number. The style number on the back of the top button always matches the style number that’s printed on the white care label inside of the jeans. If the numbers do not match or you can’t find a style number on the care label, this likely indicates a fake pair of jeans. [11] X Research source The style number is typically printed on the bottom or right-hand corner of the care label."

      "title": "Ensure all 6 rivets are detailed with the company initials.",
      "content": "Ensure all 6 rivets are detailed with the company initials. Most pairs of Levi jeans have 6 rivets on the front: 4 are on the right-side pockets and 2 are on the left-side pocket. The back and front of each rivet is inscribed “LS & CO. S.F.”—this stands for “Levi Strauss and Co. San Francisco.” [12] X Research source If the jeans are missing rivets, they aren't inscribed with “LS & CO. S.F.,” or they have spelling mistakes, they are probably fake."

    {
      "title": "Look for the double-arced stitching on the back pockets.",
      "content": "Look for the double-arced stitching on the back pockets. One of the hallmarks of a pair of Levi jeans is the trademarked arcuate stitching on both back pockets. The double arches are evenly stitched across the middle of the pockets and the stitches form a diamond shape where the arcs intersect. [13] X Research source If a pair of jeans is missing the double-arced design, they are almost certainly fake."

    {
      "title": "Check the overall build quality of the jeans.",
      "content": "Check the overall build quality of the jeans. Levi’s has a very high standard for quality control. If there are any faults in the stitching, like crooked lines and ripped seams, or defects to the metal hardware, chances are the jeans are fake. [14] X Research source If you believe your jeans are authentic and notice any defects, return them to Levi’s for inspection."

      "title": "Check Levi’s website for stores near you.",
      "content": "Check Levi’s website for stores near you. The Levi’s website has a list of their official suppliers and outlet stores. This is the best way to ensure that the jeans you buy are 100% authentic. [15] X Research source If you buy your jeans from an unlicensed store, online marketplace, or resale app, they may not be real Levi’s. If you’re looking for vintage or pre-loved jeans, check out Levi’s SecondHand website . Most fake Levi’s are sold on third-party websites and online marketplaces like eBay. You might also come across fakes at thrift stores and flea markets."

      "content": "Research online sellers to check that they are legitimate. If you are shopping for vintage or secondhand jeans online (like on eBay, Depop, or Facebook Marketplace), inspect the seller’s reviews to see if customers are happy with their purchases and if they reliably sell authentic goods. Closely inspect the images the seller provides, too, to ensure you’re getting the real deal. [16] X Trustworthy Source Federal Trade Commission Website with up-to-date information for consumers from the Federal Trade Commisson Go to source Ask the seller to provide a detailed description of the jeans and clear images of the actual product (rather than a stock image from Levi’s website). If the seller refuses, this is a good indication that they might be selling a fake pair. Be wary of sellers that have no reviews, bad reviews, only show their good reviews, or have reviews that look automated. These are all signs that the seller might be a scammer.

      "title": "Beware of a deal that’s too good to be true.",
      "content": "Beware of a deal that’s too good to be true. While many stores offer regular sales, if you find a pair of ‘Authentic’ Levi’s jeans that are way below the average retail price, this may be cause for suspicion. It is a good idea to research the style you want first so you know roughly how much you will be paying. Of course, the price may vary from store to store, however, they all should be in the same range. [18] X Research source New pairs of Levi’s typically cost $70 to $100. Highly sought-after vintage jeans often cost over $100."

      "content": "Make your purchase with a credit card, when possible. Credit cards are generally considered the safest way to shop in-person and online. In the case that you buy a counterfeit pair of jeans or never receive your jeans from an online seller, you can file a dispute with your credit card company to get your money back. [19] X Trustworthy Source Federal Trade Commission Website with up-to-date information for consumers from the Federal Trade Commisson Go to source If you buy a fake pair of Levi’s , request a refund from the seller first. If they refuse to give you a refund, submit a chargeback with your credit card company. If you’re shopping online, report any fraudulent sellers you see on the platform you’re using. For instance, report the seller to eBay or Depop. If you believe a seller is selling counterfeit goods, report them to the FTC . Most credit card companies also protect you against fraud and scams, like if your card number gets stolen."

      "content": "Get the original receipt when you buy secondhand. If you’re buying secondhand jeans online or at a garage sale or market, ask for the original receipt. While a lot of people may not have it anymore, this can be a good way to ensure the jeans are from a licensed dealer and an authentic pair."
