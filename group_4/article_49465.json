      "title": "Check if your state allows guardianship letters.",
      "content": "Check if your state allows guardianship letters. Not all states recognize guardianship letters. Instead, they require that even temporary custody issues be handled through the courts. The state of Maine, for example, requires parents to file papers with a court in order to seek a temporary guardianship. [1] X Trustworthy Source Pine Tree Legal Association Legal advocacy group providing public resources related to civil rights and and services and the justice system Go to source Some states limit informal arrangements, such as those made by letter, to a six month period in order to be effective. Find and read your state’s statute on domestic relations or child custody. To find your state statute, type the name of your state into a search engine along with the words “temporary guardianship,” “guardianship,” or “domestic relations.”"

      "title": "Consider meeting with a lawyer.",
      "content": "Consider meeting with a lawyer. You can meet with a family law attorney to check whether your state allows guardianship letters. An experienced family lawyer can also help you draft the letter or come up with a list of potential guardians. [2] X Research source To find a family law attorney, you can contact your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program. If costs are a concern, be aware that many attorneys now offer “unbundled legal” services. Under this arrangement, the lawyer will perform discrete tasks (such as offering advice or drafting a guardianship letter). By paying for only limited services, you can lower the cost of legal representation."

      "content": "Come up with a list of guardians. The guardian should be someone you know well and trust completely. The guardian should also be familiar to the children. Ideally, a temporary guardian should live near you so that your children’s lives will not be unduly disrupted. Many people consider family and close friends as first choices to act as guardians. You should also consider the parents of your children’s friends. They know your child and, if they live in the same area, can transport your child to school quite easily. Be sure to talk to your children as well. If they are old enough, they may have a preference for who they want to stay with."

I give the temporary guardian the right to make medical, educational, and recreational decisions for my child.” You might choose to limit the powers. For example, you may not want to grant the temporary guardian the power to make any and all medical decisions. Instead, you can specify what medical decisions the temporary guardian can make. You might write: “I grant the temporary guardian power to authorize medical care for my child, such as medical examinations, X-rays, blood tests, and emergency treatment.” By limiting the information, you can assure that you will be contacted for approval for other treatments."
