      "content": "Wash your fleece only when absolutely necessary. Fleece garments and blankets are made of polyester and plastic fibers and often do not need washing every time they are worn. [1] X Research source Washing less also helps reduce the amount of microfibers shed into your washing machine and keeps it out of our planet’s water supply. [2] X Research source Some fleece garment rules of thumb: Sweatshirts: Wash after 6 wears. Jackets and parkas: Wash twice each winter season. Hats, gloves and scarves: Wash 3 to 5 times each winter season. Hosiery: Wash after every wear. Leggings and pants: Wash every 1 to 3 wears. Blankets: Twice a season depending on personal linen washing preference. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Spot wash and pretreat any stains with a gentle detergent. Use a sponge with soap or a mild detergent on targeted stained areas. Sponge gently to lift dirt and leave on for 10 minutes. Blot it out with a paper towel or cool water sponge. [4] X Research source Don’t rub too hard when spot treating or the dirt will settle deeper into the fleece fiber. For extra stubborn spots try a mild acid like lemon juice or vinegar to lift the stain. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove lint specks of pilling fleece.",
      "content": "Remove lint specks of pilling fleece. Over time white lint specks accumulate on fleece reducing the garments softness and water resistance. Pilling usually occurs when the fleece is over-rubbed or abraded. [6] X Research source . Use a lint roller, brushing down fleece while you wear it or on a flat surface. Alternatively you can very gently run a razor over the fleece, cutting away lint."

      "title": "Use a few drops of a mild or natural detergent in your washing machine.",
      "content": "Use a few drops of a mild or natural detergent in your washing machine. Try to avoid harsh detergents with fabric softeners, 'the blue goo’, bleach, scents, and conditioners. These are your fleece’s worst enemy. DIY natural detergent: ¼ cup of baking soda, 1 cup hydrogen peroxide or vinegar. You want oxygen in the water to break up the water surface tension creating the bubbles and removing the dirt. [8] X Research source Vinegar eliminates odours, is anti-bacterial and helps remove soap and grime buildup. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn your washing machine on to the gentle cycle setting using cool water.",
      "content": "Turn your washing machine on to the gentle cycle setting using cool water. A gentle wash or rinse is all the fleece needs to keep the fibres soft and fuzzy. Warm or hot water on a strong cycle will degrade the quality and reduce the waterproof resistance of the fleece over time. [10] X Research source Pull fleece garments inside out to reduce lint specks appearing on the outside. Avoid washing fleece with other items such as towels and sheets. Towels are the main culprit for lint specks!"

      "content": "Air dry the fleece on a drying rack or hanger. Hang the fleece item carefully inside or outside for 1 - 3 hours depending on the weather. Air drying keeps the fleece smelling nice and fresh. To save the fabric colour from fading air dry inside or in the shade away from direct sunlight. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Gently rub fabric together with your hands for 5 minutes. Focus on areas where you sweat or notice any dirt. Rinse and repeat this process in fresh water until the water runs clear of dirt and detergent. For fleece items that have particularly stubborn odours or stains, leave them to soak for 30 to 40 minutes before rinsing with water. [14] X Research source"
