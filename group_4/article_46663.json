      "title": "Move the weight pin to choose the amount of weight to lift.",
      "content": "Move the weight pin to choose the amount of weight to lift. Find the pin on the weights. Pull the pin out of its current setting, then move it to the hole near the weight you want. Push the pin into the hole to set the weight. [1] X Research source For instance, if you wanted to set the weight at 20 lb (9.1 kg), you’d put the pin in the hole next to that weight."

      "title": "Start with a low weight until you get used to the exercise.",
      "content": "Start with a low weight until you get used to the exercise. You may accidentally hurt yourself if you try to lift too much weight. When you’re getting started, use the lowest setting to make sure it’s okay for you. You can always adjust the machine again if the weight is too light. [2] X Research source If you experience pain or discomfort, stop using the machine immediately."
    },
    {
      "title": "Increase your weight as you get stronger.",
      "content": "Increase your weight as you get stronger. When a weight feels too light for you, try the next highest setting. Use that weight until it also feels too easy for you. Slowly increase your weight over time so you’re less likely to injure yourself. [3] X Research source If you have trouble remembering which weight you use for each machine, keep track of the weights in your phone. That way it’ll be easier to set the weight each time you go to the gym."

    {
      "title": "Sit on the attached seat with your back against the cushion.",
      "content": "Sit on the attached seat with your back against the cushion. Push your bottom against the back of the seat and adjust yourself until you’re comfortable. Sit up straight so your muscles are engaged, which will help you reduce your risk of injury. Check that your back feels supported. [4] X Research source Some lower back machines let you adjust the height of the seat. If yours has this feature, use the lever to move the seat up or down until the height feels comfortable."

    {
      "title": "Adjust the upper roller so it’s against your shoulder blades.",
      "content": "Adjust the upper roller so it’s against your shoulder blades. The seat should have a padded roller near the top of it. Use the lever on the side of the machine to move the roller backward or forward if necessary to adjust it. Set the roller so it’s comfortably against your shoulder blades. [5] X Research source The upper roller will push the weights as you lean back."

    {
      "title": "Place both feet flat on the footrest.",
      "content": "Place both feet flat on the footrest. Look for the footrest right in front of you. Move your feet onto the footrest and adjust them until you feel comfortable. [6] X Research source The footrest will likely be a metal plate or bar. It may have rubber on it to help keep your feet from sliding."

      "title": "Cross your arms over your chest in an \"X.",
      "content": "Cross your arms over your chest in an \"X. \" If you wiggle around while you’re using the machine, you may accidentally hurt yourself. Keep your arms crossed over your chest to help your core stay tight. This will help you maintain your balance. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Lean forward to get into the starting position.",
      "content": "Lean forward to get into the starting position. Hinge forward at your waist slightly so that you’re leaning forward at a slight angle. Keep your back straight and your face forward. This is your starting position for each rep. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Take a deep breath and tighten your core.",
      "content": "Take a deep breath and tighten your core. Breathe in through your nose and draw the air down into your lungs. As you do this, engage your ab muscles to support you during the rep. [10] X Research source Try to keep your upper body as straight as possible. This will help you work your muscles while also lowering your risk of hurting yourself."

    {
      "title": "Exhale as you slowly lean back as low as you comfortably can.",
      "content": "Exhale as you slowly lean back as low as you comfortably can. Slowly release the air out of your mouth. As you exhale, lean back in the seat, pushing against the weighted roller. Lower your upper body back as far as you can. [11] X Research source Your movement should be slow, so don’t rock back and forth. Concentrate on keeping your muscles engaged. Over time, you can expand your range of motion and go back further. However, it's important to take it slow and listen to your body so you're less likely to get hurt. If you experience any pain, stop using the lower back machine until you talk to your doctor."

    {
      "title": "Inhale as you slowly come back up to complete 1 rep.",
      "content": "Inhale as you slowly come back up to complete 1 rep. Slowly breathe in through your nose as you bring your upper body back to the start position. Then, slowly exhale through your mouth to finish your rep. [12] X Research source Take your time as you come back up. This can work both your abs and your lower back muscles."

    {
      "title": "Repeat for your desired number of reps.",
      "content": "Repeat for your desired number of reps. Since there’s no recommended number of reps for a lower back machine, choose a rep goal that fits your needs. You might start out with a goal of 10-12 reps until you get used to the machine. Then, you might increase your goal up to 25 reps. Do 2-3 sets on the lower back machine 2-3 times per week. [13] X Research source As an alternative, you might start with 10 reps at each weight and slowly work your way up to 25 as the weight becomes easier. When 25 reps feel easy, move up to the next weight. If you’ve worked with a trainer, use the rep goal they gave you for the lower back machine. Since the lower back machine is a strength training workout, only use it 2-3 times per week to work your upper body."
