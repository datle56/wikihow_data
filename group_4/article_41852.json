      "content": "Schedule 1 to 2 hours of study sessions into each day of the week. Finding time to study can be super hard, but it’ll be easier if you plan ahead. Go over your schedule for the week and identify pockets of time you can use for studying. You don't have to do it all at one time, so it's okay to schedule several short study sessions. Mark these times in your agenda or calendar so you won’t forget. [1] X Research source You can use a paper agenda or your phone’s calendar. Try to study for at least 1 hour every day so you can really learn and memorize the material. You may want to study longer than that each day if you need more time to review the material. If you have the same daily schedule, you might plan your study sessions for the same time, like every day from 4:00 to 5:30 p.m. You could also split up the sessions, such as 6:00 to 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 to 5:45 p.m. If your schedule varies, plan around your daily events. You might study on Monday from 8:00 to 9:30 p.m., Tuesday from 3:00 to 3:30 p.m. and 7:00 to 7:45 p.m., Wednesday from 6:00 to 7:15 p.m., etc."

      "content": "Organize your class materials so it’s easy to pull them out. You don’t want to waste any of your study time looking for stuff.

[2] X Expert Source Ashley Pritchard, MA School Counselor Expert Interview. 4 November 2019. If you always study in the same spot, such as a desk in your bedroom, keep your study materials in this area. If you like to study on the go, keep your materials together in a book bag."

      "content": "Pick a quiet, comfortable place to study . You don’t need a special spot to study. All you need is a quiet place with a table where you can spread out your materials.

If you’re not using your computer to study, turn it off, as well.

For example, try Offtime, BreakFree, Flipd, Moment, or AppDetox. [5] X Research source This way you won’t be tempted to give into distraction while you’re studying."

      "content": "Don’t try to cram at the last minute. You’re probably super busy, so you may feel like you don’t have time to study.

[6] X Research source You probably know people who brag about cramming for tests, but don’t take their word for it. Just do what’s best for you."

Fortunately, writing summaries helps you find these key concepts so you know what to study. After you read a section of text, summarize it in your own words in your notes. You might write something like, “Each governmental body has separate powers, and they can all check each others’ powers. This allows for checks and balances.” Reader Poll: We asked 382 wikiHow readers and 50% of them agreed that the most effective study guide format is a summary sheet . [Take Poll]"
