[2] X Research source It’s natural to feel hurt if you love someone who doesn’t return the feeling. Accepting that your feelings are normal can help you process them.

In fact, it's healthier to let yourself be sad than it is to try to suppress those emotions. [8] X Research source Denying or minimizing how you feel -- such as saying “It’s no big deal” or “I didn’t love them anyway” -- will actually make it worse in the long run. [9] X Research source If you can, take some time out of your life to process your sadness . This will help create a healing space for you to deal with your grief. For example: when you first realize (or are told) this person will not love you back, then you should take some time to be alone somewhere, even if it's just going for a 15-minute walk at work. Avoid wallowing in despair, however. If you haven't left your house in weeks, you aren't showering, and you're wearing that ratty old sweatshirt that should really just be burnt, you've gone overboard. It's natural to feel sad, but if you don't try to get focused on your life again, you'll just keep thinking about and loving that other person."

Your immediate reaction to learning that the other person doesn’t love you in the way you love them may be to think, “I will make them love me!” This type of thinking is very natural, but it’s also incorrect and unhelpful. The only thing you can control in life is your own actions and responses. You can’t persuade, argue, or bully someone into feeling something they don’t.

Just ask the other person to give you a little time to get past the feelings you’re working through. If the person really cares about you, they’ll give you what you need, even if it isn’t the most pleasant experience. If the person you're trying to stop loving is someone that you've relied heavily on in the past for emotional support, find a different friend to help fill that role. Ask a friend if you can reach out to him or her when you get the urge to talk to the person you're trying to avoid. De-friend the person on social media, or at least hide their posts. Delete the person from your phone so you aren't tempted to re-initiate contact. You don't want to be constantly reminded of the other person and everything they're doing.

Expressing your emotions, rather than bottling them up and waiting for them to explode, can help you accept that you’re going through a painful experience.

Don’t belittle yourself for feeling this way or try to ignore the feelings in the hopes they’ll go away. Express them openly and honestly. Cry if you want to. Crying can actually be therapeutic. It may reduce feelings of anxiety and anger, and can even reduce your body’s feelings of stress. If you want to grab a box of tissues and cry your eyes out, go for it. Avoid violent actions such as screaming, shouting, punching things, or breaking stuff. While this may “feel good” at first, research suggests that using violence to express your anger -- even towards an inanimate object -- can actually increase your angry feelings.

It’s very easy to idealize someone, especially if you have invested a lot of energy in falling in love with him or her. Stepping back to examine the reality -- without being cruel or judgmental -- can help you get some distance from that feeling of unrequited tragic love. It may also help you to think about the aspects of this person that would have created a difficult relationship between the two of you. For example: maybe their extreme social anxiety would make it nearly impossible for them to give you the validation you need in a relationship. Studies have even suggested that acknowledging negative things about the other person can help you get past romantic rejection more quickly. [16] X Research source Don’t fall into the trap of saying mean things about the other person to make yourself feel better, though. Ultimately, this type of thinking can make you feel even more bitter and angry, rather than helping you heal. Rejection temporarily lowers your IQ, believe it or not.

It may even hurt your chances of developing a genuine friendship with the person later. If you think there’s a chance you may do something you regret, ask your friends for help.

Work in the garden. Do math. Find something to engage you for long enough to get the person off your mind for a while. The more of a habit you make of not thinking about the person, the easier it will become. A handy trick is to set aside a certain amount of time that is designated for you to think about that person. Don’t make this a huge amount of time; 10-15 minutes will do. When you do find thoughts about the other person creeping into your head, you can say to those thoughts: \"Not now.

It can even be a smell (like apple pie, because you one time had an apple pie baking contest with him or her, for example). If you do unexpectedly encounter a trigger, as you probably will, it's best to acknowledge the moment and move on from it. Don't linger over the feeling that it will inevitably bring up. For example: if the song that you associate with them comes on the radio, turn the radio off or change the station. Acknowledge the sadness and regret that comes over you, and turn your attention to something positive or neutral (what you're going to have for dinner, that trip you have coming up). Remember, you're not going to have to avoid these triggers forever. You just want to make the healing as easy as possible and constant reminders make that process more difficult.

Make sure that it's someone that you trust. This could mean a friend that you know won't try to speed up your healing. It could mean a family member who lets you call them when you're feeling upset.

One good thing about journaling these feelings is that you'll be able to track your healing process, which will give you proof that it's possible to get over your unrequited love. Talking with someone who’s gone through something similar can be very helpful. You can ask them about their own experiences and how they coped. The people who have gone through the same experience can really understand one another's problem. You will have to describe less to them than others and they would be able to understand even more. Don't expect everyone to understand. People who have not gone through what your experience may not be able to empathize the way you would like them to. Develop your spirituality .

Sure, you put your heart out there and the other person didn’t want it. But you were strong and brave enough to be vulnerable! Without the willingness to accept vulnerability, we can’t connect with other people or experience deep emotions such as joy and love.

Some people may repeatedly fall for others who reject them, especially if you didn’t feel secure in your emotional attachment to your parents as a child.

You may find it helpful to talk through this with a therapist. Remind yourself that through this experience, you’re learning things like strength and self-reliance. Being rejected isn’t the most enjoyable ways to hone these skills, but if you focus on learning rather than wallowing, you’ll emerge stronger on the other side.
