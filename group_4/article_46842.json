The easiest way to find out is to search the internet for your phone model's specs (or your phone model and the words \"IR blaster\") and see what comes up. Fewer Androids come with IR blasters these days, but you'll find them on some models. Modern HTC and Samsung models no longer come with IR blasters, but you can often find them on newer models released by Huawei, Honor, and Xiaomi.

      "content": "Install an IR Universal Remote app if you don't already have one. Before downloading a new app , check your app drawer for a built-in remote control/IR blaster app. Most Androids that come with an IR blaster component installed also have a pre-installed app that can do this. If you don't see one, there are many free and paid apps on the Google Play Store you can use to control your home audio and video devices. Some popular and highly-reviewed options are Universal TV Remote Control by CodeMatics and AnyMote Universal Remote + WiFi Smart Home Control by Color Tiger. You may have to try a few different apps before you find the one that best suits you. [2] X Research source Not all IR apps are universal remote control apps. Some are for specific brands. Be sure to read the app's description before installing. For example, you can use Mi Remote only for Xiaomi phones."
