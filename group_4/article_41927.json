      "content": "Choose this short, low-maintenance style to control your waves. If you don’t want to maintain or style your hair every day, then a crew cut works perfectly. Let your hair go natural since you may not even notice the waves in your hair if it’s short enough. If you still have a few stray hairs to tame, just apply a fingertip-sized amount of matte pomade or styling cream and brush it through your hair. [1] X Research source Crew cuts work best if you have thick hair. Taper the length of the hair on the side of your head to give your crew cut a more prominent appearance."

      "content": "Comb short or medium locks to one side for a sleek and clean look. Get your hair damp so it’s a little easier to work with. Use a wide-toothed comb to find your hair’s natural part. Blow-dry your hair as you comb to shape it toward the side and front of your head. [2] X Research source Rub some toning putty or pomade in your hair with your fingers to keep it from getting frizzy or poofy throughout the day. [3] X Research source Use a blow dryer as you comb your hair if you want to straighten out your waves. If your hair still doesn’t stay in place, apply some hairspray to help it hold."

      "title": "Keep your hair longer on top of your head for a trendy, modern style.",
      "content": "Keep your hair longer on top of your head for a trendy, modern style. Work a matte styling cream or pomade into the longer hair on top of your head. Use your fingers or a comb to sweep your hair forward so the sides stay clearly defined. From there, you can comb your hair up to add more volume or leave your hair down on your forehead for a relaxed look. [4] X Research source Fades pair well with other longer styles, such as fringes, quiffs, and pompadours. You can either start from bare skin or with any hair length that’s shorter than what you have on the top of your head."

      "title": "Cover your forehead with medium-length hair for a messy look.",
      "content": "Cover your forehead with medium-length hair for a messy look. Rub some anti-frizz oil or serum into your hair so your waves don’t get poofy later in the day. If you want your hair to look a little straighter, use a brush or comb to bring it toward the front of your head so your bangs hang over your forehead. For a messier, more natural look, just use your fingers instead. [5] X Research source Fringes work well no matter your hair length, but longer hair might get in your eyes. If you want to accentuate your waves, wrap some strands of hair tightly around your fingers to define the curls. If you want an asymmetrical look, keep your hair pushed to one side of your forehead and leave the rest natural."

      "content": "Sweep medium or long hair up out of your face for a casual style. Get your hair damp and work a matte styling cream into it. Use your fingers or a flat brush to bring the hair on top of your head forward toward your forehead to help control your waves. Then, brush your hair straight up and to one side of your head going away from your natural part to add some volume. [6] X Research source To help your hair stay in the same shape throughout the day, use a blow dryer while you’re styling. [7] X Research source Quiffs can also help hide any thinning hair on the crown of your head. If you have a long and thin face, keep the hair on the sides of your head a little longer and avoid adding volume or height to the top of your head."

      "content": "Try out this striking style to add some volume to medium or long hair. Let your hair dry naturally or blow-dry your hair in the opposite direction that it grows for the same effect. When it’s dry, work a soft pomade, sculpting clay, or styling cream from the roots to the tips of your hair with a comb. [8] X Research source Then, bring your hair straight up and pull it back to your scalp so it has some additional height and volume. [9] X Research source Use hairspray when you finish styling your hair if you’re worried about it losing its shape throughout the day. If you have thick heavy hair, use thinning scissors to remove some of the weight on top of your head. However, this might make your hair frizzy or more textured if it’s dry or coarse."

      "content": "Give this long-haired look a shot if you want a bold, voluminous style. Apply some matte gel or pomade in your hair so it’s easier to work with and so it holds its shape. Work your hair up and toward the middle of your head until it stands up on its own. Then, just use your hands to push your hair together until it has the shape of a mohawk. For a bolder style, work your hair into spikes or push the front of your style over your forehead to accentuate your natural waves. [10] X Research source Faux hawks look great and more defined when you pair them with a fade or undercut."

After you wash your hair, apply some smooth styling cream or a moisturizing spray to your hair so it doesn’t get frizzy. Blow-dry your hair and brush it back with a comb so your hair is out of your face and hugs your scalp. Apply some shiny pomade or cream into your hair and comb it in to keep your hair in place. [11] X Research source If you want a looser style, run your fingers through your hair and let some of your natural waves show through."

Use a blow-dryer to push your bangs back and off of your forehead. [12] X Research source Then run your fingers through your hair going from the front toward the back. You don’t have to use any product if you want a truly natural look. Otherwise, put some light hold styling cream on your fingers and work it into your hair from the roots down to the tips. Throughout the day, keep running your hands through your hair to train it into its natural shape. [13] X Research source Visit a barber every few months to trim the tips of your hair and get rid of split ends. Use a comb instead of your fingers if you want your hair to look more neat and structured."

Hold your hair in place and wrap an elastic band twice around the bun so it doesn’t come undone. For a messier look, leave some strands outside of the bun to show off your hair’s natural texture. [14] X Research source If you want to show off your natural waves, only put half of your hair in a bun and let the other half hang loose."
