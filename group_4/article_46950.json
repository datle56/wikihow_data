AHAs work at the skin’s surface level to remove dead skin cells, so it’s not overly-drying or harsh on dry skin. Oily skin: Try BHAs to improve skin texture and clarity. BHAs work both at the surface level and deep within the pores to remove any congestion. Aging and acne-prone skin: Choose retinoids for fresh, evenly-toned skin. Retinoids are antioxidants that increase cell turnover, declogging pores, reducing lines and texture, and calming the skin."
