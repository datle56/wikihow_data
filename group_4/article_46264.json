      "content": "Pick between oil based or water based pomade. Oil based pomade is the more traditional choice, but water based is a bit more popular. The choice depends on the look you’re going for with your hair. [1] X Research source Oil based pomades tend to be the a bit less expensive than water based pomades. They give a much greasier and shinier look than water based, and they typically have a much stronger hold. The negative side is that oil based pomades are water insoluble, so it won’t wash out with just water. It’s also hard to get it out by washing with shampoo as well. There are degreasing shampoos available, but they might strip your hair of its natural oils. Water based pomades are much more user friendly, but a bit costlier. This type of pomade gives you a similar look to oil based pomades, but will wash out with water. Water based pomades aren’t as strong as oil based, but they will keep the hold as well as maintain flexibility to restyle throughout the day."

      "content": "Decide what strength of hold you need. Pomades are sold in different strengths which will give your hair different amounts of hold. Research different brands of pomade to find out if they give a light, medium, or strong hold. If you’re new to using pomade, start with one that has a light hold. This will allow you to get a feel for how to style your hair and still allow you to change the style throughout the day. Pomades that give a light hold are soft, and pomades that give a stronger hold are harder. If you have thicker hair, you might want to opt for a medium or strong hold. You can also ask friends and family for recommendations. For example, you might have a friend or sibling with a similar hair type as yours. Ask them what they use. You may need to try several different products before you find the right 1 for you. You might look for trial sizes or samples to keep the costs down."
