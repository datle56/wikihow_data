      "content": "Recall if you’ve been in contact with someone who has herpes. Whitlow, also known as herpetic whitlow, is a skin infection that’s caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), a common and highly contagious virus. Whitlow usually causes painful blisters to appear on a person’s fingers, with some rare cases also causing blisters to appear on a person’s toes. If you’ve come into contact with someone who has HSV, it’s possible that you may have contracted the virus, especially if you came into direct contact with the blisters caused by HSV. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source HSV most often causes painful blisters to appear around a person’s mouth (oral herpes) or around their genitals (genital herpes). [2] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source There are 2 types of HSV: HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-1 commonly affects the face and often causes cold sores (painful blisters on the lips), whereas HSV-2 tends to cause painful genital blisters. HSV-1 can spread through kissing or oral sex, while HSV-2 can spread through skin-to-skin contact with infected genitals. HSV can have a long-dormant period. There’s a chance you may have contracted herpes long ago, but the virus may have stayed dormant in the nerve cells. Being stressed or getting sick are common triggers for the activation of the virus."

      "content": "Monitor for early symptoms, such as tingling or unusual pain. In the early phase (prodrome) of any disease, you may first notice unusual sensations in one or more of your fingers, such as a localized pain or tingling sensation. These symptoms usually appear 2 to 20 days after initial exposure. Other possible symptoms include: [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Fever Fatigue Numbness in the infected area Tenderness around the infected area Herpetic whitlow can also appear on your toes, though it’s uncommon.

      "content": "Note any painful blisters or fluid-filled bumps on your finger. Once the initial prodrome phase has passed, you’ll see more specific symptoms that clearly point to whitlow. These include swelling, redness, or a rash around the infected area, as well as fluid-filled vesicles that usually form in a honeycomb-like group. In many cases, whitlow only affects one finger, though there have been cases where people have had multiple fingers affected. The vesicles may rupture and release a white, clear, or bloody fluid. Ulceration, or a break in the skin, may develop later. These vesicles may merge and take on a black/brown color. The skin around your nail may also darken to a red or purplish color. Other symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenitis) around the elbow (epitrochlear) or armpit (axillary) and swelling of the hands, Symptoms usually resolve within 2 to 4 weeks, and the first case of whitlow is usually the most severe."

      "content": "Keep the vesicles covered and avoid picking at them. Wrap your finger with a bandage or gauze to help you avoid subconsciously scratching or picking at the blisters. Picking at or bursting the vesicles can open the wound and put you at risk for a bacterial infection. Do not drain or pop the blisters: When you pop or drain the blisters, the fluid that’s released can transmit the virus to other parts of your body or other people if they come into contact with it."

      "title": "Keep your finger from touching other people or easily-infected areas.",
      "content": "Keep your finger from touching other people or easily-infected areas. Since the virus can spread through contact, avoiding touching other people or other areas of your body with the infected area. In particular, avoid touching body parts that contain fluids or bodily secretions, such as the eyes, mouth, tongue, genitals, ears, and breasts. Avoid wearing contacts until the infection has resolved itself. Using your fingers to put in your contacts carries a great risk of spreading the infection to your eyes. If a child has been infected, ensure they’re not sucking on the infected finger or touching their eyes, mouth, or any other body area that contains bodily fluids."

Fill a container or sink with warm water that’s deep enough for you to fully submerge your hand. Soak the infected area for 10 to 20 minutes. When you’re done soaking, dry off the area completely and rewrap it in a clean, dry bandage.

The cold will numb the nerves in the surrounding area, relieving the pain. It can also help reduce any inflammation or swelling that would contribute to the pain. [10] X Research source Never apply ice directly to your skin. Only apply the ice pack for up to 20 minutes at a time. [11] X Research source"

If you’re able to get an official diagnosis of whitlow within 48 hours after your symptoms start, the doctor will often be able to prescribe you an antiviral medication. The medicine may come in the form of a topical cream or pills that you take orally. These antivirals will often work to lessen the severity of the infection and your symptoms, as well as promote faster healing. [14] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source These antivirals are typically only effective within those first 48 hours, so it’s important that you talk to your doctor as soon as you notice symptoms.

If you try to burst or drain the vesicles on your finger on your own, it’s possible that debris and bacteria can cause a more serious infection. Whitlow is a viral infection, but your symptoms may be made worse if a bacterial infection also occurs. This type of infection will often result in a darker discoloration, an odor coming from the infected area and blisters, and a discharge of white pus. [16] X Research source The doctors might order a complete blood count with differential in order to measure your white blood cell count if they suspect a bacterial infection. [17] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source The white blood cell count will be high if you have a bacterial infection.

Once the bacterial infection is confirmed, your doctor will likely prescribe you an antibiotic which can come as an oral medication or topical cream.
