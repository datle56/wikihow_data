Otherwise, use a marker to write the information directly on the container.

[7] X Trustworthy Source State of Massachusetts Official website for the State of Massachusetts Go to source If your plastic wrap doesn’t seem super secure, hold it in place with some tape. Some test kits might come with a “ toilet hat ” that goes directly over your toilet bowl and is held in place with the toilet seat. True to its name, it resembles an upside-down hat.
