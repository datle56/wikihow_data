This contract will tell you the procedures you must follow when you have a dispute with the bank. [7] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Even if you don't have an account with the bank, all banks have a statement of terms and conditions that cover any application or transaction made at that bank. You can usually get a copy of this document from the bank's website, or by asking for one at a branch. Most of these contracts have mandatory arbitration clauses. This means that in most instances, you won't be able to sue the bank. If you file a lawsuit, the judge will merely dismiss your lawsuit and tell you that you have to submit your dispute to arbitration. There are some situations, however, where you still may be able to file a lawsuit, such as if you believe the bank discriminated against you."

An arbitration hearing is relatively formal, but the rules are typically a little more relaxed than court rules. Since you filed the initial claim, you (or your attorney) typically will present your arguments and evidence first. You may call witnesses or introduce documents that support your claim. After you conclude, the bank's lawyers will present their arguments and evidence as to why you shouldn't succeed in your claim. You may be called on to testify. The arbitrators will make a decision based on their understanding of the dispute, the evidence and arguments presented, and any laws or regulations that apply. The arbitration decision is typically final, meaning if they don't decide in your favor you cannot appeal."

A demand letter is a formal business letter that sets forth the facts of your dispute and what you want the bank to do to resolve the situation. [9] X Research source Make a copy of your signed letter before you send it. Then mail your letter using certified mail with return receipt requested. You can use the receipt as proof that the bank received your letter.

Since most bank disputes involve written contracts, look for the statute of limitations for written contracts. It's typically 4 or 5 years. [10] X Research source You may be suing the bank for some reason unrelated to your account. For example, you may want to sue the bank because you slipped and fell in the lobby. In that case, you would be looking for the personal injury statute of limitations, which is usually much shorter than the statute of limitations for written contracts (sometimes a year or less)."

The amount varies widely among courts, but is typically less than $100. If you can't afford to pay the fee, ask the clerk if it's possible to get a waiver.

Some courts require you to file this form with the clerk in advance. In other courts, you simply bring it with you to your hearing.
