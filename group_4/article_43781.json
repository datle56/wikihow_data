      "title": "Stop thinking of coworkers as friends.",
      "content": "Stop thinking of coworkers as friends. Men value the feelings and thoughts of those close to them, but tend to worry less about coworkers and acquaintances. Women, however, expect openness, equality, and honesty from anyone they spend significant time with, including coworkers. In the standard hierarchical workplace, this will lead to disappointment and confusion for women."

      "title": "Speak up.",
      "content": "Speak up. Whether you’re at a departmental meeting or briefing a small team, express yourself to the group. Men tend to speak more often in large groups to preserve social standing and demonstrate verbal ability. Tell a story, a joke, or present a report to demonstrate your oratory skill and command of the facts. [1] X Research source While women are typically thought of as great communicators, they communicate in a way that facilitates friendship. In a competitive workplace, this can be detrimental. When speaking, men take fewer pauses and are less concerned with how their listeners feel."

      "title": "Analyze situations objectively.",
      "content": "Analyze situations objectively. Men find it easy to set feelings aside in order to make practical decisions based on facts alone. Women, by contrast, tend to make decisions based on how people will feel and their own intuition. [2] X Research source Use charts, graphs, and hard data when making a business decision."

      "title": "Don’t be afraid of STEM.",
      "content": "Don’t be afraid of STEM. From an early age, people are taught that math, science, and technology are masculine while the arts are feminine. Challenge the notion that your gender is an impediment to your STEM abilities. Read up on science news, catch an episode of Cosmos, and try out new geeky gadgets, games, and apps. [3] X Research source If you're a student, enroll in a science or math class."

      "title": "Acknowledge your limits and abilities.",
      "content": "Acknowledge your limits and abilities. Whether it’s a project you don’t feel comfortable taking on or a small favor a coworker asks you to do, say no if you can’t do it – or just don’t want to. Men have think nothing of turning down excessive assignments. On the other hand, if you are interested in a raise, a new position at your company, or greater responsibility, tell your supervisor explicitly that you're interested. [4] X Research source Don’t be afraid of being seen as demanding or pushy. Women often have a hard time saying no to additional responsibilities because they don’t want to be thought of as lazy and are genuinely more inclined to help others than men are. To think like a man, overcome these tendencies and realize that saying no is a sign of strength and self-respect, not laziness. Men believe they deserve the salaries and raises they seek. [5] X Research source Be assertive and believe in yourself when thinking about whether to pursue a raise or negotiate your salary. Act with a sense of entitlement."

      "title": "Communicate openly and honestly.",
      "content": "Communicate openly and honestly. Women often dance around a topic or express themselves in more subtle ways than men. Men, by comparison, are more likely to state their thoughts directly and promptly. Share whatever is on your mind in an unambiguous way. Don’t drop hints about a problem or issue. Be direct and say exactly what you’re thinking and feeling. [6] X Research source Be honest with yourself as well as your partner. If you are interested in taking your relationship to the next level, let your partner know. Alternately, if you want to keep things casual, make sure you and your partner are on the same page. Men tend to speak less in private than in public. Try to build rapport with others by doing things rather than talking about things."

      "title": "Exercise your spatial skills.",
      "content": "Exercise your spatial skills. Men are better than women at envisioning and remembering objects or new spaces. This is because male brains have a thinner parietal region (the area of the brain that processes visual information). [7] X Research source [8] X Research source Crafting a model, building a Lego kit, or playing a sport like soccer will help you think more spatially. You could also try drawing a map of a place you are familiar with."

      "title": "Don’t worry, be happy.",
      "content": "Don’t worry, be happy. Men and women both worry, but women are more likely to continue worrying long after men have stopped. To think like a man, let go of small relationship issues, family matters, or troubles at the work place that you cannot solve. [9] X Research source To worry less, set aside a designated time for your worries. Cut back on your internet surfing and try to get more exercise. You might also to find something that requires active engagement to distract you, like reading a book or painting a picture. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Prove your independence. While people like to feel desired, it's also good for them to know that their partner can care for themselves. Men are reared to act and think independently. [11] X Research source Demonstrating that you can take care of yourself at work and in your social life will boost your self-confidence and let others know you are a capable, independent person. Financial security can go a long way to feeling independent and living an independent life. Women are often expected to provide only a supplementary income and focus on children while their male partner acts as primary breadwinner.

      "content": "Keep your emotions in check. If your first instinct is to yell, weep, or storm out in a huff – don’t. Count patiently to ten and try to come at the conversation or problem a different way. Women have more brain circuitry devoted to expressing and remembering emotions, so tamping down on the emotional instinct is an important step to thinking like a man. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Let go of the details. Women tend to fixate on and recall small moments that men do not.

      "title": "Focus less on your appearance.",
      "content": "Focus less on your appearance. Women are surrounded with pervasive messages that they need to look perfect. Men are not bombarded with the same kind of pressure to conform to a superficial standard of beauty, and tend to have better body image as a result. [16] X Research source To think more like a man, learn to accept your appearance or body. Don’t fret over your imperfections. Stand in front of the mirror with your feet apart and declare to yourself \"I’m awesome.” Do this every day until you believe it."
