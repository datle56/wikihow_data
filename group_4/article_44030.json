      "content": "Use leave-in conditioner after you wash your hair. Curly hair tends to be dry, so apply a leave-in conditioner before you get out of the shower to give your locks a dose of moisture. The conditioner will also help to prevent frizz, which can be a constant battle for those with curls, and assist in detangling your wet hair. [1] X Research source The best way to detangle curly hair is by using a wide-toothed comb and working from tip to root. Wet your hair, and add a detangling conditioner or similar product. Then, gently work the comb through the tips before combing the full head from the roots down. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Follow up with a curl cream. Once you’ve conditioned and detangled your damp mane, apply a curl cream product to help enhance and define your curls. Put a dime-sized amount in your palm, then rub your palms together. Smooth the product on your hair, starting just shy of your scalp and working it down to the tips. Work in palm-sized sections until you’ve coated all of your hair with the cream. [3] X Research source Choose a curl cream made with Moroccan or Argan oil if you need help taming frizz. If you don't have naturally curly hair, swap out the curl cream for a product like a style primer to help your curls hold once you style them in."

      "content": "Try applying styling products with the “praying hands” technique. When applying curl cream or styling gel, the praying hands technique can help you get even coverage. Apply a small amount of product to your palms and rub them together. Take one section of hair and clap your hands together, with the hair in between them, starting at the roots. Pull your hands down toward the tips of that section of hair. Continue in this way until you’ve covered all of your hair. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Scrunch your damp hair.",
      "content": "Scrunch your damp hair. Go ahead and part your hair the way you want it to fall once it’s dried and styled. Lean your head to one side and cup your hand underneath a section so that the tips are brushing your palm. Lift up to grab onto a section of hair, then make a fist while you lift your hand and the hair up to your scalp. This is a “scrunch.” Scrunch your hair liberally, then lean to the other side and do the same thing. [5] X Research source Scrunching will enhance your curls and start the process of helping them set. [6] X Research source For extra volume, flip your hair over and scrunch with both hands for about a minute or so."

      "content": "Finger coil tighter curls to help define and set them. If you already have ringlet style curls, you may need to finger coil them rather than scrunching. Wrap small pieces of your hair around your finger, starting at the roots and running to the ends. Then, gently pull your finger out to free the coil."

      "title": "Twist damp hair and let it set.",
      "content": "Twist damp hair and let it set. To amp up curls without using a hair dryer, give the “twist out” technique a try. After applying a styling gel, grab a small section of hair, then divide it in two. Twist the two pieces around each other, starting at the roots and working your way down to the tips. Continue twisting sections of hair in this pattern until you’ve twisted all of it. Let your hair air-dry for at least a couple hours and up to overnight. Then gently unravel the twists. [7] X Research source Depending upon your hair's length and thickness, you can do between 10-30 twists. The longer your hair, the more options you have. Short hair needs tighter twists, while longer hair can have any size twist. The tighter the twist, the tighter the curl."

      "content": "Dry your hair and set your curls with a diffuser. Set your hair dryer to “low” and aim it at your hair. As you dry, continue to scrunch your hair the entire time. When your hair is about halfway dry, flip your head over and cup sections of your hair in your hand, continuing to scrunch your hair to the roots. Flip your head back up and finish off with a few more scrunches. [8] X Research source Invest in a high-quality hair diffuser, since this is a critical tool for those with curly hair. Flipping your head over to scrunch will add bounce and volume. If your hair is very thick and you don’t want extra volume, avoid doing this."

      "content": "Wash your hair with curl-enhancing shampoo and conditioner. Start working on getting tight curls before the styling even begins by using curl-enhancing hair products in the shower. Do some scrunching as you apply the shampoo and conditioner to enhance and encourage even tighter curls. Rinse your hair thoroughly, since any leftover residue will weigh your curls down."

      "content": "Use a quality curl cream. Don’t skimp on this key product. Curl creams help tame frizz, create texture and define spiral curls. Curl creams also keep your hair soft, while many other styling products may result in “crunchy” curls. Look for curl cream products that create a tight, intense curl; avoid the creams marketed for wavy hair. Some creams claim to be root stimulators, which can also help you take your curls to the next level. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a curl-defining product after styling.",
      "content": "Use a curl-defining product after styling. Curl-defining creams and pomades are applied to dry, just-styled hair. They help separate your ringlets while also fighting frizzing and adding a bit of texture. Put a small amount on your fingertips, then rub your fingertips together so that you can work with both hands. Gently apply to small sections of hair with your fingers, lightly squeezing and scrunching your ringlets to encourage separation and definition. A small amount of styling gel can be applied in the same way to get a similar result with a stronger hold. Just be sure to avoid gels that contain alcohol, as these can dry out the hair."

The product will reactivate your curls and restore bounce and shine to your locks. Look for lightweight sprays and mists. [10] X Research source"

Use a small amount of curl cream or styling gel to boost your ringlets. Flip your hair over and diffuse as you scrunch to revive hair that’s gone a little flat. You can also get your hair lightly damp prior to diffusing to intensify the effects."

Pull your hair up to keep it from getting wet and take your morning shower. Crank up the warm water to make sure you get plenty of steam going. When you step out of the shower, take down your hair and use a little leave-in conditioner or curl crème to enhance your curls further. Give your hair a few scrunches before you head out the door. [11] X Research source Exercise caution when using this method. Steam can refresh curls, but it can also cause some hair to frizz."

Leave it like this for a few hours or even overnight. Take out the scrunchie, shake out your curls and use a small amount of curl cream as you fluff and scrunch your hair into place.

If the ends of your hair look straighter than the virgin hair growing from the roots, it’s definitely time for a trim. Snip off those split ends and your ringlets will spring back into place.
