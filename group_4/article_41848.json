Optionally, write out how to pronounce the word, and an example sentence using the word. You can find example sentences by searching for the word online. Try to find an online news article or book, since those are more likely to use the word correctly. Your flashcards don't need to be fancy as long as they help you learn new words.

      "content": "Color code the cards (optional). Color coding can help you sort cards if you're studying a large number at once. Pull out your highlighters and color the word side of the card. Here are a few systems you could use: One color for each vocabulary lesson or chapter. One color for each topic (food words, traveling words, etc.). One color for each part of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.)."

      "title": "Sort the cards as you test yourself.",
      "content": "Sort the cards as you test yourself. To test yourself, shuffle the cards and look at the top one. Read the word aloud, then say what you think the definition is. Turn it over and check yourself. Put cards you got right in one pile, and cards you got wrong in another pile. If you're testing yourself on the go, bring along rubber bands to hold the two piles. Most electronic apps have the option to test yourself like this. They may also have games and alternate tests you can use."

      "content": "Keep testing yourself. Reread the pile of cards you got wrong, on both sides. Shuffle them and test yourself in the same way. Keep setting aside the cards you get wrong, so you can repeat this until there are no cards left. The length of time to do this will vary depending on how many cards you have.

Waiting a short time between tests can help commit the words to your long-term memory. Try tackling 20-50 new words per week if you're learning a new language. Focus on most general and essential words before moving on to more specific ones. [6] X Expert Source Tian Zhou Language Specialist Expert Interview. 22 March 2021."

      "content": "Make connections between the words and definitions. You'll find it easier to remember a word if you connect it to something else in your mind. It doesn't matter how silly it is; you can use anything that will make you think of the definition. For example, the word \"thespian\" means \"actor.\" Think of an actor asked to play a spy, doing \"the spying'.\" This works for foreign languages as well, especially ones closely related to your own language. For example, the Spanish word \"cine\" means \"movie theater,\" just like \"cinema\" in English."
