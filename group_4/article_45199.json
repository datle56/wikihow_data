      "content": "Make them feel seen and special. Compliment them and make them feel good about themselves. Show them you care about them as a person and that you’re paying attention. Ask them about their day, and about their likes and dislikes. Taking them out to dinner and a movie is nice, but that's not where the romance is: the romance is in knowing how to treat them right. Listen to your partner. Make them feel important by asking them about their life. Compliment them on their looks, on how they dress, or the way they smile, as long as you are sincere.

      "content": "Doing something unexpected will pique their interest. Jeney suggests small romantic gestures to get your partner feeling good: “It could be anything thoughtful like ‘I made you lunch today.’ It could be ‘I'm going to rub your back tonight when you get home from work,’ just like being very, very thoughtful about what your partner might need without them asking.” Spontaneity and intentionality are “always really romantic,” Jeney says. “There's a difference between ‘We're going to go get dinner because we have to eat’ versus ‘Hey, I made dinner reservations for us at this really cool new place in the city.’”"

      "title": "Be fun, sexy, and playful.",
      "content": "Be fun, sexy, and playful. Let them know you find them desirable. Sprinkle suggestive comments or even direct comments into your conversation to let them know what you're thinking. Be flirty and playful. Try casually touching them. Brush their shoulder with your fingers, wrap an arm around them and give them a squeeze, run your fingers through their hair, tickle them—anything playful and light to let them know you want to be more intimate. Jeney advises making eye contact and “holding it for a few seconds at a time and maybe looking back [to send] a signal that you're interested…. Expressions [with] your eyebrows and winking…could be considered flirting with your eyes.” Don't be too coy about the compliments. If that dress your partner is wearing makes them look hotter than Arizona in August, tell them! Don't be crude, but if they've “packaged” their assets to be admired, let them know that's appreciated."

      "content": "Confidence is a major turn-on. Odds are, your partner likes it when you’re feeling good about yourself ! If you’re not feeling confident , fake it ‘til you make it. And keep this in mind: the more you \"bluff\" confidence, the more confident you will become—it's sort of a win-win situation. Help yourself feel more confident by wearing clothes you feel comfortable and attractive in and adopting straight but relaxed posture. You’ll look the part—but you’ll likely also feel better and more empowered. If you struggle with confidence regularly, try to be aware of negative self-talk as it flits through your head. Challenge any negative thoughts with positive affirmations. For example, if you feel like you’re not good enough, try thinking about all of your good qualities and any personal achievements you feel proud of.

Don't shove your tongue down their throat on the first kiss—work up to it. Kiss them like you mean it, and tease their lips with your teeth and tongue. [3] X Research source Respond to their reactions: if they pull away when you try to kiss them, they may not be up for it. Go back to step one next time, and try again. If they do respond, pay attention to their body language. If they are kissing but guarded, don't proceed further until their body language lets you know it's OK: they should reciprocate your kiss, or display open body language to let you know they’re comfortable.

Whether you’re in a long-distance relationship or you just want to let your partner know you’re thinking about them at work, a sexy message sent straight to their pocket is the perfect way to turn them on.

      "content": "Send nudes or just suggestive pics. Up your sexting game by adding some visuals. You don't have to get X-rated (though you can); even just a photo of you biting your lip will likely get your partner going. [5] X Research source Just make sure you have their permission to send sexy photos first, if you want to send some, and realize they may not want to send a photo back if they’re not comfortable with it. Consider the context in which they might open the text: if they work in a busy office where anyone might see a naughty photo you send them, best to avoid sexting until you know they’re alone! To avoid the above happening, try texting them, “Are you alone?” and wait for permission to send a photo. Asking first also has the double benefit of piquing their interest and making them curious for what you’re about to send."

[7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Where exactly you should touch them likely depends on your relationship: have you just started dating? Have you been intimate before? Have you been married for a while? As a general rule of thumb, be less handsy if you’re new to touching each other or ask for permission first, and always respect your partner if they tell you to stop or if they remove your hands, no matter how long you’ve been together."

      "content": "Don't be afraid to be bold, and direct. Pull them on top of you, so that whatever you want to kiss is near your lips. Roll yourself on top of them, and kiss them harder than you have so far. If your partner likes dominating you, try putting yourself under them. Don’t force or pressure your partner into anything, and observe their body language to make sure they’re into everything you’re doing. If they pull back from your touch or seem to stiffen up, these are good signs they’re not enjoying what you’re doing. Remember that you will often receive as much as you will give. If you're in the mood and want them to go out of their way to please you, try going above and beyond for them."

Of course, when in doubt, speak up and tell them exactly what you like or ask what they like— “Kiss me harder,” “I love how you’re doing that,” “Show me what you want.”"

Many adults watch porn alone, but did you know watching porn alongside your partner can boost your sexual intimacy and feelings of closeness? [8] X Research source Ask your partner if they’d want to watch a sexy video with you, and sit together—clothed or not—and feel the sexual tension rise! If you’re not sure if your partner is into porn, or you’re not sure how they’d feel about watching it together, communicate with them clearly about your intentions first. Ideally, have this conversation in advance so you can both be more level-headed and rational: “So, John, I was thinking about our sex life, and I was wondering how you’d feel about watching porn together? I hear it can be super hot.” Of course, just having the conversation may be enough to turn you both on!"

[11] X Research source Start the conversation so they know you're okay with it: “Ooh, baby, you like that?” is a good place to start. If they don’t seem to respond much, they might not be into it, so it’s best to let it go and maybe revisit the subject later, when you’re not in the throes of passion, to see how they feel about it."

[12] X Research source If you and your partner haven't used sex toys before, consider having a discussion about it before bringing them into the bedroom. Sex toys are totally normal and healthy, but some people may feel uncomfortable with them, so you might benefit from having an open conversation about why you'd like to use them. Consider turning an excursion to the sex shop into a hot date: pick out toys together to get the sexual tension flowing, and then go home and test them out."

[13] X Research source You can talk about this ahead of time—“Hey, babe, mind if I take the lead tonight?”—or take action in the moment to let them know what you want: for instance, if you’re normally more dominant, kneel before them to show you’re feeling more submissive."

Instead, don’t be afraid to take your time and go slow to increase the sexual tension . It’ll really rev your and your partner’s engines. [14] X Research source When they start removing your clothes—don't let them. Instead, do it yourself. When they go to touch (and they probably will), deny them. Keep this up until neither of you can stand it anymore. Slowing down sex not only increases the tension, it can help you both approach physical pleasure and intimacy more mindfully, leading to increased intimacy and better orgasms. [15] X Research source"
