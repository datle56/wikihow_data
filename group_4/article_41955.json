      "content": "Find an appropriate academic journal. If you are a scholar, your article will usually be best placed in an academic journal. These publications are typically categorized very specifically by topic. They also generally require a very rigorous review process. [1] X Research source Make sure that your research fits the scope of the journal. For example, if you are a scholar of European history, do not submit your article to a journal that focuses solely on East Asian history. Verify that the publication is peer-reviewed. This means that other scholars will review your work. Be aware that it may take a while to receive an answer from the editor. The review process for academic journals can often take several months."

      "content": "Propose an op-ed article. An op-ed is an opinion piece. It differs from a personal essay, which might just be telling a story.

If you feel a fee is appropriate, make sure that you pay it using the specified method."
