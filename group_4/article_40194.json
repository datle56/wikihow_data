Earthy and funky? Choose a name that captures the spirit of your starter, and sprinkle in bread-related puns or pop culture references for a humorous touch. Other ideas for naming your sourdough starter: [6] X Research source Use a sourdough starter name generator if you’re stumped on ideas. Name your starter after the place you live, such as the town or street, since the local yeast makes it unique. If you’re using a specific jar to grow your starter, you can name it after what was originally in the jar, such as “Pickle” or “Jammy.” Honor a loved one or the person who gave you the starter by naming it after them. For example, if your mom gifted you the starter, you could name it “Mama’s Microbe.” Add a baking-related twist to your favorite book, show, or movie. For example, you could use “Dough Vader” if you’re a Star Wars fan or “Doughzilla” if you love Godzilla . Think of iconic celebrities and historical figures, then give their name a sourdough spin. For example, you could name your starter “Taylor Sift” if you’re a Swiftie or Breadoncé if you’re part of the BeyHive."

      "title": "Why should you name your sourdough starter?",
      "content": "Why should you name your sourdough starter? Naming your starter makes the entire baking process more personal and enjoyable. Since your sourdough starter is a living collection of yeast and bacteria, it requires regular feeding and maintenance…sort of like having a pet. Giving your starter a name can make it feel like you’re taking care of something special and inject some fun and humor into the kitchen. Naming also helps with tracking and organization if you have more than one starter, plus serves as a fun conversation starter!"

      "title": "How do you feed your sourdough starter in the fridge?",
      "content": "How do you feed your sourdough starter in the fridge? Throw away about half of your starter, then add equal parts flour and water to the remaining starter for a 1:1:1: ratio. If you have 50 g of starter, for example, you can add 50 g of flour and 50 g of water. Mix the flour and water into the starter until it’s thoroughly combined, then let the starter sit at room temperature for an hour to let the fermentation process begin. Return it to the fridge until your next use. [7] X Research source Remember, you can’t store your starter in the fridge until it’s mature. That means you need to leave it on the counter and feed it twice a day during the establishment phase. Once it’s mature, you can store it in the fridge and feed it more infrequently."

      "title": "Does older sourdough taste better?",
      "content": "Does older sourdough taste better? Sometimes. Some bakers believe older sourdough starters produce better-tasting bread, but it also depends on how you prepare your starter , as well as the quality of your ingredients, the fermentation time, and your overall baking techniques. Instead of focusing on the age of your starter, prioritize consistent feeding and maintenance for the best flavor. [8] X Research source The type of flour used, the starter’s hydration level, the frequency of feeding, and the temperature your starter is stored in can influence the flavor."
