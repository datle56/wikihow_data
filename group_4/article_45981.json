      "content": "Mix green curry paste with coconut milk to tamper its spiciness. This paste is usually the hottest of the 3 pastes, which is why adding coconut milk is a good idea, as it dulls the spiciness. It typically contains kaffir lime leaves, shrimp paste, lemongrass, garlic, and green chilies. Try 1-2 teaspoons (17-34 g) for a can of coconut milk.

      "content": "Cook the paste in oil for 1-2 minutes before adding other ingredients. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of olive oil to a pan on medium and let it heat up.

To keep it even fresher, try wiping the inside of the jar clean at the top. Then, pour in just enough olive oil to cover the top of the paste, which will form a barrier to help keep it fresher."
