A common setback when trying to solve algebra word problems is assuming what the question is asking before you read the entire problem. In order to be successful in solving a word problem, you need to read the whole problem in order to assess what information is provided, and what information is missing. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Determine what you are asked to find.",
      "content": "Determine what you are asked to find. In many problems, what you are asked to find is presented in the last sentence. This is not always true, however, so you need to read the entire problem carefully. [3] X Research source Write down what you need to find, or else underline it in the problem, so that you do not forget what your final answer means. [4] X Research source In an algebra word problem, you will likely be asked to find a certain value, or you may be asked to find an equation that represents a value. For example, you might have the following problem: Jane went to a book shop and bought a book. While at the store Jane found a second interesting book and bought it for $80. The price of the second book was $10 less than three times the price of he first book. What was the price of the first book? In this problem, you are asked to find the price of the first book Jane purchased."

      "content": "Summarize what you know, and what you need to know. Likely, the information you need to know is the same as what information you are asked to find. You also need to assess what information you already know. Again, underline or write out this information, so you can keep track of all the parts of the problem. For problems involving geometry, it is often helpful to draw a sketch at this point. [5] X Research source For example, you know that Jane bought two books. You know that the second book was $80. You also know that the second book cost $10 less than 3 times the price of the first book. You don't know the price of the first book."

If, however, you are asked to find an equation, you will likely have multiple variables. No matter how many variables you have, you should list each one, and indicate what they are equal to. [6] X Research source For example, assign the variable x {\\displaystyle x} to the unknown in the problem, which is the price of the first book. Write x = the price of the first book {\\displaystyle x={\\text{the price of the first book}}} ."

Locating and interpreting these keywords can help you translate the words into algebra. [8] X Research source Multiplication keywords include times, of, and f actor. [9] X Research source Division keywords include per, out of, and percent. [10] X Research source Addition keywords include some, more, and together. [11] X Research source Subtraction keywords include difference, fewer, and decreased. [12] X Research source"

[13] X Research source For example, you know that the second book is $80, and you know what $80 equals in terms of the price of the first book ( x {\\displaystyle x} ). So set 80 equal to $10 less ( − 10 {\\displaystyle -10} ) than 3 times the price of the first book ( 3 x {\\displaystyle 3x} ). Putting everything together, you have 80 = 3 x − 10 {\\displaystyle 80=3x-10} ."

      "title": "Solve an equation for one variable.",
      "content": "Solve an equation for one variable. If you have only one unknown in your word problem, isolate the variable in your equation and find which number it is equal to. Use the normal rules of algebra to isolate the variable. Remember that you need to keep the equation balanced. This means that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must also do to the other side. [14] X Research source Use inverse operations to isolate a variable. For example, to isolate the variable in the equation 80 = 3 x − 10 {\\displaystyle 80=3x-10} , you need to add 10 to both sides, then divide by 3: 80 = 3 x − 10 {\\displaystyle 80=3x-10} 80 + 10 = 3 x − 10 + 10 {\\displaystyle 80+10=3x-10+10} 90 = 3 x {\\displaystyle 90=3x} 90 3 = 3 x 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {90}{3}}={\\frac {3x}{3}}} 30 = x {\\displaystyle 30=x}"

When combining like terms, remember that only terms with the same exponent and variable can be combined. For example, 4 x {\\displaystyle 4x} and 2 x {\\displaystyle 2x} can be combined, 3 x 2 {\\displaystyle 3x^{2}} and 5 x 2 {\\displaystyle 5x^{2}} can be combined, and 8 x y {\\displaystyle 8xy} and 4 x y {\\displaystyle 4xy} can be combined."

This means you cannot solve for a specific numerical value of a variable. Instead, you will solve to find an equation that describes a variable. Robyn and Billy run a lemonade stand. They are giving all the money that they make to a cat shelter. They will combine their profits from selling lemonade with their tips. They sell cups of lemonade for 75 cents. Their mom and dad have agreed to double whatever amount they receive in tips. Write an equation that describes the amount of money Robyn and Billy will give to the shelter."

Since you are writing an equation that describes the amount of money they will give to the shelter, the variable x {\\displaystyle x} will be alone on one side of the equation. Since you are combining their profits and tips, you will be adding two terms. So, x = __ + __. The first term will be equal to their profits. Since they make $0.75 for every cup of lemonade they sell, their profits are equal to .75 c {\\displaystyle .75c} . So, x = .75 c + ? ? {\\displaystyle x=.75c\\;+\\;??} . The second term will be equal to their tips. Since their parents are doubling their tips, their tips will be equal to 2 t {\\displaystyle 2t} . So, x = .75 c + 2 t {\\displaystyle x=.75c+2t} . Since the variable you are describing is already isolated, and all like terms are combined, you have arrived at your final answer."
