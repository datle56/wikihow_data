      "content": "Stick to wardrobe staples and your favorite basics. Bowling is a pretty low-key date, so you want to dress to impress without really dressing up . Play it safe (but still look cute!) by wearing some of your go-to wardrobe staples that you look and feel really good in. For example, you might try your best-fitting pair of jeans with your favorite T-shirt or tank top. [1] X Research source Loose-fitting dresses, relaxed pants, and cozy sweaters are also great options for a bowling date."

      "content": "Wear something comfortable and casual. Clothing that’s too tight or restrictive can make bowling a challenge since you’ll want to feel comfortable enough to throw your strikes, bend down to pick up the ball, sit on the bench, etc. [2] X Research source With this idea in mind, it may be best to opt for loose-fitting jeans and cropped slacks over short skirts, low-cut tops, or skinny jeans. Similarly, stick to casual, everyday clothing. Formalwear (like ties, silk skirts, or other dressy items) may make you stand out in the humble, family-oriented environment of a bowling alley. However, tracksuits and other types of loungewear may come off as low-effort. Be mindful of wearing something casual, but not so casual that you look like you just rolled out of bed—that is definitely unlikely to leave a positive impression on your date."

Here are some common no-nos for the average bowling alley: Ripped clothing: Includes any jeans, shirts, jackets, or other items with rips in them. Offensive clothing: Any article with imagery or messaging that’s racist, sexist, or otherwise offensive. [4] X Research source Heels, flip flops, and work boots: Certain types of shoes are banned from bowling lanes due to their potential for injury or causing damage to the floors. Hats: Some alleys have no-hat policies, so check with your local lanes before wearing one to cover up a first-date bad hair day."
