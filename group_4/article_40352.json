      "title": "Squeeze some paint into the balloon.",
      "content": "Squeeze some paint into the balloon. Open a bottle of washable paint and stretch a balloon over the opening. Flip the balloon and the bottle upside down and give the bottle a squeeze. Don't fill the entire balloon with paint. [1] X Research source Tempera and poster paint will work the best, but you can use acrylic too."

      "title": "Remove the balloon and fill it with air.",
      "content": "Remove the balloon and fill it with air. Carefully tip the bottle right-side-up. Pinch the neck of the balloon and pull it off of the bottle. Pump air into the balloon until the balloon is nice and full. You can also blow air into the balloon if you are careful and have strong lungs."

    {
      "title": "Knot the end of the balloon.",
      "content": "Knot the end of the balloon. Pinch the end of the balloon and pull it off of the pump. Wrap the balloon's tail around your finger to make a loop, then pull the end through it to make a knot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make more balloons.",
      "content": "Make more balloons. Use a different color of paint for each balloon. If you want to, match the color of the balloon to the paint you are using. This way, you can tell what's inside it. Experiment with using more paint in some balloons than others."

      "title": "Prepare to get messy.",
      "content": "Prepare to get messy. Put on a set of clothes you don't mind getting dirty. Find a spot outside that is easy to clean, or where paint splatters are okay. A driveway would be ideal. Wearing sunglasses or goggles would also be a good idea, in case the paint splatters. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Pop the balloons over a sheet of poster paper.",
      "content": "Pop the balloons over a sheet of poster paper. Spread out a sheet of poster paper on the ground. Arrange the balloons on the paper. Pop them by stomping on them or poking them with pins or wooden skewers. [3] X Research source You can stomp on the balloons barefoot or with rain boots. If this is for an older child, pin the balloons through the tail to a foam core board. Prop the board up, then pop the balloons by throwing darts at them. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Squirt some washable paint into a water balloon.",
      "content": "Squirt some washable paint into a water balloon. Fit a water balloon over a bottle of washable paint. Turn the bottle over and squirt some paint into the balloon. Don't fill the entire balloon with paint, however. You need room for the water. [5] X Research source Liquid watercolor, acrylic, tempera, and poster paint will all work great. This method will give you a watered-down, tie-dye effect."

    {
      "title": "Fill the balloon the rest of the way with water.",
      "content": "Fill the balloon the rest of the way with water. Tip the bottle right-side-up and pull the balloon off. Stretch the end of the balloon over a faucet or hose. Hold the balloon by the bottom, then turn the water on. Let the balloon fill slowly, then turn the faucet off. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Make more paint-filled water balloons. Fill each balloon with a different color of paint. Experiment with using different amounts of paint and water. You can also shake the balloons to dilute the paint further. Keep the balloons in a bucket or plastic bin. Be careful not to pop them!"

      "title": "Get ready to get dirty.",
      "content": "Get ready to get dirty. Put on a set of clothes you don't mind getting dirty. Head outside where the paint won't ruin anything. Tape a sheet of poster paper against a wall or fence. You can also prop a foam cord board up against a wall/fence instead. [7] X Research source If you aren't allowed to use the wall or fence, spread the paper on the ground, and stand up on a bench or chair."

    {
      "title": "Throw the balloons at the paper.",
      "content": "Throw the balloons at the paper. The balloons will burst open when they hit the paper and splatter it with paint. The water will mix with the paint and create a cool, tie-dye or watercolor effect. [8] X Research source If you are standing on a bench or chair, simply drop the balloon onto the paper."
