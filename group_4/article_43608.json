      "title": "Capricorns take pride in their ability to solve others’ problems.",
      "content": "Capricorns take pride in their ability to solve others’ problems. To give him the feeling that you really could use—or even really need—his help, send a Cap guy a straightforward question that he can definitely answer. And, while you’re at it, play into his ego a little by adding a compliment to your question. You might text something like the following: [1] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. “You always understand these history assignments, but I don’t get this one. Can you explain to me what we’re supposed to write about?” “Can you offer any advice for my presentation tomorrow? You always stay so calm and cool during these things!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Validate the importance Capricorns put on career achievements.",
      "content": "Validate the importance Capricorns put on career achievements. Most Cap guys really like to be recognized for all the hard work they put into their job. So, if you can manage to text a question that requires his assistance while also pointing out his career success, you’ll earn double the points toward making a great impression. [2] X Research source For example: “Everyone says you’re the best DJ in the city, so can you share any advice I can give my nephew who’s really into that?” Or: “That was amazing how you closed that deal with Acme Corp. when no one else could. What’s your secret?”"

      "title": "Caps don’t do things halfway—they go all in with their interests.",
      "content": "Caps don’t do things halfway—they go all in with their interests. Many Capricorns really like to talk about their interests and really don’t like to talk about stuff that doesn’t interest them. So, use your knowledge of a Cap guy’s job, hobbies, sports interests, family, and so on to ask a question or make a comment that’ll get him talking. [3] X Research source Try something like this: “You were a machine during that fundraiser walk-a-thon yesterday! How’d you first get involved with the local food bank?” Or this: “I can’t thank you enough for stepping in to help with the basketball camp on short notice. I could tell that those kids mean the world to you.”"

    {
      "title": "Capricorns like people who are as driven as they are.",
      "content": "Capricorns like people who are as driven as they are. You don’t necessarily have to be passionate about the same things in order to draw his interest—although that can’t hurt. What’s more important is that you show that you’re truly passionate about your passions. If you’re wishy-washy or indecisive, things might not work out with a Cap guy. [4] X Research source Send a text like this: “Thanks again for donating to the Alzheimer’s fundraiser. I’m determined to top last year’s total and you really helped out.” Or one like this: “Sorry I didn’t stop to chat at the pool. I was trying to beat my best time for 20 laps (and did!)”"

      "title": "Caps have a funny side, but don’t get too silly right away.",
      "content": "Caps have a funny side, but don’t get too silly right away. Capricorns like a good laugh as much as anyone, but they’re more likely to find something funny if it relates to their major interests. So, instead of sending out some generic funny text, come up with something that is both funny and relevant to your Cap guy’s interests. [5] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. For example, if he’s a lawyer and you’re an accountant, you might send this: “What did the lawyer say to the accountant? (Awaiting your response) (No hurry) (Seriously, I can wait)” Or, if you know he’s a big Seinfeld fan, you might send this on December 23: “Happy Festivus! What’s your all-time most impressive Feat of Strength?”"

      "title": "Capricorns like to test themselves—and like that quality in others.",
      "content": "Capricorns like to test themselves—and like that quality in others. New challenges and new adventures feed into a Cap guy’s drive to succeed, so invite him to take on something new that relates to his existing interests. If you come up with a challenge that isn’t relevant to his interests, he may decide it isn’t a practical use of his time. [6] X Research source If he’s just gotten into off-road biking, you might text something like this: “Have you heard of the Switchback trail at Westwood Park? Wanna tackle it with me on Saturday?” Or you might try this if he’s really into sports: “I’m looking for a partner for quiz night at Ray’s Tavern. I hear you know your sports trivia. Wanna team up?”"

      "title": "Capricorns rarely go straight from texting into dating.",
      "content": "Capricorns rarely go straight from texting into dating. A Cap guy is likely to see texting as a practical way to get introduced to someone, but not a good way to actually get to know someone. In other words, they’ll text to meet a potential new friend, but not to actually make a new friend or romantic partner. Use your texts as a point of entry on your way into his “inner circle” of people he cares about—from there, you can build a romantic connection. [7] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. So, instead of asking him out (or waiting for him to ask you out) via text, use texting as a way to get to know each other a little. Ask questions, share observations, and let your connection develop over time."

      "title": "Cap guys prefer talking to you (especially in person) over texting.",
      "content": "Cap guys prefer talking to you (especially in person) over texting. Capricorns tend to view texting as a practical necessity in the modern world, but not the ideal way to communicate. Most of the time, they really want to wait to have an old-fashioned face-to-face conversation before making their full evaluation of you. [8] X Research source Use your texts as a way to work toward that face-to-face meetup: “Wanna meet at the student union to talk about our strategy for this class presentation?” Or, if face-to-face isn’t possible, aim for a phone call or video chat: “Call me an old-timer, but I’m a lousy texter. Any chance you could call me?”"

      "title": "Capricorns trust their instincts, so make a good impression.",
      "content": "Capricorns trust their instincts, so make a good impression. If your text is long, unfocused, generic, nonsensical, or otherwise off-the mark, a Cap guy may just ignore it. If, however, you make a habit of sending concise, well-considered, focused texts, you may just work your way into his inner circle! [9] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. Don’t send a Cap guy a text on a whim, particularly if it’s your first text to him. Think about it. Type up a few drafts until you find the right one. Treat it like you’re sending them a really short introductory letter, not just some random conversation-starter."

      "title": "Make sure reading your texts is a good use of a Cap guy’s time.",
      "content": "Make sure reading your texts is a good use of a Cap guy’s time. Hard-working Capricorns don’t always respond well to unnecessary delays—even the few seconds it takes to read a text. On the flip side, though, sending a text with a clear and relevant purpose is a great way to get a Cap guy’s attention and draw a positive response. [10] X Research source Avoid texting generic greetings or observations (like “Hey,” “Nice day, huh,” or “What’s up?”) that don’t really lead anywhere. Texting for texting’s sake doesn’t make sense to a Capricorn. They text with a purpose and like when you to do the same."

    {
      "title": "Present yourself as calm and practical, not out of control.",
      "content": "Present yourself as calm and practical, not out of control. Capricorns pride themselves on their self control, and are attracted to that same quality in others. Your texts don’t have to seem like they’re from an emotionless robot, but they should be controlled and focused. [11] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. DON’T: Text repeatedly to try to get an answer from him. Complain about how hard your day was. Go on about how cute or kissable he is. DO: Text once and let him respond on his own time. Ask if he has advice for a problem you had today. Compliment him on his good looks and his positive qualities."
