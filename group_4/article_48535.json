Sit at the bar, rather than a table or booth, to show that you’re open to conversation. Don’t hesitate to introduce yourself to women at bars , too; don’t just wait for them to come to you."

Speed dating events are also a lot of fun.” These let you meet a ton of single women in a short amount of time, who you can link up with later if there’s chemistry. When speed dating , ask lots of questions and answer your dates’ questions honestly. Tell them what you want from a partner, and why."

      "title": "Classes",
      "content": "Classes Whether they’re academic-oriented or hobby classes that teach you to paint, build furniture, or what-have-you, adult classes are great places to make connections. Most meet more than once, giving you a chance to build relationships with your fellow students and more organically form potentially romantic bonds."

      "title": "Volunteer organizations",
      "content": "Volunteer organizations Meeting a woman while you’re both working toward a good cause signals that your own head and heart are in the right place, which helps to give her a good opinion of you from the jump. Helping others at a food bank or animal shelter makes you feel good and boosts your self-esteem, too. Just be sure you’re also genuinely working for the cause; try not to take advantage of it as just a dating service."

And what’s cuter than jotting your number down on a bookmark for her to find when she opens her book? Make sure you have your own recommendations ready when she asks."

      "content": "Concerts or festivals Like bars, concerts are filled with people looking to have a good time, but now with the common ground of the band they’re there to see. Show up early so you can chat with other early birds before the music starts blasting, though. Waiting line in front of the venue is also a good time to strike up a conversation."

But a fitness class, on the other hand, has a much more social aspect to it that makes meeting new people much easier, and even expected. If you do have a gym crush , wait until they’re between workouts, or even packing up, to approach them."

      "title": "Dog parks",
      "content": "Dog parks It’s almost a cliche for a reason. If you’ve got a dog, you’ve also got the perfect wingman. They’ll do most of the work for you when they run up to greet a stranger’s dog. That’s when you introduce yourself and start talking about being a puppy parent. If your dogs get along, you might even ask when they frequent the park, so the dogs (and yourselves) can see each other again."

      "title": "Start a conversation by talking about the place, or the context.",
      "content": "Start a conversation by talking about the place, or the context. You always have something in common, which is where you are and what’s happening around you. Approach a woman by asking a question about your location, or what she’s doing, to get her attention in a casual, comfortable way. [5] X Research source For example, try: “Do you know what kind of flowers these are?” “What breed of dog is that?” “Is that the new iPhone? Do you like it?” “Do you know what’s going on over there?” “What are you eating? Looks delicious!”"

Make sure you have that strong eye contact…Showing that you're really present in the moment is a signal for flirting.” Also, avoid crossing your arms, keep your shoulders loose, and strike a casual, easy pose, like leaning your weight on one leg. Always approach from the side or the front. Approaching from the back may startle a stranger, which doesn’t make a great impression, and puts them on guard."

      "title": "Relax, don’t overthink it, and go with the flow of conversation.",
      "content": "Relax, don’t overthink it, and go with the flow of conversation. Treat the encounter like making a new acquaintance, rather than kicking off a sweeping love story. That makes it low-stakes and casual, and helps to keep you relaxed. Let the conversation and interaction play out like you’re just bumping into someone, rather than making a romantic advance. Even if the conversation doesn’t go as you hoped, you just got some great practice approaching and chatting with strangers. Keep at it! Reader Poll: We asked 1157 wikiHow readers how they like to show interest in someone without asking if they're single, and only 9% of them said by offering to buy them a drink or food . [Take Poll] This might come across as too forward for some people, so simply have a relaxed conversation to get to know them first."

      "content": "Ask for her number just before you leave. If you felt some chemistry during your conversation, don’t hesitate to ask for her number . This is best done toward the end, both to give you time to get to know each other, and to reduce any awkward segues in the conversation. Say something like: “I’ve really enjoyed talking to you, and would love to chat or text again. Can I get your contact information?”"

      "content": "End the conversation after a few minutes to keep it comfortable. It’s best not to linger too long. Sticking around could make things awkward, or make you seem desperate. Remember that this is just a first encounter, and romance can come later, once you’ve laid some groundwork. To that, don’t feel pressured to talk about romance, or even to flirt too hard. There’s plenty of time for that later, if things go well now. Of course, if you’re really hitting it off, stick around until the conversation fades naturally! Say something like, “It was great to meet you, but I’ve gotta run. Maybe I’ll see you around?”"
