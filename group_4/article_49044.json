      "content": "Recognise the timeline for withdrawal. Withdrawal typically begins about 24 hours after usage stops but can start sooner. The first 48 hours will be the worst, followed by up to 10 days of severe symptoms. [3] X Research source After day 11, a lot of the symptoms will ease, and by a month or two, most symptoms will have subsided. For some, lingering effects like mood swings or cravings may last longer."

      "content": "Familiarise yourself with amphetamine psychosis. To familiarise yourself with psychosis, study its symptoms. You will need to watch out for these symptoms when going into withdrawal. Approximately 40% of users are affected by these, [5] X Research source and it's extremely serious and life-altering if psychosis occurs in you. Hallucinations [6] X Research source Tactile hallucinations: feelings that aren't there, such as bugs crawling on you or under your skin. Auditory hallucinations: hearing sounds or voices that aren't there. This can include mishearing real sounds into something that fits your perception of reality. Visual hallucinations: seeing things that don't exist, such as shadow people, bugs, faces or eyes. More simple visual hallucinations include flashes and geometric shapes appearing in your vision. Delusions: beliefs that have no basis in reality. These may look different in different people and overlap with paranoia, but may include: Paranoid delusions: Thinking people are out to get you. Thinking an organisation or government controls everyone. Grandiose delusions Believing you're a reincarnation or are in contact with a biblical or religious figure. Thinking you have special powers. Somatic delusions When someone thinks there is something wrong with their body, such as: Believing a part of the body is missing. Feeling strange things in the body. Paranoia: the irrational fear that people are out to get you, that you are being watched or listened to, or that others can hear your thoughts. Disorganised thinking: when your thoughts go through your head much faster than usual. This puts you in an almost manic state as you jump from conclusion to conclusion. Compulsive behaviour: any repetitive behaviour, such as skin picking, is typical. These can leave lasting scars and may worsen over time without intervention."

You'll likely want to sleep for long periods, maybe days at a time, which you must allow yourself to do. Most of the first part of your withdrawal should be spent in bed, which also allows you to sleep through unpleasant symptoms. Be warned: you may experience unpleasant dreams or dreams about using.

Your brain is suddenly depleted of the most dopamine humanly possible, so it's no wonder you feel this way. Here are some strategies to overcome or deal with these symptoms: Journalling. Oftentimes, while you were using, you may have kept a journal. Keep this up when you feel like it. Meditation. Meditation is a simple way to positively impact your emotional mindset. Every self-help article recommends it, and that's for good reason. Don't dismiss it as useless before trying it. Deep breathing. Although it sounds basic, it genuinely helps."

Draw something or create art of how you feel; it also helps your emotional well-being. Be patient with yourself. You may not be able to distract yourself 24/7; the hard reality is sometimes you'll need to sit there shaking and craving, too anxious to sleep and too nauseous to eat or drink. Remind yourself that even these moments will pass."

You may have needed these before you started using, but you'll especially benefit from them now as depression and anxiety are two of the more long-lasting symptoms, possibly persisting for up to 3-6 months of discontinued usage. [13] X Research source These can also help you get through withdrawal closer to the beginning of your recovery. [14] X Research source Antidepressants (SSRIs) should be used under medical supervision. Not everyone benefits from the same medication. Find what works for you through trial and error, working with your psychiatrist or GP."

Don't go to locations you used to use or know where to obtain meth. Delete any contacts with dealers you may have. Cutting off friends who still use may be challenging, but it's for your good."
