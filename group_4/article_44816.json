      "content": "Take pain medicine. A pulled muscle can take several weeks to heal, and in the meantime can cause considerable pain. One of the best ways to alleviate that pain at home is by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. [2] X Research source NSAIDs like aspirin and ibuprofen can help reduce pain and inflammation. Reducing inflammation is important for core muscles like obliques, which are crucial for movement.

      "content": "Apply ice for the first 48 hours. Ice is helpful for muscle pain, as the cold compress slows down blood flow and reduce swelling and inflammation. If you do not have an ice pack, you can wrap ice cubes in a clean dish towel or use a cold, flexible item like frozen vegetables from the freezer. Ice should be applied for no more than 20 minutes, then removed for at least 20 minutes before being reapplied. Remove the ice pack if the skin turns red or bright pink. Do not apply ice directly to the skin, as this may cause ice burns. [4] X Research source Ice works best for the first 48 hours after an injury. After 48 hours, switch to heat treatment or alternate between heat and ice."

      "content": "Apply heat after 48 hours. Icing an injury is best during the first 48 hours, as it reduces swelling and inflammation. After 48 hours, you can also use heat treatment, such as a heating pad. Heat will help to relax your muscles and re-stimulate blood flow, allowing the tissue to heal.

The oblique muscles are crucial for many types and ranges of movement, and they are often prone to repeat injuries. For some people, especially athletes who are at risk of re-injuring the obliques, rehabilitation sessions with a physical therapist will be recommended by a physician."

      "content": "Do upward-facing dog stretches. These stretches work the rectus abdominis, the group of muscles closest to the obliques. Strengthening the rectus abdominis should be a part of your comprehensive oblique rehab plan. While lying flat against the ground facing downward, position your hands directly beneath your shoulders. Keep your feet hip-width apart, your gluteal muscles squeezed, and your spine and neck held straight and level. While keeping your lower body flat against the ground, slowly straighten your arms to raise your upper body. Hold this pose for five seconds, then return to the floor. Complete 10 repetitions, as long as the stretch doesn't cause any pain."

When practiced in conjunction with upward-facing dog and other rehabilitative techniques, standing stretches can help return your normal range of motion after an injury. Stand straight upright with your feet shoulder-width apart. Keep your back straight, and raise your hands over your head. Slowly and gently lean to one side until you begin to feel some stretch through your abdomen. Hold that position for five seconds, then switch to the other side. Complete ten repetitions on each side, as long as the stretch does not cause you any pain."
