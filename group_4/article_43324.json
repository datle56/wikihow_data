      "content": "Ask a friend if they can see the server. If you're still not sure whether the server still exists, the best thing to do is reach out to someone you know from the server. Send a DM to a friend and ask if the server still exists, and whether they can invite you. You can also try reaching out to a mod to see if you're on the banned list. If you were banned, you can reach out to the mod (respectfully) to ask them why. You might be able to get them to unban you, depending on the reason you were banned."
