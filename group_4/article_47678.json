      "content": "Choose a wool, linen, or twill cloak for the most authentic look. [1] X Research source Find a rectangular cloak online or at a costume store. Otherwise, you can use any blanket made from 1–2 layers of fabric. You can choose fabric with either raw or blanket-stitched edges. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick a single solid color for your cloak.",
      "content": "Pick a single solid color for your cloak. You can use either dyed or undyed fabric for your cloak as long as it has a consistent color. For a natural look, choose fabric that’s light brown or dark brown. If you want a cloak that makes you appear like you have more wealth and power, choose colors like solid reds or blues instead.

      "title": "Find a cloak that hangs to your knees and is as wide as your arm span.",
      "content": "Find a cloak that hangs to your knees and is as wide as your arm span. Spread the cloak out and hold onto it by the top corners. Outstretch your arms and lift your cloak up to shoulder-level. If the cloak still bunches up or hangs loosely, then it’s too big. Then while you’re holding the cloak, check that the bottom reaches down to your knees, or else it might look too short. [4] X Research source If the cloak is too long, then it will drag along the ground and get dirty after you wrap it. If you prefer a shorter look, then it’s okay to get a cloak that just passes your waist."

      "title": "Get a cloak with sewn knot patterns and fur to look like a Viking prince.",
      "content": "Get a cloak with sewn knot patterns and fur to look like a Viking prince. If you want your Viking outfit to look fancier, try to find a cloak or fabric that has silk embellishments or embroidered knotwork designs around the edges. You can also look for cloaks that have fur lining on the edges or inside to stay even warmer while you wear it. [5] X Research source You can buy a cloak that already has designs, or you can embroider them yourself."

    {
      "title": "Drape the cloak around your neck and over your shoulders.",
      "content": "Drape the cloak around your neck and over your shoulders. Hold onto the top corners of your cloak and keep the bottom edge of your cloak parallel to the floor. Bring the cloak behind your body and wrap it around your shoulders and neck. Pull the cloak forward until it doesn’t hang past your knees. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the top left corner of the cloak to your right shoulder.",
      "content": "Pull the top left corner of the cloak to your right shoulder. Take the corner of the cloak draped over your left shoulder and pull it tight across the front of your chest. Bring the corner as far over as you can so your cloak hangs at an angle across the front of your body. [7] X Research source That way, you can still use your right hand without the cloak getting in the way. [8] X Research source If you’re left-handed, pull the right corner toward your left shoulder so your dominant hand stays free. Avoid securing your cloak in the center of your chest since it will limit your mobility and cause the fabric to get in your way."

    {
      "title": "Push a ringed pin or brooch through both cloak layers on your right shoulder.",
      "content": "Push a ringed pin or brooch through both cloak layers on your right shoulder. A ringed pin or brooch has a circular ring with an opening and a long hinged pin running through the center. Get one that’s made of iron, copper, or bone for the most authenticity. Pinch the layers of your cloak on your shoulder to make a small raised area. Open the pin so it extends out from the ring. Push the pin through the side of the raised fabric closest to your head. Keep pushing the pin until it goes through each layer and comes out through the side of the raised section near your shoulder. [9] X Research source You can buy ringed pins or brooches online. If you can’t find one, you can always use a safety pin to hold your cloak closed. Avoid pointing the pin towards your neck or chest so you don’t accidentally injure yourself."

    {
      "title": "Twist the ring or brooch so the pin stays secured.",
      "content": "Twist the ring or brooch so the pin stays secured. Lower the ring back against your cloak so the pin goes through the opening. Turn the ring in either direction so the opening points down or away from the pin. That way, the pin won’t be able to slip out and your cloak will stay perfectly in place. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Flip the cloak over your shoulder when you need to use both hands.",
      "content": "Flip the cloak over your shoulder when you need to use both hands. Take the loose corner hanging in front of your body and bring it up toward your shoulder. If you just need to quickly do something, drape the corner over so it goes behind your back. For something more secure, tuck the loose corner underneath the cloak on your shoulder so it stays still and doesn’t fall down. [11] X Research source Keep in mind you’ll feel a lot colder when you do this since your body is uncovered."

    {
      "title": "Pull the cloak over your head if you want a hood.",
      "content": "Pull the cloak over your head if you want a hood. Leave the cloak pinned while you form a hood so the fabric stays tight. Turn your cloak so the pin is just off your shoulder near the front of your body. Grab onto the cloak’s collar and gently pull it up around your face so it wraps around the bottom of your chin and the top of your head. [12] X Research source If your hood or cloak feels too tight, then undo the pin and reposition it so the fabric is looser."

      "title": "Hold your cloak closed so you can warm up.",
      "content": "Hold your cloak closed so you can warm up. [13] X Research source When you’re feeling cold and want to conserve body heat, grab the loose edges of your cloak and pull them tight against your body. Since your cloak doesn’t reach lower than your knees, crouch down to cover up your legs and conserve your body heat. [14] X Research source You’ll stay even warmer if you make a hood with your cloak as well."
