      "content": "Boggle Draw a 4x4 grid onto a large whiteboard and write one random letter in each box. Instruct players to make a list of as many words as they can by connecting the adjoining letters on the Boggle board. Whoever is able to make the most words in a specified amount of time (could be anywhere between 1 minute and 30 minutes!) is the winner of that round. [1] X Research source For example , let’s say your Boggle grid looks like this: E | S | T B | A | N P | R | W In this case, potential words include “seat,” “sat,” “pants,” and “brawn.” However, a word like “pest” would not work because the “p” is not adjacent to the “e,” “s,” or “t.” You could, however, write down the word “best”! Here’s a digital and printable example of a Boggle round. You can use this template for your game or as inspiration for your own Boggle grid."

In your head (or on a secret piece of paper), assign each square of the grid to a question or a “crocodile.” Have players take turns naming the coordinates on the grid to select a square. If the square they choose is matched to a question, they must answer the question—and they get points for answering correctly or truthfully. If the square they choose is hiding a crocodile, however, they lose all of their points to the hungry reptile."

      "title": "Family Feud",
      "content": "Family Feud Prepare for your Family Feud game by making a list of categories with 5-10 words in each category. The words in that category should be the most popular or common items in that list. For instance, a “chip flavors” category might include “plain,” “barbecue,” “cheddar and sour cream,” “sour cream and onion,” “salt and vinegar,” etc. Once you’re ready to play, divide your players into pairs or small groups. Write the category on the board, alongside the number of items you’ve secretly listed in that category (e.g., “Chip Flavors (5)”). Set a timer for 2-3 minutes. Once this time is up, write your list of words on the board. For each item you wrote that a team also had on their list, they get a point. Play the game for several rounds, then count up each team’s total points. Whichever team has the most points at the end is the Family Feud champion! Here are some examples of Family Feud categories and answers ."

      "content": "Hot Seat Place a chair in front of a large whiteboard and position it so that anyone sitting in the chair will be facing away from the board. Ask a player to sit in the chair, then write a word on the whiteboard behind them. The rest of the players then try to describe the word to the player in the chair without actually telling them what the word is. Once the player in the chair is able to answer correctly, another player replaces them and a new word is written on the board. [2] X Research source Spelling the word, using gestures, or offering a rhyming word are not allowed. Players have to describe the word in some way that gets the guessing player to figure out what it is! For instance, if the word is “phone,” players might say, “You make calls on this, and it fits in your pocket.” They would not be able to say, “It’s spelled P-H-O-N-E” and “It rhymes with ‘clone’” or make a gesture of holding a phone to their ear."

Give a dry-erase marker to the first player in line for each group. Then, shout out a topic or category (e.g., reptiles, countries, vegetables, car models, etc.). The first players in line for each team run to the board and write a word from that category. [3] X Research source As soon as they finish their word, the player returns to their team and gives the marker to the next person in line. This second player must rush to the board and write a word that starts with the last letter of the previous written word. If the category is “chemistry terms,” for example, and the first player on a team wrote “ato m ,” then the second player must write a word that starts with “m.” Play continues like this until every player in each team has taken their turn. Whichever team gets through their line first and has correct words on the board is the winner!"

Whichever player is first in each line will play the first round. When you want to begin the round, say a sentence that uses one of the words or homophones in a sentence, e.g., “You can get your driving permit at fifteen” or “She’s the heir to the throne.” The first two players must run to the board and circle the correct word. Whoever circles the correct word first wins a point for their team. Play continues like this, with each player in the line taking a turn."

      "content": "Hangman Select a puzzle giver and have them silently choose a word, phrase, or sentence. The puzzle giver should then draw an upside-down “L” (aka the Hangman ’s gallows) and a row of dashes across the whiteboard, with each dash representing a letter in their chosen word. Then, have the other players take turns guessing letters. [5] X Research source If a guessed letter is in the secret word, the puzzle giver must write it on the dashes corresponding to where it appears in the word. Players can guess the complete word at any time. If a guessed letter is not in the secret word, the puzzle giver writes it to the side of the board so that players can keep track of which letters have been guessed already. Then, they add a body part to the “hangman” stick figure on the board. Typically, each incorrectly guessed letter will add one of these body parts to the board, roughly in this order: head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg. The game ends whenever the first of these two things happens: the complete word is guessed by a player or the hangman stick figure is completed. If the correct word is guessed, the player that guessed it is the winner! If you’re playing Hangman in a school environment, it may be better to play the “Snowman” variation and add “body parts” to a doodled snowman (e.g., bottom ball, middle ball, top ball, carrot nose, smile, eyes, top hat, and scarf)."

Then, ask the players to turn around so that they can no longer see the board. Erase one of the words, then say “Go!” When you say “go,” players must turn around and attempt to name the missing word.

In order to win, one team has to get three of their symbols in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. [7] X Research source To up the challenge level, consider drawing a bigger board: 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, etc. To add an educational angle, add a target vocab word, concept, or equation into each of the boxes. If the student or player wants to place their marker in a box, they must first define the word or concept, use the word in a sentence, or solve the equation. If you’re playing with only two players, you can follow these same instructions with each player representing a “team.”"

Then, draw a small circle in the center of the circle. Write a letter in the small circle—for an easier game, go for a vowel. Then, write different letters in each of the “slices” of the circle. You’ve just made a word wheel! [8] X Research source Once you’re ready to play, show the word wheel to your players. Their goal is to create as many words as possible using the letters in the word wheel. Letters don’t have to be adjacent to each other to be used in the same word, and players can use each letter repeatedly in a single word. However, every word must contain the letter in the small circle. For example, let’s say a word wheel has a center letter E and the other letters are K, P, W, L, A, B, S, and C. Potential words include “sales,” “bleak,” and “well.” However, “slap” doesn’t work because it doesn’t include E, even though all of the other letters are correct."

      "content": "A Fake Artist Goes to New York Get together a group of 5-10 players to play this fun bluffing game! Start by assigning one person to be the first Question Master (every player will take turns playing this role). The Question Master must choose and announce a category to the group (e.g., domestic pets). Then, they’ll choose a word that fits that category (e.g., bird), write that word on several slips of paper, and give those papers to the players (who will not say the word aloud). [9] X Research source However, one of the players will receive a slip of paper that only has an “X” written on it, which designates them as the fake artist! Next, players go around the table, and each one draws one contiguous stroke on their drawing paper to begin drawing the item named by the Question Master. Repeat this for another rotation around the table. Then, players can begin to guess who the fake artist is. If the fake artist isn’t caught, both the Question Master and the fake artist receive a point. If the fake artist is caught and can’t guess what the word is, each artist earns a point.

On the large whiteboard, write a list of 6-7 general categories—e.g., “Animals,” “Sports Teams,” “Movie Stars,” “Cities,” “World Languages,” “Fruits,” etc. Then, write a random letter on the board and shout “Go!” When you say “go,” the players must work in their teams or pairs to write down one word for each category that begins with the letter you wrote on the board. [11] X Research source When a team finishes their list, they shout “Stop the bus!” When this phrase is shouted, all other teams must set down their pens and stop writing. Alternatively, you can set a timer for 2-3 minutes to end the round. Go through the categories one by one and have each team share their answer. The group can challenge answers that don’t fit the category. Each team is awarded one point for each correct answer. Count up each team’s points—whichever group has the most points is the winner of that round! For example, let’s say we’re using the above categories with the letter “B.” Correct answers might include “Bat,” “Boston Red Sox,” “Barbra Streisand,” “Bogotá,” “Balinese,” and “Banana.”"

Assign a dollar value to each question: $100 for the easiest question, $200 for the next question, and so on until you reach $500 for the most difficult question. [12] X Research source Once you have your list of questions, draw a 5x6 grid on your whiteboard. Write your category names in each square across the top row, “$100” in each square in the second row, “$200” in the third row, “$300” in the fourth row, “$400” in the fifth row, and “$500” in the sixth row. Now, you’re finally ready for gameplay! Split your group into teams, or have 3-4 individual players go head to head. On each turn, have one team or player select a category and dollar value from the board. Read the question associated with that category and money amount. At that point, any team or player can raise their hand, slap the table, or hit a buzzer to indicate that they know the answer to the question. If they answer the question correctly, they receive the dollar amount in points (not actual cash!). If they answer the question in correctly, that dollar amount gets deducted from their point total (even if they go into the negatives) and another player can answer.
