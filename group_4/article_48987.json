      "content": "Unscrew the crown. The crown is located on the side of your watch by the 3 o'clock marking. Turn the crown counterclockwise until you feel it release from the last thread. It will pop out slightly from the side of the watch. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Wind your Rolex.",
      "content": "Wind your Rolex. With your thumb and index finger, slowly turn the crown clockwise 360 degrees, or a full rotation, at least 30 to 40 times. This fully winds the watch. [2] X Research source If you only rotate the crown clockwise a few times then the watch will not be fully wound. Rolex designs its watches so it is impossible to over wind them. A device built into the watch will prevent you from over winding the Rolex."

      "title": "Be patient.",
      "content": "Be patient. If you've wound your watch and it doesn't immediately start working, leave it alone for a little while or rotate it back and forth on your wrist. It may take a little motion for the watch to be working properly."

      "title": "Move around.",
      "content": "Move around. A Rolex watch that stays motionless for approximately 24 hours will usually not wind itself and will need to be manually wound. Keep your Rolex on if you don't want to repeatedly wind it."

      "content": "Send your watch for repairs if it still does not work. If your Rolex still doesn't work after winding it, you may have a more serious problem. Take your watch to a local certified and authorized dealer who can assess the watch. If it is broken, the dealer will ship your Rolex to a factory in Switzerland for repairs."

      "content": "Set the time and date on your watch. Now that the Rolex is wound properly you will need to reset the date and time.
