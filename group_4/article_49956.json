      "title": "The label should have a style number and art number on it.",
      "content": "The label should have a style number and art number on it. The label will be either at the base of the flap or tucked behind a pocket wall inside of the bag. You should see “MADE IN ITALY” in all caps. Behind that, you’ll find the style number and art number (these are kind of like serial numbers). YSL used to have a lookup service for this info, but it doesn’t anymore, so you’ll have to search online to see if other products online match your bag. If the bag is still in production, find it on YSL’s website and click “more details” to find your correct style ID. Here’s what a real YSL bag will have on the back of the label: [1] X Research source A 6-digit style number. A 4- to 5-digit art number. If it’s a vintage bag, there will be a 12-digit serial number. A prefix and dot before the style and art numbers on newer bags. This formatting should be consistent with all Kering brands, including Gucci and Balenciaga."

      "title": "The logo should look polished and essentially perfect.",
      "content": "The logo should look polished and essentially perfect. The YSL logo is such a big part of the Saint Laurent charm and design that the details are carefully crafted and executed in real bags. If any element of the YSL logo looks cheap or incorrect, you’ve likely got a fake. Here’s what you’re looking for in a real bag: [2] X Research source The left arm of the Y should be slightly thicker than the right arm. The left arm of the Y should sit underneath the S and the right arm should be on top. The middle of the S should overlap the L and then swoop behind it. The bottom and top curves of the S should be thinner than the central portion. The angle of the bend in the L shouldn’t be a little tighter than 90 degrees, and the left side of the bottom arm of the L should be thinner than the right. Some bags include 4 mock nails in the corners—2 in the tops of the Y, 1 in the bottom left of the S, and 1 in the bottom right of the L. These are not a good indicator of authenticity, as some of the bags do not have them."

    {
      "title": "Real bags should have “SAINT LAURENT PARIS” on the buttons.",
      "content": "Real bags should have “SAINT LAURENT PARIS” on the buttons. This lettering will be in capital letters and it will be evenly spaced. The text should be engraved and unpainted if the bag is legitimate. If the text is uneven or the lettering is very thick or hard to read, it’s probably not a legitimate bag. [3] X Research source It’s extremely difficult for counterfeiters to match the quality of the tiny font. If the bag is new, you should have no problem at all reading the writing on the button(s)."

    {
      "title": "Authentic YSL bags use all capital letters in a sans serif font.",
      "content": "Authentic YSL bags use all capital letters in a sans serif font. Look under the bag flap. All of the letters should be capitalized with no serif markers. The N and the T in “LAURENT” should touch. Also, note the two Rs. The R in “LAURENT” should have a rounded leg, while the R in “PARIS” is perfectly straight. If the Rs are identical, it’s a dead giveaway the bag is fake. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "The zipper should move seamlessly and have some heft.",
      "content": "The zipper should move seamlessly and have some heft. Move the zipper back and forth and try to evaluate how heavy it is. Cheaper bags will often mix their metals with aluminum (or use pure aluminum). As a result, fake zippers will have a lightweight and flimsy quality to them. If you have a chain strap, the zipper should be just as shiny and reflective as the chain is."
    },
    {
      "title": "If there is stitching on the edges, it should be uniform and neat.",
      "content": "If there is stitching on the edges, it should be uniform and neat. YSL uses matelassé stitching, which is a French style of stitching designed to mimic the look of hand stitching. Each row will have the same width, and the number of stitches on each opposing side of the bag will be identical, so count the stitches. If the total number of stitches on each side match, the bag is probably real. [5] X Research source Some YSL bags won’t have stitching around the edges—the sides will be glued together. Most of them are stitched, though."

    {
      "title": "Authentic YSL quilting should overlap in consistent, even sections.",
      "content": "Authentic YSL quilting should overlap in consistent, even sections. The quilting on a YSL bag is meant to mimic a letter Y, in reference to Yves Saint Laurent. The individual sections that make up each quilt should be symmetrical, evenly spaced, and uniformly stitched. If you see any unevenness or the quilt sections are inconsistent, it’s probably a fake bag. [6] X Research source If the bag isn’t used, the quilting on the front flap should overlap pretty evenly with the quilting underneath it. The stitching that separates each quilt should also be even and uniform. Some bags do not have quilting—they have stippled leather or sheepskin. You cannot rely on any stitching to determine if these bags are real or not."

    {
      "title": "Legitimate straps should contain a leather stamp or metal connector.",
      "content": "Legitimate straps should contain a leather stamp or metal connector. YSL bags come in two distinct styles. There’s a leather strap, or a chain (some styles have both). Here’s what you’re looking for in each style: [7] X Research source Leather straps: the edges should be stitched the same way the bag is, and there should be embossed lettering somewhere reading “SAINT LAURENT” or “SAINT LAURENT PARIS” depending on the width. Chain straps: the chain should be curb-style with flat-facing links. There will always be a metal connector somewhere that reads “SAINT LAURENT.” There should be a peg-in-hole closure, although the design will vary."

      "title": "Every new bag should come with a high-quality dust cover.",
      "content": "Every new bag should come with a high-quality dust cover. The color of the dust bag will depend on the color of the bag, but it will always have either the YSL logo or the words “SAINT LAURENT” and “PARIS” in different fonts. The “PARIS” should also be smaller than the “SAINT LAURENT” above it. The fake bags will often make both sets of lettering the same size. [8] X Research source The dust bag shouldn’t feel cheap. It should feel like a solid, expensive material."
