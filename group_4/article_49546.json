      "content": "Think about the person you love. You fell in love with him or her for a reason. [2] X Expert Source Crista Beck Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. There was something about them that first attracted you and something that helped you fall in love and kept you there. They have special attributes, such as looks, personality, character, temperament, humor or strengths that you want them to know you appreciate. Tell him or her all the things you love about them and how you value who they are and what they do for you. Think about what your significant other is to you? Your best friend? Your soul mate? Make a list of everything you appreciate and adore about your partner. Now create sentences with your list. “I love how soft your hands feel in mine,” or “I love the way you look at me and let me know everything will be all right,” or perhaps, “Your smile and easy laughter can make my whole day.” Don’t just focus on physical characteristics. This can make the letter feel shallow and incomplete. You don’t want to completely avoid physical attraction in your letter either, though, because then it can feel a little too platonic. Love letters are meant to be tastefully sensual and respectful—not necessarily erotic."

The message is what matters, and once you get that down you can go over the letter and fix any errors. Your letter is a confession of sorts on how you feel, and right now you want to focus on being completely honest and open about how you feel and why. Take your time and don’t rush. If this is the first love letter you have ever written, then keep that in mind. There is a learning curve for everything, so accept that you may have some difficulties or make mistakes. Use your own voice to express how you feel. Don’t imitate the way someone else writes or speaks. You want this message to be uniquely yours and to reach your partner the way only you can. It must be sincere and reflect the real you on paper. Keep your partner in mind as you write your letter as well as the level of your relationship. Declaring your love to someone for the first time will probably be a little different on paper than writing a letter to your wife of 20 years. Remember to state your love somewhere in the letter. A simple \"I love you\" works just fine."

[6] X Research source Tell him or her how your life has changed for the better, and how your life would be incomplete without them in it. The goal of the love letter is to express very deep feelings that you have a hard time conveying in person. Take this opportunity to say more than you usually say and to take it to a deeper level. Use the ideas you jotted down earlier to guide you. If you don’t write poetry , consider including a poem from a favorite poet or a quote that expresses more of what you’re trying to say. Always give the writer credit to avoid looking like you tried to steal it and trick your partner into believing it was yours. If you want to be cheesy, go ahead. Just be authentic, and if your partner loves you, he or she will love your letter too."

A good way to keep your letter positive is to talk about how you feel right now. Yes, you want to go over those special stories about how you fell in love but you also want to be sure your partner knows that you still feel strongly for them or even more so. Try something like, “Now, a decade later, I still get butterflies when you smile at me,” or \"I love you more now than I ever have before.\" You might also say, \"Your love has altered my existence\" or \"I can't live without you.\" [7] X Expert Source Crista Beck Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 26 August 2021."

Selecting high-quality paper will add a nice touch and show how much care went into writing your letter. If you don’t have any stationery, a piece of plain or notebook paper will do fine as well. The message is definitely more important than the type of paper you write on. You can make regular paper look old or even make your own paper if you want to do something fun. Use either a black or brown ink to keep the writing grounded and classy-looking. Avoid “teacher colors” like blue, green, and red that will make it look like you’re marking up a homework assignment."
