      "title": "Go for side-swept bangs if you have a round face.",
      "content": "Go for side-swept bangs if you have a round face. These bangs are styled like the name would imply – they flow over the forehead to one side of your face. The best types of side-swept bangs for round faces are thick and full, rather than thin and wispy. These will add a bit of shape and dimension to a round face. Figure out which side of your face you would like your bangs to go and try it out. [1] X Research source To find out if you have a round face, measure across your upper cheeks (from the outer corner of each eye) and your face length (from your hair to your chin). If these two measurements are pretty equal and you don’t have a sharp jawline, your face is round. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Try wispy crescent bangs if you have a heart-shaped face.",
      "content": "Try wispy crescent bangs if you have a heart-shaped face. Heart-shaped faces are wider at the top and become narrower and pointed at the bottom, just like a heart. Bangs that are a bit wispier will soften this face shape. [3] X Research source Bangs that are a bit longer on the sides will also help to soften up the more sharper chin. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Opt for slightly shorter, softer bangs if you have a square face.",
      "content": "Opt for slightly shorter, softer bangs if you have a square face. Square faces are a bit more angular than others, so the key is getting bangs that will soften everything up. Bangs that softly split down the middle work really well for square faces because their slanted “A” shape breaks up the sharper lines of the face. [5] X Research source As for length, ask for bangs that hit your eyebrows and no longer. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Go for bold, blunt bangs if you have an oval face.",
      "content": "Go for bold, blunt bangs if you have an oval face. Oval faces are pretty easy to work with, because it’s the face shape most people actually desire and can basically work with any kind of bangs. That being said, blunt, straight-across bangs can particularly flatter oval faces. Because your face is longer, the blunt bangs don’t overwhelm your entire face, but really, pretty much any style of bangs should look flattering on you. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Examine the size of your forehead.",
      "content": "Examine the size of your forehead. The shape of your face is the biggest thing to consider when you’re toying with the idea of bangs, but the size of your forehead should also come into consideration. If you have a small forehead, side-swept bangs can make it look a bit bigger and more proportionate. [8] X Research source If you have an elongated forehead, parted, wispy bangs can disguise a bit of the length while softening the shape. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Look online or in magazines for “bang inspiration.” The best way to figure out what sort of bangs you like is to find pictures of people who already have them. It’s particularly helpful if you can find pictures of people with similar face shapes and hair types! Save a few photos on your phone or bring them with you so you can make sure the hairstylist knows what you are looking for. Instagram and pinterest are both great sources for ideas."

      "title": "Talk to a hairstylist.",
      "content": "Talk to a hairstylist. If you’re unsure if your face is well suited for bangs, the best thing you can do is talk to a professional. Hairstylists want you to be happy with their service, so they will offer you good advice about what to do. They have experience cutting and styling all types of hair, so they will be able to answer your questions and help you figure out what type of bangs will work best."

      "content": "Consider the upkeep of bangs. For bangs to look their best, they will likely need to be styled. After all, they are front and center when you’re speaking to people, so you want them to look polished. If you’re a fan of rolling out of bed every morning and barely touching your hair, they might not be the best option for you. Additionally, you’ll need to make time to get regular trims."

      "content": "Experiment with looks using a hair app. There are many hair apps available that allow you to upload your own image and then edit different hairstyles, hair colors and/or bangs on to it. These apps can give you a very good idea of what bangs will look like on you. You can experiment with different types of bangs until you find something that best complements your specific features.

      "content": "Try clip-in bangs. You can buy these either at a beauty supply store or online and they come in a wide variety of shades and styles. Pick up the clip-in bangs style you're considering, then part your hair down the middle, slide the piece in and secure it with the three clips. [11] X Research source This is a great way to experiment with many styles without actually getting a cut, so wear the piece around a few days and see how you feel about it."

      "content": "Use bobby pins to \"create\" bangs. If you have a particular style of bangs in mind, use bobby pins to arrange your hair into that fringe, then pin the fringe in place. For example, if you want side-swept bangs, pin your hair back so that it looks like you have them, then check out how it looks on you. First, section your hair and form it to the length you want your bangs to be. Style it to the best of your ability and then bobby pin it in place."
