      "content": "Develop a routine for your puppy. To begin housetraining your puppy, create a routine to help your puppy learn. Puppies need a consistent routine in order to learn when and where they are supposed to relieve themselves. It's important to start teaching your puppy to go outside when she feels the urge as soon as you bring her home. Plan to take her outside on a set schedule every day: first thing in the morning, after every meal, after playtime, and right before bed. [1] X Research source Puppies should be taken out every hour, as well as shortly after meals, naps, and playtime. You should always take your puppy out first thing in the morning, before you and the puppy go to bed at night, and before you leave the puppy alone for any extended period of time. Feed your puppy at the same time every day so you can predict when she'll need to go outside. Very young puppies have to go to the bathroom as often as once an hour. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source That means you or a family member will need to be available to take your puppy outside that often. If you aren't available to housetrain your puppy during the day, it's important to hire someone else to do it professionally. If you don't start early, it may take your dog a long time to learn not to go to the bathroom in the house."

      "content": "Get your puppy’s attention if she tries to eliminate in the house. If you notice your puppy going potty inside the house, don't overreact by yelling at her or scaring her. Interrupt her while she's doing her business by clapping your hands together. Then pick her up or get her to follow you right away and take her to her bathroom spot. When she finishes going to the bathroom there, reward her with some praise. [3] X Research source If you find a mess behind the sofa or somewhere else in your house, it's too late to discipline the puppy. Don't rub her nose in it; she'll just get confused and scared, and she won't understand what you're trying to teach her."

      "title": "Limit your puppy’s space within your home while your puppy is housetraining.",
      "content": "Limit your puppy’s space within your home while your puppy is housetraining. For the first few months you will need to keep a careful eye on your puppy so that you can take her outside as soon as she has to go to the bathroom. If you give her too much freedom around the house at first, she'll learn to go to the bathroom wherever she wants, and you won't always be able to catch it in time. [4] X Research source Use baby gates to limit your puppy’s area within your home. For example, you could put a gate up at the bottom of the stairs to prevent your puppy from roaming around the upper level of your home or put gates up to limit your puppy’s movement between a couple of rooms in your home. Allow your puppy more freedom as she becomes better at controlling her bladder and bowels. Try putting your puppy on a leash when she is exploring a new room. It will be much more difficult for your puppy to get into trouble when you are attached to the other end of the leash."

      "title": "Pick a designated bathroom spot outside.",
      "content": "Pick a designated bathroom spot outside. Having a place that the puppy associates with going to the bathroom will help her learn not to go in the house. She'll start wanting to go to that spot to relieve herself, and over time she'll learn to wait until you take her there instead of going to the bathroom inside. [5] X Research source Use language to strengthen the puppy's association with the spot. Say \"go potty\" or just \"potty\" when you set her down. Don't use the word anywhere but in that spot. Many people choose a far corner of the yard, sometimes a place that is fenced off, as the spot where their dog goes to the bathroom. If you don't have a yard, choose a spot close to your home or apartment. It doesn't matter where the location is as long as you take your puppy to the same spot every time. Bringing her to the same spot will associate the smells of the spot with going potty. Smells can often prompt a puppy to eliminate. Keep in mind that some puppies will go potty as soon as you take them outside, while others may need to move around a play a bit before they can eliminate."

Doing so will help your puppy to understand that this is good behavior and that she should keep doing it. [6] X Research source The promise of a reward will encourage her to perform the same good behavior again. Give your puppy her reward immediately after she goes to the bathroom and while she's still in her bathroom spot. If you wait, she'll associate the praise with something else. Wait until your puppy finishes going potty. If you praise your puppy before she has gone to the bathroom, she may get confused."

Cleaning up your puppy’s messes right away will to help prevent further messes in your house. [7] X Research source Use an enzymatic cleaner rather than an ammonia-based cleaner to clean up your puppy’s messes right after they happen. Ammonia based cleaners smell too much like urine, so your puppy may confuse the smell with her own urine. If the area smells like urine, your puppy may want to go to the bathroom there again.

      "content": "Consider crate training your puppy. A crate helps with potty training because dogs do not like to soil their dens. A crate should be a safe place where your puppy can retreat to during the day if she becomes overwhelmed or that she can go to feel safe when you are away. [9] X Research source Make sure the crate is big enough for her to stand up in and lie down with her legs stretched out. If it is too much bigger than this, then she may choose a corner of the crate as a bathroom spot. Make sure not to use the crate as a punishment. Take her out regularly for a game or to offer a toilet break."

They learn by playing; when one puppy bites another puppy too hard, the puppy yelps and stops playing. In this way, puppies learn to control how hard they bite."

When she bites your hand, let out a high-pitched yelp, just the way another puppy would. Let your hand go limp and stop playing. Your puppy will learn that when she bites, she doesn't get attention anymore. Your puppy may try to making up for the bite by nuzzling and licking your hand. Praise her in a sweet voice and reward her with a treat, then keep playing with her. She'll learn that playing nicely gets rewarded. Never spank a puppy to cause her pain in return. Using physical punishment against a puppy will only make her afraid of you."

Provide plenty of puppy-safe chew toys for your puppy to gnaw on during play time. When your puppy starts nipping at your skin, put a chew toy in her mouth. This will teach her that she should be chewing on the toy instead of your hand. Do the same thing if your puppy nips at your heels and ankles when you walk around. Stop walking and give her a chew toy. If you don't have a toy handy, just stop. When she starts playing nicely, praise her. If she grabs something of yours, distract her and swap the item for one of her own toys in its place."

If your puppy is having trouble learning not to bite, you may need to create a time-out area, a place where you take her to teach her that if she can't play nice, she doesn't get to play. Set aside a corner of her playroom and take her there right away when she bites. Don't use the puppy's crate as a time-out area. She should never associate being crated with punishment. After your puppy has been in time out for a few minutes, bring her back to play with the family. Reward her when she plays nicely. If she bites again, give a high-pitched yelp and take her right back to time out. Eventually she will learn not to bite."

Puppies and children can have a lot of fun together, but they have to be taught to play properly. If your puppy gets rough with a child, put her in time out immediately. Make sure your kids know how to play nicely, too. Always supervise your children around your puppy.

The trick is to get your puppy to associate the act of placing her bottom on the floor with the sound of your voice saying \"sit.\" Tell her to \"sit\" in a clear, firm but friendly voice. When she does, give her a treat. [10] X Research source Practice often. Sitting can be practiced inside, outside, and anywhere you take your puppy.

Tell your dog to sit, and when she does, say \"stay\" and wait a few seconds. If she moves, tell her to \"sit,\" then try again. When she successfully stays, reward her with treats and praise. After she has learned how to stay in one place for about 10 seconds, start walking away after you tell her to stay. If she follows you, turn around and tell her to \"sit.\" Say stay and walk away again. Be sure to reward her when she gets it right. Some puppies respond well to a hand signal with the \"stay\" command. Hold up your hand each time you say \"stay.\" Eventually your puppy may be able to stay without hearing the verbal command."

This problem can go on for years if you don't resolve it while your puppy is still young. If your puppy barks and jumps on you when you pick up a leash, wait until she is completely calm before putting it on.

Repeat the process until she learns to walk alongside you instead of pulling on the leash. [14] X Research source When your puppy walks beside you, reward her frequently so she knows that's where she's supposed to walk. Continue using the red light, green light method for a few weeks.

It is important to give your puppy his reward right after he does what you ask him to do. Over time, you should phase out the treats so that your puppy doesn't get a treat each time he performs the behavior. Doing so teaches him to work harder because he can't take it for granted that he gets a treat every time. Otherwise, he may become lazy.

If you do, he will just think that you are angry at him for going potty, rather than realize he has defecated in the wrong spot.
