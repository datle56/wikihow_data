      "content": "Use fine-grained sandpaper to lightly sand and remove the bamboo's natural waxy layer. All bamboo has this layer, and it will prevent the bamboo fibers from accepting the stain. Pay particular attention to the rough areas of the bamboo that may be difficult to get to. If you leave any of the waxy layer, the bamboo will accept stain in some areas, but not in others. This will give the bamboo a mottled look. [1] X Research source Be aware that sanding the bamboo will change the character of the bamboo since it removes the bamboo's natural sheen and reduces the nodes. If the bamboo you desire to stain has been left out in the weather for several months, it may have turned a light gray color. Bamboo that has been weathered has lost its tough, waxy outer layer and will readily take a stain, varnish, or paint. Make sure that the bamboo is free of dust before you get started."
