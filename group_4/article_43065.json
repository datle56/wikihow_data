Inside the office, at a professional meeting, in the classroom, and even out to lunch with colleagues are inappropriate situations to tell a girl that she is pretty. Doing so in these circumstances will put the girl on the spot and could embarrass her, which is not what you want to do.

This way she will have a degree of comfort with you before you tell her she is pretty. Your compliment might go awry if you do not know the girl well. She may consider it out of the blue and “creepy.” If you can, get to know her a bit. Exchange small talk or pleasantries before class or at the water cooler. If you are bolder and work together, try sitting at the same table as her over lunch in order to introduce yourself. Make some small talk. Use other social situations to get to know her. It is easier to tell a girl she is pretty after you’ve spent some time together and are on friendly terms. For example, you could talk while waiting for the bus before or after school, at office parties, or during group projects."

Starting with small talk will help you be more confident with the girl, and the girl be more confident with you. Stay calm and be yourself. Don’t try to put on a false face or you might come across as insincere. Even worse, the girl may think you are joking. Pay attention to body language when talking.

      "content": "Tell her that she looks pretty. There are a number of ways to do this after you have had some initial conversation. What is critical is that you do not blurt out your compliment in the middle of the conversation. Instead, wait for a lull in the conversation. Try something like “You look very pretty this evening” or “I just wanted to say that you look pretty tonight.” It is usually good to go with simplicity. You might also try to be original and plan your own lines. “I’ve always thought you have lovely eyes” or an indirect “Have you done something new with your hair? It is very pretty the way that it frames your face.”"

Make sure that your friend realizes that you are just offering her a nice, friendly, brotherly compliment and doesn’t think that you are interested in more. Tone and body language are key.

Consider complimenting her in an indirect way – a way that says she is pretty without necessarily directly referencing her appearance. [9] X Research source It is also important that your body language is non-aggressive. Don’t lean in too much and respect her personal space. Don’t move in too closely, in other words."
