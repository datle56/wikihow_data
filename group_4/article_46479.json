      "content": "Track your time for at least a week. Keep a log of how you spend every waking moment so you know where your time is going. Get a small notebook you can carry around with you or use your smartphone as a log. Write down the times and what you do during that time. After a week or so, go back and look through your log to get a better picture of how you spend your day. [1] X Research source Don't cheat! If you're not honest about how you spend your time, you won't be able to improve anything. If you spent 20 minutes playing a game on your phone, write it down. If you want a more visual depiction, you can translate your log into pie charts or graphs to get a better idea of what tasks take up the most of your time."

      "content": "Look for things in your time log that are taking you off-task. You might have habits you've developed over time that are now doing you more harm than good. Maybe you check your phone every few minutes or respond to text messages immediately after receiving them. Changing your habits takes time and effort, but it will help you manage your time more effectively so you have more time to do the things you enjoy and find fulfilling. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment Program in the University of Kentucky devoted to scientific research and public education Go to source For example, if you find that you're frequently derailed by social media notifications, turning those notifications off will help you stay on task better. Then, you can block specific times to check your social media accounts. If your problem is constantly checking your phone, try putting your phone in a drawer or another room while you're working on something important."

      "content": "Organize your workspace to eliminate time-sinks. Remove clutter from your workspace and put everything you need in reach. If your workspace is disorganized, you'll lose time trying to find things that you need. Keep necessary items close at hand in a designated spot so you can always find them when you need them. [3] X Research source This principle doesn't just apply to your desk at work—you can put it to good use at home as well. For example, organize your kitchen so that the utensils you use most frequently are nearest to where you use them. This also applies to ideas. Life coach Rachel Clissold says to get your ideas out of your head when you want to organize them for more clarity. Write a to-do list of ideas to keep them from getting lost in your head."

      "title": "Make a list of goals you want to achieve.",
      "content": "Make a list of goals you want to achieve. Start with 3-5 goals that you can achieve within a few weeks. Your goals might be work or school-related, personal, or a mixture. Think of things you want to change or improve upon and figure out what you need to do to get to where you want to be. Prioritize your goals so the most important one is first—that's the one you'll spend the most quality time on. [4] X Trustworthy Source University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment Program in the University of Kentucky devoted to scientific research and public education Go to source Use the \"SMART\" method to set goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely. [5] X Research source For example, you might set a goal to walk 2 miles 4 days a week. If you're already in the habit of walking regularly, this goal is certainly attainable. It's also specific and measurable. Once you've accomplished a few goals, use that sense of achievement to motivate yourself to press further. You can move on to more complex, long-term goals. Just break them down into smaller pieces so they're attainable. When setting actionable, realistic short-term goals, life coach Sydney Axelrod says to be clear about what you want to get out of your goals. If you want to make a certain amount of money or lose weight, get clear on why. Is it for confidence reasons? Are you trying to accomplish your dreams? These are all questions to ask as you’re setting your goals."

      "content": "Mark events on a calendar and schedule daily tasks. Calendars help with long-term planning and specific events that take place on a certain date and time. Use a separate schedule for your daily tasks. Usually, your schedule will be fairly repetitive from day-to-day. [6] X Research source Schedule time in half-hour and hour blocks. Group similar tasks together so your brain isn't switching gears as often. [7] X Research source For example, you might schedule a half-hour block in the morning and in the afternoon to read and respond to emails. If someone asks you to do something and you're booked, don't be afraid to say \"no.\" Trying to fit too many tasks into a day is a big reason people get stressed out.

      "title": "Do tasks that are both urgent and important first.",
      "content": "Do tasks that are both urgent and important first. Categorize your tasks based on how important and urgent they are, then do the ones at the top of the list first. Urgency relates to the time you have to complete the task, while importance relates to a task's necessity. If a task is urgent but not important, complete it after the tasks that are both urgent and important. Then, move on to tasks that are important but not urgent. [9] X Research source Leave tasks that are neither urgent nor important for last. If possible, you can also delegate these tasks to others to complete."

      "title": "Do important tasks when you have the most energy.",
      "content": "Do important tasks when you have the most energy. Track your energy during the day to figure out when it's at its peak. If you're a morning person, you likely have the most energy soon after you get up, then flag later on in the afternoon. Night people, on the other hand, might find that they get a burst of energy later in the evening. [10] X Trustworthy Source University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment Program in the University of Kentucky devoted to scientific research and public education Go to source If you have a deadline coming up soon, you might not be able to move around tasks like this. However, if you plan better for deadlines in the future, you can schedule that work for times when you have the most energy. When managing time for productivity, Axelrod says to put yourself into the inquiry of what works best for you, when you work best, and what you need to be most productive. Then, find a way to put those boundaries in place."

      "title": "Delegate tasks you don’t need to do yourself.",
      "content": "Delegate tasks you don’t need to do yourself. If a task is neither urgent nor important, it can probably be done by someone else. If you can delegate tasks to other people, particularly in the work environment, it can help free up some of your time and take some of the pressure off you. Keep in mind that delegation doesn't just mean assigning a task to another person—you can also use your computer and apps to automate some of your tasks. [11] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source For example, if you find that you usually reply the same way to specific types of emails, you can automate a response so that you can respond with a single click rather than having to type it out every time. Avoid thinking that you have to do everything yourself or it won't be done correctly. Give others a chance to help you, particularly with things that aren't that important or difficult. It'll free up some of your time so you can get other important things done."

      "content": "Prioritize spending quality time with people you love. Time with your family and friends can be fulfilling and calming. Give your loved ones the gift of your attention by being present in the moments you share with them, rather than your mind being elsewhere. Find and schedule specific things to do so that you're not all just sitting in the same room on your phones. [12] X Research source For example, you might have a family dinner on an evening when everyone is going to be home at around the same time. You could also schedule a family game night and choose board games that the whole family can enjoy. Some things you do every day are even better with friends! For example, if you run most mornings for exercise, get a friend to run with you once or twice a week."

      "title": "Focus on the task at hand.",
      "content": "Focus on the task at hand. Staying in the moment rather than doing something automatically while you think about something else is part of using your time wisely. You'll get things done more efficiently and get more enjoyment out of them if you commit to them 100% when you're doing them. [13] X Research source This applies to time spent with family or friends as well. When you're eating dinner with the family, put your phone away and avoid checking your email or texting others. You'll get a lot more out of the time if you actively participate and remain present in the moment. When you’re constantly bouncing back and forth between tasks, you become less efficient and more likely to make a mistake. This can result in you using up more time and energy than you would’ve if you stuck to one task at a time.

      "title": "Take frequent breaks to keep your mind fresh.",
      "content": "Take frequent breaks to keep your mind fresh. If possible, take a 15-20 minute break every hour. You can only focus and concentrate for so long on a specific task. Taking frequent breaks keeps you working at peak performance and ensures you don't burn out. Over time, you might find that you feel less tired at the end of the day. [15] X Research source If your work or school environment doesn't allow you to take breaks this long, you should still make an effort to take some kind of break every hour or so—even if it means switching tasks and doing something that doesn't take a lot of mental effort. For example, if you only have 10 minutes between 2 hour-long classes, you could step outside for a couple of minutes and walk around the building to help refresh your mind. Axelrod says to refill your cup and avoid trying to take on too many things when trying to be more productive. Ask yourself if you’re getting enough sleep, taking breaks, and finding ways to unwind. According to Axelrod, you want to feel energized, focused, and clear so you can properly take on your goals."

      "content": "Be willing to say no. No is one of the most powerful words when it comes to using your time wisely. We only have 24 hours in the day, so unless you have extra time to spare, you must be willing to tell others no when they ask you to do a task that you don’t have the capacity for. This especially rings true in a work environment. Even if you feel bad for saying no, remember that you’re a part of a team. Other people can complete the task. [16] X Research source If you’re working on a project and you’re close to the deadline, someone asking you to do another task can completely throw you off. Respond by saying “I wish I could, but I’m busy with this project that’s due soon. Can you find someone else to do it?”"

      "content": "Prioritize your hobbies and things that bring you joy, too. You don’t have to dedicate hours upon hours to your hobbies if they eat into the other important tasks that you have to do, but prioritize and make time for them. Dedicate 45 minutes to an hour a day to doing something that brings you joy, like drawing, painting, making music, or another creative endeavor.

      "title": "Avoid comparing yourself to others.",
      "content": "Avoid comparing yourself to others. Everyone is different, which means the way that they use their time is different. What’s wise to one person may be detrimental to the next, so avoid comparing yourself to how other people manage their time. Everyone’s measure of success is different, and holding yourself to other people’s standards of success is a great way to eat at your own time and avoid achieving your goals. [18] X Research source When measuring your goals, Axelrod says to ask yourself what success looks like to you. If you want to be more mindful, what does that look like? Is it being at peace more often? Feeling more confident or patient? Use these questions to help measure progress towards your goals. Axelrod says to put those goals on a 1-10 scale and measure them. See how at peace you feel at the start of the month and continue measuring throughout the month to check progress."

      "content": "Be honest about your progress. As you reflect on how much progress you’ve made when it comes to using your time wisely, be honest with yourself so you know where you need to improve. When you lie to yourself about your progress, it can keep you in the same spot and cause you to not make any progress at all, which is much worse than having to face the fact that you may not have made as much progress as you’d like.

      "title": "Using your time wisely means making the most of the time you have.",
      "content": "Using your time wisely means making the most of the time you have. Using your time wisely means prioritizing important tasks, dedicating a specific amount of time to those tasks by scheduling in advance, and doing whatever you can to avoid wasting time, especially when you’re busy. For example, if you had two days to complete a 10-page assignment, using your time wisely would look like dedicating the first day to research and outlining and the second day to writing the assignment. [20] X Research source Really using your time wisely would look like carving out specific blocks of time for the research and outlining, then switching tasks when your time is up. People who use their time wisely often use calendars, reminder apps, and written notes to keep themselves on task."

When you move as though you’re working towards something, whether that looks like planning out your week, holding yourself accountable when you need to complete tasks, or genuinely walking with a purpose towards your next destination. By consistently channeling your time and energy towards a bigger goal or goals, you are using that time and energy wisely. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "You play to your strengths. Playing to your strengths results in being effective, as you aren’t wasting time on doing something you aren’t good at. So, if you’re the type to lean into your areas of expertise and lead with your unique attributes when taking on tasks, rather than overshooting and under delivering, that’s a sign you use your time wisely.

      "content": "You aren’t afraid to work in a team. If you’re the type to enlist a team of people for a project because you know doing things by yourself will take longer and possibly result in lower quality work, then you definitely use your time wisely. By working with others, you can compound your tasks for a project and get it done way faster than if you were by yourself. So don’t second-guess your affinity for teamwork. It’s a sign you’re wise with your time. [23] X Research source When you work with a team, you’ve got more eyes for review and observation, which brings that time down, as well."

      "content": "You’re committed to your values. Values are just as important as anything else when it comes to using your time wisely. When you act in accordance with your beliefs, you can find fulfillment and create a life that you love. But when you go against your beliefs, you may find it harder to move through life, which can result in a lack of energy and more time being spent trying to do regular tasks. [24] X Research source For example, working for a company that specializes in endangered species conservation, when you are passionate about saving endangered species, will make you more excited to show up for work than if you worked for a deforestation company. Being happier at work and liking your job typically results in higher productivity, meaning you’ll complete tasks quicker than if you were working at a job you hated. [25] X Research source Self leadership coach and executive resilience builder Guy Reichard says to find your values by exploring and reflecting on the way you live and experience your life. Over time, certain themes and patterns that show your beliefs will emerge."

Managing your time wisely is a combination of adhering to tight schedules, being dedicated to completing the tasks at hand, and making time for yourself and others. When you’re busy, say no, as you don’t have the time for new tasks. But, don’t cut yourself off from the world, either. Make sure you’re spending time with family and friends, on top of tasks in your personal life. Carve out time for your hobbies, as well. Dedicating time to creative tasks and things that you love tends to result in increased feelings of relaxation, which can give you more energy for productivity."
