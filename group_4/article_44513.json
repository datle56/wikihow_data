      "content": "Look for changes in your Rottweiler’s activity level. With dysplasia, your Rottweiler’s joints become painful from normal wear and tear. If your Rottweiler’s joints are bothering him, he’ll start slowing down or completely avoid certain activities. For example, he might be unable to handle long walks and may refuse to go on walks at all.

Go to source In addition, he may be more reluctant to go up and down stairs. [3] X Research source If your Rottweiler used to excitedly greet you at the door, he might walk more slowly toward the door, or simply stay where he is."

      "title": "Observe how your Rottweiler walks.",
      "content": "Observe how your Rottweiler walks. Rottweilers with hip dysplasia have a characteristic ‘bunny hop’ gait, during which the back legs move at the same time, rather than one at a time. [4] X Research source With elbow dysplasia, your Rottweiler may have a ‘paddling’ gait (legs swinging out to the side) if both front legs are painful. [5] X Research source Limping is common with either form of dysplasia. Your Rottweiler might have a stiff walk first thing in the morning. This initial stiffness usually goes away as the day goes on. [6] X Research source With elbow dysplasia, your Rottweiler will have trouble flexing and extending his front legs, which likely contributes to the paddling action. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Watch how your Rottweiler holds his front legs.",
      "content": "Watch how your Rottweiler holds his front legs. Elbow dysplasia occurs when the radius and ulna (the two bones below the elbow) grow at uneven rates in the front legs. This unevenness causes the bones to fit improperly into the elbow joint, creating pressure and pain. Your Rottweiler will try to relieve this discomfort by twisting the affected leg out to one side. Unfortunately, twisting the leg out worsens the dysplasia. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Take your Rottweiler to your vet.",
      "content": "Take your Rottweiler to your vet. Your vet will perform a full physical exam, then perform a more focused orthopedic exam. During the orthopedic exam, your vet will move your Rottweiler’s legs and joints in different directions, as well as watch how your Rottweiler walks (and runs, if possible). X-rays will help your vet see how much your Rottweiler’s joints have been affected by the dysplasia. Since your Rottweiler may be in a lot of pain, he will need to be sedated for the x-rays. [9] X Research source On an x-ray for hip dysplasia, the top of the femur (thigh bone) does not fit into the hip socket and may have extra bone growth. For elbow dysplasia, your vet would see bone fragments in the joint.

      "title": "Modify your Rottweiler’s exercise.",
      "content": "Modify your Rottweiler’s exercise. Dysplasia treatment is divided into medical (non-surgical) and surgical. Controlled exercise is an effective form of medical treatment since it can maintain muscle tone, improve joint stability, and improve range of motion. Short walks and swimming are great low-impact exercises for your Rottweiler. How much exercise he can handle will involve some trial and error. [12] X Research source Try to walk your Rottweiler on the grass, which provides more cushioning than asphalt. [13] X Research source Avoid high-impact activities, like running and jumping. [14] X Research source Exercise your Rottweiler every day. [15] X Research source Talk with your vet about long each exercise session should be."

      "title": "Manage your Rottweiler’s weight.",
      "content": "Manage your Rottweiler’s weight . Large dogs put more pressure on their joints. Rottweiler’s are naturally large dogs, so if your Rottweiler is carrying around extra weight, he’s putting even more pressure on his joints. Help him lose weight by switching him to a reduced-calorie diet, which you can purchase through your vet or at your local pet store. If you’ve been feeding him store-bought treats, which tend to be high in fat, switch him to healthy treats or take treats out of his diet entirely. Carrot sticks and orange slices are healthy treats. [16] X Research source Daily exercise will help your Rottweiler lose weight. Weight loss in dogs should be gradual. Your vet can determine your Rottweiler’s ideal weight and how long it should take him to reach that weight."

      "title": "Add supplements to your Rottweiler’s diet.",
      "content": "Add supplements to your Rottweiler’s diet. Dietary supplements called nutraceuticals have become increasingly popular for treating joint problems in dogs. [17] X Research source Nutraceuticals containing chondroitin and/or glucosamine, which are effective at repairing damaged joint cartilage, are commonly used in dogs. [18] X Research source Omega-3 fatty acids help improve joint health. [19] X Research source Many nutraceuticals are available, but not all of them are high in quality. Ask your vet to recommend high-quality products for your Rottweiler."

      "title": "Use medication to reduce joint pain and inflammation.",
      "content": "Use medication to reduce joint pain and inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to reduce joint pain and inflammation in dogs. Always have your dog take non-steroidals with or after eating food, as they can cause side effects like stomach ulcers when given on an empty stomach. Your vet may check your dogs liver and kidney function before starting medication to make sure it won't have any serious side effects. While your Rottweiler is on NSAIDs, your vet will run blood tests to check his liver and kidney function. [20] X Research source Tramadol relieves pain and doesn’t have many side effects. Steroids reduce pain and inflammation but can cause serious side effects, such as weight gain and weakened bones. [21] X Research source Whichever medication your vet prescribes, follow the prescription instructions carefully."

[22] X Research source [23] X Research source Your vet can recommend various physical therapy exercises for you to perform on your Rottweiler at home. A massage can feel like a little piece of heaven to your Rottweiler. Make the massage area quiet and comfortable. When you massage him, use gentle pressure around his joints. [24] X Research source It may take a while for your Rottweiler to get used to the massage. Be patient as he gets accustomed to you touching him in this way."

      "title": "Keep your Rottweiler’s sleeping area comfortable.",
      "content": "Keep your Rottweiler’s sleeping area comfortable. Your Rottweiler will appreciate a warm and comfortable place to sleep if he has dysplasia. Consider purchasing an orthopedic foam bed, which will be easy for him to get into and out of and will not create painful pressure points around his joints. Place the bed in a warm and draft-free area of your home. [25] X Research source When your Rottweiler is not in his bed, you could use heating pads around his joints to warm him up and relieve pain. Wrap the heating pad in a towel to prevent his skin burns. [26] X Research source Limit the use of the heating pad to 15 or 20 minutes."

      "content": "Discuss surgical options with your vet. Surgery is frequently recommended for elbow dysplasia. The main goals for elbow dysplasia surgery are to correct unevenness between the radius and ulna and repair joint damage. [27] X Trustworthy Source American College of Veterinary Surgeons Trade organization responsible for setting standards of surgical excellence for the field of veterinary medicine and promoting safe practices for equine care. Go to source Several different types of elbow dysplasia surgery are available, including total elbow replacement. [28] X Research source Several surgical options also exist for hip dysplasia, including total hip replacement or removal of the head (top) of the femur. [29] X Research source Your vet will be able to recommend the ideal surgery for your Rottweiler. Obese dogs typically do not make good candidates for surgery. [30] X Research source If your Rottweiler is obese, your vet may recommend that he lose a certain amount of weight before having surgery. Depending on the complexity of the surgical procedure, your vet may refer you to a veterinary surgeon."
