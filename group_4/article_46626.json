      "title": "Wear long sleeves and work gloves while operating your heat gun.",
      "content": "Wear long sleeves and work gloves while operating your heat gun. Before operating a heat gun, put on some heavy-duty work gloves and a long-sleeved shirt. These will create a barrier between your skin and the heat from the gun nozzle in case you accidentally aim the heat gun at your hand or arm while it’s on. [2] X Research source Make sure you wear clean work clothes and gloves that haven’t been exposed to any solvents or other flammable materials. Keep in mind that this barrier likely won’t prevent your skin from burning for more than a few seconds, so you still need to avoid aiming the gun at any part of your body! You can purchase heat-resistant work gloves at many hardware or building supply stores. Depending on the type of work you are doing, such as drying glassware in a chemistry lab, you might need to wear additional protective gear, such as goggles and a fire-retardant coat. If you’re using a heat gun to strip lead-based paint, you’ll also need a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) with a HEPA filter and an organic vapor cartridge."

      "title": "Make sure the air inlets are not blocked.",
      "content": "Make sure the air inlets are not blocked. Covering the air inlets on your heat gun could cause the gun to overheat and catch fire. Always make sure the inlets are clear and open while you’re operating the gun. [6] X Research source The air inlets look like a group of slits or holes and are located at the back end of the gun, over the internal fan and motor assembly. If you need to use both hands to aim or steady the gun, make sure your hand is not covering the inlets."

      "content": "Maintain a distance of at least .4 inches (1.0 cm) from your work surface. Placing the nozzle of the gun directly against your work surface could both damage the surface and potentially cause the gun to overheat. Make sure there is always at least a small space between the nozzle and whatever you are heating. [7] X Research source You may need to vary the distance between the nozzle and the surface depending on what kind of work you are doing."

      "content": "Keep the hot nozzle away from your body and clothing. Even with protective clothing on, you can easily burn yourself if you accidentally touch the nozzle or aim it at yourself. As long as the gun is switched on, take care to keep it pointed away from you at all times. [8] X Research source Never look into the barrel of the gun while it’s switched on, or you could burn your face and eyes. Since a heat gun doesn’t produce an obvious flame the way a blow torch does, it can be easy to forget that there’s a jet of extremely hot air coming out of it."

      "title": "Switch your heat gun off before setting it down.",
      "content": "Switch your heat gun off before setting it down. Even if you’re still in the middle of a project, always turn off the gun before you put it down, even for a second. Setting down an active heat gun could easily cause a fire or other severe damage or injury. Switch it off and set it down on an insulated surface free of any flammable materials when you’re not using it. [11] X Research source Some heat guns have a power switch located on the handle under the barrel of the gun, in the “trigger” position. However, other models have the switch located on top of the device. You can purchase a steel heat shield or a soldering block for your workbench online or from a home improvement store."

      "content": "Allow the heat gun to cool for at least 30 minutes before storing it. Even after the heat gun is turned off, the nozzle will still be very hot. To prevent fires and other damage, don’t put your heat gun away until it’s had a chance to cool down completely. [12] X Research source Some heat guns have a “cold” setting that you can turn on to help the gun cool more quickly. Let your heat gun cool down on a heat-resistant surface, such as a steel heat shield or a soldering block, before you put it away."

      "content": "Use an attachment to target your heat. Heat guns typically come with a variety of attachments that will allow you to aim your heat more precisely. If you want to heat a specific area without singeing or damaging the areas around it, use a nozzle attachment that concentrates or narrows the flow of heat. [13] X Research source Alternatively, you can build a heat shield by cutting a hole in a piece of cardboard. Make the hole slightly larger than your target area and cover the cardboard with aluminum foil to insulate it. Position the shield in between the nozzle and the painted surface.

      "title": "Switch your heat gun on to the recommended setting.",
      "content": "Switch your heat gun on to the recommended setting. A basic heat gun designed for paint stripping may have only one heat setting and fan speed. However, more advanced multi-purpose models have multiple settings. [15] X Research source Consult your user manual to find the appropriate settings for stripping paint. The amount of heat you’ll need will depend on the kind of paint you’re working with and what sort of building material is underneath. You’ll likely need to heat your gun to at least 700 °F (371 °C) to remove paint effectively. [16] X Trustworthy Source US Occupational Safety and Health Administration U.S. government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards Go to source If you’re working in a building constructed before 1978, never use a heat gun at a temperature higher than 1,100 °F (593 °C) to strip paint. Higher temperatures increase your risk of exposure to dangerous lead fumes. Your heat gun may have separate controls to set the temperature and the airspeed. Set your heat gun to the correct settings before switching on the airflow unless your manual says otherwise."

      "content": "Remove old window glazing with a heat gun. If you need to redo the glazing on your windows, a heat gun is a must. As windows age, the glazing (a special putty that holds the panes in place) can become brittle and start to crack or flake away. Use a heat gun with a heat shield attachment to soften the old glazing. Use a stiff putty knife to gouge out the glazing as it softens. [23] X Research source Keep the heat gun moving so you don’t overheat the glass and crack it. Examine the wood for damage when you’re done. Before you add the new glazing, repair damaged areas with wood epoxy and prime any bare wood with a shellac-based primer. [24] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply shrink wrap with a heat gun. Another one of the most popular uses for heat guns is to shrink plastic wrap. Wrap your item in special shrink-wrap plastic or place it in a shrinkable plastic bag, then go over the plastic with a heat gun until it shrinks into place. Keep the heat gun 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) away from the plastic wrap and move it continuously to avoid melting a hole in the plastic. [25] X Research source If you use a shrinkable bag, tuck the opening shut and tape it, or tie it off at the top. Always use shrink-wrap plastic for this purpose. If you use regular plastic cling-wrap, it will burn or melt and release toxic fumes."
