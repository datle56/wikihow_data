      "content": "Keep it playful if you’re talking to friends and family members. If you’re playing a game with a childhood friend, sibling, or anyone else you’ve known for years, tease them with a silly jab. It’s an effective way to ruffle their feathers without personally attacking them. If you’re playing in a competitive event against people you don’t know, focus on serious boasts and downplay the humor. You could say, “Should I give you my autograph now or later?” [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Read the crowd to see if trash talking is appropriate. Whether you’re competing online or in person, “read the room” before saying anything. If the other players project respect and good sportsmanship, your trash talk may be considered rude. The same rule applies in online forums—if the other participants enjoy trash talk or are already engaging in it, go ahead and join in. If the crowd is more conservative or prefers a quieter atmosphere, avoid bothering them with trash talk."

      "title": "Familiarize yourself with the sports etiquette.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the sports etiquette. Some sports, such as boxing and wrestling, are aggressive, in-your-face competitions. These environments encourage trash talk because they increase the entertainment for spectators and allow the fighters to get under each other’s skin. [2] X Research source Other sports, like tennis or baseball, are seen as more “respectable,” so they discourage trash talk. Some competitive games, like Call of Duty, are more appropriate forums for trash talk. Until you’re familiar with the gaming community, avoid saying anything rude or aggressive. If you’re playing a light-hearted game with a much younger or older family member, avoid trash talk. For example, if you’re playing Wii Sports with your nephew or grandmother, encourage them or cheer them on."

      "title": "Boast about your skills.",
      "content": "Boast about your skills. No matter what type of competition you’re in, most trash talk involves boasting about your excellence. Have fun coming up with a line that’s clever and creative, and let your opponent know that you’re the best in the game. You might say something like, “I’m the ninth wonder of the world” or “I’m the reason why people came to watch the game.” Be prepared to back up your words with actions. If you’re playing basketball and say you’re able to make a shot from half court, you’ll need to prove that you can make the shot. [3] X Research source Don’t be immature or boast about skills you don’t have. For example, young teens are notorious for filling online gaming forums with juvenile humor and over-the-top boasts."

      "title": "Insult your opponents.",
      "content": "Insult your opponents. Use intimidation to make your opponent doubt their own skill at a game, or distract them with trash talk so they can no longer focus on the competition. Messing with your opponent’s mind is one of the best ways to catch them off guard, as long as you do it in a light-hearted or clever manner. [4] X Research source You might say: “You’re already yesterday’s news.” [5] X Research source “You’re like school on Sunday—no class.” “Want me to hold your shoes and socks?” “Your mom called. She said you left your game at home.”"

      "title": "Use humor to your advantage.",
      "content": "Use humor to your advantage. Successful trash talk is usually witty or random. Since no one plays well when they’re laughing, humor is a great strategy to distract your opponents or build up camaraderie within your own team. You could say something like: “That’s a clown haircut.” “You fight like a dairy farmer.” “If you ever dream of beating me, you’d better wake up and apologize.” [6] X Research source “Did you hear a bell ring? Because someone is about to get served.”"

      "title": "Know when trash talk isn’t working.",
      "content": "Know when trash talk isn’t working. If you feel that your trash talking is ineffective, it’s probably a good idea to stop. If you continue trash talking, you may start to look desperate or give the impression that you’re more skilled at running your mouth than at winning competitions."

    {
      "title": "Build yourself up.",
      "content": "Build yourself up. Successful trash talk can make you feel more aggressive, which often translates into better playing. If you’re competing on a team, it can also motivate your teammates to join in and step up their game. A great strategy to boost your confidence is to tell your opponent what you’re going to do before doing it. For example, you could say: “I’m about to send your character to the grave. RIP.” “This next move is why they call me the greatest of all time.” “My shots are as accurate as sniper fire. Watch and learn, little boy.” “I’m going to dribble twice, then make a three-pointer over your head.”"

      "title": "Keep the pressure on your opponent.",
      "content": "Keep the pressure on your opponent. If you can taunt your opponent during the game, it may help you feel less pressured and self-conscious about your performance. Draw attention to your success and your opponent’s failure to make them think they don’t have a chance of winning against you. [7] X Research source You could say something like: “Which one of my hands do you want to lose to?” [8] X Research source “Awww. Look who’s trying to defend. That’s so cute.” “I haven’t seen a shot that out of range since elementary school.” “Is that the best you got? I’ve seen better swings at my kid’s school.”"

      "title": "Maintain basic sportsmanship.",
      "content": "Maintain basic sportsmanship. Although losing a competitive event is never fun, you should still show dignity and sportsmanship. Avoid complaining or criticizing your opponent to be respectful , and always shake their hand at the end of the game. There’s a difference between trash talking and poor sportsmanship—a good trash-talker can still admit when an opponent out-performed them. If you want to show that you’re a good sport, lightly mock yourself if you’re not playing well. A little self-directed trash talk will make everyone laugh and show them you’re not taking the game too seriously."

      "title": "Anticipate trash talk directed towards you.",
      "content": "Anticipate trash talk directed towards you. Once you’ve made it clear that you’re cool with trash talk, expect your opponents to throw out some insults. Try not to let them get into your head, and stay focused on the game or event. [9] X Research source If an opponent trash talks you, a sarcastic reply can give you the advantage. For example, if an opponent is boasting, reply with: “Don’t be humble. You’re not that good.” [10] X Research source"
