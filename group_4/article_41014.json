      "content": "Know the stages of passive-aggressive conflict. There is a passive-aggressive conflict style that can develop in a person with passive-aggressive tendencies. [3] X Research source Whitson, S. (2013). The passive aggressive conflict cycle. Reclaiming Children &amp; Youth, 22(93), pp. 24-27. Stage one of the passive-aggressive conflict cycle is the development of passive-aggressive behaviors. As they develop socially, individuals usually think that direct expressions of anger are perilous and should be avoided [4] X Research source Whitson, S. (2013). The passive aggressive conflict cycle. Reclaiming Children &amp; Youth, 22(93), pp. 24-27. . The person then solves their anger issues by masking the anger with passive-aggressive behaviors [5] X Research source Whitson, S. (2013). The passive aggressive conflict cycle. Reclaiming Children &amp; Youth, 22(93), pp. 24-27. . Stage two of the passive-aggressive conflict cycle is a stressful situation that triggers irrational thoughts based on these early life experiences. [6] X Research source Whitson, S. (2013). The passive aggressive conflict cycle. Reclaiming Children &amp; Youth, 22(93), pp. 24-27. For example, if a teacher asks a student to pass out a worksheet and that student has a prior history of being asked to do things and not being appreciated for it, the student might fall back on this history in the current situation. Instead of feeling honored by being asked to help, the student will feel resentful because the request has triggered a pre-learned response. Stage three occurs when the passive-aggressive individual denies their anger, which can lead to projecting negative feelings onto other people and building resentment towards others. [7] X Research source Whitson, S. (2013). The passive aggressive conflict cycle. Reclaiming Children &amp; Youth, 22(93), pp. 24-27. Stage four of the cycle is to engage in passive-aggressive behavior. This includes (but is not limited to): denying feelings of anger, withdrawing, sulking, pouting, procrastinating, carrying out tasks inefficiently or unacceptably, and exacting hidden revenge. [8] X Research source Whitson, S. (2013). The passive aggressive conflict cycle. Reclaiming Children &amp; Youth, 22(93), pp. 24-27 Stage five of this cycle is the reactions of others. People typically react negatively to passive-aggressive behavior and, often, this is what the aggressor is hoping for. [9] X Research source Whitson, S. (2013). The passive aggressive conflict cycle. Reclaiming Children &amp; Youth, 22(93), pp. 24-27. This reaction then only acts as reinforcement for the behavior and the cycle will begin again."

There are four specific behaviors that are common to passive aggressive habits at work: temporary compliance, intentional inefficiency, letting a problem escalate, and hidden but conscious revenge.

To eliminate these thought processes, first identify when and how they are occurring. Look back and try to recall specific details about your behavior. It can be helpful to view the circumstances as a third-party observer would, being as objective as possible. If you start feeling emotional, take a deep breath and clear your thoughts before continuing. Don't deflect your own role in what happened. The purpose is to examine the circumstances and motivations that bring out your passive aggressive actions. Consider the following questions: Who were the other parties involved? What were their relationships to you (for example: boss, coworker, friend, parent, roommate, teacher)? Did they have authority over you; were they your peers; did you have a decision-making role? Where did it happen? For example, at work, home, school, a party, a game, or a club? When did this occur? Sometimes the timing is a factor, such as the beginning of a school year or during the busy holiday season. How did the incident unfold? Was there a specific trigger or a series of events involved? What was the sequence of actions and responses? What happened in the end? Were the results what you set out to achieve with your negative behavior? What were the reactions of others?"

Generally, this behavior [11] X Research source manifests as deliberate contradictions between what you say (passive) and what you actually do (aggressive). The following are common manifestations of passive-aggressive behavior: offering public support but indirectly resisting, procrastinating or undermining the successful completion of social and occupational tasks agreeing to do something and not following through or pretending to forget giving someone the silent treatment but not letting the person know why pleasing people publicly but demeaning them behind their backs lacking the assertiveness to express feelings and desires but expecting others to know what they are overlaying positive comments with pointed sarcasm or negative body language complaining of being misunderstood and unappreciated by others being sullen and argumentative without offering constructive ideas blaming others for everything while avoiding responsibility unreasonably criticizing and scorning authority to your peers responding to unwelcome authority with covert, dishonest actions repressing emotions in fear of conflict, failure or disappointment expressing envy and resentment toward those apparently more fortunate voicing exaggerated and persistent complaints of personal misfortune alternating between hostile defiance and contrition predicting negative outcomes before even starting the work"

This kind of behavior can be damaging to both the employee's organization and the employee's reputation. Recognizing this type of behavior can allow you to start reducing passive aggressive behaviors at work, which will do your career a lot of good.

Don't be afraid to go back to the beginning and re-assess your behavior. At the same time, don't be hard on yourself if you find yourself unsuccessful on your first attempt. The more you practice and work through your passive aggressive tendencies, the more likely you are to successfully change your behavior. If you find yourself getting off track in your attempts to change passive-aggressive behavior, take a moment to pause and reflect on what is happening. Ask yourself: Can you identify the reasons why you are taking steps backward? Do you need to pause and take a different approach at changing that specific behavior? Is there an underlying feeling or emotional response you have not recognized or worked through yet?"

Practice what you would say to find the right words without being in the heat of the moment. Hear how you're coming across. You can be forceful and direct without having to hurt the other person. Take the blame out of your words and communicate your feelings in a positive manner. Opening yourself up in this way may make you feel more vulnerable in the beginning but you'll gain confidence as you progress. For example, you may be annoyed at someone at work because they always take the last cup of coffee without starting a new pot for others. Instead of keeping quiet until it escalates, speak your mind. Say, \"I see that you're getting the last cup of coffee. Would you mind starting a fresh pot if you get the last cup so that the rest of us can drink coffee on our break as well? Thank you!\" At home, you can be clear with your expectations for your significant other. If your partner is supposed to do the dishes after dinner and doesn't, try saying \"I know that you are tired after working all day, but we agreed that if I cooked dinner, you would do the dishes. If you would prefer to cook and have me do the dishes, we can do that instead, but I think we should share the responsibility for daily household chores.\""

You usually are not in any danger if you can defuse your anger and make your discussions constructive and positive. It's possible to agreeably disagree and be able to work out compromises that bring \"win-win\" results to both parties involved. In this way, you are taking control instead of allowing passive aggressive behavior to send issues out of control. At work, you may disagree with someone about the way a project should be approached. You may want to sit and develop a plan, while a co-worker may want to jump right in and start coming up with visions for the end result without considering first how to get there. Instead of getting angry or annoyed, talk to the person about your differences in process. You may not be able to agree on the best approach to the project, but perhaps you can divide the labor in a way that draws on both of your strengths; your planning and their vision. At home, you might talk to your partner and find that you have assigned them a chore that they really hate doing. Perhaps you can work out a deal where they take on other chores that they find less disagreeable and you can do their chore. For example, they may agree to vacuum, cook, and take out the trash in exchange for not having to do the dishes."
