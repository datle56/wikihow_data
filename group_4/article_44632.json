      "content": "Get a face wash with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. These two products are used frequently to fight acne. They help kill acne-causing bacteria. Before seeing your doctor for a prescription-strength facewash, try starting a daily regimen with one of these store-bought products. Start with the lowest concentration available to see if it works for you before moving up to a higher concentration. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source These products are available over the counter. Visit a local pharmacy and find them in the skincare section. Products are also available online. If you buy from a website, make sure the wash is from a reputable brand and seller. Avoid face washes with alcohol. This chemical is irritating and can make acne worse. Use a soft washcloth or baking soda to help exfoliate your skin even more when you wash your face."

Then gently rub it on your face in a circular motion. Cover your whole face, but especially pay attention to areas where you have papules. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you have papules on your neck, wash here as well.

Only apply the toner after you wash your face for the best effect. Rub a coin-sized amount of toner over the affected area and work it deep into your skin. Leave the toner on your skin so it can shrink the size of your acne. [6] X Research source Salicylic acid can cause dryness and peeling skin. If your face gets red or dry after applying salicylic acid, use a green clay mask to help reduce the redness. Start by applying salicylic acid toner once daily. If you don’t notice any effects, you can apply it up to 3 times each day, but be sure to wash your face before each treatment."

      "content": "Limit your washing to 2 times a day and after sweating. You might be tempted to wash your face as much as possible to get rid of your acne, but this is counterproductive. Too much washing irritates your face and makes acne worse. Only wash twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. You can also wash if you get sweaty because sweat is irritating and should be washed off. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Wash your face as soon as possible after sweating. If you only have time to wash your face once, do it at night. This removes all the dirt and sweat that accumulated on your face throughout the day."

A chemical peel is a cosmetic procedure that removes the top layer of dead skin on your face and reveals the fresh layer beneath it. Some dermatologists use them to treat acne papules. Your dermatologist may perform one of these peels if your papules are small and haven’t developed into cysts or pustules yet. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Chemical peels are less effective against larger acne cysts.

Oral antibiotics usually work best when you continue washing with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, so continue your face washing regimen."

If your hair hangs over your face, it transfers that grease to your skin, which can cause acne outbreaks.

[10] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Also wash your hair at least 3-4 times per week to remove grease. That way, even if your hair does drape over your face, there is less of a chance that it will cause an outbreak. If your hair is naturally oily, try washing it every day."

Some might be more effective than others, but you can try them out and see if any work for you. Lemon juice works as an astringent, and some supporters say that it kills the bacteria in acne pimples. Use lemon juice fresh from a lemon, not from a bottle. Honey also has antibacterial properties and spreading a bit on your acne could help clear it up.

Reapply sunscreen every 2 hours of being in the sun so you stay protected."
