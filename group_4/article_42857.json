      "title": "Present the numbers one at a time.",
      "content": "Present the numbers one at a time. Beginning with the number 11, teach children these numbers one at a time. Write the number on the board, and include a visual image: if you are teaching the number 11, draw 11 flowers, 11 cars, or 11 happy faces. It may also help to incorporate the concept of a ten frame at this point, including a ten frame with the appropriate number of units. For more on ten frames, see Part 2."

      "title": "Teach children to count to 20.",
      "content": "Teach children to count to 20. Children can usually learn to count to 20 fairly easily by rote memorization. Make it even easier by tackling the numbers just two at a time – first count to 12, then 14, and so on. [1] X Research source Note, however, that teaching children to count to 20 is not the same as teaching children to understand the number values. Counting needs to be accompanied by other lessons aimed at number awareness and comprehension."

      "title": "Practice writing the numbers.",
      "content": "Practice writing the numbers. Once children know the individual numbers and can count to 20 in the correct order, have them practice writing the numbers themselves. For best results, have them pronounce the numbers out loud as they write them."

      "content": "Incorporate objects. Some children have more success learning these numbers when they use objects they can touch. Have children count out sticks, pencils, cubes, marbles, or other small items. Reinforce the fact that if they count objects one by one, the number they reach when they stop counting is equivalent to the number of objects they have accumulated. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Make it physical.",
      "content": "Make it physical. Have children count their steps (stairs are great for this, but it’s also fine just to walk from one side of a room to the other), or have them jump up and down 20 times, counting as they go. Hopscotch games work well for this purpose. Draw 10 squares on the ground, and fill them with the numbers from 1 to 10. Have children count from 1 to 10 when they hop forward and from 11 to 20 when they hop backward."

The number 20 is made of two whole tens. Help children visualize this concept by writing the number 11 and, next to it, showing a ten and a single unit, separated by a circle."

You can use coins or other small objects to demonstrate this, and you can also draw it on the board. [4] X Research source For a good activity, give each child two ten frames and 20 objects of some kind. Have them create the number 11: one full ten frame, and a second ten frame with just one unit in it. Have them create the other numbers. You can also reverse the process, starting with full ten frames and taking objects away."

Fill the right column with the numbers 1 to 10, in sequence; leave the left column blank. Then: Add representative numbers of objects, such as small cubes, to the ones column: a single cube next to number 1, two cubes next to number 2, and so on. Explain that you could represent a ten with either ten of the small cubes or one larger stick. Fill the tens column with sticks, one by one, and explain how these numbers would work together to create larger numbers."
