      "title": "Cherry eye is the prolapse of a dog's tear gland in their third eyelid.",
      "content": "Cherry eye is the prolapse of a dog's tear gland in their third eyelid. Like many other animals, dogs have a third eyelid that is located in their lower eyelid. This third eyelid gives their eyes added protection and also produces most of their tears. Normally, the tear gland in their third eyelid is firmly attached, keeping it in place. Dogs with cherry eye have a weaker attachment between the gland and the third eyelid, which can cause it to dislodge and bulge out of place. [1] X Research source It's common for cherry eye to occur in one or both eyes. Dogs usually develop cherry when they are 2 years old or younger, but it's also possible for dogs to experience the condition later in life."

The bulging tissue may only be visible sometimes. In other cases, the tissue may cover a large portion of your dog's eye and remain visible at all times. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Dogs who experience cherry eye often have a genetic predisposition.",
      "content": "Dogs who experience cherry eye often have a genetic predisposition. There isn't a specific cause (or prevention method), but these dogs usually have a weaker attachment between the lower inner rim of their eye and their third eyelid gland. This makes it easier for the gland to prolapse. Dogs that have a genetic predisposition to cherry eye include: [6] X Research source Cocker spaniels Boston terriers Bloodhounds Bulldogs Shih Tzus Lhasa Apsos Beagles Boxers"

      "title": "If your dog shows symptoms, take them to the vet as soon as possible.",
      "content": "If your dog shows symptoms, take them to the vet as soon as possible. Surgery is required to treat cherry eye in pretty much all cases, so it's important that you schedule an appointment with your veterinarian. They'll be able to give you an official cherry eye diagnosis and advise what type of surgery will be the best fit for your dog. [7] X Research source Veterinarians don't recommend trying to treat cherry eye at home. Though they may prescribe a topical ointment to soothe your dog's eye, this will only be a temporary solution to relieve their discomfort."

      "title": "In most cases, your vet will recommend the tucking method.",
      "content": "In most cases, your vet will recommend the tucking method. During this surgery, your veterinarian will place a stitch through the gland to guide it back to its correct location in the third eyelid. This stitch will permanently remain in your dog's eye, holding the gland in its proper place. [8] X Research source This surgery is sometimes called \"tacking.\" Though this surgery is the most common and successful treatment method, sometimes, the stitch doesn't hold permanently. In that case, your dog may have to undergo additional surgeries to get another stitch in their eye."

      "content": "Your vet may suggest imbrication if the tucking method doesn't hold. In this surgery, your veterinarian will take out a small portion of tissue located above your dog's third eyelid gland. Once the tissue is removed, your vet will close the gap left in its place by adding small stitches that tighten the connection between the gland and the third eyelid. These stitches will dissolve later on, but the attachment should remain secure. [9] X Research source This surgery is relatively new compared to other methods. Your dog may experience swelling at the sight of the stitches as they dissolve. Though surgeries are usually successful, it's possible the stitches won't hold, causing the gland to prolapse again."

      "title": "Vets only recommend removing the gland in extreme, recurrent cases.",
      "content": "Vets only recommend removing the gland in extreme, recurrent cases. This was once the most popular option, but it's fallen out of favor in recent years. Vets rarely perform the procedure due to the third eyelid gland's importance to a dog's overall eye health. If the gland is removed, your dog's ability to produce tears will be significantly lessened. This can result in medical complications like dry eye, which can be costly to treat and impact your dog's sight. [10] X Research source The third eyelid gland produces 30 to 40% of your dog's tears, which is why veterinarians try to avoid removing it if at all possible. Your veterinarian may still recommend this treatment if they have exhausted all other treatment options."

      "content": "The cost of surgery usually ranges from $300 to $800. If your dog has cherry eye in only one eye, surgery will likely cost between $300 and $500. The surgery may go up to $800 if your dog has the condition in both eyes. This price estimate includes tests and blood samples to determine if your dog has the condition, anesthesia, surgery, and postoperative medication. The cost may also vary depending on the rate and experience of your veterinarian. [11] X Research source If you have pet insurance, the cost of surgery may be covered if it's not a pre-existing condition. If you aren't able to afford cherry eye surgery, you have options to reduce the cost. You may try working out a payment plan with your vet or applying to get help from a veterinary-bill fund."

After that, the swelling should go down and their eye should return to normal.

If your pup only had cherry eye in one of their eyes, they may go on to experience it in the other eye later on in life. [15] X Research source If you notice cherry eye reoccurring or catch signs of it in your dog's opposite eye, contact your veterinarian to make sure they get treatment. If the cherry eye comes back, you may be tempted to ignore it due to the cost of treatment. It's best to get your dog the treatment they need, though, as untreated cherry eye can lead to costly conditions like dry eye (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca)."
