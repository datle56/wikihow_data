      "content": "Make sure the GPS unit has a clear line of sight to the sky. A GPS unit gets it's signal from satellites. Therefore, it needs a clear line of sight to the sky to be able to pick up a GPS signal. Without it, it may lose the GPS signal or get intermittent signal loss. If you have a stand-alone GPS unit, make sure it is placed on the car dashboard or attached to a non-obstructive location on the windshield. Don't place it in a location where it can't see the sky."

      "content": "Make sure the area you are in isn't obstructing the GPS signal. Sometimes the reason a GPS unit is not picking up a signal or is not updating its location is because of the area you are in. If you are in an urban area, valley, or forest, the GPS signal may be obstructed. It may also just be the weather that's obstructing the signal. Some GPS units use cellular networks to report their location. It could also be that you are in an area that has poor cellular service. If this is the case, you just need to wait until you are in a better location to start receiving the signal again."

      "title": "Update the GPS unit.",
      "content": "Update the GPS unit. If a GPS unit is giving wrong directions, it's most likely because the maps are outdated. When a GPS has outdated maps, it may tell you to turn onto a road that no longer exists or not know about new roads that have been built. Plus updating the firmware can fix any bugs the unit is experiencing. To update a stand-alone GPS unit, download the update software to your computer from the manufacturer's website. Connect the GPS to your computer using a USB cable and launch the update software. For a built-in car console GPS, you can purchase a map update from the manufacturer's website or contact your dealer for assistance in updating your maps.

Some devices may allow you to adjust the audio of the voice navigation, alter tones, and the voice language. Make sure all audio features are enabled and turned up. Check your car's audio system. If your GPS navigation is built-in to your car console, check to see if you are getting sound from the radio or other audio devices. If you are not getting any audio, check to make sure your car speakers are connected to your car console and that the wires aren't worn or frayed. If your GPS is the only thing that doesn't have sound, you may need to update your GPS system. If you are still not getting any sound, contact your car dealer or a mechanic for further assistance."
