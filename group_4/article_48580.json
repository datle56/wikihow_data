      "title": "Low power steering fluid",
      "content": "Low power steering fluid Power steering fluid is responsible for keeping the hydraulic steering system pressurized. If that fluid is low, the space in the hydraulic lines will be left full of air. That air will squeal and whine when you drive, and the noise may become louder the faster you accelerate. [1] X Research source Other symptoms: Turning feels tighter than it should, you notice reddish or brown fluids underneath the vehicle, or your steering wheel shakes the faster you go. The repair: The power steering system is closed, so low power steering fluids generally indicate that you’ve got a leak somewhere. The cost: Depending on the source of the leak, you’re probably looking at $200-500 in repairs."

      "title": "Bad power steering pump",
      "content": "Bad power steering pump The power steering pump is responsible for distributing the power steering fluid in your hydraulic lines. If the pump goes bad, the power steering fluid won’t distribute correctly when you drive and you’ll end up with pockets of air in the lines. Those pockets will cause a whining noise as the fluid pressurizes and depressurizes over and over again. [2] X Research source Other symptoms: Driving randomly feels stiffer and looser, your car squeals and groans in between whining fits, your steering wheel shakes, and there’s a lag between your steering wheel inputs and the vehicle’s movements. The repair: See a mechanic to have them inspect and replace your pump. The cost: Expect to spend $500-900 on a new power steering pump."

      "title": "Bad AC compressor",
      "content": "Bad AC compressor The AC compressor is responsible for condensing the air and cooling it before it flows into your vehicle’s cabin. If the compressor is failing, it will likely make a whining noise when you try to turn the AC on as the pulley in the AC compressor assembly fails to turn smoothly. [3] X Research source Other symptoms: The noise only occurs when you turn the air conditioning on and/or your AC isn’t working correctly. The repair: Replace the AC compressor or the AC compressor clutch to get rid of that whining noise. The cost: The cost here radically shifts depending on how difficult it is for a mechanic to access the AC system in your make and model. This may cost $150-300 or $800-1,200."

      "title": "Low transmission fluid",
      "content": "Low transmission fluid The transmission is responsible for converting the engine’s combustion into rotational power for your vehicle. Inside the transmission, fluid keeps the gears lubricated and cool so that all of the individual gears and pulleys move smoothly. If you have a leak and the transmission fluid is low, your vehicle may make a whining noise—especially when the transmission shifts gears. [4] X Research source Other symptoms: Warning lights appear on your dashboard, your transmission or engine run hot, you have trouble shifting gears, or your vehicle’s gears slip as you drive. The repair: See a transmission specialist. The transmission is potentially the most complex system in your vehicle, so don’t attempt any DIY repairs here. The cost: It depends on the cause of the leak, but a minor leak may only run $100-300, while new gaskets or gears can cost up to $5,000."

      "title": "Transmission gear damage",
      "content": "Transmission gear damage If your transmission fluid levels are perfectly fine but you still have whining noises and trouble with slipping gears, it’s possible that your transmission has physical damage that’s causing the whining noise you’re hearing. [5] X Research source Other symptoms: Your transmission gears slip, you have trouble maintaining speed, you notice warning lights on your dashboard, or your engine and transmission run hot. The repair: See a transmission pro to have them inspect and repair your vehicle. The cost: Transmission repairs are potentially very expensive. It may cost up to $5,000 if you need to replace the transmission entirely."

      "title": "Alternator issues",
      "content": "Alternator issues The alternator is responsible for converting mechanical power into electrical power to keep the engine running and battery charged. If the alternator isn’t running correctly (or running at all), the pulley on the component may slip or stick and cause the whining noise you’re hearing when you drive. [6] X Research source Other symptoms: If the alternator is going bad, you should notice electrical issues. The dash lights may randomly go dim, the power could surge, your vehicle may lurch, or you may stall out when you drive. The repair: See a mechanic to have them test and replace your alternator as needed. The cost: Expect to spend $700-800 on a fresh alternator. It may be a little cheaper if it simply requires minor repairs."

      "title": "Damaged piston",
      "content": "Damaged piston This is a pretty rare source of a whining noise but if your engine is on the older side, a damaged piston may misfire and cause a squealing, whining noise known as piston slap. This is caused by a gap between a piston and the piston cylinder. As the piston moves up and down, it rubs against the wall of the cylinder and scrapes to produce that annoying sound. [7] X Research source Other symptoms: Your check engine light comes on, your engine overheats, you have trouble accelerating, you get poor gas mileage, and blue smoke comes out of the exhaust. The repair: If your engine is on the older side and your pistons are failing, it might be time to start considering a new engine. See a mechanic to get an appraisal on your options. The cost: Very minor repairs may only run $500-2,000. If you need a new engine, you may need to spend up to $10,000."

      "title": "Yes, although you could risk serious damage to your car.",
      "content": "Yes, although you could risk serious damage to your car. Most of the issues that trigger whining noises when you accelerate are not going to put you in harm’s way so long as you can safely turn and brake. If you can control the vehicle, you’ll be safe. However, many of these issues—especially transmission and alternator problems—could lead to catastrophic damage if you continue to drive. [8] X Research source Transmission issues become uniquely expensive if they’re allowed to go from minor to major. If you do not have to drive the vehicle, don’t. Play it safe and either repair the vehicle where it is or get it towed to the mechanic."

      "title": "Whining when you’re idling points to an engine oil leak or pressure issue.",
      "content": "Whining when you’re idling points to an engine oil leak or pressure issue. If you notice whining after you start the vehicle but it isn’t especially noticeable when actively driving, it’s likely an oil-related problem. At idle, poor oil pressure or low oil levels will expose the dry spots on your engine where there isn’t enough lubricant. This sound will likely go away as you accelerate and the oil flows through the system. [9] X Research source Other symptoms: Your check engine oil light comes on, you see white smoke coming from your engine bay, your engine overheats, or you see black sludge underneath the vehicle. The repair: See a mechanic to have your oil lines inspected and repaired. The cost: It depends on the extent of the damage. It may only be $50-100 for an oil change, or up to $400 for a more extensive patch job."

      "title": "Whining when you turn indicates a suspension issue.",
      "content": "Whining when you turn indicates a suspension issue. The suspension system is designed to help your vehicle turn safely and accurately by keeping the tires on the road at all times. The suspension is comprised of a sequence of joints, valves, struts, shocks, metal rods, and axles. If one of those components begins failing or slips out of its slot, it’s very likely to cause a whining noise when you turn. Other symptoms: Your car turns unevenly, the noise also appears when you stop abruptly, your vehicle handles less evenly than it used to, or your tires slide more often than normal in the rain. The repair: The solution here depends on what specific component of your suspension is damaged. See a mechanic to get the issues appraised. The cost: Expect to spend anywhere from $100-1,000 depending on what component requires attention."
