      "title": "Observe the cat looking for a nest.",
      "content": "Observe the cat looking for a nest. In the days leading up to queening, a pregnant cat will start looking for a nest, or suitable place to give birth to and care for her kittens. Many cats that are about to give birth will seek privacy, like a closet or other hiding spot. If you notice yours investigating areas like this, you can lay a blanket or towels down to make it more comfortable. [2] X Research source You can also offer your cat a nest, such as a cardboard box. Be aware that many cats will want to choose their own nest, and may even change locations."

      "title": "Look for changes in behavior.",
      "content": "Look for changes in behavior. As her due date approaches, your cat may begin to appear restless, and pace around frequently. You may also notice her changing habits. For instance, if you have a cat that is normally aloof, she may become more affectionate near her due date, or vice versa. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Notice if your cat skips a meal.",
      "content": "Notice if your cat skips a meal. Pregnant cats will typically eat more than usual. Once queening nears, however, they may have a reduced appetite or even stop eating all together."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch for your cat to wash her genital area.",
      "content": "Watch for your cat to wash her genital area. The onset of queening entails physiological changes, which your cat will start to sense. In particular, you may see her washing or licking her genital area. This may or may not be accompanied by a mucous discharge, which signals that labor is very near."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take the cat’s temperature.",
      "content": "Take the cat’s temperature. Checking a cat’s temperature beginning around the 60th day after breeding can give a relatively reliable indication that queening is near. Even if you aren’t sure of the breeding date, regularly checking your cat’s temperature once it is quite pregnant can be a useful indicator. Rectal temperature of a pregnant cat varies between 100.5 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit Within two hours before labor, rectal temperature should drop, as much as 2 degrees."

    {
      "title": "Observe your cat’s physical condition.",
      "content": "Observe your cat’s physical condition. When a pregnant cat’s queening date approaches, its nipples and mammary glands will enlarge. Your cat may also begin to lick its nipples. Other physical signs include a descended (dropped) abdomen, and an enlarged and softened vulva. All of these signs should be fairly obvious upon visual inspection. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pay attention to your cat’s breathing patterns.",
      "content": "Pay attention to your cat’s breathing patterns. If you suspect that queening is imminent, and your cat allows you to get near it, listen closely to its breathing. Its breathing rate may become more rapid, and it may even begin to start panting. Your cat may also purr rhythmically and continuously. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Feel for straining and tension in the abdomen.",
      "content": "Feel for straining and tension in the abdomen. When birthing is very close, your cat will begin to have contractions. You can tell if these are happening by gently feeling its abdomen. Tension and straining in the abdominal area likely signify that contractions are taking place. You may also be able to see your cat’s abdomen contracting and releasing. Your cat may lay on its side during this time, making an inspection easier. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Call a vet if labor is prolonged.",
      "content": "Call a vet if labor is prolonged. Most cats are able to queen all by themselves. Keep a close eye on yours if it looks like labor is about to begin, however. If signs (such as contractions) indicate that you cat is in forceful labor, but nothing happens after an hour of effort, contact a vet immediately. He or she can determine how to help your cat. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Observe your cat closely if its temperature increases.",
      "content": "Observe your cat closely if its temperature increases. Checking your cat’s temperature will not only indicate when queening is near, but also if there are potential problems. Normally, a cat’s temperature will drop near queening time. If your cat’s temperature rises, watch it closely and check it again as soon as possible. If the temperature is still higher than normal, contact a vet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for suspicious discharges.",
      "content": "Look for suspicious discharges. Some bleeding may accompany the queening process. Pregnant cats will also have discharges of mucous and amniotic fluid when birthing is near. However, if you notice excessive bleeding or a foul smelling discharge, contact a vet, as these signs may indicate a problem."

    {
      "title": "Pay attention if your cat seems in pain.",
      "content": "Pay attention if your cat seems in pain. Queening will entail some discomfort and behavioral changes, so it may be difficult to tell if your cat is all right. Most cats will queen just fine all by themselves. However, if your cat bites its genital area or cries and licks at it, consider calling a vet to rule out any potential problems.

      "title": "Watch out for warning behaviors.",
      "content": "Watch out for warning behaviors. Approaching labor will cause your cat to behave unusually. Lethargy and depression, however, are not commonly associated with labor and may indicate an issue. Contact a vet to describe the behavior and get recommendations about what to do.
