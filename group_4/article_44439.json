To do so, you need to remove the blue safety cap and place the orange tip in the middle of the outer thigh. Swing and push the pen into the thigh until it clicks. Hold it in place for 3 full seconds. Always call 911 after using an EpiPen, even if the individual is feeling better. [11] X Research source This is to be used in severe cases when symptoms are aggressive. Epinephrine is a chemical that increases the flow of oxygen to the lungs signaling the pumping of more blood, which allows the muscles to relax.

Teach friends and family how to use an EpiPen in case of emergency. If you have severe reactions to insect bites, consider wearing a MedicAlert bracelet so first responders know about your allergy."
