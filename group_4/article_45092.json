Since the US doesn't have strict data protection laws like the EU and the UK, Instagram will not let you opt out of Meta AI. According to Meta's generative AI policy, Meta can use any publicly posted information (including posts and photos) to train Meta AI. [2] X Research source There are a few workarounds to keep your information away from Meta AI: The best way to ensure your data won't be used to train Meta AI is to set your profile to private. [3] X Research source The downsides to this are that your past public data is still fair game, and if someone shares your data publicly, it can be used by Meta AI. Another workaround that may or may not work is to submit a Data Subject Rights form to Meta. To do this, go to this form and fill it out with as much information as you can or want to provide. Filling out this form may or may not help, as Facebook uses local jurisdiction to make a decision for each request, and your data isn't protected as strictly in the US."
