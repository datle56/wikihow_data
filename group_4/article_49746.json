      "content": "Write in the third person. Theatrical biographies are always written in the third person, even though you are usually the one writing it. Introduce yourself using your full name, then utilize pronouns when referring to yourself throughout. For instance, instead of writing, “I am a student at Brighton College,” write, “Jane is a student at Brighton College.” Use “he,\" “she,” or \"they\" in following sentences. [1] X Research source The following example marks third person language with an underline, \" John Smith is a graduate student in playwriting at XYZ University. He has acted in...\""

      "title": "Keep it short.",
      "content": "Keep it short. Theatre biographies are always brief. If you see opportunities to reduce excess information or simplify language, do so. Being too long-winded is common and usually requires you to edit down your bio. Get it right the first time by keeping everything concise and to the point. [2] X Research source If you’re in a lead role or expected to produce a longer bio, keep your paragraphs roughly three sentences long. Use active voice to keep content clear. For example, \"She was encouraged by her family to pursue acting\" would be stronger as \"Her family encouraged her to pursue acting.\" [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Employ professional language.",
      "content": "Employ professional language. Avoid informal prose, inside jokes, and snark. For instance, do not write, “Wow, this is gonna be a great show, LOL!!!” Instead, use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation. [4] X Research source It is acceptable to throw a joke into your bio, but keep it brief and avoid inside jokes. You don’t want to come across as unprofessional to readers or audience members. Some members of the audience may be connected to the theatrical community. A professionally written bio will give these people a favorable impression of you."

      "title": "Edit your bio.",
      "content": "Edit your bio. Once you’ve written your bio, turn it over to a trusted friend or colleague with a sharp eye for grammar, punctuation, and spelling. Double check the names of plays, theatres, organizations, and roles you’ve referenced in your bio. If this is your first time writing a bio, ask the director, producer, stage manager, or a more experienced actor to look over yours. These people will be more knowledgeable about theatrical bio writing."

      "title": "Consult the theatre company you’re writing the bio for.",
      "content": "Consult the theatre company you’re writing the bio for. All theatre companies set a word limit for bio length. To ensure you’re keeping your bio within the accepted limit, consult your director, producer, or an authoritative member of the crew before penning your bio. [5] X Research source In addition to a word limit, some theatre companies provide templates for your bio, limiting you to discussing only certain things. Some theatre companies have rules regarding what information you can and cannot include in your bio."

[6] X Expert Source Lesly Kahn, MFA Acting Teacher & Coach Expert Interview. 12 May 2020. Avoid listing every production you’ve ever been in.

      "content": "List some things you do outside of theatre. Depending on your level as an actor, you may need or want to fill your bio with some extracurricular activities. Include anything from volunteer experiences to sporting leagues you participate in. If you’re writing a bio for an amateur theatre production, you’ll probably also include information about your vocation. [10] X Research source If you’re a student, mention this by saying, “She is a student at the Acme University.” This is especially appropriate if you’re studying theatre or drama with the aim of becoming a professional actor."

If you were a chorus member or an unnamed character in a production, you can still refer to this experience in your bio, but do not name the character. Lead roles should be listed along with the production. An example of listed minor roles might look like, \"John has been involved in The Miracle Worker , Jesus, Son of Man , and Showdown at the Sugar Cane Saloon .\" A mix of minor and lead roles could be written, \"Jane has appeared in My Fair Lady , Fiddler on the Roof , and as Fantine in Les Misérables .\" [11] X Research source"

For instance, you might write a sentence about where you were born or that you’re the father of two children. Reflect upon your own life experience to determine what special details you'll add. [12] X Research source Significant life changes, like graduating with a degree in engineering before pursuing acting, can help you connect with the audience better through your bio. [13] X Research source Specialized training you received, like a workshop class in physical theatre by famed mime Marcel Marceau, can illustrate your accomplishments and the range of your skill. Your involvement with theatre related activities, like a youth theatre outreach, can show readers the kind of person you are without being heavy handed. [14] X Research source"

If you do choose to include an expression of gratitude, keep it brief and limit it to your family, your cast and crew, or both. [17] X Research source In some situations, it may be suitable to thank a mentor or teacher in your bio, especially if that person is respected theatrically. Thanking your family in your bio can sometimes give the impression that you're inexperienced. Serious actors may want to avoid doing this. [18] X Research source"
