      "content": "Fill the water tank at least halfway full. Take out the clear reservoir tank attached to your machine and fill it up with fresh, clean water. Using quality water—whether it's from the tap, distilled, or bottled—gives your coffee a great base. [1] X Research source While you only need as much water as the capsule uses to brew your coffee, having more water in the tank lessens the risk of scorching the grounds."

      "content": "Turn on your machine and wait for the power button to stop flashing. Depending on the model, your Nespresso either has a power button or 2 coffee buttons on the top or front of the machine. When you press the button, it starts to flash, indicating that your Nespresso is heating up. After 15 to 25 seconds, the button will stop flashing and turn solid. Your machine is now ready to brew. [2] X Research source On the Pixie : locate the coffee buttons on the top of the machine and towards the back. On the Essenza : find the coffee buttons on the front face of the machine. On a Vertuo : locate the power button on the very top of the machine."

      "content": "Place a proper-sized coffee cup below the coffee outlet. Different Nespresso machines have the option to make full cups of coffee, large espresso shots, or small espresso shots. If your machine has a size option, just decide on the amount of coffee you need today and set the appropriately sized mug on the platform below the spout. [3] X Research source Nespresso recommends using 1.3 oz (40 ml) cups for espresso pours, 3.7 oz (110 ml) cups for lungo, or large espresso, pours, and 7.7 oz (230 ml) mugs for regular coffee pours. For large cups and small machines, lift or detach the platform to fit your cup under the spout."

Find the appropriate mechanism and open the capsule container as wide as it goes. [4] X Research source On the Pixie : pull the circular lever up to reveal the pod slot. On the Essenz a: pull upwards on the flap at the top of the machine. On the Vertuo : unlock the top by pushing the lever to the right and pulling it up. If you’re having trouble finding where to open your machine, consult your model’s manual."

      "content": "Place your espresso pod in the machine and secure the lid. Your Nespresso machine has an open, capsule-shaped cavity to place your espresso pod inside. Depending on your machine, you might set the pod on its side, or leave it vertical with the logo facing up. Just turn your capsule in the correct direction. Once its inside, close the lid to secure the pod in place. [5] X Research source If you have a Vertuo, lock the lid after inserting the pod by turning the lever to the left. Most Nespresso machines use a sharp needle-like piercer to puncture the capsule, so remove your hand before closing the lid."

On other machines, like the Pixie, you press the small or large coffee button to start brewing a small or large espresso pour. Once you press the appropriate button, your coffee begins to flow out of the spout and into your mug. [6] X Research source If you want to top off your coffee, press the power or coffee button again once your machine’s finished pouring. If it takes a long time for your machine to brew your coffee, it might not have fully preheated before you put the pod in. Make sure to turn your machine on to preheat it before brewing."

When the top is opened, the used pod automatically ejects into the disposal compartment in your machine. Just press the top of the machine back down and you’re ready to enjoy your coffee! [7] X Research source If the pod doesn’t automatically eject, the disposal container might be full of pods. To empty it, remove the used capsule container, which is typically at the front or back of your machine."

Make a mocha with some cocoa powder, or add milk to whip up a latte or create a cappuccino .

Shop online to save time and keep your favorite flavors in your cart. Nespresso sells their own espresso pods , while other popular coffee makers like Starbucks, Peet’s Coffee, and Lavazza sell Nespresso-compatible pods.

If you prefer to descale your machine yourself, dissolving citric acid tablets in water is a great alternative.

They can be hazardous to your skin, so wear gloves when handling the solution. [12] X Research source Nespresso only recommends using their descaling product to clean your machine.
