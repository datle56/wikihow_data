      "title": "Dig trenches or holes for water.",
      "content": "Dig trenches or holes for water. You can either dig trenches to put sugar cane on both sides, or individual holes. Make sure your holes or trenches are spaced at least 2 blocks apart. The trenches can be as long as you want, or you can dig as many holes as you want. Digging individual holes instead of trenches will allow you to have four blocks for sugar cane per hole instead of two. Click and hold (or hold the right trigger button) to dig. You don't need any tools to dig, but it will be quicker if you use a shovel ."

      "title": "Harvest your sugar cane.",
      "content": "Harvest your sugar cane. You can start harvesting your sugar cane when it grows at least 2 blocks tall. You do not need any tools to harvest it. You can just use your hands. Harvest it by punching it one block above the ground. This will break the sugar cane above the first block, but leave the base still planted so it can continue to grow and produce more sugar cane. Walk over the dropped sugar cane to collect it. If you break the base of the sugar cane, you will need to plant more sugar cane."
