      "title": "Wilted leaves",
      "content": "Wilted leaves If you open up the bag of spinach in your fridge and immediately notice wet, wilted leaves— this is a dead giveaway that moisture has spoiled your spinach. Age causes the leaves to break down, resulting in this wet look. [1] X Research source Wetness invites bacteria, so it’s best for you to not consume them raw. After thoroughly inspecting the wet leaves for any visible signs of mold or discoloration, you might determine they’re still safe to eat as long as you cook them. Fortunately, cooked spinach has its own set of nutritional benefits, as it allows for better absorption of essential vitamins and minerals. Dietician and chef, Jennifer Lease, describes spinach as “versatile” and “easy to cook.” She suggests that you saute spinach in a pan with olive oil, and then add it to a pasta or grain dish by draining your carb of choice right over the spinach in a colander."

      "title": "Discoloration",
      "content": "Discoloration Fresh spinach should be a healthy, dark green color. If it starts to brown or yellow, it could indicate spoilage. In the case of discoloration, it’s very likely that either decay or pests have set in, so cooking them won’t restore them to their earlier nutritional glory. It’s best to toss the spinach in the trash at this point. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Slimy appearance and texture",
      "content": "Slimy appearance and texture Spinach is largely made up of water, so it secretes liquid when bruised, leading to a slimy film. Whether it’s leaky leaves, condensation, or too much overall moisture, a slimy spinach leaf is a sign of decomposition and isn’t safe to eat. [3] X Research source When you first purchase your bag of spinach, sort through it and pick out and wilted or slimy leaves. The surrounding leaves will still be safe to eat. Sort through the bag regularly prior to every serving. While it’s important to note that not everyone will get sick from eating slimy spinach, there is a significant risk of food poisoning, so it’s best to just toss it."

    {
      "title": "Foul smell",
      "content": "Foul smell Fresh spinach should have a slightly sweet, grassy smell. If it smells bitter, sour, or otherwise off, don’t try and salvage it. While wilted spinach with no real signs of spoilage can be cooked and eaten, slimy spinach with a rancid smell or taste is best reserved for the bin. Trust your senses and act accordingly! [4] X Research source Do a smell test, as eating any amount of rotting spinach leaves carries risk of food poisoning. Avoid eating at all costs."

      "title": "Fresh spinach has a shelf life of up to 2 weeks.",
      "content": "Fresh spinach has a shelf life of up to 2 weeks. Depending on where it's coming from and how well you store it, spinach can maintain freshness for up to 2 weeks in the fridge and up to 6 months in the freezer. However, beyond these windows of time, spinach can— and will— go bad. Wilted leaves, changes in color, and a rancid, algae-like smell will let you know that your spinach is no a viable addition to your morning green smoothie. [5] X Research source Note where your spinach is coming from. If it’s being shipped from another state, the clock has already started ticking on its shelf life. If you notice wet leaves clinging to the inside of the plastic bag, remove leaves and store the rest in an airtight container lined with paper towels."

      "title": "Remove wilted leaves from the bag.",
      "content": "Remove wilted leaves from the bag. The first step is to sort through your store-bought bag of spinach and pick out the wilted leaves, tossing them out. Remember, you can still “eat around” the wet leaves as the surrounding leaves should still be fresh and safe to eat. Getting rid of the added moisture provided by these wilting leaves will help the rest of your spinach stay fresh for longer."

      "title": "Pat dry the spinach.",
      "content": "Pat dry the spinach. After checking for moisture inside the bag or container the spinach came in, empty the bag onto a dry surface and pat down the leaves with paper towels. Blotting out the moisture can help preserve the spinach’s integrity for up to a week in the fridge. Check your batch regularly to remove wilting or extra-wet leaves. [6] X Research source While you will ultimately have to wash the spinach prior to eating it, washing it before storing it in the fridge may just increase the moisture and lead it to spoil faster. If you do insist on washing the spinach in bulk prior to storing it, make sure you pat all the leaves down to optimize freshness and crunch. Otherwise, wash the spinach right before you add it to your favorite pasta dish or salad."

      "title": "Store in an air-tight container lined with paper towels.",
      "content": "Store in an air-tight container lined with paper towels. After pat-drying the leaves, you can choose to refill the container the spinach originally came in— or find another one! A glass, airtight container is a great vessel to maximize storage potential. Line the bottom of the container with paper towels as well as the top. Seal it tight. This should keep your leafy greens from spoiling for about 7 days. [7] X Research source Personal chef Jennifer Levasseur shares that greens also love to be stored in a Ziplock bag lined with paper towels. “But do use it within a few days,” she advises."

      "title": "Freeze spinach for up to 6 months.",
      "content": "Freeze spinach for up to 6 months. Similarly to storing it in the fridge’s crisper drawer, you want to thoroughly dry the spinach before you freeze it. It’s best to do this by lining a large Ziploc bag with paper towels and storing it at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius). This storage method can help your spinach remain edible for up to 6 months, with frostbite more likely to set in after that point. Frozen spinach will be wet when you thaw it, so use it as a great way to add nutrition to smoothies, sauces, and soups. Food expert, Jason Mayer, says, “The right way to defrost [spinach] is to put it in the fridge overnight and allow it to slowly defrost.”"

If your spinach has been stored for more than 4-5 days in the fridge, and you detect a significant change in color, it’s best to throw it out.

Not only is it off-putting to eat, but it also signals that the spinach is long past its prime and may be becoming a bacterial breeding ground. If it’s mushy and slimy— not tender—don’t try to save it. Toss it! Better safe than sorry. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Sour or off taste Although it’s advised that you don’t taste visibly spoiled spinach, you might take an unsuspecting bite out of your cooked spinach container in the fridge. If you instantly smell a sour or algae-like odor, no need to confirm with another bite. If it tastes as bad as it smells, don’t panic, but do discard the leftover spinach. Your frittata will be just fine without it. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Eating bad spinach could lead to food poisoning. Nutritious and wholesome as they are, leafy greens are also surprisingly responsible for 22% of food poisoning cases, as reported by the CDC. Unwashed, raw spinach can carry norovirus and E. coli, which can lead to diarrhea, vomiting, and even death. [11] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Other symptoms of food poisoning include stomach cramps, nausea, and fever. Norovirus is one of the leading viruses related to leafy greens. Typically referred to as the “stomach flu,” norovirus has no relation to the influenza virus. [12] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source In reality, it’s an inflammation of the stomach lining which spreads by contact with an infected person or by touching a contaminated area and bringing your hand to your mouth. Washing spinach is an important step to protecting yourself, although it’s not always a guarantee. Private chef, Ollie George Cigliano, advises: “Wash at least three times in a full sink basin or bow, repeating until water is clear and silt free. No one likes gritty spinach! Dry in a salad spinner. ”"

      "title": "What causes spinach to go bad?",
      "content": "What causes spinach to go bad? Moisture and age cause spinach to go bad. Spinach is about 90% water, so as the leaves age, they tear and release moisture. Moreover, exposing the leaves to moisture also spoils them as they turn into inedible mush. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Which lasts longer, baby or mature spinach?",
      "content": "Which lasts longer, baby or mature spinach? As their name might imply, mature spinach leaves are stronger, allowing them to potentially last longer than baby leaves. Although both kinds of fresh spinach will last about a week stored in the fridge, mature leaves are less likely to be affected by moisture and tend to hold up a bit better than their younger counterparts. [14] X Research source For this same reason, you should also never cook baby spinach, as it will very likely turn to mush when stirred into a pasta sauce, soup, or anything on the stove."

      "content": "Is it okay to cook wilted spinach? Cooking wilted spinach is fine as long as it isn’t slimy. If your spinach is looking a little limp but otherwise okay, blanch it or cook it into a dish to restore its original integrity. If it’s smelly or has an awful stench, consuming it is not safe in any form. [15] X Research source"

Unless there is slime or a rancid odor, use your discretion to pick around the spoiled leaves as the fresh leaves should still be good to eat. However, if you even get a whisper of a foul smell or have any doubts, it’s best to throw the whole bag away."
