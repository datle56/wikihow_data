Run your fingers through your goat’s fur to feel for any small lumps that might be a tick, checking visually to confirm the lumps are ticks after finding them. Inspecting your goat beforehand can help keep you from missing any ticks that may be hiding in hard-to-reach areas. [1] X Research source Inspect more closely in dark, moist areas like the ears, groin, and eyelids. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source Save the ticks in a plastic bag or pill bottle so that your veterinarian can test them for diseases they may have passed to your goats.

      "content": "Use a flea comb to rid your goat of fleas and flea dirt. Comb over your goat’s entire body in the direction of the fur to remove fleas and flea dirt (small, dark clumps of flea feces). Start with the head and work your way to the tail, then work from the chest down your goat’s belly. Make sure to also comb the fur on the legs. [6] X Research source You can use the same sort of flea comb used with cats and dogs. [7] X Research source Rinse your comb in hot, soapy water every few strokes or any time you see fleas or flea dirt on it. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Identify the specific tick or flea species infesting your goat(s). Use an identification key ( http://www.tickencounter.org/tick_identification for ticks) to figure out what type of tick or flea your goat has. Different species require different insecticides, so you’ll need to know before you pursue treatment. [9] X Research source If you’re having trouble identifying the species of the tick or flea, you can always ask your veterinarian to make a house call to assist you. [10] X Research source The most common species of fleas that infest goats are the cat flea and the sticktight flea. The most common species of ticks that infest goats are the American Dog Tick, the Gulf Coast Tick, and the Lone Star Tick. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash your goat’s fur with flea shampoo and give them water to drink before applying insecticide. Spray your goat down with water and apply a veterinarian-recommended flea shampoo to its fleece to remove as many fleas as possible before applying insecticide. Then, spray your goat with water again to rinse out the shampoo. [12] X Research source Giving your goat water to drink can keep them from getting thirsty and drinking the insecticide. [13] X Research source Make sure to wear gloves to protect yourself from fleas, ticks, or irritants in the shampoo. [14] X Research source Don’t use a human shampoo. Human shampoos can irritate your goat’s skin. [15] X Research source After washing your goat’s fur, you may choose to shear your goat if it’s around the time you regularly do so to remove many (but not all) of the ticks and fleas. [16] X Research source Consult your veterinarian on the best insecticide for treatment. Once you’ve identified the specific tick or flea species infesting your goat, call your veterinarian to find out which insecticides combat those species most effectively."

      "content": "Change your goats’ bedding regularly. Fleas lay eggs on goats, which then drop down onto the ground to be hatched. The hay or other bedding material your goats use provides the perfect environment for flea larvae to grow into adult fleas and return to your goats’ fur. Change your goats’ bedding regularly to deprive fleas of a natural habitat. [19] X Research source Dry bedding favors the development of fleas, while wet bedding can attract flies. Change dry bedding every 2 weeks to prevent fleas from finishing their life cycles. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Rotate your goats’ grazing pastures. Ticks thrive in grazing pastures with tall grass, so it’s important to move your goats between different areas on a regular basis. This way, their grazing pastures won’t grow too long and ticks won’t have a hospitable environment in which to live. [21] X Research source"
