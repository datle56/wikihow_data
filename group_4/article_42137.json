      "content": "Don't focus on your punishment. There's no way to tell what your punishment will be, or if there will be a punishment at all.

Instead of focusing on the outcome of your meeting with the principal, concentrate on getting all of your facts correct and work on breathing and relaxing. [3] X Research source"

Sometimes people get so scared of getting into trouble that they may lie or make things up to get out of it. This can backfire and get you into more trouble than if you just told the truth. When you start talking to the principal, don't make things up and remain honest. [6] X Research source Lying here or there will make the principal question other things in your story. Lying can cause more stress later on because you'll have to stick to your false story and it can be hard to remember made-up details."

    {
      "title": "Tell your side of the story.",
      "content": "Tell your side of the story. Tell the principal in detail what happened and don't leave anything out. Explain why you did what you did, and what led to the situation that you're getting in trouble for. Try to include as many details as you can so that the principal gets an accurate picture of the situation. For instance, you can say, \"Joe put his foot out and tripped Mary, but she turned around and thought it was me. Mr Collins didn't see exactly what happened, so he assumed that Mary was right.\" Or you could say, \"Raul started screaming in my face, so I screamed back. He got mad because I called him out for how he treats other students and that's when he started punching me. I was just trying to get him off of me, I didn't really want to fight.\""

[9] X Research source You can say something like \"I shouldn't have pushed John back, I can admit that. I was just angry that he shoved me, and it was an automatic response. It's not how I usually am, but I was wrong.\" Or something like, \"Honestly, I did skip school that day. I don't really have a good explanation, but now I know it's wrong and I take full responsibility for what I did. I just hope that it doesn't lessen all of the good stuff I've done over the school year.\""

      "title": "Think before you act.",
      "content": "Think before you act. Always think about the potential repercussions of your actions before you do them. More than thinking about the punishment you may get for your actions, think about how they will affect other people's lives. Be compassionate for other people, and always think about how your actions will affect you and others. For instance, if you feel like trashing the lunchroom or leaving packets of ketchup on the floor, think about the person who has to clean it up and how it makes their day harder. If you bully other people and make them feel bad about themselves, try to think about how it would make you feel if someone targeted you in the same way."

If you have friends who are always getting into trouble and getting you in trouble, you need to stand up against them. Either let them know that you're tired of risking it and getting in trouble, or tell them that you can't hang out with them anymore. Doing this should cut down on how often you're getting into trouble. [11] X Research source"
