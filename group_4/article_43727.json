      "content": "Use a gentle nail file when you shape your nails. Feel both sides of your nail file and use the finer, gentler side when you rub it against your nails.

      "content": "Don't file down the ridges of your nail plate. Your nail is made up of 30 microscopic layers, but filing down the top of your nail can remove 10% of the nail.

      "content": "Use non-acetone nail polish remover to take polish off. When you're taking off your nail polish, dip a cotton ball or cotton bad in a non-acetone nail polish remover and wipe it over your nail.

      "title": "Oil your nails to protect them from moisture damage.",
      "content": "Oil your nails to protect them from moisture damage. If you frequently get your nails wet or wash your hands a lot, spread cuticle or nail oil over your nails.

      "content": "Eat healthy fats, protein, and calcium every day to strengthen your nails. Your nails might be thin or weak if you're not getting a balanced diet.

      "content": "Give yourself time. Unfortunately, nails take about 6 months to fully grow out, so it will take several weeks or months before you notice any thickening of your nails.
