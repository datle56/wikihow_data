      "title": "Put your clay mask into a BPA-free plastic container.",
      "content": "Put your clay mask into a BPA-free plastic container. Look for the label “BPA-free” on any plastic container you choose. If the container you use has any harmful chemicals, they could mix in with your clay mask and affect its ingredients. [1] X Research source You can find plastic containers at most home goods stores. You can also use a glass container if that’s easier to find."

      "title": "Avoid using a metal container to store your clay mask.",
      "content": "Avoid using a metal container to store your clay mask. Metal and clay don’t mix well together because clay contains properties that may ionize metal. This could change the substance of your clay mask or even harm the metal container that it’s in! Keep your clay mask in a plastic or glass jar when you store it. [2] X Research source Putting clay in a metal container could make it rust."

    {
      "title": "Seal your container so that it’s airtight.",
      "content": "Seal your container so that it’s airtight. Make sure the lid you choose fits your container snugly so that air can’t get in. If your lid isn’t tight enough, add a layer of plastic wrap underneath it to seal your mask in. If you are using a plastic lid, make sure it is also BPA-free."

    {
      "title": "Place your container in a cool, dry place.",
      "content": "Place your container in a cool, dry place. Pick an area, like your kitchen cabinet or pantry, to keep your clay mask. Make sure it’s out of the direct sunlight, and try to make sure it stays at room temperature. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If your clay mask gets too cold, it could harden. This doesn’t mean that it’s ruined, but it will be super hard to get out of the container."

    {
      "title": "Use your clay mask within 3 to 6 months.",
      "content": "Use your clay mask within 3 to 6 months. As long as you keep your clay mask in an airtight container when you aren’t using it, it should stay fresh for a while. Throw your clay mask out after 6 months if you haven’t used it, since it probably won’t be effective anymore. If you are storing a powdered clay mask, you can keep it around for up to 1 year as long as you don’t get it wet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Throw your clay away if it smells sour.",
      "content": "Throw your clay away if it smells sour. Open up your container and hold the clay mask under your nose. If your clay mask smells musty or sour, it has probably gone bad and you should throw it away. Clay can go bad if it gets too wet or you keep it around for too long."

    {
      "title": "Use a utensil to scrape out the clay, not your hands.",
      "content": "Use a utensil to scrape out the clay, not your hands. Your hands can introduce germs into the clay mask that will stick around for a long time. Instead, use a metal or plastic spoon to scrape the clay out of your container. Try not to “double dip” your utensil when you use it. Instead, use a new utensil each time you take a scoop out of your mask."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the sides of the clay into the center to keep it from drying out.",
      "content": "Mix the sides of the clay into the center to keep it from drying out. As you keep using your clay mask, you may notice that the center dries out quicker than the sides. Use your utensil to push the sides of the mask down into the center and stir it up slightly to mix them together. This will help all the ingredients reincorporate and keep your mask from separating."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of water if your clay mask dries out.",
      "content": "Add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of water if your clay mask dries out. If your mask got a little too warm or you haven’t used it in a while, it could get dry and crumbly. Add a little bit of room-temperature water and mix it into your mask until it’s thick enough to apply to your face. Depending on how dry your mask is, you may need to add more water. Keep adding it in 1 tsp (4.9 mL) increments until your mask is thick enough."
