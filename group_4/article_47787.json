For friends or partners, start a one-on-one conversation somewhere private about what you’ve noticed and how you feel about it. [11] X Research source For the workplace: “I’d love to walk you through some of the ideas I had for the Park Blvd. project, and then after I go through what I’ve outlined, I’d appreciate your input.” For a friend or partner: “I’ve noticed you interrupt me sometimes when I’m talking. I love your enthusiasm, but it makes me feel frustrated when I can’t finish what I’m saying.” For a less confrontational approach, you can address a group to create new expectations: “Let’s work to be more mindful when we’re speaking and make sure we give everyone a chance to get their ideas out.”"
