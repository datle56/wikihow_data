Your doctor can show you the best way to tape up your foot, and they'll even do it for you the first time. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source To tape a bunion, cut 2 strips of medical tape that are about 1 in (2.5 cm) wide and 6 in (15 cm) long. Cut one more strip that's the same length but double the width. Wrap 1 narrow strip around the bottom of the big toe, starting between the big toe and the next toe. Pull it around the front of the foot, wrapping it towards the top middle of your foot. Do the same with the other narrow strip, except attach it slightly on the outer edge of the first strip. Wrap the large strip over the area where the bunion is, moving from under the foot to the top of the foot. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Stay at a healthy weight to take pressure off the area. While losing weight won't stop a bunion once it's begun, it may help prevent one, as well as relieve some of the pressure. Extra weight puts more pressure on your toes, which in turn can increase your chances of developing a bunion. Shedding any extra pounds can ease the pressure so talk to your doctor about what a healthy weight means for you.

Aim to fill your plate with veggies, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins for a healthy diet . Try to exercise 30 minutes a day most days of the week. Try walking, running, swimming, yoga, or anything that gets you moving! Talk to your doctor about exercises that won't exacerbate your bunions."

While shoes with narrow toes don't cause bunions, as that's generally do to genetics, they can trigger one to start growing if you're predisposed to them. Instead of opting for shoes with angled toes at the front, choose ones with rounded toes that have more room.
