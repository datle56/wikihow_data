      "content": "“Who asked” is an impolite response, similar to “Shut up.” While not as openly harsh as “shut up,” “Who asked?” is a rude way to tell someone you don’t care about what they have to say. Depending on the context, “Who asked?” can also mean “Mind your own business,” or “I didn’t want your opinion.” “I’ve been having such a good time reading this new book, I feel like it’s a lot better than the first one in the series, and I’m excited to see where it goes!” “Weird, I was looking around to see who asked, but I couldn’t find anyone.” “I really think you need to start drinking less coffee.” “I’m sorry, who asked?” “Why are you going on a date with that guy, you have a boyfriend.” “Um, who asked?”"

      "content": "Sincere responses When someone puts you down, divert the energy of the insult by ignoring the person, questioning their comment, or sincerely telling them how you feel about it. [1] X Research source If someone was genuinely trying to hurt your feelings, tell them what’s up with one of these responses: Maybe no one, but it’s worth saying. Did I ask you to interrupt me? The point I’m raising is mine, not yours. If you have an issue, no one asked you to be here. Does it matter? I’m allowed to voice my opinions. So if you didn’t ask about something, is it not important? What do you mean by that? I’m just having a conversation."

      "content": "Comebacks If you know the person well and want to keep the conversation moving, you can use a quick comeback, but, generally, it’s better to assert your right to speak without escalating the situation. [2] X Research source If the situation is playful, you can be a little more snarky, but if someone’s being a bully, stand up to them without insulting them. Does it matter? I’m still right. Consider it a freebie. No one asked you to listen. I’m just trying to keep the conversation interesting. No one, but you’re welcome. No one asked, but maybe you’d learn something if you’d listen. Funny, I didn’t realize I needed your permission to speak. Who made you the arbiter of what can and cannot be said? That’s weird, I thought we were having a conversation. Well you answered. No one, I was just feeling generous. No one, I just couldn’t resist correcting you. No one, but it was painful watching you struggle. No one, but I couldn’t let you go on like that."

When you engage with someone who is putting you down, however, you can run the risk of hurting their feelings, as well. [3] X Research source Your curiosity is flattering Clearly not you, but here we are. Common sense did. You’re right, no one did. But you seem interested, anyway. Just thought you needed some guidance. It was a public service. My sense of duty to society. My responsibility to the truth. No one, but someone had to. I’m just here to improve the conversation. No one, but clearly someone needed to. No one, but I did hear a cry for help."

      "title": "People say “Who asked you?” when they don’t want an outside opinion.",
      "content": "People say “Who asked you?” when they don’t want an outside opinion. Saying “Who asked you?” unlike “Who asked?” shows that another person’s opinion on something that affects your life isn’t welcome. It’s still a rude comment, but it is more situationally dependent than “Who asked?” “I don’t think you can afford a new pet right now.” “Who asked you?” “You should turn left here if you want to be on time.” “I’m sorry, who asked you?” “Break up with him!” “Who asked you!?”"
