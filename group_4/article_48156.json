    {
      "title": "If you like him, it’s good if he simply thinks you’re unavailable for a bit.",
      "content": "If you like him, it’s good if he simply thinks you’re unavailable for a bit. It shows that he knows you’ve got your own, fulfilling life to live and that he’s not insecure or desperate. This is most guys’ first assumption—he’ll probably keep thinking this for a few hours or for a day. [1] X Research source If you’ve had good communication up until now, he’s probably thinking you’ll get back to him when you have the time. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Guys try not to overthink things, which may make him feel better.",
      "content": "Guys try not to overthink things, which may make him feel better. After a few hours, he’s probably telling himself things like “She’ll reply eventually” or “It’s not a big deal.” For some guys, it’s really not a huge deal. Others might start to get anxious or upset as time goes by. [3] X Research source If you two don’t have a strong connection and he really doesn’t care about getting an answer, he might move on and start texting someone else."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ignoring or responding slowly to texts is a classic “hard to get” move.",
      "content": "Ignoring or responding slowly to texts is a classic “hard to get” move. He might think you’re trying to get him to chase you , or that you want him to think you’re aloof. If you left him hanging mid-conversation, he’ll suspect you planned to leave him wanting more. [4] X Research source These days, we all know everyone has their phone on them 24/7. If you play “hard to get” too long, you might end up looking more rude than aloof."
    },
    {
      "title": "He might assume he did or said something wrong, even if he didn't.",
      "content": "He might assume he did or said something wrong, even if he didn't. Whether it’s true or not, he’ll probably text you or make a gesture to show he’s still interested and available. The longer you hold out, the more anxious and ready to prove himself he’ll be. [5] X Research source A lot of humor and emotion gets lost over text. If you’ve never met in person, he may think you misunderstood him (it’s easy to do until you actually meet). Right now, he’s probably rereading his messages trying to figure out what he said to put you off. If you’re not really upset with him and still want to see him, you may have an awkward time explaining why you weren’t answering his texts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Everyone struggles with sending a “double text” now and then.",
      "content": "Everyone struggles with sending a “double text” now and then. On one hand, he might be eager to text you again and restart the conversation. On the other, he wants to avoid seeming desperate or needy. If he texts you again and you still don’t answer, he may resolve himself to wait you out or just give up. [6] X Research source Some guys can go for a long time without texting again to protect their ego. He may try again in the future if he’s interested, but he’ll wait a long time."
    },
    {
      "title": "If he thought things were great, he might have no clue what’s going on.",
      "content": "If he thought things were great, he might have no clue what’s going on. It’s hard to feel like someone you like is slipping away, and he might start to develop hard feelings. If this happens, he’ll either express his frustration to you or just walk away. [7] X Research source A lot of guys like to chase someone to some degree, but this excitement doesn’t last forever."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’ll make himself feel better by blaming technology or his cell service.",
      "content": "He’ll make himself feel better by blaming technology or his cell service. It might sound a little funny and delusional, but to him, it’s better than feeling like he’s the reason for the radio silence. He’s probably thinking things like “Maybe her phone is broken” or “My message must not have gone through!” [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "He’ll get insecure about his texting game if he’s had this issue before.",
      "content": "He’ll get insecure about his texting game if he’s had this issue before. He’ll do his best to initiate more interesting or exciting conversations—hello, jokes and memes!—to reel you back in. On a bigger scale, he'll think he has to be a more interesting or creative person to make you happy. [9] X Research source If he’s extra insecure, he’ll spend a lot of time analyzing previous texts to see where you started losing interest or getting bored."
    },
    {
      "title": "He'll find things one-sided if he always has to start the chat.",
      "content": "He'll find things one-sided if he always has to start the chat. It seems like part of the chase at first, but always being the one to make plans or having to try repeatedly to get a text back gets old after a while. He may lose interest unless he really likes you. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "In the age of dating apps, it’s reasonable to think he’s got competition.",
      "content": "In the age of dating apps, it’s reasonable to think he’s got competition. He might jump to this conclusion if you’ve been communicating regularly and then you stop responding all of a sudden. He’ll assume there must be another guy involved out of anxiety. [11] X Research source Sometimes, this is a protective thought. It’s easier for him to think the problem is you, some other guy, or dating apps and texting in general rather than himself."

    {
      "title": "It’s natural to assume you've been ghosted when the texts stop coming.",
      "content": "It’s natural to assume you've been ghosted when the texts stop coming. He’ll probably take the hint and move on if you continue to leave him on read or barely respond. If you’ve only been on one date or haven’t even met in person yet, chances are he won’t take it too personally. When someone’s texting slows down dramatically, it’s a pretty universal sign for men and women that they’re losing interest or working their way to ghosting. On the flip side, ghosting him might inspire him to try and endear himself to you even more. It all depends on the guy and your previous connection."
