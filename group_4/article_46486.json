For example, if you’re a heavy smoker and looking to replace cigarettes with ZYN, you might opt for a higher nicotine concentration. Occasional tobacco users might opt for a lower nicotine concentration. Flavor options: cool mint, peppermint, wintergreen, spearmint, cinnamon, coffee, citrus, and menthol—plus two “unflavored” varieties: smooth and chill.

      "content": "There’s no evidence that nicotine pouches are safer than tobacco. It’s true that ZYN pouches don’t contain many of the chemicals found in tobacco. They also don’t produce second-hand smoke or ash, which means they don’t affect other people around you in the same way. But scientists aren’t sold on nicotine pouches as a safe alternative to tobacco use. More research needs to be done before we can know for sure.
