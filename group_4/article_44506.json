Place the washcloth over your closed eyes for around 5-10 minutes. Use the washcloth to gently rub your eyelids before removing it.

      "content": "Cleanse your eyelids with warm water and a cotton swab. Soak the end of a cotton swab in warm water. Wipe gently around the edges of your eye. To cleanse the area closest to your eyelashes, you can softly pull the eyelid away from the eye and use your other hand to wipe the eyelid. This will help prevent damage to the eye. [2] X Research source For a stronger cleanser, use a few drops of baby shampoo in warm water. Clean your eyelids using this solution first, and then repeat the process using a fresh cotton swab and warm water to rinse. A doctor may also prescribe an over-the-counter eyelid cleanser."

      "title": "Use a moisturizer specifically for the skin around your eyes.",
      "content": "Use a moisturizer specifically for the skin around your eyes. Because the skin on your eyelids is thinner and more sensitive than the skin anywhere else on your body, using your normal lotion or moisturizer can be dangerous. Use a gel or cream made specifically for use around the eyes to relieve dry skin. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Because the skin of your eyelid is so sensitive, it can react to moisturizers that you don't normally have a problem with.

      "title": "Stop wearing makeup for a few days.",
      "content": "Stop wearing makeup for a few days. Mascara and eye makeup, in particular, can irritate the eyelids. Avoid using any products that are expired or old since they can cause more irritation. Makeup can contain bacteria or can cause an allergic reaction, both of which could cause dry, itchy eyelids. [9] X Research source Wearing makeup can also make it harder to clean your eyes. If your doctor has recommended a cleaning regimen for the treatment of blepharitis or other conditions, it's best to wear a bare face until your eyelids are back to normal. If your dry eyelids are caused by bacteria, you may need to stop using makeup products or eyeliner completely."
