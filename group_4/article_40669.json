      "content": "Consider beginning with a small-scale, residential demolition company. Depending on your experience and investment capital, a smaller, manual demolition company may be best. Starting with a smaller company enables you to gain the experience and expertise that is necessary to ensure the growth and development of your demolition business. [1] X Research source Research what types of demolition companies already exist in your area. This will give you an idea of the potential for your company's success, especially if you plan on beginning with a small-scale, manual demolition company that subcontracts demolition jobs from construction companies. Manual demolition can involve removing concrete, wiring, plumbing, wood, metal, or other materials associated with residential structures. Mechanical demolition companies, in contrast, demolish larger buildings and structures, requiring more equipment and a much larger initial investment. A newer area of specialization is deconstruction or \"green demolition,\" a slower but environmentally friendly method that permits recycling many of the original construction materials. The structure is carefully dismantled rather than demolished, limiting the amount of debris and waste that ends up in landfills."

      "title": "Get the right amount and type of insurance.",
      "content": "Get the right amount and type of insurance. You will need general liability insurance and workers' compensation insurance when starting out. You may also need to get demolition insurance once you begin accepting jobs since some clients may require proof of demolition insurance before you may submit a bid. [4] X Research source Many insurance companies offer the different types of insurance necessary to cover the various needs of a demolition business. Making inquiries to different companies enables you to find the best rates and the insurance that best fits your company's needs. The size and type of your demolition company will determine how much insurance you are required to have. A smaller scale, manual company will require less, while a larger mechanical demolition company will need additional accident insurance (for employees and any damage to the site) as well as insurance for certain equipment, such as cranes or bulldozers."

      "content": "Appoint a safety director, at least for each specific job. Since demolition can be risky or even dangerous, a safety director who can regulate your company's safety standards is necessary. If your company is smaller and unable to have a full-time safety director, you should have an employee include these duties in addition to their other responsibilities to ensure that the necessary preparation and precautions are taken and your safety guidelines are followed during the job.
