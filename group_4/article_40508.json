      "title": "Select one bamboo or wooden stake.",
      "content": "Select one bamboo or wooden stake. A single stake method works best with a bare root tree, or a tree that was dug out of the ground when leafless and that had all of its soil shaken from its roots. Select a bamboo or wooden stake for small and medium sized trees or if you’ve got a larger tree on your hands, use a metal stake. Select an angled stake if you’re concerned about letting your tree have room to flex and build up its own strength. Select a tall, straight stake if your tree is top heavy. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Insert the stake on the windward side of the tree.",
      "content": "Insert the stake on the windward side of the tree. Dig a hole 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) deep about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the base of the primary branch on the windward side of the tree, or the side with the prevailing wind. If planted on this side, your tree will pull away from the stake instead of rubbing against it. If you’re doing preventive staking, place your stake in the ground before you plant your tree. This will prevent damage to the roots of your tree if you accidentally hammer your stake into them. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Locate the primary branch.",
      "content": "Locate the primary branch. Once your tree has been planted, look for the primary branch that supports the most growth. This is typically near the center, but if you have a tree that has split down the center, there may be 2 primary branches."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie the primary branch to the stake ⅔ of the way up the stem.",
      "content": "Tie the primary branch to the stake ⅔ of the way up the stem. Using a material with a flat, broad surface, such as elastic or a wire inside of a rubber hose, tie the branch to several locations on the stake for firm support. You should use a figure eight loop to tie the branch to the stake in order to prevent the stake rubbing up against the stem. Take care not to use a tie that is a bare cord or wire as these will cut into the tree and damage it."

      "title": "Remove the stakes after one growing season.",
      "content": "Remove the stakes after one growing season. After one growing season your tree’s root system should’ve spread out enough to fully support the tree without additional help from stakes. Remove the stakes and save them to reuse on another tree or bush. You could always leave the stakes in place after removing the ties. Then you’ll have a barrier to protect the tree from lawn mowers.

      "title": "Gather two or three wooden stakes and broad, smooth ties.",
      "content": "Gather two or three wooden stakes and broad, smooth ties. The double/triple stake method is useful for trees with balled or burlapped roots to prevent it from rocking back and forth in the wind. You’ll need 2-3 stakes of the same size. They should be roughly ⅓ of the height of the trunk. Acquire 2-3 ties that are broad and smooth for attaching the tree to the stake. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Drive the stakes on sides equidistant from the tree.",
      "content": "Drive the stakes on sides equidistant from the tree. Place your stakes at an angle about 15–18 inches (38.1–45.7 cm) from the trunk on opposite sides. Make sure that the stakes are buried deep enough in the ground that they do not give when pushed against. This will help to keep the tree stable in poor weather and storms."

    {
      "title": "Attach the ties ⅓ of the way up the stem.",
      "content": "Attach the ties ⅓ of the way up the stem. Attach each tie about ⅓ of the way up the stem so the tree will have some flexibility to give in response to the wind. You want the tie to be firm, but with some give to it."

      "content": "Select stout stakes and strong wire. Guying a tree is the best method for large trees in areas with heavy winds. [5] X Research source Guying anchors are shorter and stronger, and so you’ll need 3-4 stouter wooden stakes. You’ll need to gather wire and padding for the wire around the tree as well. Since you’ll be using shorter stakes, make sure you mark them with bright paint so no one will trip! [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Tie the wires on the canopy stem.",
      "content": "Tie the wires on the canopy stem. Attach the wire tautly, but not restricting all movement, from the tree to the stake. You’ll tie the wire around the stem above the first set of branches, also called the canopy stem. Be sure to use padding, such as a rubber hose, to protect the tree stem."
