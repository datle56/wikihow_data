      "content": "The two block haircut looks like a mushroom cut with shaved sides. Invented and popularized in South Korea, the two block haircut is a cross between the mushroom cut and the undercut. The name “two block” refers to how the hair is cut into 2 distinct sections: the sides and back are trimmed short, while the hair on top is left long. This contrast in length is effortlessly cool and versatile, since the longer hair can be styled in a variety of ways. [1] X Research source There are countless variations of the two block haircut, but the shorter block of hair is usually a fade or a classic taper . The longer block can be parted, side-swept, or worn anyway you like, but most guys rock it wavy, messy, and textured. Over the past few years, the two block cut has taken over TikTok and become a popular style worldwide. [2] X Research source Celebs like Park Bo-gum, Lee Min-ho, Gong Yoo, Jimin, and Jungkook from BTS, Baekhyun from EXO, Mingyu from SEVENTEEN, and Yeonjun from TXT have sported the look."

For the two block cut, ask your barber for a side shave with a #2 or #3 guard on the clippers, depending on how short you want to go. Request “ice pick” or pointed sideburns, and have them lightly taper or fade the back . For the top, ask them to keep the hair the same length as your eyebrows, while adding layers and texture to soften up the crown (so it doesn’t look like a bowl cut). [3] X Research source Tell your barber to use thinning shears on the top to take off any weight and make it look extra fluffy and bouncy. [4] X Research source If you want the shorter block to look more connected to the longer block, request a #4 guard on the clippers instead. Show your barber reference photos of Korean two block cuts that have the type of layering, bangs, and styling you like. The key to a flattering haircut is to be clear about what you want!"
