You can also rub lotion on your hands and then rub your body underneath the static parts of your dress. Once again, make sure you don’t rub too much. Unscented lotion is probably the best bet too, as you don’t want to smell really strongly of moisturizing lotion. [6] X Research source"

If the static can’t build on you then it won’t stay on the dress either. This option because more difficult if the dress has static all over it, but if the static is localized you should give this option a shot. You can also use some talcum baby powder but this is much messier than moisturizer and has a very recognizable smell. If you choose to follow this option just get some on your hands and rub it gently on your skin wherever the static sticks your dress. Use very little."

All you have to do is buy a humidifier at your local hardware store and set it up in your house. Static is especially common in the winter when the air is very dry. The static will die down over time with a humidifier. If you don’t want to buy a humidifier, you can also just hang your dress up in your bathroom after you take a shower. The humidity will be higher in there and it will take care of the static."

      "content": "Hand or machine-wash the dress on the gentlest cycle available. But first check the label to see if the dress can be washed. Look for a label in the dress that has washing instructions. It should tell you if you are allowed to machine wash and dry the dress or if it will ruin the fabric. Definitely check this before putting your dress in the wash. If you do decide to put it in the wash, adding baking soda to the washing machine can help reduce static cling. If you are machine drying the dress, put a dryer sheet in with the dress, then take the dress out of the dryer while it's still slightly damp."

      "content": "Hang dry your dress on a hanger in a doorway. Have the hook hanging on the door frame. If you hang-dry your clothes anyway, like on a clothesline, make sure that it is on a hanger for the last 10 minutes of drying rather than hanging directly on the clothesline. This will prevent it from getting wrinkled and will prevent static build up."

      "content": "Walk around barefoot. This sounds silly, but it will really reduce the static that you collect on your body.

You can also put aluminum foil around the bottoms of your shoes to prevent static build up, but walking around barefoot is probably easier.
