The amount of time you need to wait depends on the product you’re using, but it ranges anywhere from 5 minutes to 6 hours. [4] X Research source Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to apply the remover and wait the prescribed amount of time before peeling the caulk up. [5] X Research source For sprays, you typically just spritz the entire length of caulk. Gels and pastes are usually applied directly on top of the caulk. When the caulk is soft, you can just peel the caulk up by hand most of the time. If necessary, you can pry it up with pliers or a putty knife ."

      "content": "Grab a hair dryer or heat gun to soften the caulk. Caulk will become super soft if it gets warm enough, so grab a hair dryer or heat gun. [6] X Expert Source Eric Shipe Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. This is generally going to be an efficient way to go, and it should work with either silicone or latex caulk. [7] X Research source You may not want to go this route if the caulk is on any kind of malleable plastic, which may melt. Heat may also discolor painted surfaces. This should be totally safe with masonry, tile, or wood, though. It doesn’t take a lot of heat for this to work. If the caulk is in an area that’s exposed to the sun, removing the caulk near the end of a warm, sunny day should help this process along (or prevent the need for it entirely)."

      "content": "Turn the heat on to the lowest available setting. The biggest risks here are damaging the surface underneath the caulk with excess heat, or melting the caulk to the point that it becomes goopy and more difficult to remove. As a result, start off with the lowest heat setting on your hair dryer or heat gun. It doesn’t take a ton of heat to soften up the caulk. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Move the dryer or heat gun back and forth along the caulk to soften it up.",
      "content": "Move the dryer or heat gun back and forth along the caulk to soften it up. Hold your heat source 6–12 inches (15–30 cm) away from the caulk. Move the heat source continuously along the length of caulk you want to soften to avoid letting the heat build up in any single location. After a minute or so, try removing the caulk. [9] X Research source The amount of time that it will take for the caulk to soften up is going to vary depending on the type and age of the caulk. It shouldn’t take a ton of time for the caulk to soften up, though. Once it’s soft, you should be able to peel the caulk up by hand. You can use a putty knife or pliers if you need some extra leverage."

      "content": "Grab mineral spirits if the caulk is on concrete, marble, or ceramic. Mineral spirits should help to soften the caulk, but this stuff isn’t safe on any painted or porous surfaces. [10] X Expert Source Eric Shipe Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. You can either soak a rag with the spirits and lay that on top of the caulk for a bit, or scrub the caulk directly with a spirit-soaked scouring pad or sponge to wear it down. [11] X Research source Mineral spirits will cause the caulk to swell a bit, which will weaken its adhesion. Wear gloves and keep a window open while you work with mineral spirits. It’s not super dangerous stuff, but it can irritate your skin and it smells pretty strong."

      "content": "Use alcohol if the surface is painted or plastic. Rubbing or isopropyl alcohol will soften caulk, and it’s safe to use on a painted or plastic surfaces. Dampen a clean rag with your alcohol and leave it on top of the caulk you want to soften up. Wait few minutes and the caulk should be much easier to work with. [12] X Research source The alcohol will cause the caulk to expand, which will make it much easier to tear up. This may only work for water-based latex caulk. According to some folks, 100% pure silicone caulk will not soften up with alcohol. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Try white vinegar if you don’t have mineral spirits or alcohol. It’s not the most popular option, but white vinegar might help soften old caulk . It also shouldn’t do any harm to the surface you’re working on. Soak a rag and leave it on the caulk, or fill a spray bottle and spritz the area to soften the caulk up. [14] X Research source Vinegar and silicone caulk both contain acetic acid. Pouring vinegar on the caulk should increase the acetic acid levels and make it malleable again. You should be able to use lacquer thinner as well, but that may damage the surface underneath the caulk. Once the caulk is soft, you can usually pull it off by hand. You can use a putty knife or pliers if you need some help getting it up."
