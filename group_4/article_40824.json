      "content": "Bright lights help keep you alert when you're tired. It's hard to fall asleep in a well-lit area. Besides that, a bright atmosphere can trick your brain into thinking it's daytime—at least for a little while. If you don't have control over the lights, try to sit close to a strong light source.

      "content": "You'll be more alert in a cooler setting. If you have access to the thermostat, crank up the A/C! When it's cool, your blood starts flowing to maintain your body temperature, which also wakes you up a little. If it's cool outside, you might also try opening a window, which will also let some fresh air in. [2] X Research source"

If you're able to play music (either aloud or through headphones), something vibrant and energetic can give you a nice little boost. Just make sure it's not too distracting if you're studying or have work to do. [3] X Research source Electronic dance music is a great option if you're looking for something without a lot of lyrics to keep you awake and focused."

      "content": "Moving your facial muscles promotes blood flow to your head. Chewing gum is an easy way to reduce sleepiness in a pretty significant way, although scientists aren't exactly sure why. The speculation is that using your mouth increases blood flow to your head, which stimulates your brain and causes you to be more alert. It's also true that mint flavors have a stimulating effect on your sense of taste and smell.

      "content": "The shock of the cold gives you a quick but strong energy boost. You'll get the blood flowing straight to your face and head, which can really clear your mind and make you feel refreshed. While the boost won't last long, it might be just enough to get you over a little hump. [7] X Research source If you're at home, jumping into a cold shower for a few minutes will have the same effect, although it might last a little longer."

Tiredness can really set in if you're sitting in the same position for too long, especially if you're staring at a book or a screen. It's not important what you do specifically, just walk around a little or shake out your arms and legs. [8] X Research source For example, if you're sitting at a desk, you might stand up and do a few jumping jacks to get the blood flowing."

Even if you're at work or school and your options are limited, there are still ways to sneak in a few minutes of exercise to get your blood pumping. Something as simple as using the stairs instead of taking the elevator can help keep you more alert. If you're able to go for a walk outside, even if it's just across the street to get coffee, the fresh air will also help you. Even better if there's a park nearby—studies show that spending even a few moments in nature can make you feel more energized. [9] X Research source A 10-minute walk can increase your energy for up to 2 hours (compared to eating a candy bar, which tends to boost energy for less than an hour, followed by a crash).

      "content": "Improve circulation and mental alertness with stretches. When you sit in the same position for too long, your brain can start to get a little sluggish as well. Perk yourself up by stretching your arms over your head, stretching your legs, or touching your toes. Even just waving your arms around can be beneficial if you're looking to stay awake. [11] X Research source Gently massaging certain pressure points, such as the back of your neck or the skin between your thumb and index finger, can also improve your alertness."

If you know you've got a long day ahead of you and you're likely to be tired later, make sure you get the day started right with a nutritious breakfast that includes eggs, lean protein, leafy green vegetables, and some whole grain toast or oatmeal. Round it off with a piece of fruit or a smoothie. [12] X Research source If eating vegetables for breakfast feels a little weird to you, try mixing them up in an egg scramble or blending them into a smoothie. Eitches recommends \"a balance of fats, proteins, high fiber, and carbohydrates,\" noting that \"whole foods, plant-based foods are going to be the best, the most efficient\" to increase your energy.

      "content": "Snacks such as almonds or cashews help keep you awake. Fruits are good choices as well, since they have natural sugars that can keep you up (at least in the short term). Peanut butter and celery or yogurt can also help you stay awake when you're feeling tired. [14] X Research source Sugary snacks might give you a quick energy boost, but that boost doesn't last long and is typically followed by a crash where you end up feeling even more tired than you did before. Try eating small meals every couple of hours for more sustained energy. At least eat something, even if you're so tired that the thought of food doesn't appeal to you one bit—not eating will make you much more fatigued in the long run."

      "content": "Use small doses of caffeine to stay awake without the jitters. Slamming down a triple mocha might give you a quick burst of energy for a moment, but you're also likely to crash later. This is because caffeine works by blocking your brain's adenosine receptors. Adenosine is a neurochemical that causes you to feel sleepy. [15] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If you flood your system with caffeine, that means you're blocking a lot of those receptors at once. When the effect of the caffeine wears off, your system will be flooded with adenosine, causing you to crash. Drinking slowly and taking small sips blocks fewer adenosine receptors at a time and allows the effects of the caffeine to taper off gradually."

Practice active listening to stay engaged if you're listening to someone else talk or watching a video. [17] X Research source For example, you might take notes or even doodle in the margins of a piece of paper to keep your mind alert if it's not appropriate for you to speak. If you're studying late or pulling an all-nighter, find a friend to study with you. Chatting with them occasionally can help you stay alert—plus, the two of you can keep each other accountable.

If everything you have to do is rather monotonous, at least switch topics or assignments from time to time to get your brain thinking in a different way. The variety also helps keep your brain active and interested. [19] X Research source For example, if you were reading, you might switch to working on a spreadsheet or drafting emails."
