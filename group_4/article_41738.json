      "content": "Microwave canvas shoes for a quick way to stretch them. Put your shoes in the microwave on high for no longer than 30 seconds. The heat from the microwave will make the fabric more malleable to your feet. [1] X Research source Make sure there are no metal pieces in the shoes before putting them in the microwave. Make sure the eyelets in your shoes aren’t metal, too. [2] X Research source Take the shoes out of the microwave and put them on right away while the material is still warm. Walk around with them on for a minute. [3] X Research source After a minute, they’ll start to cool down, so take them off and put them in the microwave again for 20 seconds. After 20 seconds, wear your shoes again, and they should be widened enough. [4] X Research source"

Fill two small zip-lock bags with water and seal them tightly. Place the bags in the shoes all the way to the toe area, and put them in the freezer overnight. [10] X Research source Take the shoes out of the freezer, and try them on to test their fit. Repeat this process if necessary. [11] X Research source"

[22] X Research source You should spray a stretching liquid on your shoes prior to using this device. [23] X Research source When the solution saturates the fabric, turn the knob of the stretching device one full turn every 8 hours. You may leave the stretcher in overnight. [24] X Research source"
