      "title": "Hold the ball on the threads.",
      "content": "Hold the ball on the threads. Grip the ball with your dominant hand. Put your fingers in between the threads and hold the ball in a position that feels most comfortable for you. Ideally, you’ll want to place your fingers around the 2nd and 5th lace on the back end of the ball. Place your non-dominant hand on the other side of the ball until you're ready to throw it. [1] X Research source The majority of the ball’s weight should be on the front of your throw. Leave a little bit of space between your hands and the ball. Holding the ball at the threads or laces will help you throw a perfect spiral. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Bend your knees slightly and plant your feet shoulder-width apart.",
      "content": "Bend your knees slightly and plant your feet shoulder-width apart. Plant your feet firmly on the ground with your toes pointed in front of you and straighten your back. Hold the football in your hands and slightly bend your knees. The majority of your weight should be distributed on your back foot. [3] X Research source Distributing your weight on the back foot allows you to spring off it, which could increase your throwing distance. Do not hunch over in this position or it could affect your throw."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push the ball into the throwing position with your lead hand.",
      "content": "Push the ball into the throwing position with your lead hand. Use your lead hand to position the ball and bring it back in your dominant hand. Bend your dominant elbow and bring the ball above your shoulder so your arm is in an “L” position at a 90-degree angle. [4] X Research source Don’t bring the ball down or out to the side when setting up your throw. This step of the throw is called the reach. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Step forward with your lead foot and pull down your lead arm.",
      "content": "Step forward with your lead foot and pull down your lead arm. Your lead foot should be on the same side as your lead hand. Perform an open stride with your lead foot and point your toe in the direction of where you want to throw the ball. Push off with your back foot to gain momentum and power in your throw. As you do this, pull your lead arm down and to your side to add more range of motion to your body. [6] X Research source Keep your lead arm tight against your body. Your lead foot and chest should be pointed towards the target."
    },
    {
      "title": "Throw the ball and twist your waist.",
      "content": "Throw the ball and twist your waist. Extend your arm fully and throw the ball as you rotate your waist into the throw. Your back leg should rotate slightly as you push off it to toss the ball. Keep your shoulder and arm straight so that the throw is accurate. [7] X Research source Bring your lead elbow straight down, not off to the side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Snap your wrist and follow through with the throw.",
      "content": "Snap your wrist and follow through with the throw. Snap your wrist as you throw the ball so that your thumb is pointing downward and in front of you as the ball exits your hand. This will rotate the ball as it leaves your hand so that it forms a spiral and goes the maximum distance. [8] X Research source The last finger that should make contact with the ball is your index finger. This will help you throw a spiral."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tilt back and lean into the pass.",
      "content": "Tilt back and lean into the pass. Lean slightly at the waist towards your throwing arm to increase the range of motion in the throw. This will cock the ball back, which will make it travel farther as you throw it. [9] X Research source Most of the power from your throw is generated from the legs and hips, so getting a fuller range of motion will cause the ball to travel farther."
    },
    {
      "title": "Increase your throwing trajectory to throw the ball farther.",
      "content": "Increase your throwing trajectory to throw the ball farther. Slightly elevate your shoulders and aim the ball in a more upward trajectory to get a more distance. This is necessary for plays that require passes over 40 yd (120 ft), such as a Hail Mary pass. Remember to have full rotation and extension of your body as the ball leaves your hands. [10] X Research source Throw the ball at a 45-degree angle. Do not lean forward or tilt forward as this will actually decrease the distance of your throw."
    },
    {
      "title": "Throw a perfect spiral to maximize your distance.",
      "content": "Throw a perfect spiral to maximize your distance. Throwing a spiral will reduce drag on the ball and allows it to go much farther than a tumbling football. The rotation of the ball will also keep the tip of the ball up in the air, which will improve the trajectory for maximum distance. [11] X Research source If you don't put a spin on the ball as it leaves your hand, there's a good chance it will tumble in the air."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a crow step to build more power in your throw.",
      "content": "Use a crow step to build more power in your throw. Step behind your front foot with your back foot so that your legs cross over. Then, step forward with your lead foot and throw the ball. This extra range of motion causes you to step deeper into the throw, which will make it travel a farther distance. [12] X Research source If you are using a crow step, make sure you have enough clear distance in front of you to take 2-3 steps."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice flicking your wrist to achieve a perfect spiral.",
      "content": "Practice flicking your wrist to achieve a perfect spiral. Practice throwing without holding a ball to perfect the motion of your wrist when throwing a spiral. Throw the ball as you normally would, but concentrate on the downward flick motion of your wrist. Make sure your thumb is pointing down and your index finger is pointed towards your lead thigh as you follow through. [13] X Research source Perform this drill 10-20 times before you warm up with an actual ball."

      "title": "Use a medicine ball to work out your core.",
      "content": "Use a medicine ball to work out your core. Hold a medicine ball at waist level and rotate your hips to both sides. Repeat this for 10-15 reps for 2-3 sets to strengthen your core, which will increase your throwing distance. [14] X Research source You can also do other exercises like sit-ups, crunches , leg lifts, and push-ups to strengthen your core."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice from a stationary position to work on your arm technique.",
      "content": "Practice from a stationary position to work on your arm technique. Stand 10 yd (30 ft) away from your partner and don’t step or move your feet as you throw the ball. This will help you concentrate on your arm technique exclusively and will help build power in your core. [15] X Research source Your lead elbow should be facing the target that you’re passing to. Throw the ball 10-15 times in this position."
    },
    {
      "title": "Throw the ball with your back foot in front of your lead foot.",
      "content": "Throw the ball with your back foot in front of your lead foot. Standing in the opposite direction of your normal stance will force you to exaggerate the twisting motion of your midsection when throwing. This will help build your core strength and get you used to the rotation of your waist as you throw. [16] X Research source Toss the ball 10-15 times in this position."
    },
    {
      "title": "Throw passes while you’re on your knees.",
      "content": "Throw passes while you’re on your knees. Start with your back knee on the ground and your lead leg bent at the knee with your foot planted flat on the ground. Exaggerate the twisting motion of your body as you throw the ball back and forth with your partner. This will work out your core and help you build a full range of motion as you throw. [17] X Research source Switch knees after 10-15 passes and do 10-15 more passes on the other knee."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice throwing accurate 40-yard passes.",
      "content": "Practice throwing accurate 40-yard passes. Have a partner stand 40 yards away and throw the ball to them. Focus on accuracy and distance when throwing the ball. If you’re having trouble throwing a ball 40 yards, reduce the distance to 20 yards and try that instead. [18] X Research source If you practice regularly, throwing a football far will come naturally to you."

    {
      "title": "Practice at least 1-2 hours, 5 days a week.",
      "content": "Practice at least 1-2 hours, 5 days a week. The only way you'll maximize your distance is to practice and drill nearly every day. College level players can spend up to 40 hours per week practicing. Work on your conditioning, throwing power, and footwork to become a well-rounded player. [19] X Research source"
