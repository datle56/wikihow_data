      "content": "Choose a breastfeeding position that is comfortable for you. How you use the pillow depends on how you sit while breastfeeding. Position your body in a way that provides you and your child the most comfort so that they have an easier time latching and are less likely to experience issues like gastric reflux. Here are some common breastfeeding positions to choose from: [1] X Research source Cradle hold: Lay your baby on their side so they’re facing you. Their head should be nestled against or slightly above the crook of your elbow so they can feed from the breast on the same side. Use your other hand to support the back of their head and to guide them toward your breast. This position works well at all stages of growth, especially if the baby latches easily. Cross-cradle hold: This position is the reverse of the cradle position. Support your baby’s body and neck with the arm opposite the breast from which they’re feeding. The cross-cradle position works well for newborns who need help latching, but it can be very demanding on your arm, which is why it’s essential to use a nursing pillow. Football hold: This position resembles an American football carry. Nestle your baby with their bottom at the crook of the elbow on the same side as the breast from which they’re feeding. This works well if you need to nurse two babies at once, though it requires a larger pillow that wraps around your waist. Side-lying position: Lie on your side on a flat mattress with your baby lying on their side next to you. Use a regular pillow to elevate your head and place a body pillow behind you and between your legs to support your back and hips. You don’t typically need a nursing pillow to breastfeed in this position."

      "content": "Adjust the pillow comfortably around your waist. Because breastfeeding pillows come in different shapes and styles, follow your pillow’s instructions to place it properly. Make sure the pillow is snug against your waist without being too tight, then secure any fastening straps. Move your feet and arms until you find an ideal position. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Place your baby on the pillow. Place the breastfeeding pillow along the arm, lap, or side of your body where the baby will be seated during feeding. Gently, take your baby and place their feet under your arm, facing your back. Position the baby so their tummy is facing your body. Ease your baby down onto the breastfeeding pillow. The pillow will do some work for you in regards to supporting your baby. [3] X Research source Make sure your child is positioned on their side with their tummy facing you. Improper positioning could lead to gastric reflux or difficulty swallowing. Remember, if one position doesn’t work well for you, try another one. Never leave your newborn with a nursing pillow unsupervised."

      "content": "Bottle feed your baby using the breastfeeding pillow. If you’re weaning your baby or prefer to bottle feed , a nursing pillow can still come in handy. Find a comfortable place to sit and position the pillow on your lap or side. Lie with whichever arm you’re using to support the baby’s head on the pillow. When bottle feeding, your baby should be lying on a slight incline with their head tilted upward. Using a breastfeeding pillow will provide some support and take some of your baby’s weight off of you while you feed. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the pillow to relieve discomfort during or after pregnancy. If you purchase a breastfeeding pillow before your baby arrives, it can help provide some relief from pains and discomfort during pregnancy. When you sleep , try tucking the pillow between bent knees for lower back support or behind your back to help you stay on your side. [5] X Research source After delivering your baby, use the pillow as a butt pillow to relieve pressure on your genitals. [6] X Research source If you have pregnancy-related heartburn, use the pillow to raise your head while sleeping."

      "content": "Add a breastfeeding pillow to tummy time. Tummy time is a routine in which a baby is placed on their tummy for a little bit each day to strengthen their neck muscles and teach them how to push, roll over, crawl, and stand. Breastfeeding pillows can help ease your child into tummy time, as it props them up and allows them to see more of the room around them. This can distract them from the discomfort of being on their belly. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Most babies sleep on their backs, as per the standards of the American Academy of Pediatricians, to help prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). [8] X Research source Because babies spend so much time on their backs, however, tummy time can be stressful, and they may resist being forced onto their stomach. Make sure you don’t prop your baby up with a breastfeeding pillow before they’re 3 or 4 months old, as their neck muscles might not be strong enough for this to be safe until then.

      "content": "Use your nursing pillow for supported sitting. When your baby starts sitting up, a breastfeeding pillow can support them so they build strength to sit on their own. Wrap the pillow around the front of your baby with their arms draped over it to build lateral strength. When they’re more stable sitting up on their own, place the pillow behind their back and bum to give them extra support if they fall over. [10] X Research source When your baby is first starting to sit up, make sure to place lots of pillows around them, especially behind them, in case they fall over."

      "content": "Prop your child up to play. When they’re little, babies don’t have the motor skills necessary to grab at toys hanging above them or to lift their head from a flat laying position. Prop your baby up on a breastfeeding pillow under a toy bar to help them get closer to the toys and to assist their motor abilities by putting them in a reclined position. [11] X Research source Similarly, laying your child on a nursing pillow with their head on the pillow and their bottom in the hole is a great way to let them see the world around them."

      "content": "Let older children hold the baby with the pillow's assistance. Other children may want to hold your baby , but babies can often be too heavy or wiggly for their small arms. With adult assistance and supervision, placing a breastfeeding pillow around the child allows them to hold the baby more securely. Nursing pillows are also a great way for anyone of any age to snuggle the baby without getting uncomfortable or tired."

      "content": "Consider how long you’re going to be nursing. A breastfeeding pillow is a somewhat long-term investment. If you enjoy using it and it works well for you and your baby, you’ll likely use the pillow until you’re finished breastfeeding. Keep this in mind when selecting your pillow, as you’ll need to choose a size that will work as your baby grows. [12] X Research source Some mothers only breastfeed for 3 or 4 months. In this case, you may not need to worry about the length and size of the pillow. A baby in that age range should fit on most breastfeeding pillows without much trouble. Some mothers choose to breastfeed longer. If you intend to breastfeed your child for a couple of years rather than a couple of months, go with a larger-sized pillow that can support a bigger child. However, as a baby gets older, they’ll be able to hold their head up and control motor functions more easily.

      "content": "Choose a shape that fits your body. Your baby is not the only factor when selecting a breastfeeding pillow. Keep your own size and shape in mind to make sure the breastfeeding pillow fits you properly. Many breastfeeding pillows strap around your torso to support the baby while you breastfeed, so try to select a pillow that will fit your midsection shortly after birth. It’s helpful to imagine yourself 5 or 6 months pregnant, as this is a good gauge of the size you’ll need. [14] X Research source Breastfeeding pillows come in 3 shapes: C-shape, O-shape, and crescent shape. The C-shape is the most universal shape and generally fits the most body types while providing adequate arm support. O-shaped pillows wrap around the entire body, which can be good if you need extra support after pregnancy due to a C-section or complications. Crescent shapes are designed to wrap around the side of your body. They might not work as well for smaller women, as the sides may fall on the back of your chair. Some crescent-shaped pillows, however, are adjustable and can be maneuvered to fit multiple sizes."

      "content": "Decide if you want fastening straps. Fastening straps are buckled straps that allow the pillow to fit the closest around your body. [15] X Research source They keep the pillow more secure, which makes breastfeeding less disruptive. However, they can be difficult to get off, which can cause issues if you need to get out of the contraption quickly, like if your baby is spitting up or your other children or pets need attention. Some mothers also use a travel nursing pillow . Parents often want a strap for these pillows to ensure that everything stays snug in unfamiliar places."

      "content": "Choose a material that’s easy to clean. Because babies spit up and have other accidents, breastfeeding pillows get dirty easily. The easiest breastfeeding pillows to clean have removable covers that can be machine-washed and dried. Some also come with foam inserts that can be hand washed and laid out to dry. Choose a breathable material like cotton or a poly-blend to make clean-up and care easier. [16] X Research source Some moms prefer organic materials, but these are sometimes harder to clean and often need to be hand washed."

It’s important that your baby stays in the correct position so they’re comfortable and don’t experience issues like gastric reflux or trouble swallowing. Breastfeeding pillows support the baby and take some pressure off of your arms to help ensure the baby stays in the correct position until they finish feeding. [17] X Research source Some children take a long time to feed, so a nursing pillow can help minimize sore or tired muscles from holding them. Breastfeeding pillows provide support even as your baby grows and you need to change breastfeeding positions."

Even if your delivery went smoothly, your body will likely be tender and sore as it heals, and those who had a C-section will likely experience additional discomfort. Using a breastfeeding pillow adds a layer of protection between you and your baby and relieves some pressure from the weight of holding them against you as you nurse. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Anyone can use nursing pillows. Breastfeeding pillows allow anyone to feed a baby, not just the nursing mother. Because nursing pillows also provide comfort and support for bottle feeding, the baby’s father, grandparents, babysitter, or anyone else can feed them safely. This is especially helpful when the mother needs a break. [19] X Research source Fun fact: breastfeeding pillows can also improve posture. By raising your baby to nipple-height, nursing pillows help prevent parents from slouching forward. Nursing pillows also allow for hands-free feeding, so you can eat or drink while nursing."

This could lead to the onset of positional plagiocephaly, or flat head syndrome.

      "content": "What is a breastfeeding pillow? A breastfeeding, or nursing, pillow is a type of pillow specifically designed to support a mother and her baby during breastfeeding. These pillows help make breastfeeding more safe and secure by providing back support for the mother and ensuring the baby’s head stays in the correct position during feeding. Most breastfeeding pillows are U-shaped, though they’re available in other shapes depending on the mother’s needs. [21] X Research source Nursing pillows are also more dense than regular pillows, so they make sure the baby’s whole body is supported. They also typically come with washable covers, so they’re easier to clean than regular pillows. Boppy pillows are one of the most popular brands of breastfeeding pillows."

      "content": "What are the downsides of using a breastfeeding pillow? Nursing pillows do not work for every mother or every child. Some babies do not take to breastfeeding and prefer to be held, resulting in them becoming fussy or difficult to nurse when using the pillow. Breastfeeding pillows are also bulky and can be difficult to take from place to place. Some mothers report having to lean over the pillows and experiencing back aches because of this. [24] X Research source Remember, a nursing pillow is designed to provide added comfort. Some mothers find the pillow to be helpful to them and their babies, but if a breastfeeding pillow causes you discomfort, it’s not a necessity. Old-fashioned breastfeeding is fine if you don’t feel comfortable with a breastfeeding pillow."
