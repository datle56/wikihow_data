You can talk to your crush without any pretense or pressure by starting a group message that includes them and some friends, classmates, or coworkers. You can send jokes, funny memes, or use the group chat to plan meetups and events with the group. [9] X Research source Use a real reason to start the group chat so it’s not weird. For example, if you’re in a class with your crush, create a group message and start it off with something like, “Hey guys, this is Sarah, did anybody do Mr. Smith’s homework? I’m struggling over here lol.” Your crush may think you’re just interested in them as a friend if you only talk to them in a group message, but it’s a great way for you to show them your funny or friendly side. If you want to talk to them more intimately or flirtatiously, text them directly."
