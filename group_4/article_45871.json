      "content": "Combine apples, water, and spices together to make your own applesauce. Wash, core, and quarter 2 lb. (908 g) of apples. Put them in a large pot filled with water that is at least an inch (2.5 cm) deeper than the apples. Boil until the apples are soft. With a bit of cooking water or unsweetened apple juice, put them through a blender or food mill. Add 1 tsp. (2 g) of spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. [1] X Research source For baking purposes, use unsweetened applesauce. Add up to 1/2 cup (96 g) of sugar or 1/3 cup (113 g) of honey to homemade applesauce, if you plan to eat it on its own. Reduce the amount of sugar you use in a recipe if you are using sweetened applesauce."

      "content": "Use a 1 to 1 ratio to replace oil or melted butter with applesauce. For example, 1/2 cup (118 ml) of oil is equal to 1/2 cup (56.5 g) of applesauce. Keep in mind that applesauce can be substituted for oil and melted butter, but not softened butter. The substitution works best for cakes, muffins and quick breads. [2] X Research source Substituting applesauce for oil or butter in cookies is not recommended. It can result in mushy cookies that do not hold their shape. You do not need to substitute all of the oil to get a healthy effect. If your recipe turns out better with a little oil and a little applesauce, you can consider it a healthy substitution. Measure applesauce the same way as oil, in a liquid measuring cup . This will provide a more accurate measurement than using a dry measuring cup."

      "content": "Stir the applesauce with the wet ingredients before the dry ingredients. Use an electric mixer to ensure the applesauce is well mixed. The recipe will also turn out to be more moist, if the dry ingredients are mixed with the wet ingredients right before baking. Refrain from changing the cooking time on the recipe. Low-fat recipes should not be over-baked as they can be extra dry."
