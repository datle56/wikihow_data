      "content": "Use semi- or demi-permanent dye if your natural blonde hair is 20-25% gray. Semi- and demi-permanent hair dyes deposit color without using ammonia, which prevents unnecessary damage to your hair. Semi-permanent dyes last through 6-12 shampoos and demi-permanent dyes last for 12-24 shampoos. Semi- and demi-permanent dyes provide limited coverage, so they work best if you have minimal gray or need to touch up gray roots on dyed blonde hair. These dyes are great options if want to experiment with color without commitment. They can be invaluable tools as you begin your gray-to-blonde journey! [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Select permanent or high-lift dye if you need more than 25% gray coverage. For the longest lasting and best coverage with the least amount of damage, permanent hair dye is the way to go. It’s the best choice if you need to dye your full head rather than touch up your roots. You can also go with high-lift dye, which is a type of permanent dye that includes additional boosters and ammonia to strip out stubborn or dark gray. High-lift dyes lighten and deposit new color simultaneously so that you don't have to bleach your hair. Gray hair is fragile so it's best to avoid bleach if you can. High-lift dyes are more damaging than the other options, but they're still a lot less damaging than bleach. Once your gray roots start growing in after using permanent or high-lift dye, you can use a gentler demi- or semi-permanent dye to cover them with minimal damage to your hair. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a blonde shade of dye that flatters your skin's undertones . If your skin has warm undertones, a golden blonde shade will flatter your skin and blend well with the gray. If you’re mostly gray, a cool or ashy blonde shade works great because it blends well for all-over coverage and flatters most skin tones. If you aren’t sure what to choose, consider a neutral blonde shade, which includes a mix of warm and cool tones and tends to flatter everyone's skin tone. [4] X Research source Neutral blonde shades might have names like \"iced latte\" or \"pearl copper.\" Most dyes state warm, cool, or neutral on the box, though. If you’re dyeing your roots, choose a blonde shade that matches your lengths or go 1 shade lighter to create a natural-looking blend with your lengths. [5] X Research source If you aren’t using a box kit, you’ll need to buy dye and developer separately at a beauty supply store."

      "content": "Brush out your dry, unwashed hair to remove any tangles. Gently run a paddle brush through your lengths to get rid of any knots. Keep in mind that freshly washed hair doesn’t absorb the dye well because it makes the hair slippery. Hair that hasn’t been washed in 24-48 hours is ideal for applying hair dye. [6] X Research source If your hair is dirtier than that, the oils and product buildup may prevent the dye from adhering to the hair shaft and you could end up with patchy results. If you have thick, curly hair, use a wide-tooth comb instead of a paddle brush to work through any tangles."
