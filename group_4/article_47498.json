A solid button-up underneath a patterned crop top and low-rise wide-leg jeans makes a great outfit for school or shopping. For a more formal option, pair a white button-up with a solid-colored crop top and dress pants. Add heels and a few pieces of understated jewelry to complete the look. This look works better with a slightly more form-fitting crop top, but make sure it isn't too tight, since that might bunch up the button-up!"
