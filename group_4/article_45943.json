Before you approach the person, start laying the groundwork by trying some “long-distance flirting.” Catch their eye from across the room. If they smile or hold eye contact for more than 3 seconds, they’re probably interested. Move a couple steps closer. If they keep looking at you and smiling, start making your way over! [2] X Research source They might also show that they’re attracted to you by touching their hair, neck or lips, turning their body towards you, and taking an open, relaxed stance."

      "content": "Approach them confidently to make a good impression. Walk over slowly and casually, or lean closer to them at the bar or table. Give them a relaxed, confident smile. Your approach is crucial to the setup of your pickup line: you want to come across as confident and in-control, but also interested and engaging. If you’re feeling nervous, take a couple of deep breaths. Pull your shoulders back and put your hands in your pockets to avoid fidgeting. Remember that if you look confident, people won’t realize that you’re nervous! Using pickup lines is a fun, easy way to start a conversation with someone. You can do this! Reader Poll: We asked 1476 wikiHow readers, and 71% of them agreed that the best way to get someone's attention is by starting with \"Excuse me\" and going from there. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Interrupt their conversation politely when you hear a lull. If the person you’re approaching is talking to others, wait until you see them pause to take a drink or look around. Then, casually lean across and break into the conversation in a relaxed, polite way. You want to get their attention and make eye contact before you go into your pickup line. You could say something like, “Excuse me…” or “Hey, is this seat taken?”"

      "content": "Go for a humorous pickup line that’s related to the setting and situation. Studies have shown that the pickup lines with the best success rates are funny ones! Making the other person laugh is a great way to create an instant bond between you, and get them feeling positive and excited. Avoid sarcasm and corny, overused lines and go with something unique, related to the place you’re at or something you’re both doing. Try something like: [3] X Research source “Wow. The man bun really is making a comeback, isn’t it?” “I just wonder how early we’d have to get here to be at the front of the line… maybe if I brought a tent and camped out overnight...” “I haven’t heard this song since 7th grade. I would complain, but it’s still a jam… I had great taste for a 12 year old.” “So, I did something stupid. I came over here and ordered French fries because I was thinking, if I order food, she’ll definitely start talking to me. But I forgot ketchup. And you are clearly not the kind of girl who would stoop for fries without ketchup. I feel like I need to apologize.” “Well, this place sucks. How’s your night going?” “My friends are so boring. Please help me entertain myself before I fall asleep at this bar.”"

      "content": "Try a sincere, specific compliment to start off on a positive note. If you’re using a compliment to break the ice, focus on something that’s not related to her appearance. You’ll come off as more sincere, and it’ll be a better start to a real conversation. If you do try an appearance-related compliment, be upfront and candid about it, not sleazy. Try compliments like: [4] X Research source “Can I compliment you on your superb taste in bar food? That pizza looks amazing.” “I’m sorry, I don’t mean to eavesdrop… but you’re hilarious. I was trying so hard not to laugh out loud.” “You were really good at that cardio kickboxing circuit. Have you done this before?” “I have to tell you, you look just like Angelina Jolie. I know that sounds cheesy, but I’m not kidding!”"

      "content": "Try a cliche pickup line and comment on how cheesy it is to show your wit and humor. The cheesiest, most overused pickup lines don’t usually work on their own. If you want to try one, though, pair it with a joke or comment on how corny or funny it is. You’ll still be giving the person a compliment (even if it’s a cheesy one!), while showing them that you have a good sense of humor and wit. Try: “I have a bet with my friend that even the worst pickup lines can still work with the right delivery, wanna help me out? OK. Try to keep a straight face. Here it is: ‘Was that an earthquake? Or did you just rock my world?’” “I would ask if you’re from Tennessee, and do that whole ‘you’re the only 10 I see thing…’ but I think you’re a 9 out of 10… And I’m the 1 you need! See what I did there?”"

      "title": "Use a pickup line that’s straightforward and honest for a direct approach.",
      "content": "Use a pickup line that’s straightforward and honest for a direct approach. Sometimes the best pickup lines are the ones that are simple, direct, and honest about what you want. This shows that you’re confident and not just messing around, unlike more jokey pickup lines that might make it hard for people to take you seriously. Keep a casual, in-control tone to surprise and impress the other person with your straightforwardness. Try something like: [5] X Research source “This song is amazing. Do you want to dance?” “Tell me about yourself.” “I saw you over here and I had to come over and say something.”"

    {
      "title": "Pay attention to their response and decide if you should keep talking.",
      "content": "Pay attention to their response and decide if you should keep talking. If they answer your question positively, smile, or laugh, your pickup line did its job! They might be interested in having a conversation. If they ignore you or give a short, disinterested answer, they’re probably not interested. Their body language can also tell you whether they want to keep talking. If they turn towards you and make eye contact, they’re more likely to keep talking than if they just glance at you over their shoulder. If they’re not interested, you could try to make a better impression by saying something like, “OK, sorry, I know that was cheesy. I really just wanted to start a conversation with you. How’re you doing tonight?” If they’re still not interested, it’s time to walk away. Say something like, “I hope you have a good night!” It might sting, but remember that you were brave for trying, and that someone else will appreciate your humor and friendliness."

      "content": "Follow up with casual questions. Once you’ve broken the ice with your pickup line, keep the conversation going! Introduce yourself and talk more about the place you’re at, what they’ve been doing today, or a common interest you share. Keep your tone casual and your focus on them, asking lots of questions so they keep talking with you. Try saying things like: “So what brings you out tonight?” “Are you from around here?” “Are you a big basketball fan, then?” “Do you like this kind of music?”"

      "content": "Leave politely if they’re not interested. As you talk, watch their body language and listen to how they respond. If they’re smiling, tilting their head, or leaning closer to you, keep the conversation going—they may be interested! If they start turning away from you, giving you shorter, blunter answers, or stop making eye contact, it’s probably time to move on. [6] X Research source Say something like, “It was cool to meet you. Have a great night,” or, “I better get back to my friends. Have a good time tonight.”"

      "title": "Avoid overtly sexual pickup lines.",
      "content": "Avoid overtly sexual pickup lines. Lines that are too aggressive or suggestive can come off as desperate or creepy, and are much more likely to backfire. Studies show that women in particular are turned off by lines that are too forward. By talking to this person in the first place, you’re showing them that you’re interested in them in some way; you don’t have to make it too explicit. [7] X Research source For example, avoid shallow, crass, or sexual lines like “Are you cake? Because I want a piece of that” or “If you were a library book, I’d check you out.” For more success, focus on creating an emotional connection. Make them laugh, ask them questions you’re genuinely interested in, and offer engaging stories of your own."

      "title": "Try an interesting, funny comment about their profile to show them your personality.",
      "content": "Try an interesting, funny comment about their profile to show them your personality. Read the person’s profile and look at their pictures, then send them a message responding to something they’re interested in, or an activity they’ve done. Sending a unique, personalized message and showing that you’re interested in them as a person tells them that you want to get to know them in a genuine way. You’ll be much more likely to get a response, too! Try messages like: [8] X Research source “I saw you went to Southeast Asia recently? That’s so cool. I fell off an elephant in Thailand once and it was incredible.” “Hey, this message is for your dog Casper so please pass it along… hey buddy! If you and your dad ever wanna go for a walk in the park, let me know!” “Hey, that’s really cool that you ski! I’m a pro at the bunny slope. I tear it up out there. If you need any tips I’m happy to share.”"

    {
      "title": "Ask a funny question to encourage a response.",
      "content": "Ask a funny question to encourage a response. Sending the person a question that’s both funny and unique is a great way to get them to respond. They’ll be able to tell that you went to the effort of learning a little bit about them, and that you care enough to ask them something different and interesting. Try a question like: [9] X Research source “Hey! How long have you been living in New York? I’ve been here 2 years and I still don’t understand the subway system so really I’m only here to find someone to be my GPS.” “That’s so cool that you went skydiving! I’ve always wanted to go, but then I’m like, wait, I can’t even go off a high dive from 6 feet (1.8 m) above a pool, so….”"

      "title": "Send them a sincere compliment to show your interest.",
      "content": "Send them a sincere compliment to show your interest. Compliments can be a good conversation starter and a great way to let someone know you’re interested, but make sure that they’re genuine and personalized to the person. Avoid making comments on their appearance, which can feel shallow. Instead, compliment things you’ve learned about them from their profile, like: “I’ve never met an actual zoologist before! I still haven’t met you technically but I think I’m going to count an online conversation so…. Anyways, what animals do you work with? LOL.” “That’s so cool you’re a journalist. Can you tell me about the weirdest story you’ve ever worked on? Haha I’m so curious.” “Your profile was hilarious, I was actually laughing out loud. Please tell me you’re just as funny IRL haha.”"

    {
      "title": "Try a cheesy pickup line, while commenting on how funny it is.",
      "content": "Try a cheesy pickup line, while commenting on how funny it is. Cheesy pickup lines can be hard to use online; the other person can’t read your expression, so the line can come off as less lighthearted and more creepy. If you want to try a line, try poking fun at yourself or adding a funny comment about how weird the line is to show that you’re using it in good humor. For example, you could say: “Hey! I have a question for you: if nothing lasts forever… will you be my nothing? OK, I know that was cheesy, but I needed something to get your attention… you seem awesome and I’d really like to get to know you.” “At the risk of stating the obvious, we’re not socks. But I think we’d make a great pair. (... get it??)” For a more sincere approach, try saying, “There’s this pickup line that goes, ‘Want to see a picture of a beautiful person? Just hold up a mirror.’ I know we don’t know each other yet, but you’re the first person I’ve really wanted to use that one. I think you’re beautiful.”"

    {
      "title": "Continue the conversation with interesting questions and comments.",
      "content": "Continue the conversation with interesting questions and comments. Once you’ve broken the ice with a pickup line or interesting question, keep the conversation going! Ask them more questions about their life or things on their profile. Be friendly, polite, and engaging. Keep the focus on them, but share stories about yourself when you see that you have something in common. Say things like: “What shows are you watching right now? AKA please send me recommendations haha.” “So where are you from originally?” “Yeah, I played soccer growing up but definitely was not any good haha. What about you?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stop messaging them if they’re clearly not interested.",
      "content": "Stop messaging them if they’re clearly not interested. If the person is giving you detailed responses and asking you questions in return, it probably means they’re interested! Keep up your conversation and start making deeper connections. However, if they’re giving you short, forced responses or just not responding at all, they’re probably not interested. Send them a short message to say goodbye and move on. Say something like, “It was nice talking to you, but I don’t think we’re in the same place. Wish you the best with everything.” If they never responded to your first message, a goodbye message probably isn’t necessary. It can hurt to be rejected, but keep your head up. As long as you keep messaging people in a kind, polite, and interesting way, you’ll meet the one for you!"

    {
      "title": "Avoid messages that are too eager, corny, or forward.",
      "content": "Avoid messages that are too eager, corny, or forward. Overly flirtatious or forward pickup lines can seem even more aggressive online than they do in person, because you can’t temper their meaning with your tone or expression. Steer clear of anything that could come off as offensive, and try not to use lines that are too corny or desperate-sounding either. [10] X Research source For example, avoid sending a corny, disingenuous, or desperate message like, “You’re too beautiful for this site!!” or “I have to meet you! Otherwise, it will always feel like I’m missing something in my life.” Sending really flirty, forward messages might catch someone’s attention momentarily, but it’s more likely to turn them off in the long run. For a real connection, focus on getting to know the person through good conversation."
