Feed your husky three meals a day until three months of age, then two meals a day after that. If the puppy is struggling to finish his meals or his tummy is very full and distended on three meals before the age of three months, then divide the daily allowance between four meals instead. At 12 to 16 weeks, you will notice the puppy just picks a little at the afternoon meal. At this point, you can discontinue it. Feed a high-quality food that is not full of artificial additives. [1] X Research source This is important at any age, but especially so for a growing puppy. Feeding on a regular schedule will help with housebreaking the dog, as most husky puppies will need to go outside 15 to 30 minutes after eating. [2] X Research source Do not allow your husky to \"free feed\" at any age. Providing meals at set times, and taking the dish away when the dog is done eating, is one way to show your stubborn husky that you are in charge."
