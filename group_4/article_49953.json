      "content": "Install more RAM in your computer. RAM, or “random access memory,” acts as temporary storage while your computer runs, and it can start acting up if programs use all of the storage space. Taking apart your Mac to install more RAM can be tricky to do on your own, so it’s best to take your computer to an Apple store or certified provider to see if they can do the installation for you. [5] X Research source Luigi Oppido, a computer specialist, mentions you can check how much RAM your Mac has by clicking on the Apple logo, selecting About This Mac and looking at the “Memory” listing. Some Macs and MacBooks cannot have RAM added or upgraded by Apple, but you may be able to find third-party services that will do it for you. Spike Baron, a desktop support expert, says that 8 GB of RAM is usually enough for casual browsing and simple picture editing. If you’re using more intensive programs, such as 3D modeling software, aim to get 16-32 GB instead."
