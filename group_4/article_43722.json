    {
      "title": "Use equal parts of cream and milk.",
      "content": "Use equal parts of cream and milk. Ice cream recipes use cream because you can whip it (unlike milk). This will give you a light, airy base. For thicker ice cream, however, you want a less airy base. This means that you need to reduce the amount of cream, and use the same amount as your milk. [1] X Research source Don't use less cream than milk, however, or the ice cream will end up too icy."

    {
      "title": "Add extra egg yolks for a richer, thicker texture.",
      "content": "Add extra egg yolks for a richer, thicker texture. You can use up to 8 eggs for 1 quart (688 grams) of ice cream. This may seem like a lot, but it really makes a difference. Egg yolks not only help make the ice cream thicker, but they also help reduce the amount of ice crystals that often form during freezing. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that adding egg yolks to ice cream will change the flavor somewhat. The ice cream will taste more like custard."

      "title": "Try a dry stabilizer for something quick and simple.",
      "content": "Try a dry stabilizer for something quick and simple. Great examples include arrowroot powder, cornflour, and tapioca flour. Unlike eggs, they do not alter the flavor too much. Plan on using between 2 and 3 teaspoons per quart (688 grams) of ice cream. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Try a gelling stabilizer if you need something more potent.",
      "content": "Try a gelling stabilizer if you need something more potent. These are ingredients that gel when hydrated in a liquid. Carrageenan, gelatin, locust bean gum, pectin, and sodium alginate are all examples of good gelling stabilizers. These ingredients are very potent, so you should only use 0.1 to 0.5% of the base's weight. For best results, use a kitchen scale. [4] X Research source If you don't have a kitchen scale, measure out about ¼ teaspoon of your gelling stabilizer instead. Adjust the amount to get the thickness you desire."

    {
      "title": "Try some vegan thickeners.",
      "content": "Try some vegan thickeners. Not all vegan ice cream recipes turn out thick. While you can try some stabilizers are already vegan (i.e.: cornstarch), there are some options that work even better. The stabilizers listed below work great in vegan ice cream recipes, but not so much in traditional recipes. If you are working with a vegan recipe, try: [5] X Research source Scoop the cream from a can of full-fat coconut milk, and use it as your base. Use frozen, mashed up bananas as your base. Add some silken tofu, but be sure to blend it up first. Whip up the brine from a can of chickpeas (aquafaba) until it forms peaks, then fold it into the base."

      "title": "Mix the stabilizer into the ingredients well.",
      "content": "Mix the stabilizer into the ingredients well. You can do this with a handheld blender or by hand with a fork or whisk. If you choose to do it by hand, mix it for about 5 minutes to ensure thorough mixing. If you don't mix the stabilizers into your ingredients well enough, they will clump and not thicken your ice cream properly. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Hydrate gelling stabilizers according to the instructions on the package.",
      "content": "Hydrate gelling stabilizers according to the instructions on the package. Some gelling stabilizers need to be hydrated in hot liquid while others need to by hydrated in cold liquid. This will determine when you should add the stabilizer into your recipe. [7] X Research source For example, gelatin needs to be hydrated in cold liquid. You should add it to the cold liquid (i.e.: milk or cream) and let it bloom before proceeding. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure that the ice cream base is cold before you churn it.",
      "content": "Make sure that the ice cream base is cold before you churn it. Do not get impatient and try to churn it while it is still warm. Even if it is lukewarm, the canister won't be cold enough to thicken it and freeze it. Chill the ice cream base for four hours in an ice bath, or overnight in the fridge."

      "title": "Freeze the canister the day before to ensure that it is cold enough.",
      "content": "Freeze the canister the day before to ensure that it is cold enough. This should go without saying, but it is a common ice cream making mistake. If you are churning your ice cream and it is not thickening, make sure that the canister is cold. Try adding some more ice and rock salt to it. Next time, put the canister into the freezer the day before you start making ice cream. This will ensure that it is cold enough."

      "title": "Stop churning early and transfer the ice cream into a flat, wide container.",
      "content": "Stop churning early and transfer the ice cream into a flat, wide container. As soon as the ice cream is thick enough so that a spoon leaves an indent, stop churning. This will help prevent overrun and reduce the amount of air. Transfer the ice cream into a flat, wide container, such as a loaf pan. This will help it freeze faster. [9] X Research source Work quickly; you want to get the ice cream into the freezer as quickly as possible."

      "title": "Put the ice cream into the freezer immediately.",
      "content": "Put the ice cream into the freezer immediately. If you wait too long, the ice cream will start to melt, which can lead to ice crystals. This can affect the texture, making it grainy and gritty. Keep the ice cream on the bottom of your freezer, towards the back, where it is the coldest. [10] X Research source Don't open the freezer and peek at the ice cream. This will only slow down the freezing process and introduce ice crystals. Place some frozen stuff on top of the ice cream container; make sure that these items don't touch the actual ice cream."

It is ready when it reaches 170 °F (77 °C). If you don't have a thermometer, check the texture instead. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.

Once the ice cream is frozen solid, you can scoop it out into a serving bowl, then add mix-ins, such as chocolate syrup, caramel sauce, chocolate chips, etc. Do not peek into the freezer while the ice cream is freezing. This will alter the temperature inside the freezer and create ice crystals in the ice cream. [18] X Research source"
