      "content": "Doodle in your notebook. Doodling is a great way to waste time in class because it just looks like you're taking notes. You can draw things like geometric shapes, crazy designs, or whatever you see outside the classroom window. You can even color your drawings in with colored pencils or markers. [1] X Research source Make sure you have a page of notes to flip to in case your teacher walks by your desk. Make your drawing interact with the binder paper. Have a worm poke out of the binder ring hole, or a stick figure climb up the blue lines like a ladder. If you do plan on taking notes alongside your doodling, draw in the margins of your paper. This will free up the rest of the page for note taking."

Tear out a sheet of paper and try making an origami crane , an origami heart , or an origami turtle . You can even make your own origami wallet . [2] X Research source Make the origami in your lap below your desk so your teacher doesn't see you. You can also tilt your notebook back and use it as a barrier to do your origami behind. Most origami designs are made from square sheets of paper, so you should turn your binder paper into a square first."

      "content": "Draw a fake tattoo on yourself with a pen. Write your name on your wrist or draw a symbol like an arrow or a heart. If you like henna, draw a fake henna tattoo on the top of your hand using a pen instead of actual henna ink. If you need design ideas, look some up on your phone, or print them out before class to be more discreet. If you want something more subtle, draw a fake ring on your finger. It doesn't even have to be your actual \"ring finger.\""

It can be a heart or even an origami frog ."

You can also play 20 questions by passing the questions and answers back and forth on a tiny piece of paper. [5] X Research source Try playing \"I spy.\" Pick a random object in the room, write a hint about what it is on a piece of paper, and pass it to your friend. They have to keep writing down their guesses and passing them to you. If they guess the object before class is over, they win! Another fun game to play is where you each write a sentence of a story. See how far you can get! If you are feeling more creative, you can pass a sheet of paper back and forth and add a doodle to it to complete a larger picture or scene."

      "content": "Do your homework for a different class. Even though you might not feel like doing homework, getting it out of the way now means you won't have to do it later. Also, if you forgot to do your homework for a class you have after this one, you can do it now so it's not late. If you're having trouble focusing because of the background noise in class, try putting in headphones or earplugs. Just make sure they're not visible and that you can still hear what your teacher is saying in case you get called on. If wearing headphones or earplugs isn't an option, work on the easiest parts of your homework that don't require a lot of concentration."

Play games that don't require a lot of attention so you're not staring at your phone screen the whole time. Use a stylus that looks like a pen to play the games on your phone so it looks like you're taking notes. [7] X Research source If you are in a class where you are allowed to use laptops, you can play games on that instead. A simple card game will be more discreet than a fancy mmorpg."

Try to find something interesting to focus on and before you know it, class will be over! If you aren't near a window, you could try looking out the classroom door. See if you can find something interesting going on in the class across the hall. Alternatively, you can always study your fellow classmates. Look only at the people in front of you; the teacher will notice if you turn around to look at the people behind you."
