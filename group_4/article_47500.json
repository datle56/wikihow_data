      "title": "Press your top dentures against the roof of your mouth.",
      "content": "Press your top dentures against the roof of your mouth. Your top dentures just rest on the roof of your mouth and the natural suction in your mouth holds them in place. Hold the dentures inside your mouth and line them up with your top gum line. Then press the dentures into place by pressing them against the roof of your mouth for a few seconds. [2] X Research source Partial and full dentures both rest on the roof of your mouth, so this procedure works the same no matter what type you use. If you have partial dentures, then you’ll have to line up the dentures with the spaces between your remaining teeth like a puzzle. Look in the mirror to make this a lot easier."

[3] X Research source If you have partial dentures, fit them into the space between your remaining teeth like a puzzle piece. The lower denture tends to feel looser than the top one because it isn’t held in place with natural suction. It’s normal if you need some adhesive or a re-sizing from your dentist."

      "title": "Apply denture adhesive",
      "content": "Apply denture adhesive if your dentures feel loose. Dentures are designed to fit your mouth and shouldn’t need extra adhesive. However, denture adhesive is a good option if your dentures feel loose or you want some extra security. Squeeze 3-4 pea-sized drops of adhesive onto the part of the top denture that touches the roof of your mouth. Apply the same amount to the bottom denture along the gum line. Then press each one into position and hold it for a few seconds to let the adhesive work.

You can't go wrong with these products. If you need more advice for choosing the right one, ask your dentist. Adhesive is also a good option if your mouth is usually dry, since saliva holds them in place. If your dentures still feel too loose, they might need tightening. Talk to your dentist about getting an adjustment."
