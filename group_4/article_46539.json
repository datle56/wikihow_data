      "title": "Exfoliate your lips.",
      "content": "Exfoliate your lips. Most lip masks recommend exfoliating your lips first, especially if your lips are a bit shaggy with dry skin. You can use a lip scrub, or you can simply rub a wet washcloth over them to help remove dead skin."

    {
      "title": "Dry your lips.",
      "content": "Dry your lips. Before applying the lip mask, your lips need to be dry. Otherwise, the mask will have trouble sticking to your face. Plus, you don't want to dilute the product with water, as you want its full benefits."

    {
      "title": "Remove the mask from the packaging.",
      "content": "Remove the mask from the packaging. Most lip masks will come in a large box. Inside the box, you'll find individual packages of lip masks.

    {
      "title": "Place the lip mask over your lips.",
      "content": "Place the lip mask over your lips. The mask goes over your mouth. Make sure you cover all of your lips, so the mask has a chance to work. In fact, some masks extend well beyond the edges of your lips. [3] X Research source Some masks are one whole piece, meaning you can't breathe through your mouth, so keep that in mind if you have a stuffy nose."

    {
      "title": "Leave the mask on for the specified amount of time.",
      "content": "Leave the mask on for the specified amount of time. To work well, the mask needs to stay on your mouth for about 10 to 15 minutes, though some run up to 30 minutes or longer. Read the directions for your specific mask. Set a timer so that you're not tempted to pull it off early. You may need to lay down while it's working, as some aren't terribly sticky. In fact, some masks are meant to be left on during the night."
    },
    {
      "title": "Peel it off.",
      "content": "Peel it off. Once the time is up, you simply peel the mask off. These masks are not reusable, so you toss it in the trash at the end. After you're done, apply your makeup or go on with your day as you normally do."
