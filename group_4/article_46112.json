Listen to your salon professional’s advice to help you work towards eventually achieving the desired shade. For example, at first you may not be able to get a silver blonde. The silver blonde toner may make your hair green or another shade. Instead, you may have to bleach your hair a few more times before your hair is stripped of the red and yellow. Always keep a color wheel handy while bleaching, dyeing, and toning your hair so that you can pay attention to your hair's current color and undertones. This way, you can avoid ending up with a hair color that’s different than what you were hoping for and expecting."
