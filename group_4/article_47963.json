      "title": "Most people drop a :L to convey that they’re speechless.",
      "content": "Most people drop a :L to convey that they’re speechless. Similar to the 😐 (neutral face) emoji, a :L kind of looks like someone staring blankly. Use :L when you want to show someone you don’t have a reaction. Just FYI, this emoticon usually implies that you’re being a touch playful. [1] X Research source For example: Them: “I just put mayo on a hot dog and it’s…not good.” You: “:L what exactly were you expecting?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Some people use :L to mean “I’m laughing.”",
      "content": "Some people use :L to mean “I’m laughing.” While less popular than the blank-face version of the emoticon, many people use :L as a substitution for lol. The colon represents eyes, and the L is just short for laughing. As an example: Them: “How do you organize a party for an astronaut? You planet.” You: “:L okay that one’s pretty good.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Drop a :L if you want to convey you’re playfully unimpressed.",
      "content": "Drop a :L if you want to convey you’re playfully unimpressed. If you want to throw a little side eye like you’re not buying what someone is selling, :L is a fun way to do it. It’s an expressive way to show you’re expressionless! As an example: Them: “I think I might have lost my mattress…” You: “:L you did what now…”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use :L the same way you’d use “lol” to show you’re laughing.",
      "content": "Use :L the same way you’d use “lol” to show you’re laughing. Instead of throwing a 😂 or lol out in reaction to a funny comment, use :L to demonstrate that you find something funny. For example: Them: “I’m so bored of Mr. Green’s science class that I might write my final paper on sleep paralysis demons.” You: “Incredible :L imagine if you actually did that.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "L is usually short for “loss.”",
      "content": "L is usually short for “loss.” If you “take an L” it means you’re taking a loss. This can be a literal loss, as in you losing a pickup basketball game, or it can be a figurative loss, like you not getting to go to a party. For example: [2] X Research source “You think you’re going to beat me in Mario Kart? I’ll hand you an L any time.” “I took a major L today after school. I asked Mia out and she said no ☹” “If you’re ready to take this L, we can go minigolfing again whenever you’d like 😊”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a well-timed L to banter in a friendly competition.",
      "content": "Use a well-timed L to banter in a friendly competition. Tell someone you’re handing out Ls and watch the no-you-didn’t oohs and ahs go flying. This is an excellent way to boost your trash talk and take it to the next level. [3] X Research source For example, you might say: “If you really need an L, I’ve got you covered.” “Step to me on the basketball court and you’re taking an L home—I guarantee it.” “No way Tupac was better than Biggie. If those two battled, Pac would take the L any day.”"

    {
      "title": "Drop an L to downplay a genuine loss you experienced.",
      "content": "Drop an L to downplay a genuine loss you experienced. Saying you “took an L” instead of simply explaining something bad that happened to you is a good way to subtly suggest that you aren’t all that shook up about it. You could say: “I definitely took an L on that math exam. No way I don’t end up in summer school.” “So, I don’t think Tony wants to go out with me again :/ guess I’m taking another dating L.” “My brother didn’t get into Wisconsin University. He’s not taking the L particularly well.”"

    {
      "title": "L and C is short for “like and comment” on Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok.",
      "content": "L and C is short for “like and comment” on Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. Liking and commenting posts or videos on YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok will give the author a boost in visibility on all these platforms. [4] X Research source Since “make sure you guys like, comment, and subscribe” is a pretty drawn out way of communicating that, authors on both platforms will often just shorten it to “L & C.” [5] X Research source A post might have description including: “L and C pls. It really helps out.” “L & C for more great content.” “Pleas L, C, and S!”"

      "title": "L + ratio is a way to sarcastically mock people on social media.",
      "content": "L + ratio is a way to sarcastically mock people on social media. Originating on Twitter, a “ratio” refers to a post where the ratio between likes and replies is really lopsided towards the replies. The “L” component of the equation is short for “loss.” Take them together, and the implication here is that someone has said something extremely unpopular. People use it ironically, but it’s probably a genuine put down if they’re replying to a comment that actually has been ratioed. [6] X Research source For example, you could say: “You’re going to get L + ratioed if you don’t delete this.” “I hate to do it, but L + ratio. This is a terrible take.” “L + ratio + unsubscribed + go home”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Left",
      "content": "Left If someone is giving directions or they use an L and R in the same sentence, they’re probably using L as a shorthand for left. For example, someone might write: “Take an L at Harbor St. We’re on the corner.” “If someone can’t figure out the difference between L and R, they probably shouldn’t be driving.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Liter",
      "content": "Liter L is the official shorthand for liter, which is the metric unit of measurement for volume (1 L is equivalent to 0.26 US gallons, in case you’re curious). If it looks like someone is sharing a measurement, the L is almost certainly short for liter. [7] X Research source Someone might say: “Can you grab a 2 L of Pepsi on your way home?” “Jason went wild last night. He drank like 8 L of ale before stumbling home.”"

    {
      "title": "50 (Roman numeral)",
      "content": "50 (Roman numeral) L is the Roman numeral for 50. You’re unlikely to encounter this one over text, but you’ll occasionally run into this one in history books or at museums. For example, LI = 51 since L is 50 and I is 1. [8] X Research source"
