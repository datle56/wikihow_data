      "content": "Make a straight part in clean, dry hair. Johnson recommends starting with clean hair that doesn’t have any products in it for the best results. Starting with clean hair makes it less likely for the tinsel to slide out as soon as you get it in. Then, use a comb or your fingers to part your hair . Wash your hair and style it however you like before you tie in your hair tinsel. You can blow-dry your hair, let it air dry, or curl it . Hair tinsel looks great with every style."

      "content": "Fold a strand of tinsel that’s twice as long as your hair in half. Most tinsel is between 20 and 47 inches (51 and 119 cm) long. If you have short hair, choose the smaller size so you don't have to waste tinsel. When you fold the tinsel strand, make sure both sides are equal lengths. Have fun picking a tinsel color! Try tinsel that matches your hair color to add a slight shimmer to your hairstyle, or pick a bright, boldly colored tinsel that stands out against your hair color."

      "content": "Make a slip knot in the looped end of the tinsel. To form a slip knot , pinch the folded end of the tinsel with 1 hand to form a loop. Slide the thumb and index finger of your other hand through the loop. Then, use your thumb and index finger to pinch the strands of tinsel and pull them back through the loop to make the slip knot. If you're unsure whether or not you've successfully made a slip knot, remove your fingers and pull the loop away. The loop should disappear instead of tightening into a knot."

      "content": "Pull 2-3 hairs through the loop and then tighten the slip knot. Keep your thumb and index finger through the loop of the slip knot. Use your other hand to separate 2-3 strands of hair near your part and hold the slip knot up to them. Grab the hairs with your fingers and pull them through the loop. Then, pull the ends of the tinsel so it tightens near your scalp. Make sure that you pull the strands of hair completely through the loop so they don't get tangled or knotted."

      "title": "Tie the strands of tinsel into a simple overhand knot.",
      "content": "Tie the strands of tinsel into a simple overhand knot. To keep the tinsel secure in your hair, make an overhand knot by overlapping both ends and bringing 1 end through the loop you made. Then, pull the ends in opposite directions to secure the knot near the base of your scalp. Make a few more overhand knots with the tinsel to make it more secure. Alternatively, tie the strand of hair into an overhand knot with one side of the tinsel and then repeat with the other side of the tinsel. Add individual strands of tinsel along your part and around the crown of your head for a subtle shimmery look. Tie up to 10 strands together at a time for a fun, bold style."

Keep your thumb and ring finger on the hair and tinsel at the scalp. Then, stretch the index and middle finger of your same hand up by 2 inches (5.1 cm). Use these fingers to pinch the hair and tinsel. [2] X Research source Choose a piece of tinsel that's as long as your hair. Separate the 2-3 strands from the hair next to your part."

Draw the tool down towards your thumb and slide it through your thumb and ring finger. This makes a tiny loop. [3] X Research source Practice doing this a few times until the motion feels comfortable. Keep pinching the tinsel and hair with your fingers while you're using the tool. A latch hook for hair extensions has a hooked end with a latch that opens and closes to help you pull and tie the tinsel to your hair. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Thread 1-4 strands of tinsel through a bead that matches your hair.",
      "content": "Thread 1-4 strands of tinsel through a bead that matches your hair. Many hair tinsel kits come with a packet of microbeads that have a layer of silicone on the inside to keep them from slipping down your hair. Choose a bead that’s closest to the color at the roots of your hair. Johnson says microbead extensions last longer and are more durable than other types. However, they may be a little uncomfortable when you’re sleeping or brushing your hair. Use a hair extension hook or size B-1 crochet hook to make it easier to thread the tinsel through the bead. Alternatively, tie strands of tinsel directly to to the bead, securing them with 2 overhand knots."

      "title": "Use the hook to pull up to 10 strands of hair through the bead.",
      "content": "Use the hook to pull up to 10 strands of hair through the bead. Choose a spot on your head where there will be enough hair to cover the bead. Put the hook through the bead with the tinsel on it. Gather a few strands of hair that are roughly the same thickness of the strands of tinsel and catch hold of them with the hook. Draw the hook back through the bead, bringing the hair with it. [8] X Research source Avoid placing the tinsel’s bead closer than 1 inch (2.5 cm) from your regular part or hairline, so you can cover it with hair."

      "content": "Slide the bead close to your scalp and clamp it with pliers. Holding the hair taut, slide the bead up to about ½ inch (1.25 cm) from your scalp. Clamp the bead firmly in the middle and on each end with hair extension pliers . Johnson says to be patient when you’re installing microbeads. “It looks easy, but it definitely takes some practice in order to get faster and to apply them correctly.” High-quality tinsel attached with microbeads can last up to 3 months with proper care. When you’re ready to take out the microbeads, use the pliers to squeeze them in the opposite direction from how they were flattened. Once the bead is open, it will slide out of your hair easily."

      "content": "Fold the tinsel and sandwich it between 2 pieces of tape. Choose up to 20 pieces of tinsel and fold them in half so each side is the same length. Then, press them onto the sticky side of single-sided hair extension tape near the where they’re folded. [9] X Research source Johnson cautions, “It's faster to apply [tape-in extensions] but they…don't last as long as microbead extensions.” While microbeads can last for months with proper care, tape-ins only last for 6-8 weeks."

Using a pair of sharp scissors, clip off the folded part of the tinsel as close to the edge of the tape as possible [10] X Research source Place a second piece of single-sided tape with the sticky side toward the tinsel to firmly secure it to the first tape. You’ll end up with the tinsel sandwiched between 2 pieces of tape. If you want to save tape, skip adding the second piece."

      "content": "Place the tape at least ½ inch (1.25 cm) from your scalp. Secure it by sandwiching the tinsel and your hair between the original 2 pieces of tape and a new piece of tape. Cover it with a thin section of hair to hide the tape. Make sure the tape isn’t too close to your hairline or it may be visible. Johnson says, “You always need to have enough hair in the front to cover the tape-in extensions.” If you only used one piece of tape in the previous step, use extra-firm pressure at the center and each end of the tape to make sure it sticks"

Just apply the remover to the tape at the top of the tinsel. Allow it to sit for up to 2 minutes and then gently peel the tapes apart. Carefully slide them out of your hair. Refer to the directions on your remover’s packaging for a specific timeframe."

      "content": "Wash your hair gently and less often to extend the tinsel's life. Washing your hair can cause your tinsel to come out sooner, especially if you rub your scalp vigorously. The good news is you probably don’t need to wash your hair daily. Evan says, “Generally, most people do not need to wash every day. Every other day or every third is what we recommend” When you do wash your hair, lightly scrub your scalp with your fingertips to get it clean and avoid pulling your tinsel loose."

      "content": "Be careful when brushing and combing your hair. Johnson says the most important thing with any type of extension is to be gentle and don't rip on it too much. She adds, “Take care of it like it's your own hair.” Use extra care near the roots where the tinsel extensions are anchored. Use a detangler spray to avoid pulling on snags and loosening the tinsel."

      "title": "Avoid using excessive heat and apply a heat protectant.",
      "content": "Avoid using excessive heat and apply a heat protectant. Most hair tinsel is designed to withstand some level of heat. However, it’s important to protect it—and your real hair—with a heat protectant before using a blow dryer or other heat tool. And make sure to adjust the settings to your heat tools. Evan says, “Most people need to be using 280-325 degrees, not the 450-degree maximum a lot of irons offer.” Check your hair tinsel’s packaging to make sure it’s able to handle high temperatures before using a heat tool."
