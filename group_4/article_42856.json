      "content": "Strengthen phonemic awareness skills by going over letters and sounds. It’s important for kids to recognize their letters and know which sounds each letter makes before they’re able to form words. Go over each letter of the alphabet, saying its name and which sound it makes. While you can do this as a class, it’s also a good idea to do it individually with each student so you know which letters and sounds they need help with. [1] X Trustworthy Source Reading Rockets Online resource supported by PBS providing research-based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers Go to source Letter sounds include consonants, short vowels, long vowels, and digraphs. For example, when going over the letter “R,” you might say, “R makes the ‘rrrrrr’ sound, like “rat.””"

      "content": "Help students learn to decode words by sounding them out. Once your first graders know their sounds, teach them to string these sounds together when they see them to form a word. Show them how to start from the left and sound out each sound until they get to the right, completing the word. [2] X Research source Some great early decodable words include “sun,” “mom,” “has,” or “shut.” If your first graders are having trouble stringing each sound together to form the full word, encourage them to sing each sound. This helps prevent long pauses between each one."

      "title": "Practice phonics to teach your first graders important spelling patterns.",
      "content": "Practice phonics to teach your first graders important spelling patterns. There are plenty of special rules when it comes to reading where simply sounding out a word won’t work. Encourage your first graders to look at groups of letters, not just individual sounds. to Teach them special phonics rules so that they are able to recognize a written word like “bake” and know how to pronounce it. [3] X Research source ”Bake” would be an example of how a silent “e” often turns a short vowel into a long vowel. Another example of an important phonics rule might be when a syllable has 2 vowels in it, the first vowel is often long and the second is silent, such as in “rain” or “meat.”"

      "content": "Teach word families to help them learn rhyming words. Not only does this help them learn word endings much more quickly, but it teaches them that there are patterns in words and that beginning sounds can be changed to alter the meaning of words. Go over words with endings like “-un,” “-it,” or “-ap.” For example, words that end in “-un” might be run, sun, fun, bun, nun, or spun. Other word families to teach are “-ip,” “-ing,” “-ack,” and “-op.”"

      "title": "Go over sight words to encourage memorization.",
      "content": "Go over sight words to encourage memorization. Sight words, or high frequency words, are words that your first graders will encounter often. Many of them aren’t easy to sound out because they don’t follow traditional phonics rules. Make flashcards or write sight words on the board to help first graders begin to memorize these words. [4] X Research source Look for first grade sight word lists online, including words like \"learn,\" \"any,\" or \"because.\" Your first grader knows a sight word once they’re able to immediately say the word without hesitating or having to sound it out. Encourage your students to write these words and say them out loud when they’re learning them to help them remember the words more easily."

      "content": "Incorporate spelling into reading lessons whenever possible. While spelling may not seem like the most important tool to teach reading, spelling words correctly will help your first graders read the word correctly faster. Write out words that coincide with phonics rules you’re learning, or have your first grader write down words they’re having trouble reading as extra reading and writing practice. [5] X Research source Have your first graders write out each word in a word family to practice spelling and saying them. Once your first grader is able to read a sight word, instead of showing it to them, say it out loud and ask them to write it down."

      "content": "Use hands-on activities to make learning to read more interactive. While simply reading texts and going over words in print can work, getting kids more physically involved in reading will get them more excited to learn. Use foam phonics dice to create words with your first graders or pull out letter magnets to use when you’re teaching sounds. Any sort of activity that gets them moving or that they can manipulate will improve their reading skills. Give each child a handful of letter magnets and ask them to say each letter and its sound. Sing songs about phonics to help reinforce special rules that they might be struggling to remember. Write different sight words on flashcards and place them along the floor, encouraging students to hop from one word to the next once they say them correctly."

      "content": "Give first graders reading level assessments so you can choose texts for them. Before you pick out books for your first graders to read, it’s important to know which level they’re on so you’re not choosing books that are too difficult or too easy for each reader. Use a reading level assessment like Reading A-Z and then give each student texts based on their discovered reading level. [6] X Research source If you’re working with students in small groups, place students with similar reading levels in the same groups. For example, if the reading assessment you used said Johnny was on a level C, you would choose books that are on this level for him to read. If you have specific books in mind and aren’t sure what their reading level is, type the name of the book and then “reading level” into an online search engine to find out."

      "content": "Choose texts below each student’s frustration level for independent reading. When your first grader is reading by themselves, it’s important that they feel confident and able to sound out each word independently. Choose books that won’t trip them up and include words or sounds that they’re able to figure out without assistance. [7] X Trustworthy Source Reading Rockets Online resource supported by PBS providing research-based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers Go to source If students are reading independently in the classroom, you might ask them to whisper read so you can walk around and listen to them. If you're using a specific reading program, they will likely have texts for you to use that are all labeled with their reading levels. If you're not using a reading program, you might encourage your first grader to read \"Go, Dog. Go!\" by P.D. Eastman or \"Clifford the Big Red Dog\" by Norman Bridwell, though you'll want to check to ensure these books coincide with their specific reading level."

      "content": "Offer help when your first graders are reading more difficult texts. When you’re working 1-on-1 or in small groups, use texts that are a bit more challenging than the ones they would read by themselves. Go over tricky words they might encounter in the book before starting, and listen to them read these texts to help them whenever they’re struggling.

      "content": "Ask questions about the reading to help with their comprehension. As you’re reading a text aloud to students, or when they’re reading a text aloud to you, pause to ask questions about what’s happening. This teaches your first graders to pay attention to what they’re reading and understand the meaning behind each sentence, improving their comprehension skills. [9] X Research source You might ask, “Why did the fox hide in the shed?” or “How do you think that made the brother feel?” Encourage kids to ask questions throughout their reading whenever they don’t understand something."

      "content": "Read aloud to students to introduce them to new vocabulary. Children are never too old to be read to, and this is a simple way you can introduce new words and talk about comprehension with your first graders. Pick out a book that’s age appropriate and that talks about things you’re learning about as a class, such as certain phonics rules or even a holiday or event you’ve discussed. [10] X Research source Ask your first graders questions about events and characters throughout the book to keep them engaged, and explain the meaning of any tricky words. You might read books to your first graders like \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\" by Judi Barrett or \"Stand Tall, Molly Lou Melon\" by Patty Lovell."

This is a great time to listen to each of your students read to you, making note of any words they’re stumped by or how quickly or slowly they’re reading. Listen carefully as they’re reading and offer support when it’s needed. [11] X Research source Having them read to you individually is also how you’ll test their reading to see if they need to stay on the same reading level or move up."
