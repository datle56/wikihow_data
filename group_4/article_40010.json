      "content": "Find your stance. Before you can get started with snowboarding you will need to find which stance you are most comfortable with. There are two main styles of standing on the snowboard, both of which are based on your naturally preferred leading leg. Find your dominant leg and plan on using the stance that matches it. If you prefer to lead with your left leg your stance will be considered a “regular” stance. If you prefer to lead with your right leg your stance will be considered a “goofy” stance. If you have a skateboard, then the leg which you push the skateboard with will be the one that will be in the front. Think about which leg you use first when putting your pants on. Chances are that leg will be your lead leg."
