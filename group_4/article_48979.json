      "content": "Avoid the bright, flashy games—they have the worst odds. The games with the brightest lights, loudest sounds, and boldest colors – like slot machines and the Wheel of Fortune game – are meant to catch your eye and draw you in. They’re also the ones you’re least likely to win. Instead, focus your attention on the dimmer, calmer games with better odds. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose table games over the slots for better odds at winning.",
      "content": "Choose table games over the slots for better odds at winning. Slots are fun, but they statistically have much lower odds than any of the table games. Head to the blackjack, baccarat, or craps tables for better chances at winning some money. [2] X Research source If you love playing slots, set aside a smaller, specific amount of money for them. Use the rest of your money on the table games while still enjoying everything you like."

      "title": "Choose calmer craps tables to make smarter bets.",
      "content": "Choose calmer craps tables to make smarter bets. Craps tables get loud. People like to crowd around to watch the games. They get excited, and there’s a lot going on that’s very distracting while you play. If you can’t find a quiet table, try to keep your wits about you and bet on craps with a “pass line.” [3] X Research source Look up some online tutorials and virtual games to get some experience before stepping into the fast-paced atmosphere of the craps table at a casino."

      "content": "Look for a sloppy dealer in blackjack for a chance to get ahead. For better chances of winning at blackjack , try to spot a dealer who looks less experienced and handles the cards with a little less expertise than a more seasoned dealer. The chances of an inexperienced dealer accidentally flashing a card are much higher, which gives you a huge edge. [4] X Research source Seeing the face of a card dealt by a clumsy dealer is different than counting cards , which casinos frown on."

      "content": "Always start by betting with the banker to win baccarat. There are 2 sides to a baccarat game : the banker’s side and the player’s side. The banker has the highest odds of winning—it does so a little over 50% of the time. If you bet the banker and it wins, continue betting the banker until it starts to lose. [5] X Research source Baccarat is a really fast-paced game! Sometimes, the dealers get anywhere from 150-200 decisions per game, so practice playing ahead of time!"

      "title": "Look for “surrender” or “en prison” games when playing roulette.",
      "content": "Look for “surrender” or “en prison” games when playing roulette. “Surrender” and “en prison” both mean if you place an even-money bet and the ball lands on “0,” your bet moves on to the next spin rather than being lost. These options cut the house’s odds in half, so you have a greater chance of winning some money. Some roulette tables won’t offer these options, so check around for the ones that do before you start playing. [6] X Research source Choose a table with only a single-zero slot rather than both single- and double-zero slots to win at roulette . This lowers the house’s odds by about half because the percentage of the house’s edge goes from about 5.25% to 2.7%."

      "content": "Avoid side bets because they have much lower odds than regular bets. A side bet is placed in addition to regular blackjack betting. They usually involve trying to predict which cards the player or dealer will receive. Side bets have much higher payouts than the regular 2:1 on most blackjack games. However, the house edge is significantly higher at 10-20% versus a house edge of 2% or lower on regular blackjack bets. [8] X Research source Conventional blackjack strategies don’t work with side bets, which are mostly a game of chance."

Then, bring that set amount of cash with you and leave the casino once it’s gone. [10] X Research source This helps you win by reducing your chances of losing more and more money. Also, if you know you have a limited amount of funds, you’ll be more choosy when deciding which games to play and what bets to make. If you’re going to the casino several days in a row, try putting your allotted gambling money into a separate envelope for each day. That way, you won’t accidentally start using money that’s meant for the end of the week on a Monday!"

      "content": "Learn the layout of a casino by visiting during the day. Casinos are designed to be disorienting—there are no clocks or windows, and the games are set in a maze-like pattern. Casino owners do this because it makes it easier for you to lose track of time. The longer you play, the more likely the house will win all your money. Take a trip to the casino during the daytime and take a look around when you aren’t distracted by the hustle and bustle of nighttime gambling. [11] X Research source Use this time to watch different games to help you decide which ones you’d like to play. An added bonus of visiting when it’s less busy is the dealer has more time to give you a breakdown of the technical aspects as you watch the game."

      "content": "Stay hydrated and don't consume too much alcohol. You’re likely to spend more money and pay less attention to the games when you drink too much alcohol, which is easy if the casino offers free drinks. If you’re going to imbibe, try to pace yourself by having a glass of water between each alcoholic drink. [12] X Research source It’s tempting to drink a lot of free complementary beverages—but remember, casinos offer so much free alcohol because they’re calculating how much money they’re winning every day from tipsy people losing their games."

Remember, the odds are always in the house’s favor! So, set a time limit of 2-4 hours, then call it quits when your time is up. If you’ve won money, that’s great! If not, take a break and come back refreshed the next day. [13] X Research source If you have a budget and still have money left when your timer goes off, transfer the money over to the next day’s budget."

However, casinos are designed to keep you there after you win, so they have a chance to win their money back. Experts suggest cashing out and walking away after you’ve won. [14] X Research source However, don’t use losing as an excuse to keep playing. Once you hit your budget for the day, leave the casino. Some casinos will even start offering you free things: a room for the night, meals, and gifts to convince you to stay and play. It’s okay to accept the gifts (because who doesn’t want a complimentary room for the night?)—just remember to leave the gambling area!"

Casino games are random by design, and just because a machine hasn’t paid out in a while doesn’t mean it’s “due” for a big win. They’re fun to play, but there’s no guarantee you’ll ever win! There are no strategies that give you a better mathematical edge without resorting to illegal activity.

      "content": "Why do they say the house always wins? When you gamble in a casino, the odds are heavily stacked against you. The games have a built-in “house edge” (the profit taken from each bet) that ranges from 1-2% up to 35%. The odds of losing go up for table games the more inexperienced you are. Casinos also use psychology to keep you in the casino and playing. They go out of their way to make you comfortable and unaware of the passage of time. The longer you play, the better the odds the house will get any money you win back…and then some. [17] X Research source In the end, a casino is a business. They exist to make money, or they wouldn’t be open."

      "content": "What game has the best odds at casinos? Table games like blackjack, craps, and roulette have the best odds at casinos. These types of games can be intimidating to beginners, which causes them to gravitate to the slot machines. However, blackjack is one of the easiest games in the casino to play, and the house edge is as low as 1% at most casinos. [18] X Research source The game with the second-best odds of winning is craps, where you have about an even chance of winning. All you have to do is bet on a dice roll…and remember to avoid side bets. The roulette wheel is another simple game with relatively good odds. Just remember, even with these games, the house still has a slight edge."

In addition to tips like practicing the games, sticking with a budget, and keeping a clear head, make sure you’re aware of any bonus requirements and VIP benefits the online casino offers. [19] X Research source Avoid scammy or otherwise shady gambling websites by looking for an eCOGRA certificate. eCOGRA regulates and evaluates online casinos to ensure they’re secure for players. Look for online casinos licensed by reputable organizations like the UK Gambling Commission, the Malta Gaming Authority, or the Gibraltar Gambling Commission."
