[13] X Research source The limit is $250,000 a day for ACH transfers initiated by a bank, title company, or some other financial institution. This is the standard withdrawal limit among basically all brokerages because $250,000 is the maximum amount insurable by the FDIC, so banks are hesitant to move more than that amount at a time. [14] X Research source If you need to move more than $250,000, you’ll need to do it over the course of multiple days.

However, there's no limit on the number of times you can withdraw using these methods in a 24-hour period.

      "content": "Taxable Investing Accounts Taxable brokerage accounts are probably the most common option among Robinhood users. These are investing accounts where you can buy and sell stocks and bonds, but any capital gains are taxable at the end of the tax year. There are two types of taxable accounts—cash and margin. [16] X Research source Cash Accounts: These are taxable investing accounts where you can only use the money you deposit to invest. Funds are subject to settlement periods, and you cannot trade options on these accounts. Are there fees for withdrawing cash? No. You can freely transfer funds in or out of a Robinhood taxable account if you do a traditional bank-to-bank ACH transfer. Can I transfer my holdings? Yes, but you’ll need to pay a $100 fee. [17] X Research source Margin Accounts: These are taxable investing accounts that get around settlement issues via margin—funds you borrow from Robinhood for a small fee. This is the most popular account type for active traders. Are there fees for withdrawing cash? No, but you may be charged if you withdraw more cash than you’re supposed to. You must hold a certain amount of cash in your margin account to cover any margin calls. Contact Robinhood at 1-650-761-7789 to have them take a closer look at your account. [18] X Research source Can I transfer my holdings? Yes, but you’ll still need to pay a $100 fee.

Robinhood only offers Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), which allow you to invest for retirement. Withdrawing or transferring funds out of a retirement account can trigger serious tax events and penalties, so don't withdraw without checking the rules first. [20] X Research source Traditional IRAs: Traditional IRAs tax the funds when they’re withdrawn after retirement and reduce your taxable income when you fund them. You can only upload $7,000 a year to a traditional IRA. Are there fees for withdrawing cash? No, but if you withdraw the cash, there will be taxes and penalties. Can I transfer my holdings? Only if you roll them over to another traditional IRA or 401(k) plan. There may be rollover fees at the brokerage you send your account to. Key Notes: Instead of withdrawing anything, consider rolling the entire account over if you want to keep it at another brokerage. Roth IRAs: Roth IRAs are the opposite of traditional IRAs regarding when the funds are taxed. Roth IRA funds are taxed on the way into the account, but whatever grows inside that account grows tax-free. It also won’t be subject to capital gains when you withdraw. Are there fees for withdrawing cash? No. However, you can only withdraw the initial deposits into the account. You cannot withdraw more than the total deposits, or you’ll trigger IRS penalties.

This is called T+1 or T+2 (trading day + 1 day/2 day). It’s a regulatory issue, so there’s no way around it. Robinhood must wait for all your funds to settle before converting them to transferable cash. [25] X Research source What if I have a margin account? Margin accounts ignore T+1 or T+2 when it comes to using the funds inside the account. But if you’re withdrawing money, everything must settle like normal first.

Most brokerages don’t charge you money to rollover a retirement fund, but Robinhood does appear to have this language in their policies. Robinhood uses an Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS) to move specific shares of stock, bonds, or ETFs to other institutions. It charges a $100 fee for this service, regardless of whether you’re moving everything in your account or just a handful of shares. [29] X Research source Pro tip: Call the brokerage where you’re transferring your holdings. Explain that you’d love to move over to their platform, but you can’t afford the $100 fee Robinhood wants to charge. The other brokerage will probably cover the fee for you in exchange for your business. To highlight how common this is, Robinhood does it !"
