      "title": "Leave the husks on.",
      "content": "Leave the husks on. The husks help keep the corn moist and fresh. If you peel the husks before storing, you run the risk of the corn drying out. Try to not even peel the tips of the husks back. [1] X Research source Use your corn in a day or two if you've already removed the husks. To buy corn without peeling the husks back, start by looking for corn that has green husks and moist corn silk sticking out. The cob should feel firm all the way from top to bottom. Check for tiny holes, which indicate the corn has worms. If you must peel the husk, only do a little bit at the top to see if the kernels go all the way to the end. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Place them in a sealed plastic bag. Do not wash the corn first. Place them in a large zip-top bag, and seal it up with as little air as possible. Set the bag in the vegetable drawer of your refrigerator. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Cook within a week.",
      "content": "Cook within a week. Your corn will start go bad after about 5 days to a week. However, for the freshest, sweetest corn, it's best to cook it sooner rather than later, as it tends to lose flavor and moisture over time. Aim to cook it in 3 days if possible. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Check for freshness.",
      "content": "Check for freshness. Corn will start to mold at the tip first. If you see a dark or moldy end, you can cut off the end plus 1 inch (2.5 cm). However, if the whole cob looks moldy, you should throw it out instead of eating it. [5] X Research source Moldy corn typically turns dark and the kernels shrivel. You may also see fuzzy growth on the corn that is white or blue."

      "title": "Remove the husks.",
      "content": "Remove the husks . When freezing corn, you will need to remove the husks. That's because you usually either blanch it or cut it off the husk before freezing. Plus, frozen husks are difficult to pull off corn. [6] X Research source Frozen corn will keep up to a year."

      "title": "Blanch and freeze whole ears to keep the corn on the cob.",
      "content": "Blanch and freeze whole ears to keep the corn on the cob. To blanch whole ears, place them boil in water for 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the size of the ears. Pull them out of the water and plunge them in ice water immediately for about 30 seconds or so. Drain the extra water off. [7] X Research source Place the corn in freezer bags or airtight containers and freeze. If using a bag, squeeze out as much air as you can before zipping it shut. You can cook them for less time if you prefer. Cooking them for less time makes for crunchier corn when you pull them out of the freezer."

      "content": "Blanch and freeze kernels for an easier defrosting process. Blanch the whole ears in boiling water. Plunge them into boiling water for 2 1/2 minutes. You can cook them a bit longer if you prefer. Pull them out, and plunge them into ice water. Drain the excess water off. [8] X Research source Use a knife to slice off the kernels. Place the kernels in freezer bags or airtight containers to freeze. Squeeze out excess air when using bags."

You can also simply zap both blanched and raw corn in the microwave until it's warm enough to eat. [10] X Research source Use the defrost setting on your microwave. Enter the pounds in weight for your corn. If you're not sure of the weight, check the corn after 2 minutes."

Keeping the air out of the corn will keep it fresher, so squeeze as much air out of the zip-top bag as you can. [11] X Research source"

Once you cook it, you have an additional 3 to 5 days to eat past the original expiration date. Still, you should aim to eat it in 5 days at most when you keep it in the refrigerator. [13] X Research source If the corn has a funny odor or it has grown mold, it's time to toss it. You can reheat corn in the microwave. Start with a minute, and then check to see if it needs more time."
