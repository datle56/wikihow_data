      "content": "Avoid popping the blood blister to prevent infection. The skin covering the blister stops germs from entering the wound, so don't be tempted to drain your blood blister. Instead, put on a bandage or apply a piece of moleskin over the blister to protect it if you're worried that you'll accidentally pop it.

      "content": "Spread a light layer of antibiotic cream over the wound. Rinse the popped blood blister with cool water—there's no need to use soap, hydrogen peroxide, or alcohol since they can slow down healing. [4] X Research source When your blood blister pops or tears, it opens the way for germs and bacteria to get into the wound. To prevent infection, gently apply a thin layer of antibiotic cream onto your skin. [5] X Research source Alternatively, you could use petroleum jelly, which acts as a barrier and prevents the bandage from sticking to the blister. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Cover the popped blood blister with a bandage.",
      "content": "Cover the popped blood blister with a bandage. Don't peel or tear off the flap of skin over the blister. Once it's clean, smooth it back over your skin and put the bandage over it. Although standard bandages work, a cushioned bandage provides more protection. [7] X Research source Place a donut-shaped piece of moleskin around the blister before you put on the bandage if the blister is in a spot that will have things rub up against it."

      "content": "Blood blisters heal within 1 to 2 weeks. Although your blood blister is tender and large at first, it gradually gets smaller as the fluid inside the blister dries up. The whole healing process usually finishes within a couple of weeks. [8] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source Try to stay off of your blood blister so you're not putting pressure on it, which could cause it to burst. If your blood blister is on your feet, elevate your feet whenever possible."

      "title": "Call your doctor if the blister doesn't heal or it looks infected.",
      "content": "Call your doctor if the blister doesn't heal or it looks infected. If you've got an infection, the blister might feel painful or it will swell up instead of shrink. The skin around the blister will look red or feel warm—you may even see streaks of red leading away from the blister. Oozing pus or fever are other telltale signs of infection, so don't hesitate to call your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. [9] X Research source To treat an infection, your doctor might prescribe oral antibiotics. For a more serious infection, they may use intravenous antibiotics."

If you've got a blood blister on your mouth, eye, or heel, for instance, ask your doctor if they recommend draining it. In some cases, if it's hard to go about your daily activities, they might suggest coming in to drain, treat, and bandage the wound."

      "content": "Blood blisters can form when your skin gets pinched. Usually, blood blisters form on your fingers or toes because it's easy for these to get pinched in a hinge or closing door. Blood blisters are pretty noticeable—you'll see a tender, raised pocket of a blister, but it's dark red or purple instead of clear. [10] X Research source Most blood blisters form within a few minutes of getting your skin caught or pinched."

      "content": "Minimize friction to prevent blood blisters. If you frequently get blood blisters in the same spots like on your feet, apply talc-free powder or wear thicker socks. If socks aren't an option, add padding directly to your shoes so they don't rub against and pinch your skin. [11] X Research source"
