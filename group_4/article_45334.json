      "content": "Cleft chin A cleft chin typically features a dimple in the center of the chin, sometimes with a vertical cleft running down the center of the chin. Cleft chins are genetic and form when the two sides of your jaw fuse together in the womb. The truth is that everyone has a cleft in their chin, it's just that some are more visible than others.

      "content": "Double chin While it's true that many people who have a double chin are overweight, that's not necessarily always the case. Some people just genetically have a softer jawline than others and are therefore more likely to store fat around their chin, even if they're relatively slim. You might consider a double chin unattractive, but it generally doesn't affect the functioning of your jaw or cause any other health issues.

      "content": "Weak or receding chin Retrognathia is the official term for a receding chin, often called a weak chin. Basically, your lower jaw sits back further than your upper jaw so, over time, your chin starts to recede back toward your neck. While there's no danger in having a receding chin, it can lead to other medical problems, including jaw pain and sleep apnea.

      "title": "Protruding chin",
      "content": "Protruding chin A protruding chin is essentially the opposite of a weak chin. Here, your jaws are out of alignment, but this time, it's the upper jaw that sits back further than the lower one. As a result, your chin juts out past the level of your lips. Prognathism (the medical term for a protruding chin) doesn't typically cause any major health issues, but it can cause speech and chewing difficulties. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Distinctive feature: chin is the most prominent part of the lower face A protruding chin is primarily genetic, but can be exacerbated by lifestyle factors, (including thumb-sucking as a child).

People with a rounder face shape are more likely to have a round chin, as well as people who are carrying a little extra weight.
