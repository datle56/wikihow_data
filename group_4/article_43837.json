      "title": "Attach the loop at the end of the hand line to your left wrist.",
      "content": "Attach the loop at the end of the hand line to your left wrist. Cinch the hand loop down nice and tight to make sure it’s secure and to prevent it from slipping off your wrist when you throw. The last thing you want to do is to toss your expensive cast net right into the deep! Most cast nets come with adjustable hand loops which make it possible to get a snug yet comfortable fit for any wrist. If the net you’re using doesn’t have an adjustable hand loop, arrange the loop so that the hand line is pointing toward the ground."

    {
      "title": "Loop the hand line into 12–18 in (30–46 cm) coils over your left hand.",
      "content": "Loop the hand line into 12–18 in (30–46 cm) coils over your left hand. Wrap the line across your palm and let it fall loosely over the back of your hand a few times. The exact number of coils you make will vary depending on the size of the net you’re using—shorter lines, of course, will have fewer coils. [1] X Research source It’s important not to wind the coils too tight or the net may not deploy properly when you release it. Generally speaking, the smaller the net is, the easier it will be to handle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grip the horn of the net with your left hand.",
      "content": "Grip the horn of the net with your left hand. The horn (sometimes known as the “yoke”) is the uppermost portion of the net where the small metal ring connects to the hand line. Holding onto the horn will allow you to drape the net in preparation for your throw. [2] X Research source At this point, the hand loop, the coiled hand line, and the horn should all be in your left hand. You’re just using your right hand to get the net’s various components into position."
    },
    {
      "title": "Align the upper portion of the net with the coiled hand line.",
      "content": "Align the upper portion of the net with the coiled hand line. Bunch the fabric of the net up with your right hand, then cradle the bundled net in your palm. Allow the rest of the net to hang straight down towards the deck. [3] X Research source Be careful not to let the net shift once you've got it lined up with the coiled hand line."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gather the remaining net at its midpoint with your right hand.",
      "content": "Gather the remaining net at its midpoint with your right hand. Take hold of the net halfway between the horn and the “skirt” of leaded weights at the bottom. Be sure to straighten out the net as you pass it into your right hand and keep it from twisting. [4] X Research source Before going further, confirm that the horn is resting just outside your left hand and that the weights of the skirt are on the deck directly below your right hand. You’re effectively splitting the net in half to make it more manageable and get it into position for the throw."
    },
    {
      "title": "Transfer the section of net from your right hand to your left palm.",
      "content": "Transfer the section of net from your right hand to your left palm. As you do this, the net will form another loop hanging outside the coiled hand line. At this point, you should be holding the entire net in your left hand. [5] X Research source Double-check that the two sections of net you’re holding in your left hand aren’t crossing over one another. This could cause them to become twisted. It's okay for the lead weights around the skirt to either be resting on the deck or hovering just above."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the lead line at the bottom of the hanging skirt between your teeth.",
      "content": "Place the lead line at the bottom of the hanging skirt between your teeth. Reach down with your right hand and grab a clean, unweighted section of the line. Then clamp it between your teeth. It may sound strange, but it’s the most efficient way to keep the skirt in the right position and is the standard technique for throwing a cast net. [6] X Research source If you don’t like the idea of sticking a muddy lead line in your mouth, you can also throw it over your shoulder. Arrange the skirt so that the two halves are perfectly centered to make sure it doesn’t slip off. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Grip the portion of the lead line dangling from your teeth or shoulder.",
      "content": "Grip the portion of the lead line dangling from your teeth or shoulder. Lift the line with the inside of your free hand, letting it rest in the crease of your fingers. Doing so will open up the skirt, ensuring that it expands as you release the net. Some nets have small colored tabs on the bottom of the skirt that make it easier to know exactly where to place your hands."

    {
      "title": "Take hold of the net 2–3 feet (0.61–0.91 m) below your left hand.",
      "content": "Take hold of the net 2–3 feet (0.61–0.91 m) below your left hand. Bunch the net tightly in your fist. You’ll now have the weight of the net divided evenly between your left and right hands, ready to launch. [8] X Research source To avoid throwing off your accuracy or distance, try not to alter your grip once you have the net in position."

    {
      "title": "Twist 90-120 degrees at the waist to initiate the throw.",
      "content": "Twist 90-120 degrees at the waist to initiate the throw. Rotate your shoulders, chest, and hips to the left (counterclockwise), then reverse the motion quickly to turn back to the right (clockwise). Prepare to let go of the net once your upper body is facing your target. [9] X Research source Keep your toes pointed toward the intended landing zone throughout your entire throw to enhance your aim and help you guide the net as it leaves your hands. [10] X Research source Bend your knees and drop your weight slightly. Lowering your center of gravity will make you less likely to lose your balance."

    {
      "title": "Release the net and allow its own weight to carry it out of your hands.",
      "content": "Release the net and allow its own weight to carry it out of your hands. At the moment you let go, whip your arms straight out in front of you and spread your fingers wide. Try to time your release by “feeling” when the net has built up full momentum. [11] X Research source Rather than trying to fling the net as far as you can using brute force, let it sail away on its own. The leaded weights around the skirt and horn are there for precisely this reason. [12] X Research source Throwing a cast net is similar to swinging a golf club—the easier and more natural your motion is, the better the outcome will be."

      "title": "Wait for the net to fan out and sink to the bottom of the water.",
      "content": "Wait for the net to fan out and sink to the bottom of the water. This will happen quickly thanks to the heavy weights around the skirt. Any baitfish that happen to be swimming in the immediate vicinity will be trapped under the net. Avoid tugging on the hand line (even by accident) until the net has completely settled."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reel in the net by hand.",
      "content": "Reel in the net by hand. Once the net is laying at the bottom of the body of water you’re fishing, proceed to pull it towards you hand-over-hand using the hand line which should still be attached to your left wrist via the hand loop. As you do, the weighted end will close up. The reward for your patience and dexterity will be of a whole mess of baitfish! [13] X Research source Take your time retrieving your net. If you try to rush it, you may lose control, and lose your baitfish as a result."
