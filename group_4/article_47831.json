      "content": "Rock this classic look with a clean pair of jeans for an easy style. A well-fitting T-shirt shows her your physique without looking too skintight. While graphic tees might make you look a little more immature, a plain solid-colored shirt makes you look more put together and ready to date. Experiment with a few different colors to see what makes you look and feel the best. [1] X Research source For a really simple style, put on a white T-shirt with some khaki pants. If it’s a little chillier outside, layer up with a simple jean or leather jacket, cardigan, or flannel shirt. When it comes to T-shirts (or basically any garment), the most important thing is the fit . As Sharp confirms, “no matter what your body type is, fit is one of the most important things. When you wear clothing that fits your body properly, it will cause less distractions and it shows that you actually put in the effort to take care of yourself and care about the way you present yourself.” [2] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. To find the T-shirt that fits you best, check if the shoulder seams align with your shoulder bone, the collar lays right on your collar bones, the sleeve hits at mid-bicep, and the rest of the shirt fits straight through your upper body.

      "content": "Look more athletic by pairing your top with other activewear. If it’s nice and warm outside, find a tank top that hugs your body tight so the ladies can see your muscles underneath. Stick with solid colors or simple patterns rather than graphic styles to seem a bit more mature. Try putting on a pair of joggers , athletic shorts, or jeans with your favorite pair of sneakers to really complete a sporty look. [4] X Research source If you want to have a more beachy vibe, wear your favorite tank top with a nice pair of shorts and some sandals. Keep in mind that a tank top is a more casual look—if you’re meeting a woman for a dinner date or other event where you want to make a good first impression, you may want to opt for something different."

      "title": "Henleys work well for casual or formal looks.",
      "content": "Henleys work well for casual or formal looks. Henleys are made from a comfortable blend of woven fabrics, and they usually have a rounded button-up collar. A lot of guys don’t wear henleys , so rocking one can make you stand out among the crowd. You can get them in a ton of different colors with either short or long sleeves. [5] X Research source Pair a henley with a pair of khakis or jeans and some dress shoes for an outfit that works no matter where you’re going. If you want to rock a layered look, try putting on a patterned blazer or a denim jacket over your henley. A red henley with jeans, a belt, and some nice brown loafers make a really striking outfit. During warmer months, try a short-sleeved henley with shorts or just roll up the sleeves on long-sleeved shirts."

      "content": "Soft flannels are the perfect cold-weather staple for your wardrobe. They usually come in plaid or checkered patterns, but you can get solid colors too if you want a simpler style. For a really classic look, put on a red-checkered flannel over a plain white tee with your favorite pair of jeans or khakis. Complete your look with a pair of your favorite boots or tennis shoes. If you want a layered look, try putting a plain black cardigan or sweater over your flannel. Leave your flannel untucked so the bottom of the shirt sticks out. Try rolling up your sleeves to show off your forearms and stay cool when it gets a bit warmer. If it’s a bit chilly, throw on a beanie or comfortable hat for a really cozy vibe."

      "content": "Dressier collared shirts pair well with dress pants or jeans. Choose some dress shirts that fit you well without looking baggy or bunched up. You can rock a short-sleeved button-up without an undershirt with some shorts and slip-on shoes in the warmer months. When it’s a bit colder or if you need a more formal look , opt for a simple long-sleeved button-up with a plain undershirt. [6] X Research source Tuck your shirt in and wear a nice belt for a really put-together style. Dress up your button-up with a skinny tie or a nice blazer to really complete your look. For a slightly more casual look that women love, roll up the sleeves of your dress shirt so that they end at the midpoint of your forearm. This look really shows off your arms and accentuates your shoulders!"

      "content": "A sweater works great for both formal and relaxed looks. Pick a crew-neck style for a really cozy tight fit, or rock a V-neck sweater if you want to accentuate your jawline. If you want a sweater that goes with most outfits, try wearing colors like navy blue, grey, olive green, or black. You can wear whatever shirt you want underneath so you stay warm. [7] X Research source Layer a red V-neck sweater on top of a button-up shirt with a pair of khakis and boots for a really professional look. Depending on your style, you can stick with sweaters that fit your body well rather than oversized baggy styles that hide your muscles. However, some women love a chunky knit sweater on a man and find that cozy look to be more endearing!"

      "content": "A jacket is the finishing piece to show off your personality and style. There are so many different types of jackets out there, but each one can say something to women about who you are: a leather jacket is a must-have if you’re trying to go for the “bad boy” look, while a blazer is a great start to looking a bit more put together and showing a woman that you can dress up a regular outfit. [8] X Research source For a really classic look, rock a black leather jacket, plain white t-shirt, and some skinny jeans with boots. Complete your look with some sunglasses to make yourself a little more mysterious. If you want to look a little professional but a suit is a little overboard, just put on a blazer or sport coat instead. For a really clean appearance, stick to a dark solid-colored blazer so you can pair it with any shirt or pants. If you want to be a little bolder, opt for a loud color or fun pattern and texture to make you stand out. Most crucially, pick a jacket that looks and feels good on you. When it comes to what women want, they’ll like to see that you have your own sense of style and can pull off more than just a simple T-shirt and jeans. When choosing your perfect jacket, Sharp recommends \"looking for more interesting patterns…because you want [the jacket] to stand on its own…Also, think about if you are wearing it for a more business casual setting or a more formal setting. Think about it in the functional sense as well—do you get overheated a lot? Then, you may want to wear a half-lined or unlined sport coat versus [a heavier jacket].\" [9] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021."

      "content": "A tailored suit is perfect if you want to look suave and professional. Women think men in suits are really sexy and put-together, but save dressing up for the most formal occasions. When you get a suit , make sure it fits your body really well to show off your physique. For a really timeless style, opt for a charcoal or black suit with a simple white button-up and colored tie underneath. [10] X Research source Complete the look of your suit with a nice clean pair of dress shoes and a professional-looking watch. When it comes to buttoning a suit jacket, Sharp advises that “you always want to button the top button and leave the other buttons unbuttoned. On a one-button and a two-button, you’d only button the top button. On a three-button, you button the top two and leave the bottom one unbuttoned.” [11] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021."

      "title": "A pair of dark- or medium-wash jeans that fit you well will always look good.",
      "content": "A pair of dark- or medium-wash jeans that fit you well will always look good. Opt for a classic blue denim to give off more of a trendy, vintage style, or go for darker-colored pants for some more versatility. You can’t go wrong with a classic white T-shirt and jeans with a pair of sneakers, but a button-up or henley is also perfect if you want to dress up your look a little bit more. [12] X Research source Make sure your pants fit well without getting too wrinkled or baggy. If the legs are a little too long, cuff them by your ankle to draw some attention to your shoes. Jeans come in a variety of fits, like slim-fit, skinny, or boot-cut, so try on a few different pairs to see what you like best. Also try out different waist heights, like high-rise, mid-rise, and low-rise. According to Sharp, fit is the thing that men struggle with the most when it comes to style. Per Sharp’s advice, men “need to be thinking about finding brands and stores that carry clothing that actually fits their body type—no matter who they are. Not all brands are created equal. So, they really need to find stores and brands that carry clothing that fits their build and body type.” [13] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. If you’re not sure how to find the right jeans for you, consider scheduling an appointment with a style consultant in your area."

      "content": "Women see a pair of tailored pants and know you have your life together. While we all love a good pair of classic denims, it’s best to have a few different bottoms options in your closet for different occasions. Consider a pair of dress pants , slacks, or khakis. Most of these pant styles work well for both relaxed formal and casual looks, but they can also be dressed up for a more professional style. [14] X Research source Most importantly, make sure that your pants fit you well. Ideally, get your pants tailored to fit you perfectly so that they aren’t too tight or baggy. The ladies will be impressed by your attention to detail—plus, your pants are guaranteed to look amazing! Then, try mixing and matching a few different shirts and styles to see what really works best with what you have in your closet. Tuck a button-up shirt into a pair of slacks , and put on a dark brown belt and boots to complete a dressy outfit. Or, rock your khakis with your favorite tee or henley and a pair of sneakers if you want something a little more relaxed."

      "title": "A clean and classic pair of shoes can really complete any outfit.",
      "content": "A clean and classic pair of shoes can really complete any outfit. In most cases, women like to see nice sneakers or boots on a man they’re interested in—avoid sandals unless the activity calls for it (e.g., a beach date or waterfall hike). Even if you aren’t the most athletic, you can rock sneakers with pretty much any style. If you want a really versatile pair, choose plain white or black shoes so you can pair them with jeans, shorts, or any other clothes in your closet. [15] X Research source If you want to be really bold, try finding a pair of sneakers that match the color of your shirt to add another pop of color to your wardrobe. Lace-up boots work well for casual or formal outfits. Boots look their best when you style them with a clean pair of pants. For a more casual style , wear your boots with a pair of jeans and keep the laces a little looser. If you want to look a little more professional, tie up your boots and cuff the legs of your pants above your ankle to really show them off. [16] X Research source Try out a few different boot colors to see what you like best. Darker brown boots look really great with khakis, while black boots are super stylish with a pair of dark-wash jeans."

      "content": "Complete a dressy look with a plain, textured tie. Ties work well with any button-up shirt with a collar. Even though there are a lot of fun patterns and quirky styles you could try, nothing beats a simple colored tie to complete your look. Try wearing a red tie if you want a bold and confident look, or go for a more muted color if you don’t want to stand out as much. [17] X Research source A must-have accessory is a nice metal tie bar to keep your tie from moving around or getting messed up. While a solid-colored tie is a good go-to to have in your closet, Sharp actually recommends choosing your tie based on your personality and the other components of your outfit. The tie, says Sharp, “is the place where [you] put in a little more personality and go for something more fun and more bold. Obviously, if you’re a conservative guy…then you can hold back on color and pattern a bit.” [18] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. “I would think about how the tie matches with the other components of your outfit,” continues Sharp. “So, if you’re wearing something busy, for example, like a shirt with a busy pattern, then your tie should be more subtle or something that’s very nondescript.” [19] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. Conversely, Sharp goes on to say, “if you’re wearing a solid shirt, then you can go a little more bold in the tie with a bold pattern or busier pattern. You don’t want to mix too many patterns when thinking about your tie, and it really should pull in some of the other colors that are in your suit or shirt.” [20] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021."

      "content": "Adding a timepiece to your outfit makes it look more complete. A nice metal watch can make you look more mature and put together, and women love that in a guy. You can wear your watch with any type of outfit, but it really helps accentuate the looks of a suit, button-up shirt and dress pants, or sweater. [21] X Research source Women typically find dressier watches more attractive than sports or casual watches. When picking out your own watch, however, base it off of your style. “Are you more of a tech person or are you more vintage and antique?” asks Sharp. “When you think about a watch and the actual style that you would go with, it really does depend on your overall personal style.” [22] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. You may also want to consider what statement (if any) you’re trying to make with your watch. “For example,” Sharp offers, “if you’re wearing a Rolex versus a Fossil watch, that’s actually communicating to somebody how you’re investing in your overall appearance, style, and image. So, it’s communicating different things depending on what type of watch you invest in.” [23] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021."

This hybrid underwear style combines the revealing and flattering fit of a men’s brief with the shape of a classic boxer. The boxer brief combination gives you the best of both worlds—you won’t be overly exposed but will still be looking good, plus you’ll feel comfortable and well-supported. [24] X Research source Keep in mind that underwear is a highly personal choice—some shapes and types work better on different body types.

      "content": "Ultimately, women love men who have a developed sense of style. When you’re picking out your outfits, the most important thing is that they fit you and show off your taste and personality—but whatever that is, you should have put some thought in it. Thought and attention to detail when it comes to style is what’s really most attractive to women, regardless of what specific item of clothing you’re wearing. [26] X Research source After all, women are more socialized than men to learn about how things fit, what colors look good on them, how to coordinate the different components of their outfit, and how to develop a style aesthetic. When we’re talking about attracting the “female gaze,” women are more likely to notice and appreciate the fact that you know how to put together an outfit. “Think about your style as your personal reflection or personality,” advises Sharp. “What are the words that come to mind when you think about how you want people to perceive you? Do you want to come across as attractive or smart or powerful?” [27] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. Then, Sharp continues, “you have to create a style that reflects that. Create a signature look for yourself and make sure it reflects your personality. Also, think about what’s going to help you stand out versus look like everybody else….Think about stepping outside of your comfort zone a bit—try new colors, new patterns, different styles, and different silhouettes. Don’t be afraid to take a little risk with your style.” [28] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021."
