      "content": "Determine which variable you need to isolate. Isolating a variable means getting the variable on one side of an equation by itself. This information should be given to you, or you can figure it out based on what information you know you will be given. [2] X Research source For example, you might be told to solve the area of a triangle formula for h {\\displaystyle h} . Or, you might know that you have the area and base of the triangle, so you need to solve for the height. So, you need to rearrange the formula and isolate the h {\\displaystyle h} variable."

This ensures that your equation remains true, and in the process you are moving variables from one side to the other as needed. For example, to solve the area of a triangle formula ( A = 1 2 b h {\\displaystyle A={\\frac {1}{2}}bh} ) for h {\\displaystyle h} : Cancel the fraction by multiplying each side by 2: A × 2 = 2 × 1 2 b h {\\displaystyle A\\times 2=2\\times {\\frac {1}{2}}bh} 2 A = b h {\\displaystyle 2A=bh} Isolate h {\\displaystyle h} by dividing each side by b {\\displaystyle b} : 2 A b = b h b {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2A}{b}}={\\frac {bh}{b}}} 2 A b = h {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2A}{b}}=h} Rearrange the formula, if desired: h = 2 A b {\\displaystyle h={\\frac {2A}{b}}}"

[5] X Research source For example, you might have the equation of a line 3 x + 2 y = 4 {\\displaystyle 3x+2y=4} . This is in standard form. If you need to find the y-intercept of the line, you need to rearrange the formula to slope-intercept form by isolating the y {\\displaystyle y} variable: [6] X Research source Subtract 3 x {\\displaystyle 3x} from both sides of the equation: 3 x + 2 y − 3 x = 4 − 3 x {\\displaystyle 3x+2y-3x=4-3x} 2 y = 4 − 3 x {\\displaystyle 2y=4-3x} . Divide both sides by 2 {\\displaystyle 2} : 2 y 2 = 4 − 3 x 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2y}{2}}={\\frac {4-3x}{2}}} y = 4 − 3 x 2 {\\displaystyle y={\\frac {4-3x}{2}}}"

If you are changing an equation to slope-intercept or standard form, rearrange the variables, coefficients, and constants so that they follow the correct formula. [7] X Research source For example, to change y = 4 − 3 x 2 {\\displaystyle y={\\frac {4-3x}{2}}} to the correct slope-intercept formula, you need to switch the order of the number in the numerator, then simplify: y = − 3 x + 4 2 {\\displaystyle y={\\frac {-3x+4}{2}}} y = − 3 2 x + 2 {\\displaystyle y={\\frac {-3}{2}}x+2} Now, since the formula is in proper slope-intercept form, it is easy to identify the y-intercept as 2."
