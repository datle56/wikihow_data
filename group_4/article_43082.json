If he doesn't, don't despair, you have a chance to change his mind, or not. Obviously, if he's seeing someone else, you need to move on, at least for the time being. But if he doesn't yet have feelings for you, there's still plenty of room to be friendly and flirt. [1] X Expert Source Cher Gopman Dating Coach Expert Interview. 17 May 2019. Here are some ways to learn about a guy before you approach him: Ask around about him. If you're shy, ask a good friend to help find out if he likes you, or is dropping hints. If you know for a fact that he likes you, you can afford to be a little bolder. Look for hints he may drop. If a guy likes you , he tends to go out of his way to be with you. (This is not always true, but often a good indicator.) He'll make excuses to sit next to you, be at social events you're at, and may even start to hang out with your friends. Keep an eye out! If you catch him staring at you, look him in the eyes and try to hold contact for a few seconds. If he keeps contact, you know he likes you back. If he turns away, it could mean he likes you and is shy. Beware, however, as there is more than one reason for people to stare at each other. You may have spinach in your teeth!"

This just means being on friendly terms, knowing a little about each other, and beginning to develop a more intimate familiarity. This is also a good chance to learn more about a guy - this new information may influence whether you want to tell him you like him or not. Here's some ways to start friendly conversations: [2] X Research source You may want to start a conversation about something that will flatter him. A great conversation starter is something that makes him feel good about himself. Try: \"That was a great football game you played in last Friday. I was in the stands watching with my friend. How long have you been playing?\" \"You're always at the top of the class in English exams. Can you read every teacher's mind, or just [English teacher's name]?\" \"That hairstyle really suits you. Did you get a haircut recently?\""

A great conversation starter is talking about things you can potentially do together (this doesn't necessarily have to be something you share the same interests in - the boy might eventually enjoy it if he is doing it with you). That way you both feel more comfortable. [3] X Expert Source Cher Gopman Dating Coach Expert Interview. 17 May 2019. Here are just a few conversation-starting examples: \"Hey, do you know what the math homework is? I left my planner in class and I don't have it memorized.\" \"Does your older brother go to Gunn? My sister thinks they share a class together.\" \"I noticed you have a Schwinn bike. How do you like it? I was thinking about asking my parents for one this Christmas.\" It may seem obvious, but it bears mentioning: Don't tell him you like him if you're not at least on good speaking terms. If you surprise someone you don't know well by openly revealing your attraction, you could scare him off. At the very least, it will affect the course of any future friendship or courtship."

This may have some basis in fact - the internet is full of guides for men that attempt to answer the question, \"Are they flirting with me?\" That doesn't mean that you should flirt more; it just means that you should be aware that he might not flirt back with you, even if he likes you. [5] X Research source When he's talking to you, twirl your hair as you listen if it’s long. This action is natural enough for most people not to make anything of it, but if he says something about it, then he's definitely paying attention. This is an easy flirting method to use. Ask him to do you a favor. This one is sweet, but it can backfire for a number of reasons: he might not want to do you a favor in front of his friends, or yours because he's embarrassed. Stick to simple favors: Ask him to hold your backpack in between classes. You can tell him it's really heavy and you want someone strong to help you out. Ask him to do homework with you, even if you don't need much help. This is the perfect excuse to get close to him, and also a good indicator of how patient he is. Above all, try not to be needy - don't try to make him help you move or anything! Smile , show him your eyes and be available. Show him all the things that make you really attractive. Smile your wonderful smile, show him your mesmerizing eyes, and be around when he's around. He'll start to notice you very soon!"

If he teases you, gently \"hit\" them on the shoulder. Mostly, one might do this when guys are playfully teasing them. You can pretend to be upset or take it with a laugh. Find excuses to touch him .

By dating, you'll get to know each other even better and you'll learn whether you're a good romantic match. A good time to schedule a date is the weekend following whenever you admit that you like each other. For your first date - try to plan so that at least part of the date allows you to talk to each other. For instance, if you want to see a movie, plan to have dinner as well. A good first date is casual, low-pressure, and uniquely \"you.\" A date doesn't have to be extravagant. A great first date can be as simple as doing homework and having a picnic at the park.
