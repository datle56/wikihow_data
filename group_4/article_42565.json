Many recommend leaving the conditioner in for several minutes before rinsing it. Others are actually meant to be applied after getting out of the shower.

Rinse out your conditioner with cold water to seal your cuticles up and maintain all of that hydration."

Exfoliating legs with a body scrub helps remove dead skin for a cleaner shave. Wet and lather shaving cream or conditioner on your legs. Using a razor, shave upward, against the grain of your hair. Start with your ankles and work your way up. Don't forget the tops of your feet at the end. Shave slowly to avoid cutting yourself, especially your knees and the back of your legs because you might hit a bump and cut yourself.
