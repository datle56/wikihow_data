While 10/5 might seem confusing, giving out 10 cookies to 5 friends makes it seem simple! [1] X Research source If you’re teaching your own child, you can introduce division by having them help you divide items into goody bags or separate baked goods into sandwich bags to hand out to friends. In a classroom setting, students can work in groups to divide a number of items, such as candies or plastic bears, evenly among themselves. Most students begin to learn division in the 3rd grade or around the age of 8 or 9.

      "content": "Explain how you can divide items into smaller, equal groups. Ask your child or your students to divide the same larger number into smaller groups of various sizes. You can use manipulatives, pictures of the items, or a worksheet. This helps them get a better grasp about how basic division works. Manipulatives are any small item that represents the numerical amounts in math problems, such as beans or plastic coins. Your student or child can physically see and touch the items, which helps them better understand the mathematical concepts."

      "content": "Incorporate the symbols used for division problems. This seems simple, but it’s an easy step to overlook. Remember to talk about both the division sign and the forward slash as a way to signify division. Try writing a division problem down while saying it out loud to reiterate when the symbols should be used. For example, 10 divided by 5 can be written like this: 10/5 or 10÷5. 8 divided by 2 can be written like this: 8/2 or 8÷2."

If your student or your child already knows about multiplication, this is a good scaffolding to build on. Grab a multiplication chart and show them how the times table can be worked backwards using division. For example, go through the 5 times tables, starting at 5 x 10 = 50. Show your student or child that 50/10 = 5. Then go to 5 x 9 = 45, and explain that 45/9 = 5. Continue until you complete the times table. Or, write out the problems on flash cards with the multiplication problem on the front and the division problem on the back. Show your student or child that 2 x 10 = 20 and have them guess the corresponding division problem (20/10 = 2). You can compare the relationship of multiplication and division to addition and subtraction—they're both opposites. [4] X Expert Source David Jia Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 7 January 2021."

Remind them that division effectively creates smaller groups out of a larger sum. [5] X Research source You can work backwards from multiplication tables. For example, when dividing by 3, the math problems would include 3/3, 6/3, 9/3, 12/3, 15/3, etc. At this point, make sure the numbers divide evenly."

The context is that the student must divide certain numbers of pizza slices per varying numbers of guests, but the math problems will contain just numbers, such as 12/3, 12/4, 24/8, etc."

After you explain the concept, you can help your student understand it by working with manipulatives. For example, you might say that your student or child has 10 cookies to share with 3 friends. This would allow them to give 3 cookies to each friend, leaving 1 extra cookie. This cookie is the remainder."

Then, ask your student or child to divide the items into various sizes of groups. If the items can’t be divided evenly, have them create a “remainder” group. For example, you could ask them to divide 25 candies into various groups. While 5 groups would divide evenly, 4 groups wouldn’t. This would leave 1 extra candy, since 4 doesn’t go into 25 evenly."

If necessary, you can help them walk through the reasoning. Then, ask them to divide another set of items and explain the remainder without your help. Ask, “Why do you have 1 candy left?” Help them arrive at the answer, which is that 4 doesn’t go into 25 evenly. You could say, \"How many cookies would 4 each friends get if the package had 25?\" or \"Would 4 people be able to split 25 cookies evenly?\" Finally, explain that 1 is the remainder. If they still cannot explain it without help, switch to a new problem and continue to work through the exercise until they are able to explain remainders without your help."

Tell your student or child that they will need to divide each unit in the dividend by the divisor, starting with the largest unit. [7] X Research source For example, you’d divide the 100s unit, then the 10s unit, and finally the 1s unit. Let’s say your problem is 54/3. Your divisor is 3, which goes into 5 just 1 time. However, you are left with a remainder of 2, which you will need to save for the next step. Similarly, let’s say your problem is 155/4. You can’t divide 4 into 1, so you’d divide it into 15.

Explain that they will need to multiply the number of times that the divisor goes into the first number by the divisor. They will subtract this product from the units in the dividend to find the remainder, which they’ll carry over to the next unit. [8] X Research source As you work though 54/3, you know that 3 goes into 5 just 1 time with a remainder of 2. You’d multiply 3 x 1 = 3. Subtract 3 from 5 to get 2. Leave the 2 in the 10s spot. Similarly, for 155/4, you know that 4 goes into 15 just 3 times. You’d multiply 4 x 3 = 12. Subtract 15-12= 3. Carry the 3 down in the 10s spot."

Write the result into your answer, and then subtract to find your remainder, if you have one. [9] X Research source Working through 54/3, you will carry the 4 down, writing it next to the 2, which gives you 24. You’ll next divide 3 into 24. This gives you 8. Putting it all together, your answer is 54/3=18. Similarly, as you work through 155/4, you’d now have a 3 left in your 10s spot. Carry down the 5, to give you 35. Divide the 4 into 35, which will give you a result of 8, with 3 remaining."

[10] X Research source Since 3 goes into 54 evenly, you don’t have a remainder. However, 55/3 would give you a remainder of 1. You would find this remainder like this: If you divide 3 into 5, you get 1, with 2 remaining. You’d then divide 3 into 25, which would give you 8, with 1 remaining. This is your remainder."
