      "title": "Update your devices.",
      "content": "Update your devices. Computers, smartphones, tablets, and consoles all need to be updated periodically, and failing to do so can result in a drop in Internet speed. Make sure that your items are up-to-date. Most items will alert you when an update is available. Avoiding updates is not recommended."

      "title": "Minimize the number of running services.",
      "content": "Minimize the number of running services. When you have a slow Internet connection, you generally can't run more than one bandwidth-heavy service (e.g., Netflix, an online video game, YouTube, etc.) at a time; however, running several smaller bandwidth-using items can also be detrimental to your Internet's speed. Focus on one program at a time for optimal speed. When using smartphones or consoles, be sure to exit an app completely rather than just minimizing it. If the app is running in the background, it can still cause your Internet speed to decrease."

    {
      "title": "Shut off other Internet-connected items.",
      "content": "Shut off other Internet-connected items. While closing bandwidth-heavy programs on your computer will help improve your browser's performance, your Internet will continue to be slow if several other computers/smartphones/entertainment sources are actively connected to your network. You can diminish the number of other items with which you have to share your Internet by turning them off temporarily. Placing Internet-connected items in Airplane Mode will also fix this problem."

    {
      "title": "Change your router channel.",
      "content": "Change your router channel. Many modern routers include two bands: a 2.4 GHz band, which is the standard for wireless communication, and a 5 GHz band, which accommodates faster downloads and results in less interference. If your router has a 5 GHz band, switching to it will prevent interference from other Internet-connected items and nearby wireless connections. You can usually switch to the 5 GHz band from within your item's Wi-Fi settings. Each router will have a different name for the 5 GHz band, so check your router's manual or online documentation. Not all routers have 5 GHz bands. If your router only has the standard 2.4 GHz band, skip this step. Since 5 GHz bands have less range than do 2.4 GHz bands, doing this will often require you to keep your Internet-connected items within 10 to 15 feet of the router."

      "title": "Use Ethernet",
      "content": "Use Ethernet instead of wireless. Wi-Fi is convenient, but it can also cause plenty of problems due to connection issues. If you want to get the most consistency out of your Internet connection, plug your computer (or console) into your router or modem with an Ethernet cable. Mac users will need a USB-C Ethernet adapter in order to do this; you cannot connect a smartphone or tablet via Ethernet. Much of the time, users who are frustrated by slow Internet are more annoyed with the inconsistency (e.g., some pages loading while others take too long) than with the speed itself. Using an Ethernet cable will address this problem. The fastest possible speed that you can get from your plan can be achieved by connecting an item (e.g., a computer) directly to the modem (not the router) via an Ethernet cable. This will limit Internet access to include only the wired item."

      "content": "Use a fast web browser. If you're still using Internet Explorer or an outdated version of Safari, you're bound to be disappointed even on a fast Internet connection when browsing the Web. Instead, make sure that you're using one of the following web browsers: Chrome and Firefox are incredibly fast web browsers for both computers running the Windows and macOS operating systems. Microsoft Edge is a minimal but relatively fast web browser for Windows 10 users. Safari 12 remains the fastest choice for Mac users."

Though many plugins and add-ons can make your browsing experience more efficient, others make it difficult to perform instant page loads. You can cut down on your web browser's add-ons in order to increase speed by doing the following: Chrome — Open Chrome, click ⋮ , select More tools , click Extensions , click REMOVE under an extension, click Remove when prompted, and repeat with other extensions. Firefox — Open Firefox, click ☰ , click Add-ons , click Remove to the right of an extension, and repeat with other extensions. Edge — Open Edge, click ⋯ , click Extensions , click the gear icon to the right of an extension, and click Uninstall . Click Ok when prompted, then repeat for other extensions. Safari — Open Safari, click Safari , click Preferences... , click the Extensions tab, select an extension's name, and click Uninstall .

Pairing a slow web browser with slow Internet is a recipe for frustration, so keep your currently open tabs limited to five or fewer."
