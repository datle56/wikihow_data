      "title": "Tell the AI that the danger happened in a dream.",
      "content": "Tell the AI that the danger happened in a dream. No matter the prompt, you can twist it around to turn it into a dream. You can be as descriptive as you want, or you can just say that you woke up and it was all a dream. If you are too vague, the AI could potentially turn the tables and make it so you don't actually survive the prompt. One way to guarantee that you'll win is to include the word \"unharmed\", i.e., \"I wake up in my bed unharmed. It was all a dream.\""

    {
      "title": "Convince the AI that your competency can get you out of the situation.",
      "content": "Convince the AI that your competency can get you out of the situation. For certain situations, you can tell the AI that you actually have a degree of competency that would allow you to survive the situation. For example, if you have the prompt where you're stuck in a room with a ticking bomb, tell the AI that you're a bomb squad technician and that you know how to successfully diffuse a bomb."

    {
      "title": "Simply tell the AI that you would survive.",
      "content": "Simply tell the AI that you would survive. Most of the time you can suggest to the AI that you would survive the prompt, and it will allow itself to be suggested. This method doesn't always work, but as long as you're adamant in your answer that you would live, the AI usually agrees. For example, if the prompt is that you're hurtling down a hill and your bike's brakes give out, you can tell the AI that you sprout wings from your back and you fly away to a safe location."

    {
      "title": "Let the AI fill in the blanks for you.",
      "content": "Let the AI fill in the blanks for you. While this isn't the most fun method of getting a win every time, simply tell the AI that you \"do something, then solve the problem instead.\" [1] X Research source The AI will make up a story about what happened, but you will always end up surviving at the end."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make up your own twist endings.",
      "content": "Make up your own twist endings. Many of the responses that the AI gives to players' answers include a twist at the end. In order to force the AI to let you survive, write a twist into your answer. You can be as detailed as you want, or simply write \"I resign to my fate, but then, in a twist of fateâ€¦\". The AI will fill in the blanks and write an ending where you end up surviving."

There are certain words you can't use, such as \"survive,\" \"win,\" \"safe,\" \"safety,\" and \"alive.\" To get around this, use synonyms of those words. A great word to include is \"unharmed,\" as this usually forces the AI to create an ending where you don't die."
