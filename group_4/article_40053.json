Try this once to see if it works for you: [1] X Research source Bring the water to a boil for a few minutes. Let it cool for a couple of hours. White minerals should settle to the bottom of the pot. Siphon or scoop up the top of the water, leaving the minerals behind."

The softened water often has a better taste, but the effect depends on the exact minerals in your water. [2] X Research source This \"filter\" does not actually remove most contaminants, unless the device has a secondary filter (such as carbon filter or reverse osmosis). [3] X Research source Most coffee fanatics dislike the taste of soft water coffee. Look for a faucet model with a switch-off valve, so you can keep your hard water brew."

Once you've picked a product, add it to laundry as follows: [4] X Trustworthy Source State of Michigan Official website for the State of Michigan Go to source Add the conditioner to the wash cycle according to the product’s instructions. If you don't know your area's exact water hardness, add conditioner until the water feels slicker than normal and suds appear during the wash."

      "content": "Treat hard water spots with vinegar. Cleaning expert Andrii Gurskyi says that distilled white vinegar is the best way to remove hard water spots. Apply plain or dilute with an equal amount of water, scrub away the problem, then rinse. This temporary solution can get tedious if limescale builds up quickly. If your water is only slightly hard it might be a cost-effective approach. Towels can also become stiff due to hard water. Treat them the same way. Vinegar can bleach some types of fabric and damage stoneware. Some people add ½ cup (120mL) vinegar to the rinse cycle in their water, while others claim this can damage the rubber seals on your machine. Consider checking with your machine manufacturer. Alternative: Cleaning specialist Erik Bakirov recommends using Bar Keepers Soft Scrub for especially tough stains."

      "content": "Measure your water hardness to see just how hard it is. Purchase some water hardness testing strips and follow the directions on the label to test your water . Typically, you just set the strip in a small cup of water and wait for it to change colors. Use the chart that came with the test strips to determine how hard your water is. If you’re unclear, here are the ranges: [5] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Soft: <1.0 grains per gallon (gpg) (or <17 parts per million (ppm)) Slightly hard: 1.0-3.5 gpg (or 17-60 ppm) Moderately hard: 3.5-7.0 gpg (or 60-120 ppm) Hard: 7.0-10.5 gpg (or 120-180 ppm) Very hard: >10.5 gpg (or >180 ppm)"

      "content": "Find a softener system that suits the size of your home. Most test kits in the United States measure the hardness in grains per gallon. Multiply this result by the gallons of water your household uses each day, on average (according to your water bill). This is the number of \"grains\" of hardness the device would soften each day. Choose a softener labeled for about 10 times this number of grains. This means the softener will work for about ten days before it needs some downtime. [6] X Research source The average US resident uses 100 gallons of water a day (or 70 gallons if you're only softening indoor water use). [7] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source For example, your household water hardness has 9 grains per gallon. You use 300 gallons per day, so 9 x 300 = 2,700 grains per day. A softener in the 27,000 grain range (2,700 x 10) is about the right size. How much will a water softener cost? Depending on the size of your home, expect to spend $1,100-3,000 on a whole-home water softener."

Most other devices are much less effective, or even just scams. [8] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Ion exchange softeners come in two types: Sodium chloride : the most common and most effective type. This adds a tiny amount of salt (sodium) to your water. Potassium chloride : it’s less effective, but it’s a useful option if you can't have sodium. Talk to your doctor before installing a potassium-based water softener if you have heart or kidney issues. [9] X Research source If you don't want sodium or potassium, pick either type and install a reverse osmosis (RO) filter as well to remove the sodium/potassium after softening."

      "content": "Hard water has high levels of magnesium and calcium in it. The water you drink, shower with, and use in your home is never “pure” H2O—water normally picks up all kinds of nutrients and minerals from its original source, the pipes, and the water filtration plants. The two most common minerals that end up in water are magnesium and calcium. Water “hardness” refers to the levels of these minerals, so “hard water” is water with an elevated level of both magnesium and calcium. [13] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Geological Survey U.S. government agency responsible for conducting scientific research on the nation's land, natural resources, and natural disasters Go to source Around 85% of the United States’ water supplies contain hard water.

      "title": "The biggest signs of hard water are water spots and soap scum.",
      "content": "The biggest signs of hard water are water spots and soap scum. The calcium and magnesium ions in hard water tend to stick to (or combine with) inert molecules. This tends to create a lot of water spots whenever you use the water, and it makes soap especially “sticky,” which creates soap scum. If your shower walls and floor tend to be very slick, sticky, or dirty, you probably have hard water. [17] X Research source Other signs of water hardness include: Poor-tasting, “flat,” or metallic-tasting water. [18] X Research source Trouble rinsing shampoo, conditioner, mud, debris, or dandruff out of your hair. Poor dishwasher or washing machine performance. White spots on surfaces. Potential skin irritation in people with preexisting skin issues. [19] X Trustworthy Source National Eczema Association Nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of those with eczema through research and education Go to source Hard water shouldn’t bother your skin if you don’t have a skin condition.

If you’re dedicating serious time to cleaning up the soapy residue and water spots left behind by hard water, it’s completely reasonable to seek out a fix for hard water. You are not going to do any serious harm to your health by getting rid of hard water. You can always get more magnesium or calcium from your diet or supplements if your doctor thinks you’re running a deficit. It’s also completely reasonable to get rid of hard water if it’s irritating your skin."
