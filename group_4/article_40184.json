      "content": "No, soul ties are not directly mentioned in the Bible. The concept of having a soul tie with someone else originates from New Age thinking, but some Christians believe soul ties are implied throughout Scripture. [1] X Research source Verses like Genesis 2:24, 1 Corinthians 6:16, and 1 Samuel 18:1 are often used to support the powerful connection, but since the term isn’t explicitly written in the Bible, evangelical and fundamentalist Christians view soul ties as immoral. [2] X Research source People who reject soul ties believe that a human’s soul can only be intertwined with that of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:17). Supporters of soul ties, however, believe that the Bible speaks about souls being knit together when it comes to close relationships like marriage and friendship."

      "content": "A soul tie is believed to be an intense connection between 2 people. Think of a soul tie as an invisible chain that binds you to another person spiritually, mentally, and physically. Since your souls are “becoming one,” you might feel like you’ve known the other person your entire life, or that you’re destined to be with them. [3] X Research source According to believers, it’s possible to have more than one soul tie throughout your life, and it can be positive or negative, depending on your relationship to the other person. Many believers claim that a new soul tie forms when 2 married individuals have sex for the first time, but if they have sex outside of marriage, an “ungodly” soul tie forms. Similarly, if you’re in a relationship with someone who encourages sin or takes advantage of you, it could be a sign of a toxic or ungodly soul tie ."

      "content": "Sexual relationships Some (but not all) Christians believe that, according to Ephesians 5:31 (“For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.”), marriage can create a godly soul tie between a husband and wife when they engage in sexual intercourse for the first time. This happens because sex isn’t just a physical experience; it’s an emotional and spiritual connection that binds 2 people together, under His intended purpose. [4] X Research source A person who has sex outside of marriage, however, violates God’s purpose, creating an unholy soul tie. In 1 Corinthians 6:16, the verse states, “What? know ye not that he which is joined to a harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.” [5] X Research source This type of bond damages the soul because people are acting on their sinful impulses."

      "content": "Close friendships Most people who believe in soul ties reference the relationship between King David and Jonathan in 1 Samuel 18:1 (“And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.”). According to this verse, a positive soul tie can form from a meaningful friendship, where both individuals care for and respect each other deeply. [6] X Research source On the other hand, an ungodly soul tie can form from a toxic or one-sided relationship, especially if you tend to idolize the other person."

[7] X Research source Similarly, in Ephesians 5:31, the Scripture says, \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.\" [8] X Research source Marriage is a vow that binds 2 people together, creating a healthy soul tie."

A soul tie usually involves an obsession with someone in authority, like a pastor or mentor, but it can also be with a romantic partner or friend. Even if the relationship is over, you might feel like you can’t live without them. [9] X Research source"

You can’t get rid of these items because you’re deeply obsessed with the other person, and they might be the only things that are keeping you connected. This could be jewelry, photos, cards, love letters, or any gifts from that attachment. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "According to the Bible, repentance is the first step in breaking a soul tie. When the Lord is preparing you to break a soul tie, He might teach you how to reject intrusive thoughts about someone in your past, take away your desire to be with the other person, or give you the strength to make the best decisions for you. From there, the Bible tells you to confess your sins to Him and to others to free yourself from an ungodly soul tie. [13] X Research source To break a soul tie through prayer , renounce the soul tie specifically, then ask the Lord for healing and forgiveness. You might say, “In Jesus’ name, I now renounce and break any ungodly soul ties formed between myself and [person’s name] due to [sin (fornication, etc.)]. I ask for the Lord’s forgiveness for my transgressions, and that He will grant me the strength to avoid destructive soul ties from this point forward. Amen.”"
