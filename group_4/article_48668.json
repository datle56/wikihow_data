      "title": "Taurus is attracted to Libra as a kindred spirit.",
      "content": "Taurus is attracted to Libra as a kindred spirit. Both ruled by Venus, Taurus and Libra have a lot in common. These signs share an interest in everything that falls within Venus’ domain, including love, art, beauty, aesthetics, and money. This means that, on some level, a Taurus naturally feels like Libras get them. While both of these signs share interests in things like art, as an Air sign, Libras tend to be more intellectual, while the Earth-sign Tauruses can get bored when things get too abstract. Luckily, Libras are pretty adaptable—they see differences with their partner as a sign that they complement each other.

      "content": "Taurus might be taken by Libra’s looks. Taurus can be a visually-oriented sign—they like beautiful things and beautiful people. As it just so happens, Libras tend to be very physically attractive. This will always catch a Taurus’ eye. In one of these pairings, Libras can rest assured that a Taurus will appreciate the effort they put into their appearance, and vice-versa."

      "title": "Taurus appreciates Libra’s sense of sophistication.",
      "content": "Taurus appreciates Libra’s sense of sophistication. As a sign, Taurus tends to stick with a close-knit circle of friends. Libras, on the other hand, are known for being social charmers who are great at meeting others. A Taurus might really admire this aspect of a Libra, since they’re practical enough to know that this skillset could be really handy for a couple. A Taurus might be a little put-off by some of Libra’s more eccentric and less-practical friends, but if they can be open-minded, they’ll realize that this kind of social circle has a lot of benefits."

      "title": "Taurus loves the way that Libra treats them.",
      "content": "Taurus loves the way that Libra treats them. For a Libra, their partner is a work of art that’s meant to be pampered and treated well. [2] X Research source This is great news for the Bull, who truly can appreciate this kind of tender love and care. This makes Libra even happier, setting up a nice virtuous cycle. Taurus is a pretty touchy-feely and sensual sign. Libras are happy to oblige a Taurus’ need for physical touch, since they, like Taurus, see this as an important part of building intimacy."

      "title": "Libra is impressed by Taurus’ taste for luxury.",
      "content": "Libra is impressed by Taurus’ taste for luxury. When a Taurus is really into you, they’ll spend money on you, treating you to fancy dinners and nice gifts. For a Libra, this kind of luxury speaks to their refined sensibilities. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source While both of these signs appreciate the finer things in life, they aren’t necessary. A homecooked meal can make both of these signs just as happy."

      "title": "Libra appreciates Taurus’ capacity to be a stable partner.",
      "content": "Libra appreciates Taurus’ capacity to be a stable partner. For the Scales, finding a secure and stable partnership is one of their deepest motivations in life—a Libra finds themselves through their partner. A Taurus is able to provide that kind of traditional, committed partnership that a Libra fantasizes about. To develop this bond even further, Libra and Taurus can openly discuss what relationships mean to them. They’re likely to find they have a lot in common about this subject."

    {
      "title": "Libra is attracted to Taurus’ decisiveness.",
      "content": "Libra is attracted to Taurus’ decisiveness. As a fixed sign, the Bull can be stubborn, but with a Libra, that might not be such a bad thing. Especially early on in a relationship, Libras prefer if their partners make decisions for them—Libras are known for being naturally indecisive. [4] X Research source A Taurus’ decisiveness is likely to appeal to a Libra who wants someone to take charge. Although Libras are known for their indecisiveness, this is still a cardinal sign, which means that Libras are naturally drawn to leadership roles. It’s a good idea for Taurus to make room for their Libra partner to take charge occasionally."

      "title": "This relationship takes time to grow.",
      "content": "This relationship takes time to grow. Libra, as a cardinal sign, is more likely to take the initiative of getting things going. Pragmatic Taurus and free-wheeling Libra don’t have a lot in common on the surface—their commonalities only get revealed over time. As a result, this relationship is likely to get better the more each partner invests in it, as they learn more about how similar they are. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Compromise is the key to making this pairing work.",
      "content": "Compromise is the key to making this pairing work. As an Earth sign, a Taurus might get put off by some of Libra’s less practical qualities. On the other hand, a Taurus’ stubbornness might begin to grate on the free-thinking air sign Libra. However, if both of these signs can communicate openly about their needs and meet each other halfway, they can form a formidable pair. It’s important for a Taurus to learn how to forgive. Forgiveness doesn’t come easy to this sign, but by internalizing the idea that everyone, including themselves, makes mistakes sometimes, they can become a better partner. Libras can grow by escaping their evasive tendencies. When a Libra is unhappy with their partner, they’re likely to become cold and distant rather than risk confrontation. Communicating openly is an important skill for Libras to develop.

      "title": "Venus draws these signs together.",
      "content": "Venus draws these signs together. Taurus represents Venus’ feminine side, while Libra is a masculine sign. These signs can show each other different aspects of their shared interests in beauty, art, and luxury. Since Venus is exalted in mystical Pisces, both of these signs are looking for a magical, almost spiritual kind of love. [6] X Research source Venus can also lead these signs to share some flaws. Snobbery can be a problem for both Taurus and Libra—Taurus might look down on people of lower status, while Libra can be judgmental about intelligence. Keep an eye out for this problem.

      "content": "These signs draw strength from their sense of commitment. Both Libra and Taurus are deeply invested in making their relationships work, and they pour a lot of energy into them. Whenever there are disagreements between this pair, if they can remember how much this relationship means to each of them, they can overcome anything."
