Otherwise, unplug your power supply, double-check your paperclip placement, and run the test once more. If the fan still does not move, your PSU is probably dead. Even if your fan is moving, your power supply might not be outputting the correct power levels. To be certain it is working as intended, test it using the next method."

[11] X Research source Your computer performs a POST each time you turn it on, so if your motherboard is already installed, turn the computer on. If it boots properly and there is no beep code, but you believe something is wrong with your motherboard, consider consulting a professional. Often, the easiest way to determine you have a bad motherboard is checking every other component in your computer. After a failed POST, ensure all other components are working before assuming your motherboard is nonfunctional."
