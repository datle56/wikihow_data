Modern HTC and Samsung models no longer come with IR blasters, but you can often find them on newer models released by Huawei, Honor, and Xiaomi.

[7] X Research source If you don't see one, there are many free and paid apps on the Google Play Store you can use to control your home audio and video devices. Some popular and highly-reviewed options are Universal TV Remote Control by CodeMatics and AnyMote Universal Remote + WiFi Smart Home Control by Color Tiger. You may have to try a few different apps before you find the one that best suits you. Not all IR apps are universal remote control apps. Some are for specific brands. Be sure to read the app's description before installing it. For example, you can use Mi Remote only for Xiaomi phones."

Not all dongles or adapters will work with every Android, however, and it's important that you make sure the external IR blaster will work with your phone before you buy it. Some adapters or dongles require a specific app for the product to work. If you're trying to use an IR blaster in your USB-C port but it's not working, try looking up who else is using your product and what app they are using. For example, the \"Android Adapter Smartphone Micro USB Type C IR Infrared Remote Control Universal\" works best with the \"Zazaremote\" app."
