To maintain the shape of your sneakers as you wash them, slide shoe trees inside of each shoe. If you don’t have shoe trees, stuff the insides of your sneakers with paper towels. [1] X Research source A shoe tree is a wood or plastic block with a handle on it. It keeps the fabric, plastic, and rubber from shrinking or creasing when you’re cleaning or not wearing your shoes. Avoid stuffing your sneakers with newspaper, as the ink could transfer to your sneakers."

Drag the bristles around the leather sole and scrub inside the heel where sweat tends to build up in the lining. Scrub firmly but not aggressively to avoid damaging the shoes. Cover each area of your shoes 2-3 times to ensure that you lift up all the dirt on your sneakers. [3] X Research source For the tongue, lift it up with your nondominant hand and use quick flicking motions to scrub the leather without wearing it down. Scrub the inside fabric around the heel, but you don’t need to shove the brush deep into the insole. The cleaning solution may dry out your hands, so wear gloves if you prefer."
