      "content": "Pay to park in a nearby lot or garage if you’re driving to the ferry. Since no vehicles are allowed on the ferry and New York is almost always busy, try and plan parking ahead of time. The St. George Ferry Terminal has 2 municipal parking lots priced at $8.00 daily. You can also purchase 3-month permits for $300. For the Whitehall terminal, the Quikpark garage is the closest parking garage at 81 Whitehall Street and costs $40 for the day. [2] X Research source You can also park in the St. George Courthouse Garage for $55 a month. Private parking lots are much more expensive—avoid them if you can."

      "content": "Visit the ferry terminals in either Lower Manhattan or Staten Island. Choose the terminal closest to you. Both are accessible by a number of subway and local bus transportation lines. While there was once a fee implied to ride the ferry, it was eliminated in the late 1990s and there is currently no charge. If you're traveling with children, keep a close eye on them as you prepare to board. The crowds can get unexpectedly large at peak times, and kids can easily become separated."
