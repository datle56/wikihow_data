      "content": "Distinguish between tinted moisturizer and foundation. Tinted moisturizer and foundation are both water-based products that contain moisturizing agents, oil, and pigment (to give some coverage). But, tinted moisturizers contain more moisturizing agents than foundation and generally offer lighter coverage. [1] X Research source Depending on the makeup line, tinted moisturizers and foundations can be almost indistinguishable so you'll need to experiment with products. Tinted moisturizers come in a bunch of different formulas, so look for one that is right for you. If you have oily skin, for example, look for an oil-free formula. If you are worried about aging day-to-day sun exposure, look for a formula with SPF."

      "content": "Decide if you should use a tinted moisturizer. Choose a tinted moisturizer if you want a light, natural look, rather than medium or full coverage. [2] X Expert Source Frankie Sanderson Makeup Artist & Stylist Expert Interview. April 14, 2020. Tinted moisturizer looks more like your skin than some heavier foundations. It can also simplify your skincare routine by acting as your regular moisturizer. The humectants and emollients in the moisturizer will add moisture to your skin and help seal it in. [3] X Research source Foundation is a better choice for people who are looking for heavier coverage."

      "content": "Choose a tinted moisturizer that matches your complexion. Try to match the tinted moisturizer shade to your face. If you're at a makeup counter, test a little on the side of your face. Or, test a little on the back of your hand. You shouldn't see any product on your skin if it blends well and matches. You should also check to see how your skin absorbs the product. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Check for sun protection.",
      "content": "Check for sun protection. Many tinted moisturizers offer sun protection and list SPF protection. In addition to apply a daily sunscreen, you may want to find a tinted moisturizer that has an SPF of at least 30 for additional protection against both UVA and UVB rays. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source Remember that the sunscreen protection from your tinted moisturizer will wear off within a few hours unless you reapply it or apply another sunscreen throughout the day."

      "title": "Select brushes.",
      "content": "Select brushes. While you can simply rub tinted moisturizer onto your face using your fingertips, using a brush may give you more control. Consider using a duo fiber brush. This brush is small with a flat head so you can blend the tint into your skin. You can also use a blending sponge to get heavier coverage. Using a brush or sponge can help you achieve a more uniform makeup look."

      "content": "Combine your moisturizer and foundation primer. Squirt a very small amount of untinted moisturizer and foundation primer onto your fingertips. Rub your fingertips together so that the moisturizer and foundation primer are mixed together well. Dab the mixture on your cheeks and forehead so you can easily rub it into your skin. Pat the mixture onto your chin, temples, and under eyes. [7] X Research source Let it set on your skin for about a minute before applying your tinted moisturizer."

      "title": "Buff the tinted moisturizer into your skin.",
      "content": "Buff the tinted moisturizer into your skin. Take your brush or your fingers and use upward sweeping motions to spread the moisturizer into your skin. Make lots of small circular motions as you move the brush across your face. [9] X Research source Unlike foundation, tinted moisturizer actually penetrates the skin better when applied with your fingers. While a brush offers a different kind of control, it is not strictly necessary. It may help to hold the brush near the end so that you're not guiding its movement as much."

      "title": "Blend in your lines.",
      "content": "Blend in your lines. Use your brush to work the moisturizer right under your eyes, under your nose, and along your jawline. Be sure to work the moisturizer down from your jawline to under your chin. This will prevent any makeup lines from being visible. [10] X Research source If your brush is too large to get into hard to reach places, try switching to a smaller or finer brush."

      "title": "Apply a concealer under your eyes and over any blemishes.",
      "content": "Apply a concealer under your eyes and over any blemishes. Use a rounded concealer brush to dip into your creamy concealer. Apply the concealer as close to your lash line as you can. Be sure to spread the concealer into the corners of your eyes and a little past the ends of your lash lines. Blend out concealer over any blemishes or redness that you may want to cover, as well. [11] X Research source Applying a concealer can help make your skin a uniform color that matches your tinted moisturizer."

      "title": "Set the tinted moisturizer using a setting powder.",
      "content": "Set the tinted moisturizer using a setting powder. To keep your tinted moisturizer in place for longer, apply a light dusting of setting powder over it. Dip a large powder brush into your powder and gently sweep it across your face. Be sure to get right under your eyes where you applied concealer. [12] X Research source One benefit of using a tinted moisturizer is a natural, dewy glow. If you want to maintain that, you can skip the powder and instead use a setting spray or facial mist to help hold your makeup."
