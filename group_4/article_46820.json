Look for the plug at the end of the cord and attach it to the corresponding receptacle on the outside of the winch. Run the remote control cord from the winch to the driver’s seat and place the remote control in your vehicle. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Find something in front of your car to anchor your winch to. A large tree trunk, boulder, or other vehicle is ideal. Don’t anchor your winch to something small and weak or you risk breaking it. Try to find an anchor that’s straight in front of your vehicle. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the disengage lever to release the winch cable. The disengage lever should be located on the outside of the winch. The lever should have an option that says “free spool” or “disengaged.” Turn the lever to that option. This will release the cable so you’re able to manually pull it out from the winch.

      "content": "Pull the winch cable all the way to the anchor. Don't pull too much of the cable out or you'll create unnecessary slack. Set the end of the cable down next to the anchor. [5] X Research source If the winch cable doesn't reach the anchor, look for another anchor that's closer to your vehicle."

Wrap the protector around the anchor so the two end loops are facing you. Hold the two end loops in your hand.

Remove the pin from the D-shackle and put the curved part of the D-shackle through both of the loops on the tree trunk protector. Once the loops are on the shackle, reinsert the pin and twist it to tighten it into place. [7] X Research source"

Press the button on the remote control to start pulling your car out. You should feel your vehicle moving forward as it's pulled out from whatever it’s stuck in. Release the button every few seconds and then resume winching; this will keep you from going too fast.
