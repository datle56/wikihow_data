      "title": "Seal the hook-and-loop fastener to itself before you wash your wraps.",
      "content": "Seal the hook-and-loop fastener to itself before you wash your wraps. To prevent wear and tear on your wraps, close up the hook-and-loop fastener on the end of each wrap. The hook-and-loop fastener pieces easily stick to each other, and this keeps it protected in the wash. [1] X Research source If you leave the hook-and-loop fastener open, the seal may weaken, and they may not stay in place."

      "content": "Place your hand wraps inside of a mesh laundry bag. Use a nylon lingerie bag to launder your wraps. After you put your wraps in the bag, zip up the bag so they don’t come out in the wash. [2] X Research source The bag prevents them from getting tangled and tied around your other clothing."

      "title": "Launder your wraps with your other clothes if they are a neutral color.",
      "content": "Launder your wraps with your other clothes if they are a neutral color. Do this if your wraps are a neutral color like white, tan, or grey. You can easily toss your laundry bag in with the rest of your clothing. This way, the dye of your gloves does not wash off onto your clothes."

      "title": "Wash your wraps by themselves if they are brightly colored.",
      "content": "Wash your wraps by themselves if they are brightly colored. If you have highly saturated wraps like red or royal blue, it is best to wash them alone. Put your laundry bag in the washing machine by itself, and adjust the settings for a small load. The pigment of the wraps can wash off and stain your white or light-colored clothing."

      "title": "Pour your detergent into its appropriate slot.",
      "content": "Pour your detergent into its appropriate slot. Use all-purpose laundry detergent to wash your wraps, and pour it into the detergent slot of your machine. If you are washing them with other clothing, use a full cup of detergent. If you are washing the wraps by themselves, use one third or one half of the cup."

      "title": "Wash the wraps on a delicate cycle with cold water.",
      "content": "Wash the wraps on a delicate cycle with cold water. To avoid damaging your hand wraps, wash your clothing on a gentle cycle and use cool water. This way, your wraps will remain in great shape. To start the wash, press the \"Start\" button. Avoid using a hot water setting, as hot water can stretch out your hand wraps."

      "title": "Take the wraps out of the laundry bag when the cycle is complete.",
      "content": "Take the wraps out of the laundry bag when the cycle is complete. Come back for your laundry after about an hour, and remove the laundry bag from the washer. If you are washing other clothing, put them in the dryer and press the “Start” button. [3] X Research source A typical rinse cycle lasts for about 45-60 minutes."

      "title": "Avoid putting your wraps in your dryer.",

      "title": "Drape each wrap across the bottom of a hanger.",
      "content": "Drape each wrap across the bottom of a hanger. Put 1 end of the wrap through the inside of the hanger, and lay it across the middle. Adjust the wrap so it is centered on the hanger. Then, either place the other wrap next to the first one or use another hanger. Both options work great for drying your wraps. [5] X Research source Lying your wraps flat ensures they completely dry. If they are folded or creased, the wraps may dry unevenly."

      "title": "Let your wraps air-dry for 1-3 hours.",
      "content": "Let your wraps air-dry for 1-3 hours. After your wraps are draped across a hanger, place them in a dry place so they can air-dry. Your wraps should be dry within a few hours, and then you can head to the gym! [6] X Research source You can hang them in your bedroom, bathroom, or front porch, for example."
