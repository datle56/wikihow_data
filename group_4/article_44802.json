      "content": "Bright lights and loud noises can worsen migraine symptoms. When you feel a migraine coming on, the best thing you can do is find a quiet, dark place where you can relax. If you can fall asleep, do so! You might feel better when you wake up. [1] X Research source Migraines can make you a lot more sensitive to lights, sounds, and smells. Something that ordinarily wouldn't bother you can make you miserable when you have a migraine. If you're at work or school and can't fully relax or take a nap, do what you can to minimize sensory stimuli around you. For example, you might go to the bathroom for a few minutes and turn the lights off."

      "content": "When you feel a migraine coming on, sniff lavender oil for 10-15 minutes. Buy a bottle of lavender essential oil online or wherever natural remedies are sold. Simply putting the bottle under your nose and inhaling deeply can make your migraine less severe than it would have been. [2] X Research source At least one clinical trial has shown that lavender oil was a safe and effective treatment for managing migraine severity. You can also dab the oil on your temples and under your nose so you can inhale it without having to hold the bottle. Dilute the oil before applying it topically so you don't irritate your skin—just use 1 drop of oil per teaspoon (5cc) of carrier oil (vegetable or nut oil) or water. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Place a hot or cold compress on your head or neck for 15-20 minutes. You can use an ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables for a cold compress. For hot, use a heating pad on low or a hot water bottle. [4] X Research source Both hot and cold work to ease pain, although one might work better than the other for you. Try both and see which one gives you the most relief. Always wrap your compress in a dry towel before you place it on your body—otherwise, it could burn or irritate your skin."

      "content": "Breathe slowly and deeply in through your nose, then out through your mouth. Turn your attention to your breath and think about all the air going into your body and expanding your lungs. As you exhale, think about squeezing all the air back out. Do this for 10-15 breath cycles, focusing on your breath. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your mind turns to something else, that's fine! Just acknowledge the thought, then turn your attention back to your breath. Studies show meditation and deep breathing are particularly effective at relieving tension and stress, which are key migraine triggers. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "These remedies are most effective for mild migraines. If you have a more severe migraine, over-the-counter (OTC) remedies might offer some relief, but they probably won't stop the migraine completely. These remedies may include ibuprofen, aspirin, acetaminophen, naproxen, or caffeine. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In the US, there are 3 OTC drugs specifically approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating migraines: Excedrin Migraine, Advil Migraine, and Motrin Migraine Pain. Follow the instructions on the bottle carefully regarding dosage and don't take these drugs more than 3 times a week—you could develop a dependency. If you have more than 3 migraines a week, prescription drugs might be more effective for you."

      "content": "A small amount of caffeine can help relieve migraine pain. This works best if you grab a soda or a cup of coffee at the onset of migraine pain. If you take an over-the-counter pain reliever (such as acetaminophen) at the same time, the caffeine might enhance the effects of that drug—a one-two punch that might just knock that migraine out (or at least dull it to the point that it's manageable). [8] X Research source Before you order that espresso, though, check the ingredients of any medications you're taking to make sure they don't also include caffeine. If you're taking a drug for migraine relief that includes caffeine, you don't want to add more on top of that. When it comes to caffeine and migraines, a little goes a long way. Too much caffeine can actually trigger a migraine for some people, so you're walking a fine line here. Limit yourself to a single drink or a few bites of chocolate to play it safe.

Your doctor can recommend a combination that could potentially work for you based on your overall health condition and the medications or supplements you're already taking. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The herbs butterbur and feverfew are also sometimes recommended for migraines. You can take them in capsule form or drink a tea. There's some clinical evidence that they work, but the results are mixed. Butterbur, in particular, has safety concerns, so only take this if your doctor recommends it. [11] X Research source"

You won't see an immediate benefit, but studies have shown that migraines get better with regular yoga practice that continues for at least 3 months. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to be super flexible to do yoga—there are plenty of easy poses that provide the same benefits as the more complicated ones. If you're too shy to join a local class, there are plenty of videos on YouTube you can use to practice on your own at home. Yoga practice typically includes deep-breathing and relaxation exercises as well, which are beneficial in and of themselves to treat migraines."

      "content": "Studies show a weekly massage can decrease the frequency of migraines. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Ask your doctor if there's a massage therapist they would recommend, or search online for \"licensed massage therapists near me.\" Let the massage therapist you choose know that you suffer from migraines so they can tailor their massage therapy to meet your needs. Massage helps reduce tension in your body and release stress, which likely contributes to its ability to treat migraines. Self-massage is also helpful when you feel a migraine coming on. Use light pressure with your fingertips to massage in gentle circles or a back-and-forth motion on your temples and scalp. Focus on the muscles underneath rather than simply letting your fingers glide over your skin. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep a headache journal to identify triggers so you know what to avoid. Migraines can be triggered by certain foods, drinks, weather, or events going on in your life. Write down the circumstances surrounding the onset of the migraine, including as much detail as possible. Then, go back and look at your accounts for several migraines. Highlight commonalities—these are possible triggers. [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Once you've identified possible triggers, avoid them if you can and see if you have fewer migraines. For example, if you get a migraine every time you eat a hot dog, you might find that if you don't eat hot dogs anymore, those migraines go away. Sometimes a trigger is unavoidable. For example, suppose you discover that you always get a migraine when there's a thunderstorm. You can't exactly avoid thunderstorms (since you can't control the weather), but if you know thunderstorms trigger migraines, you can take preventive action when you know a thunderstorm is coming."

This either stops the migraine in its tracks or keeps it from getting too severe. Preventive drugs you take regularly (often daily) to reduce the frequency of migraines and decrease their severity when you get them. Here are some drugs your doctor might recommend: [16] X Research source Triptans: available as pills, shots, or nasal sprays, taken at the onset of a migraine to alleviate symptoms Dihydroergotamines: available as a nasal spray or injection; most beneficial to alleviate symptoms of migraines that would normally last more than 24 hours Tricyclic antidepressants: prescribed to prevent migraines Anti-seizure drugs: prescribed to prevent migraines"
