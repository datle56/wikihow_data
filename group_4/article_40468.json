      "content": "Sprinkle sprinkle is another way of saying “bless your heart.” According to the creator of the term, YouTube dating coach SheRaSeven, “sprinkle sprinkle” was originally her way of saying “bless your heart” or “blessings and abundance to you.” Depending on the context, the phrase can be used sincerely or sarcastically, but it’s mostly used as a criticism. [1] X Research source The phrase is typically used in relation to men’s finances. For example, you might say “If you can’t afford to pay for both of our meals, maybe you aren’t in a position to date. Sprinkle sprinkle.” SheRa has stated that the phrase can also mean things like “Thank you,” “I agree,” or “Back at you.” As her videos have become more popular, however, it’s become the catchphrase to her dating advice. According to Influencer and Content Creator Aaron Makelky, this phrase is more common among millennials rather than Gen Z. Most teenagers don't use this phrase."

[9] X Research source Many supporters of the Sprinkle Sprinkle Movement believe in and support transactional love, in which people expect to get something in return for their affection. This can be seen with the rise of sugar daddy culture and sites like Only Fans. The movement encourages women to “lean back” in dating situations and allow the man to take the lead. This includes things like women refusing to split the bill and not initiating conversations. Women who support the movement are encouraged to work on self-love and prioritize their own passions rather than changing for a man."

      "content": "Some believe the movement is anti feminist. In addition to prioritizing money, the Sprinkle Sprinkle movement reinforces traditional gender roles by encouraging women to embrace their femininity and men to take on the role of the provider. Many people feel that the movement is both anti feminist and manipulative. [10] X Research source Critics also believe this is privileged advice, as many women can’t afford to rely on a man financially or they don’t desire a traditional relationship. Others disagree and see the movement as a way to achieve financial independence, especially for marginalized groups like women of color. They believe the critique of the movement is a result of white feminism and that it seeks to reinforce neo-liberal feminism’s focus on the power and privilege of affluent white women."
