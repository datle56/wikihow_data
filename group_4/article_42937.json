      "content": "Avoid stones with creative names. Overly descriptive terms and names are usually a sign that a stone isn’t what the seller claims. Look for simply labeled semi-precious stones when you’re shopping for gem. If you’re unsure of whether or not a stone’s name means that it’s fake, you can always consult a list of misleading gemstone names online to find out by visiting https://www.gemsociety.org/article/list-false-misleading-gemstone-names/ . Stones with names like Oriental emerald, American ruby, or Australian jade could be a green sapphire, a garnet, or treated quartz respectively. If they’re real, they’ll just be called emeralds, rubies, or jade."

      "content": "Inspect the stone’s backing for signs of enhancement. Fake gemstones are sometimes mounted on top of foil to give the stone added luster or to change its color. Real gemstones do not need their luster to be exaggerated, and are typically mounted on a solid black setting. If you are purchasing a gemstone online and only have photographs to consult, a fake gemstone will usually be unusually brilliant in color and have perfect lines running through it."

      "content": "Use a jeweler’s loupe to search for inclusions and blemishes. Inclusions (materials trapped inside the stones as they form) or blemishes are a sign that a gemstone is real. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong. It just means that as the stone was growing, it got a little crack for natural reasons. If you don’t see any inclusions or blemishes in the stone using a jeweler’s loupe (a special magnifying lens), it’s a good indication that the stone is glass or synthetic. [1] X Research source You should also look for scratches on the gemstone. Most gemstones are hard and durable, so scratches or other signs of external damage indicate that the stone isn’t real. [2] X Research source Jeweler’s loupes come with either a single lens or with 3 lenses. A single lens loupe is generally cheaper but of lower quality. Most professional jewelers use a loupe with a 10x magnification. Keep the focal length (distance between the loupe and gem) in mind. A longer focal length means a weaker magnification, and vice versa."

      "content": "Figure out what type of stone the bead is meant to be. You can ask the original seller what type of stone the bead is meant to be. If the seller is unavailable, you can also use a gemstone identification guide as a reference by visiting http://www.minerals.net/ , which will give you an approximate idea of the visual characteristics of each gemstone. You should focus in particular on the hue (color), tone (how dark or light the color is), and saturation (the intensity of the color). [3] X Research source The hue will help you identify the general type of stone, while the tone and saturation will help you pinpoint the specific variation of that stone you possess. [4] X Research source A high value emerald, for example, will be blueish green or pure green, with a light tone and vivid saturation (it should be almost transparent). [5] X Research source Using a light source like a desk lamp can make your inspection of the stone easier. [6] X Research source"

Some gemstones require different or more involved tests than the teeth test to determine whether they are real or fake. Such tests can be found with a simple Google search. [8] X Research source To test amber, see if it floats in water. Real amber will float, fakes will sink. [9] X Research source To test jet, rub it with sandpaper. If it is fake, it will produce brown dust. If it’s real, it won’t produce any dust. [10] X Research source You can also test jet by inserting a hot needle into the stone. A fake stone will bubble and produce an acrid smell, a real stone won’t be affected. [11] X Research source To test if jade is fake, hold it up to a light source to search for inclusions. Fake jade will be flawless. [12] X Research source You can also lightly strike the jade with glass or metal. If it’s real, the jade will make a tinkling sound. [13] X Research source"
