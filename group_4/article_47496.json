      "title": "Wear slim-cut pants to showcase the shape of your Crocs.",
      "content": "Wear slim-cut pants to showcase the shape of your Crocs. Skinny, straight, and fitted bootcut styles tend to do the best job of highlighting your slip-ons without looking like you're modeling them ironically. Looser trousers that taper near the ankles can be a good choice, too. If you're going to wear Crocs, you might as well display them proudly! [1] X Research source Crocs also make a good match for capris and rolled or high-ankled slacks that make the contours of the shoe fully visible. [2] X Research source Fashion experts recommend not wearing Crocs with flared jeans or excessively baggy bottoms. As awkward as some people think they look already, keeping them partially covered is even more awkward."

      "title": "Frame your Crocs with mid-length shorts, dresses, and skirts.",
      "content": "Frame your Crocs with mid-length shorts, dresses, and skirts. As with longer pants, your goal with shorter garments is to achieve just the right leg-to-shoe ratio. Styles that hit just below the knee are a winner in this departmentâ€”they allow the eye to transition seamlessly from top to bottom with no jarring gaps. [3] X Research source The higher your hemline, the more of a no-man's-land there will be between your bottoms and your shoes. Similarly, extra-long items often hang a little too low, but not low enough to create the streamlined profile of capris. This can cause you to look stunted as a result."

      "title": "Put on a hat to balance out your bulky shoes.",
      "content": "Put on a hat to balance out your bulky shoes. Crocs are almost comically large compared to most shoes, which means you could run the risk of looking bottom-heavy if you don't have much going on up top. The right piece of headgear can not only complete the look you're going for but restore order to your head-foot dynamic. [5] X Research source Styles with wide brims will help cancel out the appearance of mismatched proportions. Pass on things like flat-bills, beanies, and novelty hats, as these are more likely to feed into the juvenile look that's commonly associated with the shoes."

      "title": "Make sure your Crocs match the rest of your outfit.",
      "content": "Make sure your Crocs match the rest of your outfit. No matter what you decide to wear your Crocs with, it's important to treat at them as part of a comprehensive ensemble, like any other accessory. As a rule, you want to prioritize colors that go together and steer clear of those that don't, but ultimately the combinations you go with will depend on your sense of style. Solid black and white shoes will be the easiest to coordinate with a wide range of other clothing items."

      "title": "Save your Crocs for casual outfits only.",
      "content": "Save your Crocs for casual outfits only. Crocs are about as laid back as it gets. For this reason, it's best to avoid wearing them with button-down shirts, slacks, formal blouses, and anything else that's remotely dressy. If not matched wisely, they could even make in-between items like polo shirts seem sloppy. [6] X Research source Crocs fall into the same basic category as flip flops. If you wouldn't wear flip-flops to a particular place or event, play it safe and leave the Crocs at home, too. Don't use designer jeans or chinos try to bridge the gap between casual and dressy. You'll only end up looking like you don't know how to dress yourself."

      "title": "Pick out Crocs in a neutral color if you want to keep them low-key.",
      "content": "Pick out Crocs in a neutral color if you want to keep them low-key. Inconspicuous shades like black, white, and navy blue will help make sure your footwear doesn't look too out of place with the rest of your wardrobe. Gray, brown, olive green and similar earth tones might also serve to tie together outfits that have a more neutral palette. Crocs' patented bulbous, chunky design is instantly recognizable, so picking up a pair in lime green or fuchsia will only make them stand out even more."

      "title": "Stick to simple, monochromatic outfits to avoid looking overly busy.",
      "content": "Stick to simple, monochromatic outfits to avoid looking overly busy. Since Crocs often come in bold colors, sporting a pair with a lot of eye-catching hues, patterns, or designs could have a somewhat tacky effect. Let vibrant Crocs lend or complement the main color scheme for your outfit and keep your other garments understated, or vice-versa. [7] X Research source If you bought your Crocs in a neutral color, you'll have quite a bit more leeway when it comes to choosing an outfit."

      "content": "Add some volume to your hair to offset the size of your shoes. Another way to avoid looking like a toddler who tried on mom or dad's slippers is to place more emphasis on your head and face. Try pulling your hair up into a high ponytail or oversized messy bun, or teasing it out to give it a little extra dimension. [8] X Research source If you have naturally curly or wavy hair, let it come out to play in all its glory to balance out your base. More formal hairstyles like tight buns and elaborate updos may look odd above a pair of squishy, brightly-colored Crocs."

      "content": "Rock your Crocs with confidence. Crocs sometimes get a bad rap in the fashion world for being ugly, childish, or impractical, but don't let this discourage you from being seen in your favorite pair. At the end of the day, they're just shoes. Just stand tall and savor the luxurious feeling they give your feet! The best way to pull off any type of clothing is to make sure you're wearing it rather than the other way around."

      "content": "Reach for your Crocs when you need to run errands. Crocs are perfect for casual tasks like checking the mail, walking the dog, or making a spur-of-the-moment trip to the grocery store. Their open heel and spacious footbed make them a breeze to slip on and off, and they're supportive enough to stand and walk in for long periods of time. [9] X Research source Crocs can also be super handy when you're headed to the pool or a yoga class."

      "title": "Throw on some Crocs before working in the yard.",
      "content": "Throw on some Crocs before working in the yard. Many gardening enthusiasts love the feeling of freedom and convenience that Crocs offer. Unlike other shoes, they won't stain when they get muddy. All it takes is a quick cleaning to get them looking as good as new again. When you're finished for the day, simply hose off or wipe down your Crocs and set them aside until you need them again. Crocs don't provide much in the way of stability, so they may not be the best choice for serious outdoor labour like mowing, weed eating, or anything else that calls for sure footing."

      "content": "Switch to Crocs to stay comfortable at work. Crocs are popular choice of footwear in many fast-paced industries, including healthcare, food service, and hospitalities. If you're accustomed to spending hours on your feet every day, they may be just the thing you need to relieve your tired, aching feet. [10] X Research source Before you show up to your place of employment in a brand new pair of Crocs, double-check the dress code to make sure they're an acceptable form of footwear. Crocs may be a no-go at workplaces that require closed-toed shoes due to their partially open construction. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear Crocs for wet and water-based activities. Crocs were originally designed as a boating shoe. This means that both the insole and outsole are molded for maximum traction. They're grippy enough to handle anything from a stroll on a rainy day to a hardcore kayaking session. [12] X Research source Crocs dry much faster than other types of footwear because of their slick rubbery material and many drainage holes. [13] X Research source The holes that allow Crocs to drain so quickly can also prove to be a downside if your goal is to keep your feet dry. In this case, you'll be better off gearing up with a proper pair of rain boots."

      "content": "Invest in a pair of fleece-lined Crocs to stay warm in the winter. There's no need to limit your footwear selection to stiff, heavy boots when the weather starts to turn cold. Lined Crocs make it possible to enjoy the same signature comfort that the brand is famous for with an added layer of heat-trapping insulation for a cozier feel. [14] X Research source You can even go clomping through the snow in your fleece-lined Crocs thanks to their fully waterproof uppers."
