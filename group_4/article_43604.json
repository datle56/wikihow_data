      "title": "Get your crush's phone number.",
      "content": "Get your crush's phone number . The best time to do this is when you're in the middle of a really great conversation. Drop the request in really casually and make it seem really low pressure. Say something simple, like \"Hey, why don't we trade cell numbers? The moment after a phone number exchange can be a little awkward. Make sure that you don't miss a beat. Keep the conversation flowing so that the number exchange seems completely natural."

      "content": "Have a plan. Before you send your first message have a plan of what you are going to say or what you want to achieve by the end of the conversation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Send your first text.",
      "content": "Send your first text. A simple \"What's up (name)?\" or \"What are you up to?\" is a good conversation starter. If your crush replies that they're watching television, listening to music or playing a game, reply by asking about what they're watching, listening to or playing. Whatever your crush says, you want to be ready with a follow-up question to keep the conversation flowing . Your crush may say something along the lines of, \"I'm doing my homework.\" In reply, you can say something like \"We got loads, didn't we? Mine took ages to finish!\" Or if your crush doesn't go to your school you could say, \"Oh poor you! Ha, did you get a lot?\" Tell your crush what you're up to as well. When your crush texts you letting you know what he or she is doing, send a reply like, \"That's cool. I'm just checking Facebook\" or whatever else you're actually doing at the time."

      "title": "Observe how your crush acts.",
      "content": "Observe how your crush acts . Look for clues in the conversation to see whether the person is enjoying texting back and forth, whether the person has had enough of the conversation or whether you're ready to step it up and ask your crush on a date. If the answers to your texts are really short or clipped, then you should probably text back something like, \"Okay, catch you later,\" or \"See you later, alligator!\" (Cute texting move)Don't read too much into it. The person could be really busy or in a bad mood. Just make sure that you don't make yourself look desperate or needy by trying to push a conversation when it isn't happening. When your crush responds by asking you questions, like \"What are you doing?\" then you know that he or she wants to keep talking. Just let the conversation flow naturally. However, make sure they are the one to end the conversation. Be talkative and forward. Look for chances to take it to the next level. If the conversation starts to get intense or veers to really personal subjects, or if your crush starts to confide in you about a problem, then you can say, \"Why don't you call me so that we can talk? I want to get together sometime, maybe.\" Be bold . If you know the time is right, ask your crush on a date. If they reject, remember there are plenty of fish in the sea!"

If you're texting your crush just before Christmas or right before their birthday, then ask your crush about the plans they have for celebrating. If you're texting the person just after a holiday, send a text that says, \"Hey, did you have a good birthday? Get anything special?\" Learn about holidays that you don't celebrate. For example, if your crush celebrates Hanukkah while you celebrate Christmas, ask questions to learn what their holiday is about. Text your crush around New Year's Day and ask if the person made any New Year's resolutions. Share your resolutions back."
