      "content": "Determine your goals. Your primary goal is raising awareness, but you need to narrow that to more specific goals. For instance, create specific goals like \"Influence people who make policy decisions.\" Your awareness campaign may be smaller; maybe you mainly want to influence people who have the power to make changes, such as school officials or upper level management at work.

Do you want them to vote for more tax money to be put towards education? Do you want them to donate to schools? Do you want them to vote in favor of teacher raises? Do you want them to contact their local officials? You can have more than one action you want people to take, but you should know ahead of time what you want those actions to be."
