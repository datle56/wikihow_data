      "content": "Take long blinks before the staring contest starts. You won’t be able to blink for a long time, so try to keep your eyes closed right until you begin the contest. That way, your eyes stay moist and you have a good starting position. [1] X Research source Most people will not allow eye drops during a staring contest, but you can use them before the contest starts to add extra moisture to your eyes."

      "title": "Look into the person’s eyes instead of at their face.",
      "content": "Look into the person’s eyes instead of at their face. Your opponent will probably try to distract you so you blink first, so keep your focus on making eye contact. Avoid looking at their mouth or hands, and stare directly into their pupils instead. If the person does something funny, avoid having a strong reaction but acknowledge them. Either nod your head or quietly say “Okay” so you don’t break focus. If your opponent tries to make you laugh, think of something that makes you sad or upset."

      "title": "Squint when your eyes feel dry.",
      "content": "Squint when your eyes feel dry. If you feel like you need to blink, slightly squint to help remoisten them. Make sure you don’t close your eyes all the way or squint too much, because it might be confused as a blink. When you feel tears starting to form, open your eyes again."

      "title": "Let your mind wander during the contest.",
      "content": "Let your mind wander during the contest. Rather than thinking about keeping your eyes open, think of a topic you find deeply interesting. This can help you stare for longer while you’re deep in thought, and it makes you less likely to get distracted. Just make sure that you don’t let your mind wander too much, or you might accidentally blink without realizing it. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Stay calm and relaxed throughout the contest.",
      "content": "Stay calm and relaxed throughout the contest. You’re more likely to blink if you’re feeling anxious or uncomfortable. Make sure you’re sitting or standing in a comfortable position, and keep your body relaxed. Try to keep your eyes relaxed instead of forcing them wide open. Otherwise, your eyes may dry out quicker and force you to blink sooner."

      "title": "Try to make them laugh.",
      "content": "Try to make them laugh. Without breaking eye contact with the other person, try making funny noises or talk in a silly voice to get your opponent to laugh. Crack your favorite joke or make a funny face so your opponent blinks before you do. Try to learn your opponent’s sense of humor before you have a staring contest so you know what will make them laugh. Be careful not to do something so funny that you make yourself laugh. Try to catch your opponent off guard by whispering a silly word, like “pickle” or “banana.”"

Yawns tend to be “contagious” so your opponent may need to yawn right after you and it could cause them to blink if they aren’t prepared.
