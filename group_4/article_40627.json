These tactics have been developed over years of experience in the industry and are followed by most successful casinos. Employ the same strategies to give yourself a competitive edge. The following are some common strategies: Provide free stuff. Casinos often provide free gifts, drinks, and rooms (if they are also hotels) to patrons to make them feel like they have more money to spend on gambling. Generally, their losses make up for these expenses. Disguise the time of day. Casinos often don't have any clocks or windows so that customers spend more time gambling than they mean to. Emphasize wins and hide losses. Casinos disallow photo and video equipment on their game floors to hide the reality of losses and set off sirens and lights to emphasize wins. This encourages customers to think that they can win. [2] X Research source"
