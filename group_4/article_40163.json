      "content": "A sore loser is someone who becomes very angry when they don’t win. After losing a game or contest, a sore loser might show their frustration by slamming doors, arguing with referees, or complaining about how the whole thing was rigged. Instead of accepting defeat gracefully , they blame everyone else for their loss, and they don’t show good sportsmanship. [1] X Research source Here are some examples of how this term is used in conversation: “We hosted a game night at our apartment last weekend, and Josh was being such a sore loser. He complained that the rules of the board games were stupid, and he accused everyone of cheating.” “My daughter just joined a soccer league, and she’s been a bit of a sore loser. She gets really frustrated when her team doesn’t win, and sometimes she refuses to shake hands with the other players.” “When I got the promotion over my coworker, he was definitely a sore loser. He told everyone that he was the one who deserved it, and that he only got passed over because our boss plays favorites.”"

      "content": "If your child is a sore loser, work on teaching them good sportsmanship. Whether your child plays a sport or competes in academic or artistic contests, it’s important to teach them how to be a good sport. Learning to lose gracefully is crucial to your child’s behavior development, and it sets them up to manage disappointment in a healthy way later in life. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Here are some tips: Talk to your child about good sportsmanship before a game or a contest. Tell them that teamwork and playing with integrity, are more important than winning or losing. Validate your child’s feelings if they're frustrated with a loss. Tell them that it’s normal to be upset, and that it’s something we all go through. Encourage your child to process their feelings in a healthy way, whether that means talking them out with you or writing about them in a journal. Don’t compare your child to other players or peers. This can put undue pressure on them and harm their self-esteem, rather than motivating them. Praise your child, even when they lose. Point out the things they did well, and tell them that all that matters is that they did their best. When your child wins, remind them not to gloat, and encourage them to be respectful of the other players and competitors. [3] X Research source Set an example with your own behavior. When frustrating things happen to you, model the response you’re hoping to teach your child.
