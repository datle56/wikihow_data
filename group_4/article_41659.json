      "content": "Roll up the wet towel with a dry towel to squeeze out excess moisture. Lay a dry towel on a flat surface and place the wet towel on top. Start from one end and roll the two towels together into a tight burrito-shape, squeezing the roll as you go. The dry towel will absorb some of the moisture from the wet gym towel, leaving it much drier than before. Note that this is only useful if your gym towel is sopping wet. If your gym provides towels in the locker room, use one of those so you only have 1 towel to deal with. Make sure the dry towel is larger than or equal in size to the wet towel."

      "title": "Use a hairdryer or hand dryer to quick-dry a damp gym towel.",
      "content": "Use a hairdryer or hand dryer to quick-dry a damp gym towel. Some gym locker rooms are stocked with hair-dryers. If that's the case, hang the towel up on a nearby rack or hold it with one hand while you blast it with hot hair with your other hand. As an alternative, hold the towel under a hand drying vent. If there's available counter space and the towel is small enough, lay it flat and hold it down as you dry one side. Then flip it over to dry the other side."

      "title": "Hang the towel on a wire rack for 1 to 2 hours if possible.",
      "content": "Hang the towel on a wire rack for 1 to 2 hours if possible. If you have time to spare after working out or showering, hang the towel on a wire rack in the locker room for at least 1 hour. If your gym doesn't have wire racks, a hook will work just as well, just be sure to rotate the towel after about 30 minutes so the folds aren’t holding moisture for an extended period of time. [1] X Research source You can also drape it over the side of an opened locker door. Take some time to read or get some work done while you're waiting. If you go straight to work after the gym, consider draping the towel over a bathroom stall door or in another discreet location. If your work culture is relatively laid back, it might be okay to do this."

      "title": "Place the towel in a wet sack by itself.",
      "content": "Place the towel in a wet sack by itself. If you're an avid gym-goer, you may want to invest in a waterproof bag or wet sack for your soiled workout gear and towels. Most of these bags have antimicrobial linings, which can prevent bacteria from growing. Just be sure to take out the towel and other wet items and wash them that same day. Antimicrobial waterproof sacks cost anywhere from $15.00 to $42.00 and you can find them online or at most sports or fitness supply stores. This is a great option if you go straight from the gym to work and don't have time to dry the towel."

      "title": "Store the damp towel in a plastic zipper bag until you get home.",
      "content": "Store the damp towel in a plastic zipper bag until you get home. If you're short on time and don't have drying space, tossing the damp towel in a plastic bag may be your best bet. Use a large, heavy-duty freezer bag and be sure to leave the seal open about 1 inch (2.5 cm) before storing it in your gym bag to prevent condensation. [2] X Research source Take the towel out of the bag as soon as you're home and hang it up to dry fully until laundry day or wash it right away. Don't forget about the towel in the bag because mold and mildew can start growing around the 24-hour mark. If the towel smells moldy when you take it out, soak it in 5 parts water and 1 part white vinegar to remove the smell."

      "content": "Invest in a quick-drying towel you can store quickly after using it. Microfiber, hydro-cotton, and waffle-patterned towels will dry much faster than regular bath towels. If you sweat a lot or like to shower at the gym, consider getting one you can use and stow away without worrying about excess moisture in your bag. You should still take the towel out as soon as you can to wash it."

      "content": "Buy a gym bag with a built-in wet sack. If you’re regularly dealing with a wet towel, consider investing in a gym bag that has a compartment for wet items. Look for one made from polyester fabric with an outside pocket or compartment for wet items. [3] X Research source Make sure the bag is small enough to fit inside your gym locker."

      "content": "Use a deodorizing spray to keep your gym bag smelling fresh. Running shoes, sweaty activewear, and damp towels are sure to leave behind an unpleasant scent in your bag. Dump out everything in your gym bag every day or every other day and spray the inside with a deodorizing spray to get rid of lingering smells. You can also place 1 or 2 dryer sheets in your gym bag."

      "content": "Wring out the towel so it's not dripping wet. If you're planning to put the wet towel in your car, make sure it's not sopping wet. If you can squeeze water droplets out of the towel, it's too wet to put in the car. Wring it out more or let it hang somewhere for 5 to 10 minutes before you put it in the car. [4] X Research source Excessive moisture can damage leather and cloth seats and may even leave your car smelling like mold or mildew."

      "content": "Hang the towel from a coat hanger in your car if possible. If you drive to the gym, drape the towel over a hanger and hang it from one of the fold-out hooks in the back seat. If you don't have fold-out hooks, hang the hanger from one of the grab bars (or roof handles) in the backseat or on the passenger's side. Make sure the towel isn't blocking your line of sight through the rear-view mirror."

      "content": "Drape the towel over the passenger's seat if you're going home soon. If you don't have hangers in your car, drape the towel over the passenger's seat to allow the most airflow. Just make sure you're going home right away or within a few hours—mold and mildew can build up if you leave it lying against the seat for too long. [5] X Research source If you're worried about damaging leather upholstery, place a dry towel down first so it sits between the leather and the wet towel. You can also use a trash bag or protective seat cover if you have one."

      "content": "Deodorize your car seats and floor mats to keep odors at bay. If you’re regularly drying your gym towel in your car, the seats and mats may start to develop an odor. Use a pre-made deodorizing upholstery spray once a week or do a deep clean every other week to keep your car smelling fresh. [6] X Research source Sprinkle baking soda on your cloth seats and floor mats and let it sit for 2 to 3 hours before vacuuming them clean. Spray leather car seats with a mixture of 1 part white vinegar and 2 parts water. Let it sit for 1 minute before drying the seats with a towel."
