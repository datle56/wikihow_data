      "content": "Understand the pronunciation of words in Rastafarian. Rastafarian survives as a spoken language, so pronunciation is very important when trying to speak Rastafarian. In Rastafarian, you do not pronounce “h” in English words. So “thanks” becomes “tanks”, “three” becomes “tree”, etc. Similarly, Rastafarians do not pronounce “th” in English words. So, “the” become “di”, “them” becomes “dem”, and “that” becomes “dat”."

      "content": "Learn the use of “I and I”. In Rastafarian, “I and I”, pronounced “eye an’ eye”, is an important term. It refers to the oneness of Jah (Rastafari for their “God”, the Ethiopian Emperor Ras Tafari Haile Selassie I) [3] X Research source in every person. “I and I” is a term that reinforces the Rastafarian belief that Jah exists in all people, and everyone exists as one people, unified by Jah. “I and I” can be used to replace “you and I” in a sentence. Such as,: “And I going to de concert.” This means you and someone else are going to a concert. But it can also be used when talking about something you are doing alone, or a shorthand for “me, myself, and I”. Such as: “I and I going to de concert”. This means you are going to a concert, on your own. [4] X Research source “I” is also used as a play on certain English words, such as “I man” for “inner man”, or a Rastafari believer. Rastas will say “Inity”, instead of “unity”."

      "content": "Learn how to say “hello”, “goodbye”, and “thank you”. Most Rastafarians do not use certain words in the English language as they have devil-like connotations. For example, the word “hello” is not used because it contains the word “hell” and “lo”, referring to “low”. To say “hello”, use: “Wa gwaan” or “Yes I”. To say “goodbye”, use: “Me a go”, or “Lickle bit”. To say “thank you”, use: “Give thanks” or “Praise Jah”. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Understand the words “Rasta” “Jah Jah”, and “dread.” A Rastafarian will refer to themselves as a “Rasta”, or call other Rastafarians “Rasta.” [6] X Research source “Jah Jah” is used to praise Jah or refer to Jah. For example: “Jah Jah protect mi fram mi enemy dem.” In English, this means: “Jehovah protect me from my enemies.” “Dread” refers to the dreadlocks worn as a spiritual practice by Rastafarians. It is also used to describe something or someone who is a Rastafarian, or seen as a positive influence. For example: “Dread, mon.” In English, this means: “Cool, man.” Or, “Natty dread.” In English, this means: “You’re cool” or “You’re a Rasta.” A person who does not have dreadlocks is called a “ball head”, a play on the term “bald head”. For example, Bob Marley sings in his song “Crazy Baldheads” [7] X Research source : “Wi guh chase dem crazy Ball head outta town.” This translates to: “We gonna chase those crazy people without dreads out of town”.

      "content": "Learn common Rastafarian words like “Babylon”, “politricks” and “irie”. These are keywords in the Rastafarian, as they refer to important concepts in Rastafarian culture. “Babylon” is the Rastafarian word for the police, who are viewed by Rastafarians as part of a corrupt government system. “Babylon”, which refers to the Biblical rebellion against God through the Tower of Babel, can also be used to describe any person or organization that oppresses the innocent. For example: “Babylon deh cum, yuh hav nutten pan yuh?” In English, this translates to: “The police are coming, do you have anything on you?” “Politricks” is the Rasta term for “politics”. There is a general skepticism of authority figures in Rastafarian, including politicians. So they are seen as tricksters, or full of “tricks”. “Irie” is one of the most important terms in Rastafarian. It embodies the positive outlook of Rastafarian culture and their belief that “everyting irie” or “everything is alright”. For example, “Mi nuh have nutten fi complain bout, mi life irie.” In English, this translates to: “I don’t have anything to complain about, my life is good.”"

So Rastas refer to people as their “Idren”, a version of the English word “children.” [9] X Research source A boy is called a “bwoy” by a Rasta. A girl is called a “gal” by a Rasta. If a Rasta is asking another Rasta about their children, they will refer to the children as “pickney”, or “gal pickney”. Rastas refer to adult males as “bredren”. Female adults are called “sistren”. A Rasta man will refer to their wife or girlfriend as their “empress” or “queen”.

      "content": "Understand the use of positive words over negative words. Rastas replace words that have negative terms like “down” or “under” with “up” or “out”. For example: Rastas will say “downpression” instead of “oppression”. This is because “op” is Rastafarian for “up”, so “downpression” indicates something is holding someone down. Rastas will say “overstanding” or “innerstanding” instead of “understanding”. Rastas will say “outernational” instead of “international”. This indicates the Rasta’s feeling that the rest of the world lies outside their realm or world."

      "content": "Understand the history of the language. The Rastafarian language grew out of the Rastafarian movement, a religious and social movement based in Jamaica. Though largely unorganized, the Rastafarians are united on several strong beliefs: The belief in the beauty of black people’s African heritage. The belief that Ras Tafari Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia, is the Biblical Messiah. He is also referred to as the Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah. This is why the lion is seen as a powerful symbol by Rastafarians. The belief in repatriation to Ethiopia, also referred to by Rastas as “Zion”, the true home and redemption of black people. The belief in the eventual fall of “Babylon”, the corrupt world of the white man, and a reversal of the power structure of slave and master."

      "content": "Learn the key sources of knowledge for the Rastafari movement. The Bible is the main holy text for Rastafarians. This is why Bob Marley’s lyrics, for example, are full of Biblical references to Exodus and the Holy Land. Rastas take Biblical study very seriously and will cite and discuss scriptural passages. They believe the scriptures tell the true story of the black man’s history. They also feel Christian ministers have misled people by providing incorrect interpretations of the Bible, especially the use of the Bible to justify slavery. Rastas also refer to other official documents like The Promised Key and The Living Testament of Rasta-for-I . But most scholars agree no central doctrine of Rastafarian exists, as Rastas are against following organized systems or schools of thought. Instead, Rastas believe a person should engage in reflection and interpretation of their experience and form their own personal convictions about the Rasta beliefs."

[14] X Research source Most Rastas follow the “I-tal” practice and some are vegetarians. Meat-eating Rastas usually abstain from eating pork, as pigs are seen as scavengers of the dead. Alcohol, coffee, milk, and flavored beverages like soda are also considered not “I-tal”. Often, Rastas will say: “Man a rasta man, mi only nyam ital food.” This translates to: “I am a Rastafarian, I only eat natural foods.”"

They do not believe in the end of life, or “last” part of life. Instead, Rastas believe in a continually living life, or having an immortal life. This does not necessary mean Rastas believe they will live forever. But they consider “everlasting life” a negative outlook on the fullness or “living”-ness of life."
