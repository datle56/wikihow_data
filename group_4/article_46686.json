The shape and type of pillow depends on whether you sleep on your back, side, or stomach. [1] X Research source U-shaped neck pillows wrap around your neck and work best if you sleep on your back. Half-moon pillows are narrow and have a rounded shape to support your neck, and they’re best if you sleep on your back or side. Contour pillows have a wavy shape with an indent to rest your head. These pillows are best if you sleep on your back or side. [2] X Research source"

Readjust the stuffing or find a thinner pillow. If you’re using a contour pillow, put the shorter side under your neck when you’re sleeping on your back and use the taller side for sleeping on your side.

When you sleep on your stomach, your spine, head, and neck are already aligned, so a flat pillow or no pillow at all will feel most comfortable.

Sleeping on your stomach forces you to turn your head in one direction, which could cause it to feel sore in the morning.

Then, turn the pillow around so the cushion is just below your chin. [7] X Research source Putting the opening at the back gives your head and neck more support if you lean forward while you’re sleeping. If you have an inflatable neck pillow , locate the air valve and blow it up before putting it on. If the pillow feels too firm, open the valve and slowly let air out. If you have a wrap-style travel pillow , wrap it completely around your neck so the built-in support rests on your shoulder."

      "content": "Recline your seat. Put your seat back by a few notches so you can feel more comfortable. Reclining supports your body in a more comfortable sleep position so you’re less likely to feel back pain when you wake up. [8] X Research source If you’re sleeping on a plane , bus, or train, be considerate of the person sitting behind you and avoid reclining all the way back. If you’re not able to recline, put a cushion or jacket behind your lower back to support your spine. When you’re choosing a seat on a plane, try to pick a window seat near the front. It’ll be less noisy, you’ll be able to lean against the wall, and you won’t get woken up if someone needs to get up to use the restroom."

Tilt your head so it rests on the pillow and keeps your neck supported while you sleep. If your neck pillow has stuffing such as beads or gel, bunch it up to one side to make it more firm and comfortable. Tie off the end with a hair tie or another item that will keep the stuffing from shifting."

      "content": "Consider other factors like your mattress and body size. Think about how soft your mattress is. If your mattress is on the softer side, it may cause your body to sink down more compared to your pillow. Get a softer or shorter pillow to compensate. If you have a smaller body frame, avoid thick or large neck pillows that could cause your head to tilt forward. If you get warm at night, consider a gel-foam cooling pillow or one filled with buckwheat hulls."
