      "title": "Stop drinking alcohol.",
      "content": "Stop drinking alcohol. This may seem like an obvious thing to do, but there is an urban myth that implies drinking more alcohol will get rid of a hangover. Technically, this is true. A hangover, including diarrhea, is caused as the alcohol withdraws from your system. If you keep a level of alcohol in your system, some of your hangover symptoms may go away, but only temporarily. The more alcohol you consume, the more you will damage your GI tract, which can cause long-term, permanent problems."

      "title": "Avoid eating high-fat and high-fibre foods to slow down digestion.",
      "content": "Avoid eating high-fat and high-fibre foods to slow down digestion. Alcohol consumption speeds up the processes in your GI tract, which causes diarrhea. Therefore, when you’re suffering from diarrhea you want to eat foods that will help slow down your digestion and give your GI tract the time it needs to absorb the proper nutrients. Stick to foods that are low in fat and don’t have much fibre. [1] X Research source High-fat foods speed up your digestive processes, which will just exacerbate your diarrhea issues. These types of foods include fried foods, processed meats, chips, fast food like cheeseburgers and fries, and desserts including candy bars. High-fibre foods increase the amount of water in your stool, which will cause more diarrhea, not less. These types of foods include cereals, whole-grain breads, beans, and whole-grain pastas."

      "title": "Stay away from dairy products while you’re recuperating from a hangover.",
      "content": "Stay away from dairy products while you’re recuperating from a hangover. When dairy products are digested, they produce lactose. Lactose stimulates the muscles in your GI tract and can increase the acid levels in your stomach. A stimulated GI tract and an acidic stomach can cause a lot of gastrointestinal issues, including diarrhea. Therefore, it’s a good idea to avoid dairy products until you’re feeling better. [2] X Research source Dairy products to avoid include milk, cheese, ice cream, and yogurt, especially if they're high in fat. The one exception to this rule is low-fat yogurt with probiotics. This type of yogurt will likely be more beneficial than harmful if you have diarrhea."

      "title": "Remember to eat ‘BRAT’ foods to help calm your stomach and GI tract.",
      "content": "Remember to eat ‘BRAT’ foods to help calm your stomach and GI tract. BRAT foods are bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These foods, plus soda crackers, eggs, and chicken, can all help your GI tract feel better and get rid of your diarrhea. In addition to not irritating your stomach and making you feel sick, these foods will also help keep you hydrated. [3] X Research source Other foods that will help resolve your diarrhea and will keep you hydrated include: soup, pretzels (for the salt), sports drinks, potatoes without the skin, and fruit juices.

      "title": "Take probiotics to help restore the balance of beneficial bacteria in your GI tract.",
      "content": "Take probiotics to help restore the balance of beneficial bacteria in your GI tract. Alcohol can affect the microflora, or beneficial bacteria, in your digestive system. Not only might it reduce the amount of good bacteria, it may allow for the increase of bad bacteria. Good bacteria is what keeps your digestive system functioning properly, including the elimination of diarrhea. Probiotics are a great option to help you restore the proper balance of bacteria in your digestive system. Probiotics are available at your local pharmacy or drugstore. Ask your pharmacist for help selecting the best one for you."

Smell the peppermint oil to help calm your stomach. As another option, mix it into a carrier oil and massage it onto your skin.

      "title": "Keep yourself hydrated with lots of clear fluids.",
      "content": "Keep yourself hydrated with lots of clear fluids. Alcohol does a lot of unfortunate things to your body, including decreasing the hormone vasopressin, which causes you to pee a lot more than normal. Plus, due to the faster processing happening in your GI tract, your colon is having trouble absorbing the proper amount of water you need to keep hydrated. This all means you need to keep up your intake of clear liquids so you do not get dehydrated. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Clear liquids can include water, tea, or broth. If your hangover has also caused you to vomit and/or feel nauseous, try sucking on ice cubes instead."

      "content": "Try over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications if needed. If the non-medicinal options don’t seem to be enough to make you feel better, you may want to consider taking an anti-diarrheal medication. Both brand name and generic versions of these medications are available at your local pharmacy. Speak to your pharmacist to determine your best option. [8] X Research source Keep in mind, however, that these medications do not cure diarrhea, they just help improve the symptoms. Even though these are over-the-counter medications, check with your pharmacist or doctor before taking them to ensure there are no negative interactions with other drugs you may be taking."

Even with the best intentions, you may find yourself excreting more liquids than you’re able to consume. If you find yourself with the following symptoms, it’s time to seek medical help: lightheadedness, excessive thirst, reduced urination or volume of urine, severe fatigue, dry mouth and/or skin, and dark-coloured urine.

Even if you aren’t experiencing the symptoms of dehydration, you’ll want to see your doctor if your diarrhea lasts longer than 48 hours.
