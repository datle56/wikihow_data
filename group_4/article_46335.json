      "content": "Wash your face. Before you apply any products to your skin, you should always wash your face. Use your regular cleanser and lukewarm water to give your face a gentle, thorough washing, making sure to remove any makeup during the process. [1] X Research source If you don't have a regular skin care cleanser, you can pick one up at a department store or drug store. Go for a gentle, pH-balanced cleanser with a smaller ingredients list that’s made specifically for your skin type--sensitive, dry, oily, or acne-prone, or normal. Wash your hands thoroughly before washing your face. Avoid using hot water to wash your face, as it can dry out your skin."

Serum or essences contain ingredients to address specific skin issues. You can purchase a serum to treat any skin problems you have a drug store. For example, if your skin has dark spots, look for a serum or essence designed to target discoloration. Work the serum or essence into your skin to finish up your routine. [5] X Research source There isn't a huge difference between serums or essences. Essences tend to be more lightweight, so they're a great choice if you prefer lighter products.
