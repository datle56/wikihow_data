      "title": "Goodwill bins are outlet stores that sell items in large bins at a discount.",
      "content": "Goodwill bins are outlet stores that sell items in large bins at a discount. The stores are filled with large blue bins full of last-chance items that didn’t sell after 6 weeks at standard Goodwill locations, or items that were in less-than-ideal condition when they were initially donated. [1] X Research source Anything that doesn’t sell at the Outlets gets recycled, or sold elsewhere as salvage items. Goodwill Outlets are located in most states in the U.S. Search online to see if there’s one near you."

      "title": "Many items are priced by the pound.",
      "content": "Many items are priced by the pound. The Outlets have a special pricing system where many of the goods for sale are sold by weight, calculated at checkout. Others are sold at steep discounts by individual item. The pricing system generally looks like: Houseware, clothes, shoes, accessories, and physical media: $1.69 per pound for a transaction up to 9.99 pounds, $1.49 per pound up to 24.99 pounds, and $1.19 per pound for transactions of 25+ pounds. Glass and dinnerware: $0.39 per piece Electronics: $0.49 per item Books: $0.15 per inch (measured by the thickness of the binding) Furniture: Priced on a per-item basis"

      "title": "The items in the bins are replaced on regular rotations.",
      "content": "The items in the bins are replaced on regular rotations. Each Outlet has its own rotation schedule, where old items are taken off the sale floor and new items are swapped in. [2] X Research source This makes it so that there’s a steady stream of new treasures to find. Shoppers are often asked to clear certain areas while new bins are wheeled in."

    {
      "title": "Shop with a cart and comfy shoes.",
      "content": "Shop with a cart and comfy shoes. Most Outlets are pretty big, and many shoppers quickly rack up a hoard of items, so you’ll want a cart to tote your fresh finds around in. Comfy shoes will ensure you can navigate the store without tiring your feet. Go ahead and put “maybe” items in your cart anyway. Most locations have “ditch” bins at the register where you’ll place items you decide you don’t want."

    {
      "title": "Scout the layout of the store to find out where to dig.",
      "content": "Scout the layout of the store to find out where to dig. Most Outlets are organized into sections like clothing, electronics, home goods, and other categories. Do a quick lap to familiarize yourself with your local store and plan your route through the bins. Be on the lookout for “unsorted donations” bins, which skipped other Goodwill stores when they were donated and may have more valuable items that haven’t been organized into other bins."

    {
      "title": "Wear gloves and be prepared to dig through bins.",
      "content": "Wear gloves and be prepared to dig through bins. Some Outlets require that shoppers wear a mask and gloves for sanitary reasons. [3] X Research source Even if they don’t require them, you’re digging through piles of used goods, so it’s a good call to wear them anyway to keep your hands clean and free of germs. Also, bring some sanitary wipes to clean off any grime you might find on an item you want."

    {
      "title": "Hit the bins after a new rotation to find the best items.",
      "content": "Hit the bins after a new rotation to find the best items. Each store has its own schedule for bin rotations, but many larger locations swap them out every 30 minutes. [4] X Research source Being the first to sift through a bin gives you a better shot at finding something that strikes your interest. If you’re unsure of the rotation schedule, ask an employee."

      "title": "Bring a thrifting kit with batteries and other useful items.",
      "content": "Bring a thrifting kit with batteries and other useful items. A few AAA and AA batteries are a must for trying out electronics. A measuring tape lets you find the dimensions of furniture to see if it’s a good fit for your home. Also, know your clothing sizes before you go, since there aren’t fitting rooms. [5] X Research source Snacks and water also make good additions to your kit. Be aware that some locations may not allow things like backpacks or large purses inside the store."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be courteous to employees and other shoppers.",
      "content": "Be courteous to employees and other shoppers. Give other shoppers enough space to go about their business, and avoid crowding or getting too territorial on a bin. Also, don’t rush a bin right as it’s coming out on rotation; wait for employees to give the go-ahead before you dive in. [6] X Research source Go right as the store opens, or near closing time, to beat the crowds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be open-minded, rather than looking for a specific item.",
      "content": "Be open-minded, rather than looking for a specific item. The bins are a mish-mash of random items, so looking for something specific is often a losing battle. Instead, go in with a treasure-hunter’s mindset: trust that you’ll find something good, even if it wasn’t what you expected. That said, it can be handy to keep a list of general items you’re hoping for on hand to check off as you shop, like lamps, shoes, a stereo, etc. Also, prepare to spend a good while inside the Outlet. It’s not an in-and-out affair, but more of a long adventure. It’s easy to lose track of time there! Note that many electronics can be resold online for parts, meaning a broken blender, stereo, or other appliance isn’t necessarily worthless."
