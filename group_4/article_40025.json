      "content": "Know how long it can last. A typical high will wear off in about three hours, with the main effects spiking about 30 minutes after you smoked. However, when you eat cannabis or take too much, the effect can take longer to wear off. Highs can last as long as six hours or more. They can also be unpredictable if the cannabis has other drugs mixed in. If you took an exceptionally high dose of cannabis, your high can last much longer. Taking too much can happen in cases where you are eating cannabis, and subsequently eat too much because it doesn't take effect as quickly as you thought it would. In fact, the drug can stay in your body for up to two days."

      "content": "Learn how to cope. Using a drug like marijuana is often a way to escape problems. Therefore, to help you get off the drug, you need to learn how to deal with stress without reaching for the drug. Rehabs and groups for addicts can be helpful, but you can also learn some coping mechanisms on your own. One way to help you cope with stress is to talk about it with people you trust. Even if you can't come up with a solution, sometimes just getting the stress off your chest by talking can help relieve it. Don't be afraid to take a break from a stressful situation. If something is really stressing you out, such as a work problem, don't be afraid to walk away from it for a bit. Take a moment to take a few deep breaths and clear your head. In addition, don't be afraid to take a break from things that stress you out in your life. For instance, if you find watching the news stressful, maybe you should skip it for awhile."
