The wrap will be done in three basic stages, applying ointment and gauze, wrapping in cotton for padding, and then taping the bandage to secure everything in place. Ointment goes directly on the wounded area. [4] X Expert Source Natalie Punt, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 15 February 2022. Clean the area first and then make sure you cover the entire injury with ointment. Gauze and cotton should cover the injury as well. These layers help add protection and keep the ointment where it needs to be. Tape will be applied in two ways. First, apply the tape lengthwise, down the dogs tail and over the gauze and cotton. Then apply rings around those first pieces of tape, starting at the tip and working down the tail."

The size of your dog's tail injury will vary, so you may need more or less tape to wrap the tail. However, you can cut about ten strips of the adhesive tape to the following sizes: [7] X Research source Two long pieces (eight inches) Six short pieces (four inches) Two half pieces (four inches in length, one half inch in width)"

Gently wrap the bandage around the wound and secure it with the narrow pieces of tape. [9] X Research source Don't tape or wrap anything too tightly. Try wrapping the tape down the tail in a spiral. You can also try wrapping the adhesive tape around the tail, at each end of the bandage. Make sure the gauze covers the wound fully."

Make sure there is enough cotton to fully cover the area and provide enough padding to keep it from further injury. [10] X Research source If you have a large piece of cotton, try wrapping it around the tail just like you would a bandage. Wrap the cotton around the tail entirely at the site of the injury. The cotton should fully cover the gauze and provide padding to the injured area. Carefully compress the cotton, making it conform to the shape of the tail. Be careful not to compress the cotton too forcefully as you may cause further injury to the tail."

The tape you are now adding will form the outside of the bandage as well as help to securely hold the gauze pad in place. These next pieces of tape will run lengthwise, down the dogs tail. [11] X Research source Place an eight inch piece of tape lengthwise, parallel to the tail, over the cotton. The tape will start and end on the dog's fur. Place a six inch piece of tape slightly askew of the first eight inch piece. It should start and end in the same places; however, it will be angled off to the right somewhat, covering the first piece only slightly. Add another six inch piece of tape in the same way, expect this time angle it to the left. You should have three pieces of tape now, covering the wound, lengthwise down the dog's tail. They should start and end in the fur, just past the ends of the gauze bandage."

These next few pieces of tape will encircle the tail in rings, similar to the way a mummy is wrapped. Add the last few pieces of tape in the following way: [12] X Research source Put a piece of tape around the first three pieces and your dog's tail. Start towards the tip of your dog's tail and work down. Add the next piece of tape, just below this one. It should go all the way around the dog's tail and cover the bandages and tape already affixed. Keep adding tape in this way until you have covered the length of the bandage. Make the last piece of tape overlaps the bandage, sticking to the fur of your dog's tail."

Wet bandages will trap infections. Most tail problems will heal in two weeks Visit your veterinarian if the wound doesn't seem to be healing."

      "content": "Keep things calm. Happy tail results from your dog either wagging his tail so hard that it bleeds or hitting his tail on a hard surface. If you are able to lower the level of excitement in your dog, you will lower the chances of continued injury to your dog's tail. If your dog gets overly excited when you return home, ignore them, until you get to a larger room that he can wag his tail in without worry of them striking a hard surface. If your dog gets excited about going on a walk, prepare for the walk in a larger room, giving them more space and avoiding any injury to his tail. Try to act calmly around your dog as this can result in calm behavior from them as well. Try using the “sit” command. By having your dog sit, it will reduce the amount of force that he can wag his tail with."

Leaving a bandage on will increase the chances of infection and won't allow the tail to heal as well as it could. Remove the old bandage by using the following methods: [15] X Research source For any areas of the bandage where the fur is stuck to the adhesive, try soaking them in vegetable or olive oil for a few minutes. These oils will help break down the adhesive and allow for easy removal. If your dogs wound is healed, you can also try using shampoo to remove the adhesive and painlessly take the bandage off. For small amounts of fur that are stuck to the bandage, you may simply cut the fur away with a pair of scissors. Exercise caution when cutting the bandage away as it is easy to accidentally cut the dogs tail. If you are not confident doing this, you could take your dog to the groomer. Pulling the bandage off will also pull your dogs hair out and cause it pain. Avoid this method of removal as your dog will come to fear bandages. Do not use any harsh chemicals such as nail polish or rubbing alcohol as these can be harmful to your dog."
