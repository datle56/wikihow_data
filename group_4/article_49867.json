    {
      "title": "Outline the screenplay.",
      "content": "Outline the screenplay. The script outline is a guide that includes a rough idea of the number of scenes in the movie. Most feature length scripts have 50-70 scenes and run about 100-120 pages long. They usually have three acts that include: [1] X Research source Act 1: This is where you introduce the setting, characters, and inciting incident. The inciting incident is the event that gets your protagonist going and motivated to act. Act 1 is about 30 pages long. Act 2: This is where your protagonist identified her goal or desire and encounters obstacles that make it difficult for her to achieve her goal. It contains the bulk of the story, full of urgency and tension. Act 2 is usually about 60 pages long. Act 3: This includes the story’s climax, where the tension is highest as the protagonist tries to achieve her goal. There is also a clear ending, where the protagonist gets what she wants or fails to achieve her goal. Act 3 is usually 20-30 pages long."

      "title": "Write a rough draft.",
      "content": "Write a rough draft. A rough draft is your first go at the script. Write quickly and do not think too much about what you are writing. Get your ideas down on paper and avoid editing the script as you go. Use your long line, treatment, and outline as a guide while you write. [2] X Research source You can try writing the rough draft in a few days or a week. Focus on getting your ideas down on paper, rather than writing a perfect draft."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include visual details in the script.",
      "content": "Include visual details in the script. Describe things that can be seen or heard on screen. Include descriptors that paint a visual picture in the reader's mind. Note any sounds or images that are important to the scene. [3] X Research source For example, you may describe a character injecting drugs as \"Naomi MOANS as she sticks the needle into her vein. Blood SPURTS into the syringe as she pushes down on the plunger.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Create distinct dialogue for your characters.",
      "content": "Create distinct dialogue for your characters. Make sure the dialogue tells the reader something about the character. Avoid generic dialogue like \"Hi, how are you?\" or \"What's new?\" Instead, use dialogue that is particular to your characters. Include slang or turns of phrase that only they would use. [4] X Research source For example, you may have a character who speaks in formal British English when they get nervous or upset. Or you may have a character who says very little or only gives one word answers. Keep the dialogue short, about three lines or less. You can include monologues for your characters, where they talk for more than five lines at one time, but only when you feel they are absolutely necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Revise the rough draft.",
      "content": "Revise the rough draft. Read the draft aloud. Listen to how the dialogue sounds. Make sure your characters sound distinct on the page. You should also confirm you have included enough visual detail in the script so your reader can get a good sense of setting and scene. [5] X Research source Check that your screenplay is formatted properly. Look for any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. You can also show the script to others, such as friends, peers, or family members, and get their feedback. Then, revise the draft again to include their notes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a logline.",
      "content": "Make a logline. The logline is a one sentence summary of the movie. It should contain your protagonist (a hero or heroine), an antagonist (a villain or anti-hero), and a goal that motivates your protagonist. Having a logline will help you stay focused when writing and stay on track. It is also useful as a marketing tool when you are producing the movie and trying to get it made. [6] X Research source The logline should not use the names of the characters. Instead, it should use descriptions of the characters that tell the reader something about them. For example, you may have a logline like: “An Arkansas waitress and a housewife shoot a rapist and take off in a '66 Thunderbird.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a treatment.",
      "content": "Create a treatment. The treatment will give financiers and studio executives a clear picture of the movie, and help them decide if it is worth their money. The treatment is a two to five page summary that breaks out the movie into three acts. It will include the title of the film and the logline. [7] X Research source For example, you may have a title like “When Harry Met Sally” or “Bobo the Fish.” Go for a title that is simple and to the point. Avoid long titles. You may then have a logline like: “An Arkansas waitress and a housewife shoot a rapist and take off in a '66 Thunderbird.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Include a synopsis in the treatment.",
      "content": "Include a synopsis in the treatment. The treatment should also include a synopsis that mentions the names of the characters, and provides brief details about them. It will also present a basic idea of how the characters get from major event to major event in the movie. [8] X Research source For example, you may write a synopsis like: “Thelma, a timid housewife, joins her friend, headstrong Louise, for a weekend fishing trip. But when Louise shoots and kills a man who tries to rape Thelma at a bar, their trip finds them fleeing to Mexico on the run from the law. Along the way, Thelma finds herself falling for a handsome young thief while a kind detective tries to get them to surrender before it's too late”"

      "title": "Create a budget.",
      "content": "Create a budget. Most producers will hire a line producer or a production manager to prepare a budget for the movie.

    {
      "title": "Ask friends and family members for financial support.",
      "content": "Ask friends and family members for financial support. Tell them you want to produce the film as a passion project. Create an online donation page where friends and family can give money to the movie to help it get made. [12] X Research source It is usually easier to ask friends and family for money, rather than people you do not know."

    {
      "title": "Use your own money.",
      "content": "Use your own money. Take out a line of credit or a personal loan at your bank. Use money in your savings account towards the movie. In some cases, if you cannot get funding in other ways, you may have to take a chance and invest your own funds into the project. [13] X Research source Be careful when using credit cards to fund the movie, as this can be a risky way to produce it. Try to only invest money in the movie that you know you can pay back or earn back later on."
