    {
      "title": "Get to know how a formula works.",
      "content": "Get to know how a formula works. It’s typically more useful to understand how a formula is derived than simply memorizing it. Memorization is a good first step, but getting a feel for why a formula works by doing plenty of practice problems will increase your shot at passing with flying colors. [19] X Research source For example, you could simply memorize the sum of a triangle's interior angles, which always add up to 180 degrees. However, if you really get a feel for that formula, you could use it to solve other problems, like figuring out an unknown angle in a hexagon."
