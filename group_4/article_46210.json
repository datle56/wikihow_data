      "title": "Sit comfortably in a chair if you just want to perform the mudras.",
      "content": "Sit comfortably in a chair if you just want to perform the mudras. Mudras only refer to the hand motions you’re going to make, and you don’t have to do anything specific with the rest of your body if you don’t want to. However, you should be comfortable! At bare minimum, just sit in a comfy chair, adjust your posture, and get comfy. [1] X Research source If you need a quick mindfulness check when you’re out and about but there are other people around and you can’t break out the yoga mat, sitting in a chair and performing a few mudras is a great way to go! You can even do mudras while you’re standing if you prefer. So long as you’re comfortable, the position isn’t a huge deal."

      "content": "Get into the accomplished pose (Siddhasana) for a meditative option. If you want to incorporate the mudras into a yoga session, or you’re at home and have some time, get into the accomplished pose. Sit on the floor with your buttocks flat and spine straight. Cross your legs in front of you by tucking your left foot under your right thigh, and your right foot on top of your left shin. Rest your hands on your knees. [2] X Research source Drop your shoulders back a bit and stick your chest out so that there’s a little bit of curve in your spine. A straight line should run from the top of your head to the center of your buttocks. “Siddha” comes from the Sanskrit word “divine.” This pose grounds you, and it’s commonly used for meditation.

      "content": "Opt for the lotus pose (Padmasana) if you’re an experienced yogi. If you’re flexible enough, the lotus pose is another great position for mudras. Sit comfortably on the floor with a straight spine. Bend your right knee to your chest and rest the side of your foot on top of your left thigh. Then, bend your left knee over your right leg and rest your left foot over your right thigh. Straighten your spine and rest your hands on your knees. [4] X Research source This is not a beginner position! The lotus pose can cause injury if you aren’t prepared for it, so don’t push your body here. This should be comfortable for you, not painful. The lotus is a symbol of rebirth. If you’re aiming to get more in touch with your femininity and internal cycle, tapping into this symbol may help you self-actualize."

      "content": "Regulate your breathing and slowly relax your body. You can use any breathing pattern you’d like if you’re a practicing meditator, but it’s not mandatory for mudras. At minimum, just breathe normally by inhaling through your nose and exhaling through you mouth. Breathe slowly and feel the air entering your body, filling your lungs, and exiting your mouth. [5] X Research source Center and relax yourself. The calmer your body is, the easier it will be to tap into your feminine spirit and become reacquainted with your body."

      "content": "Use Yoni mudra to try combatting chaotic energy surrounding your womb. Bring your hands together with your fingers pointing away from your belly and hold your hands just outside of your navel. Spread your hands open with your thumbs together to form an upside-down triangle. Press your palms against your belly and breathe in and out slowly. [6] X Research source Hold this pose for anywhere from 10-45 minutes for maximum benefit. Yoga practitioners believe Yoni can help smooth out an irregular menstrual cycle. While there is no scientific evidence that mudras will impact your cycle, there’s no harm in trying. If anything, the stress relief of yoga and/or meditation can certainly help. [7] X Research source This mudra represents the womb of Kali, the Hindu goddess of death and time. As Kali has no time for delusion and drama, this pose aims to shred the ego and mania separating you from your body. It’s a symbol of radical self-love and feminine power."

With your hands over your knees, tilt your palms up so that they’re facing the sky and touch your thumbs to your index fingers to form a circle. Keep your middle, ring, and little fingers extended away from you and breathe. [8] X Research source Yoga enthusiasts think that Gyan mudra can bring you balance and stability.

      "content": "Perform the Dhyana mudra for feminine wisdom and tranquility. Do this with your left hand only, as the left hand represents feminine wisdom. In your seated position with your hands over your knees, slowly move your elbow out to your side. Move your left hand over your belly button so that it’s perpendicular to your spine. Turn your hand up as if you’re waiting for someone to drop a coin into your hand. [11] X Research source Do this for 10-45 minutes. As you hold your left hand outside of your belly button, feel your hand collecting all of the wisdom and serenity of the universe. Trust in your hands, and allow nature to pour its energy into your palm where it rests outside of your womb. You can also do this with both hands if you prefer by laying your left hand on top of your right hand with your palms facing up. When done this way, you form as triangle with your arms and head to represent the Three Jewels of Buddhism: Buddha (enlightenment), Dharma (law), and Sangha (community)."

      "content": "Attempt the Ashwini mudra to realign yourself and soothe stomach issues. Rest your hands comfortably on your knees and sit up straight. Close your eyes. Focus your attention on your anus and inhale while you flex your sphincter slowly. Relax as you exhale and repeat this process. Do this 4-5 times to complete 1 cycle of the Ashwini mudra. [12] X Research source This mudra is designed to focus and elevate your life force’s energy upward along your back. By flexing and relaxing the muscle at the base of your spine (the sphincter), you push your energy from the base of your spine up to your head. This is believed to relieve pressure and chaos inside of your gut, which is helpful if you’re dealing with menstrual cramps or stomach pain. The Ashwini mudra isn’t a mudra in a traditional sense since it doesn’t involve your hands at all, but it’s a mudra in the sense that you’re performing a gesture to articulate a spiritual expression."
