Instead, you need to provide immediate, tangible rewards that your cat enjoys. [1] X Expert Source Jessica Char Cat & Dog Behavior Consultant Expert Interview. 28 September 2021. A cat will always appreciate a tasty food treat like a bit of tuna or cheese, a spoonful of wet food, or a commercial cat treat. Cats will also respond to nonfood rewards if it’s something they really enjoy, like a bout of laser pointer tag, or a hearty scratch behind the ears.

      "content": "Learn a bit about what motivates a cat. Dogs are easy to train because they are social creatures that want to please humans, and feel rewarded by a simple “Good dog!” or other verbal praise. Most cats, on the other hand, are less concerned about what you think of them, and more interested in what you are going to do for them. [3] X Research source Cats respond well to rewards and can readily learn new tricks if you are patient with them and offer them something they really want when they do well."

      "title": "Choose a name that is easy for your cat to recognize.",
      "content": "Choose a name that is easy for your cat to recognize. Cat’s generally respond better to shorter, pleasant-sounding names. While you might have your heart set on “Princess FluffyBottom McPhee,” you should probably shorten it to “Fluffy” for training purposes. [4] X Research source If you are adamant that your cat’s moniker “Sir William the Vicious of Belvedere” cannot be shortened, you could just train him to come to “kitty.” Don’t change your cat’s name once it has become used to it. This will just confuse the cat. The introduction of new nicknames can also confuse your cat. Consistency is key."

      "content": "Begin actively training the cat. The best way to get your cat interested in training is to feed the cat a bit less than usual so it is slightly hungry and more eager to earn food treats. Then simply approach the cat and say its name, and then present it with a small food treat. [6] X Expert Source Jessica Char Cat & Dog Behavior Consultant Expert Interview. 28 September 2021. Repeat this two or three times. Then walk a few feet away from the cat, and repeat the process but add the word “come” or “here” to the cat’s name. (For example “Charlie, come” or “Here, Sneakers.” Either works, just be consistent.) When the cat approaches you, pet her and offer her a treat. Then move a bit further away and repeat. [7] X Research source Make sure the cat links her name to the pleasant reward. This means saying her name, then immediately giving the reward. Repeat this activity, calling the cat 10 to 20 times per session, once or twice a day until the cat reliably responds to its name."
