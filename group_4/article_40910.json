Rub your fingers over their exteriors as you rinse them to get rid of any stubborn dirt. [1] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Technically, you can steam any veggie in the microwave, but the best options are broccoli, spinach, leafy greens (kale, collards, Swiss chard), cauliflower, asparagus, corn, peppers, carrots, green beans, small potatoes, Brussels sprouts, peas, zucchini, and artichokes. Large, hard potatoes, celery, and squash don’t steam well. [2] X Research source You may want to soak broccoli and Brussels sprouts in a bowl of cold water for a few minutes to get rid of any bugs. You don’t need to rinse or trim frozen veggies! Open the bag and dump them directly into a microwave-safe bowl."

      "content": "Trim fresh veggies and chop them into bite-sized pieces. Use a sharp knife to trim off any hard ends, fibrous bits, and areas that look yellow, damaged, or bruised. Then, cut the larger veggies into bite-size pieces so they steam evenly and quickly. [3] X Research source Follow these guidelines: Broccoli and cauliflower: Cut them into 1 inch (2.5 cm) florets or pieces Baby carrots and green beans: Trim off the ends but keep them whole. Leafy greens: Trim off tough stems and keep the leaves whole. Brussels sprouts: Cut in half or leave whole and peel away the outer leaves. Artichokes: Peel the fibrous skin off the stalks and leave the stalks whole. Regular carrots: Slice into 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) discs. Zucchini: Slice into 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) discs. [4] X Research source Small potatoes: Cut into quarters or leave whole and pierce a few times with a fork."

      "content": "Spread the veggies out evenly in a microwave-safe bowl or dish. The veggie pieces can be touching, but try to avoid piling them on top of each other. Since different veggies require different steaming times, it’s best to steam 1 type of veggie at a time. [5] X Research source Glass, ceramic, and plastic bowls and dishes are safe to use in the microwave. Do not put flimsy plastic storage containers (like margarine tubs), take-out containers, plastic grocery bags, or aluminum foil in the microwave."

      "content": "Add 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 44 ml) of water and cover the bowl or dish. The water creates the steam when you heat the veggies. Once you've added the water, cover the container loosely with a plate or heatproof lid so the steam can escape. [6] X Research source Microwave-safe plastic wrap, wax paper, parchment paper, and paper towels are also good options for coverings. You don’t need to add water if you’re steaming freshly washed leafy greens by themselves. [7] X Research source Fold up one of the corners if you’re using microwave-safe plastic wrap, parchment, or wax paper to allow steam to escape. [8] X Research source If you use plastic wrap, make sure it's labeled \"microwave-safe\" and don't let it touch the food while it’s steaming."

How long you set the cook time depends on the veggies you’re steaming. The thicker and tougher the veggie, the longer it takes. Your microwave’s strength is also a factor. [9] X Research source In general, you’ll steam: Sliced or baby carrots for 6-8 minutes Cauliflower florets and asparagus for 5-6 minutes Broccoli florets, spinach, and leafy greens for 5 minutes Brussels sprouts for 8-10 minutes Green beans for 4-5 minutes Peas for 3 minutes Small potatoes for 15-20 minutes Whole artichoke for 25-35 minutes [10] X Research source"

Use a fork to pierce a few of the veggie pieces to check for doneness. If the veggies are tender, they’re ready to eat! [12] X Research source If the veggies are crisp and difficult to pierce, pop them back in your microwave and steam them in 30-second intervals until they’re fork-tender."

      "content": "Put 1-2 cups (195-390 g) of rice in a colander and rinse it off. Short-, medium-, and long-grain white rice all work great for this. Use regular rice instead of instant rice. Put the rice of your choice in a colander and rinse it thoroughly with warm water. The warm water hydrates and plumps the rice a bit, which will help it steam more evenly. [13] X Research source Feel free to use jasmine rice, if you prefer, which has a shorter cook time. [14] X Research source You can also use brown rice! Just keep in mind that it takes at least 30 minutes longer to steam. [15] X Research source Long-grain rice is long, slender, and fluffy. Medium-grain rice is shorter, wider, and tends to have a tender, semi-sticky consistency when it’s cooked. Short-grain rice (like sushi rice) has the stickiest texture when it’s cooked.

      "content": "Transfer the rice to a large microwave safe bowl and add the water. Glass or plastic bowls work fine for this. How much water you add depends on the amount of rice you're steaming. In general, use a 2:1 ratio of water to rice. Stir the rice and water together. [17] X Research source For example, use 2 cups (236 ml) of water if you're making 1 cup (195 g) of rice. Use the biggest container you can find. A 2-1/2 quart (2,365 ml) casserole dish works great. [18] X Research source As a flavorful alternative, use chicken or beef broth instead of water. The ratio of liquid to rice won't change. If you're making 1 cup (195 g) of rice, use 2 cups (236 ml) of broth. [19] X Research source Add 1 tablespoon (14.2 g) of butter or margarine for savory results, if desired."

Drape the towel lightly over the mouth of the bowl. Don’t use a tight-fitting covering or lid! If you do, the rice will boil over and make a mess. [20] X Research source You can try using a loose-fitting lid for this, but you won't get the same benefits that the towel offers. The towel absorbs excess steam, prevents soggy rice, and keeps the top layer of rice moist. It's the best choice!"

Starting at 10 minutes, check the rice mixture every 5 minutes and stir it up. It's done when the water is completely absorbed.
