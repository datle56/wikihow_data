      "content": "Cleanse a clear container and fill it with water. For the best results, choose a glass container with a lid, like a Mason jar, and spiritually cleanse it according to your preference (smoke cleansing, filling it with crystals, etc.). Then, fill it with the water of your choice. Many prefer distilled or spring water, though tap works just as well. [1] X Research source Colored or tinted containers could prevent energy from seeping into the water, but the type of container you use is up to you. Don’t stress if you don’t have a clear one available. If you don’t have a container with a lid, a bowl will work, as well. Just be sure to place it somewhere it won’t get knocked over. Make sure to use clean, safe water if you’re planning on consuming your moon water."

      "title": "Add crystals, flowers, or herbs to the water (optional).",
      "content": "Add crystals, flowers, or herbs to the water (optional). If you want to give your moon water an extra energy boost, consider adding other ingredients. When it charges, the ingredients in the water will release their energy into the water, giving it additional properties. Check out these additions and their benefits: [2] X Research source Basil adds prosperity. Rose petals add beauty. Dried lavender adds relaxation. Citrus peels add happiness. Amethyst adds intention. McVey also suggests placing crystals and other ingredients around the container rather than in the water: “If you put [some crystals] in water, [they’ll] soak it up and get gross. So, you can always put [them] around your container, and [they’ll] still soak up the energy.”"

      "title": "Set your intention for the moon water.",
      "content": "Set your intention for the moon water. Hold the container in your hands, close your eyes, and ask yourself what you want and need from the moon water. Imagine a specific goal or desire coming true, and picture the lunar energy moving down your body and into the container. Your intention will give the water purpose and a reason to absorb the moon’s energy. [3] X Research source Repeating a mantra or prayer is also a great way to set an intention. For example, your intention could be “I wish to release __” or “I invite __ into my life.” Consider writing down your intention and taping it to or placing it underneath the container. McVey recommends that you “set an intention with everything you do.” If you don’t set an intention or something is unintentional, “You’re still in charge of it and you’re still responsible for it, but you’re unaware of it.” By setting an intention, you know exactly what you’re doing."

      "title": "Place the water in direct moonlight to charge overnight.",
      "content": "Place the water in direct moonlight to charge overnight. Place your moon water somewhere the moon’s light will directly touch it. Preferably, this is somewhere outside, though a windowsill will also work. Leave the water to absorb the moon’s energy overnight, then bring it inside in the morning—ideally before the sun rises. If your charged moon water stays in the sunlight too long, its properties will quickly change. [4] X Research source When you choose to charge your water is totally up to you, but many witches recommend doing so during a full moon. If it’s cloudy out, don’t worry! Moon water can still charge in indirect light, but its energetic properties may fade faster. Label your moon water’s container with the moon phase and time it was charged. For example, your label may say something like, “Full Moon in Scorpio, May 2022.” Either use your moon water right away or store it for later. If you choose to store it, McVey says, “Put it in a cooler, darker type of place so no other light gets to it. Be careful if you have other stuff in the bottle or what you store it with so it doesn't [grow mold] or get rancid.”"

Drop water-safe tools and crystals (like quartz, amethyst, and citrine) directly into the moon water to infuse them with lunar energy or spritz them with a spray bottle. If your crystals can’t get wet, sometimes placing them on top of or near the moon water’s container can help charge them.

      "content": "Make moon water during the full moon to maximize energy. Traditionally, moon water is charged during the full moon because that’s when the lunar energy is most potent.

Here are some examples: [13] X Research source New moon: setting intentions, reflecting on new beginnings First quarter moon: committing to moving forward, taking action Full moon: introspection, releasing what no longer serves you Last quarter moon: evaluating situations, moving forward, expressing gratitude The moon’s energy will also be affected by which zodiac sign it’s in, so check the lunar calendar to learn when to make moon water with certain qualities.
