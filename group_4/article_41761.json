If you only need to stretch them 1/4 to 1/2 a shoe size, a spray could do the trick. [1] X Research source Spray solutions are also your most affordable option."

      "content": "Purchase an immediate-use solution marked for suede shoes. There are plenty of stretching products available online or at shoe care stores. To avoid damage or discoloration, look for one labelled specifically for suede. Some are designed to be used overnight with a shoe stretching tool, so go for one marked for immediate use if you want to skip the stretching tool. [2] X Research source"

If necessary, use your fingers or a clean cloth to reach the nooks and crannies and to spread the solution evenly.

      "content": "Wear your shoes for a few hours. There’s no need to walk around, so you can just sit at your desk and get some work done while your shoes mold to your feet. For a little more stretch, you can also put on a pair of thick socks before slipping on your shoes."

      "title": "Repeat the process if necessary.",
      "content": "Repeat the process if necessary. If they’re still tight after a few hours, or for thicker shoes and boots, you might need to repeat the process once or twice. You can use most products as many times as you need without damaging your shoe. However, if you've tried spraying and wearing your shoes twice with no luck, chances are you'll need a stretching tool. Check your product's instructions to make sure it's safe to use several times. Some sprays aren't meant to be used more than once in a short period."

Extreme temperatures aren’t good for suede, so don’t try these hacks. In addition, you can’t control how much bags of water expand as they freeze, so they might tear your shoes.

In addition, soles made of heavy plastic, rubber, and other tough materials will get in the way. Even a professional would have trouble, and might be able to expand them by 1/4 to 1/2 shoe size at most. [12] X Research source"
