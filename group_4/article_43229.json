      "content": "Be aware of the difference between an ingrown toenail and foot fungus. Ingrown toenails are also known as onychocryptosis, and can be caused by stubbing your toe, wearing socks or shoes that are too tight, and cutting your toenails incorrectly. But ingrown toenails can also be caused by a toenail fungus called onychomycosis, which can then cause your toenail to grow abnormally and become ingrown. However, foot fungus like athlete's foot (tinea pedis) can cause your toenail to look discolored and become disfigured. Your toenail may appear spotted with white pits, there may be yellow debris under your toenail, or your toenail may appear chalky and irregularly shaped. Another foot condition that causes nail disfigurement is the development of eczema or psoriasis on your nails. If you have this skin disorder, your nail may start to peel or split and appear thicker or begin to ripple. Your doctor can run a test to determine if you have a skin disorder that is causing toenail disfigurement. If your toenail turns black, this may be due to trauma where you dropped something heavy on the nail. But it can also be due to melanoma or skin cancer. If your toenail turns black without any trauma inflicted on it, you should see your doctor right away."

      "content": "Get medical attention if the toenail becomes infected. If you suspect the toenail has become infected or if you have diabetes or another condition in which circulation is limited in your feet, you should see your doctor. Your doctor may try to lift the ingrown nail and insert a piece of cotton underneath to help the nail grow over the skin. Your doctor may then instruct you to soak the toe every day and replace the cotton so the nail stays clean and grows properly. Another option may be to remove part of the nail while you are under local anesthesia. If you have recurring ingrown toenails, you may need surgery to remove an entire section of the nail."

Use your other finger to work the free end of the cotton tube under the nail and then out the other side. The cotton should sit between the skin and the nail. Keep in mind this process can be painful. You may need to ask someone else for assistance to help you slide the cotton tube under the corner of the nail."

Add two tablespoons of Epsom salts to your foot bath or soak them in Domeboro Astringent solution, which can be found at more drugstores."
