      "content": "A “buckle bunny” is a woman who actively seeks rodeo champions. A “buckle bunny” attends rodeo events with the goal of dating (or hooking up with) a buckle-winning cowboy, similar to a “groupie” or “puck bunny” in hockey. She usually wears mini skirts, low-cut tops, and heeled cowboy boots, and is considered a “fake country girl” to true cowgirls. The buckle bunny stereotype is a girl who is \"pretty and country\" and the term was considered derogatory. Tanner Adell's popular song \"Buckle Bunny\" helped women to reclaim the term and being a \"buckle bunny\" is now seen as empowering. [1] X Research source “The bar was full of buckle bunnies after the rodeo.” “Did you see that buckle bunny sneak into his trailer?” “He slept with a buckle bunny last night and ruined his relationship.”"

      "content": "The term is trending, due to the “Buckle Bunny” song by Tanner Adell. In general, a “buckle bunny” is a derogatory term used to slut-shame women. However, country artist Tanner Adell wanted to redefine the term in a positive light. Her song “Buckle Bunny” highlights female independence and self-identity in rodeo culture, and tons of women have posted videos to her song on TikTok, including “buckle bunny” outfit ideas and satirical videos about being a “buckle bunny.” Some TikTok users claim that they have been stereotyped as buckle bunnies for being “pretty and country.” According to Adell, a buckle bunny is “independent, a woman who knows what she wants, and someone who's not afraid to take risks.” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Bop According to Gen Z, a “bop” is someone who posts revealing photos of their body online and has lots of sexual partners (or only hangs out with the opposite sex). The term can apply to men and women, but it’s typically used to slut-shame women. Due to this, most users believe a “bop” is a misogynistic term. [4] X Research source “Don’t respond to that bop. He’s so dumb for cheating on you!” “She’s the definition of a bop, dude. Have you ever seen her without 10 guys on her side?” “He had the audacity to call me a bop because I have a lot of guy friends. He got blocked so fast!”"

It’s another way of calling someone a “slut” or a “whore,” so it’s considered a derogatory and misogynistic term. [5] X Research source “Bryan talked to the thot in our class so I broke up with him.” “Why does she always have her bra out? She’s such a thot.” “She’s kind of a thot. She’s slept with everyone in the friend group.”"
