Look at the number next to \"System type\" in the right panel. If you see \"64-bit operating system, x64-based processor,\" you need the 64-bit x86 version.

A hostname looks like a string of words, like students.harvard.edu or mywebsite.com. An IP address is usually 4 numbers connected together, like 10.0.01. The port you'll need to connect to. If your work, school, hosting provider, or other party hasn't provided you with a port, don't worry—this just means you'll use the default SSH port of 22. Your username and password for the server. If you're connecting to a server that has other requirements, such as using a certificate or private key to authenticate, you'll need those files as well. Most people won't need to do this, but if your host requires you to do so, you can use PuTTYgen to generate a key for your remote server."
