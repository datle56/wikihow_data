      "title": "Talk during a stress-free time.",
      "content": "Talk during a stress-free time. The time to convince your guy to stay with you is not when he’s just come home after a stressful day of work or as he’s about to go out with friends. He'll be more likely to hear you if both of you are at peace. Try to talk after dinner or while you two are on a walk. Say something like, “I know you’ve been talking about breaking up a lot lately, but I still want this relationship. I love you and hope you’ll reconsider.” If you can’t talk during a stress-free time, be as calm as possible. Be rational, listen , and don't raise your voice. Try to hold back the tears if you can. Reader Poll: We asked 2226 wikiHow readers about the most common signs a man is stressed, and only 6% of them said when he self-medicates with food or alcohol . [Take Poll] Acting snappy or restless might be a better indicator that he’s stressed."

      "title": "Be honest about your feelings.",
      "content": "Be honest about your feelings. Maybe your boyfriend wants to break up because he doesn’t know how much you care about him. Use this time to tell him! You don’t want to wake up a year from now thinking of all the things you should have said, so tell him now. [1] X Research source Say, “I know I may not show you or tell you enough, but I love you very much. You're a great boyfriend to me and I want to work to show you that. I’m willing to work on this if you're willing to be patient with me.”"

      "title": "Listen to his perspective.",
      "content": "Listen to his perspective. Your boyfriend might have a lot on his chest that he needs to get off. Maybe his reasons for wanting a breakup are completely fixable, and maybe they're not. Hear him out and then decide what to do. [2] X Research source For instance, if he wants more alone time, you can both compromise on this by adjusting your schedules. On the other hand, if he wants kids while you don't, it might be time to part ways."

    {
      "title": "Ask for more time.",
      "content": "Ask for more time. Let your boyfriend know that you understand his reasons for wanting to break up but that you need a little more time. Ask him for one more week together, and if he still wants to break up after that week, don't protest it. [3] X Research source He may also refuse to give you an extra week. In this case, you should respect his reply. Continuing to beg for extra time will not help your cause."

      "title": "Offer or extend forgiveness for the things you’ve both done.",
      "content": "Offer or extend forgiveness for the things you’ve both done. Maybe there are things your boyfriend did that you haven’t forgiven him for, and he's tired of being punished for them. Or perhaps you have done things to him that you haven’t really apologized for. Take this time to give and receive apologies. For example, you could say: [4] X Research source “I know that I've cheated on you in the past, and I regret that more than anything I’ve ever done. I want your forgiveness and I want the relationship, but I understand if I can’t have that.” “I know I’ve been holding it against you, but I know you’re sorry for lying to me in the past. It’s hard for me to get over, but I know that if we’re gonna be together, I have to. I promise to trust you from now on if you continue being trustworthy.”"

      "content": "Take a break instead. Your boyfriend might not want a full-on breakup, but he might need a break. Ask him if he needs some time to think about things so he can make the best decision. Tell him that you'll wait for him while he decides, and use this time to think, too. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You should also define the timeline and rules of the break. Will it last a week? A month? Are you both able to see other people during this time?"

      "content": "Suggest getting outside help. If you have been dating for awhile or have children together, the relationship might be worth taking extra steps to save . Seek couples counseling if your boyfriend is willing. The counselor can help you work through your issues and create a stronger relationship. [6] X Research source Remember, it’s okay to get help sometimes. This relationship might really be once in a lifetime, so it’s worth trying if he’s a good guy!"

      "title": "Put yourself in his shoes.",
      "content": "Put yourself in his shoes. Think about why your boyfriend wants to break up and have empathy for him. Is he dealing with a stressful situation with family or having a hard time with work or school? Try to be there for him instead of nagging him about being with you or spending time together. [7] X Research source Try having dinner ready when he gets home a few nights a week. Offer to help him with any projects he might have. Placing yourself in his shoes may help you figure out why he's behaving the way he is. It may also help you find a solution."

      "content": "Check-in when there are issues. If your relationship is good, there shouldn’t be issues every day. But, good relationships also mean that you have the space to talk about the issues you do have in a healthy way. When these problems arise, speak to your partner about them calmly and with love. [8] X Research source You can say something like, “It bothers me that you won’t go to my cousin’s wedding with me. I love you and want you to spend more time with me and my family.” Urge your partner to do the same, and to speak up when issues arise so that you want work on them. Neither of you should bottle up frustrations."

      "content": "Adjust any behaviors you agree are bad. If you've been doing things that bother your boyfriend, consider stopping them. You might find that convincing him to stay with you is simple if you make some changes to your behavior. Work to be a better partner for him everyday. For instance, always be honest with him. Honesty is fundamental to any relationship. If you are a bit selfish, stop to think from his perspective before asking for things. Don't give in if he is asking for unreasonable things. For instance, if he doesn't like your friends and wants you to stop seeing them, he's being controlling."

      "content": "Break up with him if he threatens to break up with you all the time. Consider your boyfriend’s behavior. Does he break up with you often? Does he refuse to compromise even in small ways? He might be manipulating you by asking to break up just so he can control you. Get out of this relationship now so he can’t continue this behavior. If he really cared about the relationship, he would try to find solutions to problems, rather than threaten to break up in order to get his way."

Surprise him with a date night and come looking your best. Flirt with him and lean in for a long kiss when you’re in the movies or watching TV. [9] X Research source Try doing something new with him, such as taking a dance class or a painting class. Anything that gets the two of you working together would help."

      "title": "Give each other some space.",
      "content": "Give each other some space. Space is crucial to any relationship’s success. Even if he’s still on the fence about breaking up with you, create some distance. Don’t always answer his calls and don’t respond immediately to his texts. Plan nights out with your friends and take up a new hobby to occupy some of your time. [10] X Research source Don't use this as a means to manipulate him or control him. There are some instances where answering that call would be necessary. Rather than spending every day together, try spending every weekend together instead. You don't need to be together 24/7 in order to be a couple. Giving each other space might help you miss each other and grow closer as a result. If you spend too much time together, you might get bored of each other."
