      "content": "Blazers are an ideal brunch staple: comfortable yet sophisticated. Brunch typically doesn’t have a strict dress code; the vibe is classy but comfy. Still, if you’re stressing about what to wear, you can’t go wrong with a blazer —it adds elegance to your outfit without getting too dressy. Pair it with a pair of your favorite blue jeans, or wear it with a matching skirt. Blazers are also a perfect brunch option because they work regardless of whether you want to look more masculine or feminine. Under the blazer, wear a simple top that complements the color of your blazer; try a t-shirt for a more casual look or a plain button-down shirt if you want to be a little more refined."

      "content": "Leather jackets add effortless style, while slacks give you a pop of color. If blazers aren’t your thing, try a leather jacket instead. They always look super cool and are easy to pair with almost anything. Wear a neutral, matching shirt underneath—black or white is usually a safe choice, depending on the leather. Then, for a little flair, complete the outfit with a pair of colored slacks . [1] X Research source For a lighter springtime vibe, choose a pair of pastel-colored pants. If you like to be bold, wear bright or jewel-toned slacks. The choice is yours! This is another outfit that fits both feminine and masculine styles. Leather jackets are a universal staple, and colored slacks come in every shape and size."

      "content": "Keep it simple and cool with a plain or printed button-down. Button-down shirts bring a casually chic and slightly retro vibe to brunch, and they come in all kinds of fabrics and prints—so the sky is really the limit for you! You could go with a plaid print, a floral look, stripes, or even a solid color button-down shirt . Thrown on some jeans (since they go with just about anything), and you’re ready to go! [2] X Research source Decide how you want to style the button-down, too. You can wear it as a single layer or put a tank underneath and wear it unbuttoned as an overshirt. If you want your pants to have a little extra flair, try a pair of artfully ripped jeans or colored pants that match the hues on your button-down. Anybody can rock a nice button-down shirt, which is why it’s an ideal look for any gender."

      "content": "Printed tops are universally stylish, while leather pants polish the look. If you’re going out for more than just brunch—say, an afternoon or evening of hanging out with friends and partying—then you might want a slightly more glam look for brunch. To achieve this, wear a printed top and a pair of dark leather pants to brunch. The leather gives you a sleek, luxurious look, and the printed top enhances it! If you like feminine clothes, a nice printed blouse is easy to find. You could opt for a printed boho-style top, which is loose-fitting and flowy, or a more fitted v-neck printed top. For a more masculine look, try a button-down printed top; there are tons of different colors and patterns for you to play around with."

      "content": "Patterned shorts enhance the classic t-shirt and shorts-style outfit. If you’re heading to brunch in the summer and don’t want to get overheated, then a t-shirt and shorts is the ideal outfit for you. Even though the overall look is pretty casual, there are easy ways to make your outfit a little nicer—like wearing colored or patterned shorts instead of denim ones. [3] X Research source If you like feminine clothes, you can also enhance your t-shirt by opting for a v-neck or twist-front style, which is a little dressier than the average t-shirt. If you prefer masculine clothes, a button-down t-shirt or polo t-shirt can give you a slightly more sophisticated look than you’d get wearing a basic tee."

      "content": "Stay cool in the summer with a chic mini dress and sandals. At the height of summer, what has more summer vibes than a simple mini-dress ? They come in all sorts of styles, colors, and patterns, so pick a mini dress that fits your tastes and pair it with neutral-toned strappy sandals to make a statement. [4] X Research source However, if you’re looking for more guidance beyond a basic mini dress, a few styles, in particular, are perfect for brunch: Sundresses are sweet, elegant, and ideal for warm summer weather. A sundress tends to have a fitted top and flared skirt—but again, there are many colors and styles to choose from. T-shirt dresses are another great option. They’re casual dresses, combining comfort with elegance. They also tend to be looser than the average mini dress, which is perfect when you’re feasting on brunch."

      "content": "Mix comfort and elegance by pairing a slip dress with white sneakers. If you prefer longer midi dresses but still want to be comfy, then wear a solid-color slip dress to brunch along with a pair of basic white sneakers . White matches anything, and because the slip dress is so minimalist in its design, it won’t clash with the sneakers. In fact, this simple ensemble goes together perfectly! [5] X Research source When it’s cool out, it’s also easy enough to throw a sweater or cardigan over the midi dress. Assuming your dress is colored, any neutral-toned sweater is a pretty safe bet."

      "content": "Maxi dresses work well when you want to look classy and be comfy. The length and flow of a maxi dress (which typically reaches to your ankles or the floor, depending on the style) gives it an effortless elegance, but they’re still super easy to wear for a morning out. Add a pair of cute flats to the ensemble—which are nice and easy to walk in—and you’ll have a complete brunch outfit. Maxi dresses also work in various seasons; opt for a maxi sweater dress when it’s cold out or a light and airy maxi dress in the summertime. If the weather is cool (or you just prefer a cool, edgy look), ditch the flats for boots and throw a leather jacket over the dress for extra warmth and style!"

Throwing on a pair of joggers and a sweatshirt allows you to basically roll out of bed and run to brunch without looking like you did—which is super convenient! And while this outfit isn’t the best for formal brunch occasions, it’s perfect for kicking back with your best friends. In terms of footwear, it’s easy enough to throw on a pair of sneakers or converse to match this simple outfit."

Start with a simple, neutral-toned t-shirt and midi skirt , then complete the look with a cropped denim jacket . Because neutral tones and denim both match a wide range of colors and patterns, feel free to pick any type of midi skirt, whether it’s a simple solid color or bold and patterned. [6] X Research source To add to the vintage look, wear this outfit with a pair of round aviator sunglasses as well. If you prefer a more masculine look, you could always wear a neutral undershirt and denim jacket with a pair of colored pants instead!"

      "content": "White is a classic brunch color and can be found in a variety of styles. Best of all, you don’t need to worry about your outfit matching—it’s all white! Pair a white blouse or t-shirt with a pair of white linen pants or shorts. This is a great look for spring and summertime, taking the “easy breezy” vibe to the next level, but if it gets cool outside, you can always throw on a white (or off-white, for a little variety) cardigan. Complete the outfit with a pair of sandals (if it’s warm) or a pair of shoes if it’s chilly. Since you’re wearing all-white, just about any shoe color will work with this outfit."

      "content": "Stand out from the crowd with bold colors and patterns on your clothes. If you like to make a statement with your outfits, don’t be afraid to play around with bold colors and striking patterns! [7] X Research source An easy way to do this is by pairing a bold, solid-color t-shirt with a pair of complementary bold patterned pants (or vice versa, if you prefer). Pick a pair of patterned pants with multiple colors. Then, match your shirt to one of the minor colors in that pattern. That way, you’re not wearing the same bold color all over, but your clothes will definitely match!"

      "content": "A matching top and bottom set is easy to coordinate and super comfy. If your brunch is on the casual side, opt for a knit set —which is essentially a matching top and bottom made from the same fabric and color. In the same vein, you could wear a tracksuit (usually a sweater and pants). There are so many possible styles within those categories that you’re sure to find something you like after a quick search! Knit sets are typically a shirt and pants, but if you want to make your outfit a touch more feminine (and dressier), you could wear a shirt and skirt knit set instead."

      "content": "Rompers are easy to throw on in a hurry and simultaneously stylish. They work for any occasion because there are so many varieties and styles of rompers out there; some are on the dressier side, and some are more casual. Luckily, brunch also has easygoing, comfy, and nice (but not too fancy) vibes, so rompers make an excellent brunch option. If it’s chilly out, you can always throw on a matching sweater over your romper. It’ll look like any other cute sweater-and-pants combo, and you can always take it off if you get too warm."

There are plenty of ways to look great and bundle up for warmth at the same time, and a cozy trench coat is one of the best. Go with a lighter fabric in the fall or a heavy coat in the winter, and pair it with a matching beret to make your fashion statement."
