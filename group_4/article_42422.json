      "title": "Look for flexible material.",
      "content": "Look for flexible material. Find a common item in your home that is flexible, meaning that it bends so you can use the length of it to measure curves on your body. Try common materials like string, yarn, a piece of scrap fabric, or a cable. Make sure the material you use isn’t precious, as you will be marking it up, cutting it, or otherwise potentially damaging it for use in taking measurements."

      "title": "Try to find an object with a known length.",
      "content": "Try to find an object with a known length. Look for an object that you have on hand that has an even, known length to allow for easy measuring. Depending on the object, you can either use it to directly measure on your body, or to measure the length of another material like string. For instance, a standard American printer paper size is 8.5 inches wide by 11 inches long. An American dollar bill is 2.5 inches wide by 6 inches long. [1] X Research source You can also look up the size written on the bottom of a baking pan, a box, or another object that you can easily find the exact dimensions of."

      "title": "Mark increments on the material.",
      "content": "Mark increments on the material. If you don’t already know the exact length of the material you’re using in place of measuring tape, use a flat ruler to mark increments on it. If you use a material that is long, you can mark off every 6 or 12 inches on it to measure longer lengths of the body, like inseam. On shorter material like a piece of paper or dollar bill, you can simply use it to measure one length at a time, or fold it in halves to measure smaller increments. If you don’t have a ruler, you can measure lengths with standard objects like printer paper or a dollar bill. Or, approximate lengths using your hand and arm. The distance from your first knuckle to the end of your fingertip is about 1 inch, the distance across your palm underneath the fingers is about 4 inches, and the distance from elbow to fingertips is about 18 inches. However, these approximations vary on each body."

      "title": "Lay the material on the body for measurement.",
      "content": "Lay the material on the body for measurement. Place your material across or around the part of the body you want to measure to find its length based on your marks or understanding of the material’s length. If your material is too short to span the length of the area, place your finger as precisely as possible where the material ends and begin there with another length of the material, doing this as many times as you have to to reach the full length of the area. If you want to find the length of an area of your body beforehand and then measure it afterward, place it on the area of your body you want to measure and carefully take hold of the material (or even cut it if it is a material like string) where the length of your body ends. Then use a ruler or approximate measurements from your hand to determine the length. Make sure you write down all numbers and label them with the body measurement they correspond to."

Find the size of your or another woman’s chest by wrapping your measuring material around the back over your shoulder blades, under the armpits, and across the fullest part of the bust. [2] X Research source Ensure that you do not pull whatever material you’re using to measure too tightly around the chest. To measure for a bra, bathing suit, or other garment that calls for it, you will use this bust measurement along with the circumference just below the bust to find the cup and band size.

      "content": "Take a waist measurement. Use your measuring material to find the length around your or another woman’s torso at its smallest point, which is your natural waist. [4] X Expert Source David Pew Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 5 January 2021. Find this point by observing where the torso creases when bending side to side, and note that it will fall above the bellybutton and below the ribcage. Note that there is a difference between the natural waist and where the waistband may be worn on pants, skirts, or shorts. When clothing measurements call for a waist size, it refers to the narrowest part of the torso, the natural waist. You may want to take another measurement below the natural waist where you know you will wear a garment. Be sure to exhale and relax, or have the woman you’re measuring do so, before you take a waist measurement. The abdomen shouldn’t be enlarged with air, sucked in smaller, or otherwise in an unnatural or unrelaxed state. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Measure hip size.",
      "content": "Measure hip size. Wrap your measuring material around your own or another woman’s hips at their fullest point to determine hip size. The fullest point of the hips is generally about 8 inches below the natural waist, but of course the distance varies from person to person. Take a few different measurements if you need to ensure that you find the widest point. If you’re taking the measurement on yourself, make sure your measuring material is level across your hips and rear end by observing yourself in a mirror."

This is best done on another person or with help from someone else to take a measurement on you. If you don’t have someone to help, you can also measure the inseam on a pair of pants that fits you well. [6] X Research source The proper inseam for a pair of pants may vary depending on the style of pants and the height of the heel on the shoe worn with them."

Make sure that you always take a measurement from the fullest part or longest extension of a body part. Measure around the widest part of your arm or thigh, for example, and measure for the length of a sleeve with your arm bent to accommodate movement. [7] X Research source It may be helpful to keep a piece of string or elastic tied around the natural waist, as it will be used as an endpoint for other measurements like front waist length, back waist length, and rise.

The chest should not be flexed or sunken in but rather comfortable and relaxed, with the measuring material held snugly against the skin while exhaling. Sport coat or suit jacket measurements will also include a letter after the chest size number. A Regular (R) typically fits men 5’7” to 6’, while a Long (L) fits 6’1” to 6’3”. [11] X Research source"
