      "title": "Decide on a time frame.",
      "content": "Decide on a time frame. Before you begin, you will need to determine the period of time your financial report will cover. Most financial reports are prepared quarterly and annually, although some companies also prepare them on a monthly basis. To determine the period of time your financial report should cover, review the governing documents of your organization, such as the bylaws, corporate charter or articles of incorporation. These documents may describe how often the financial report should be prepared. Ask an executive at your organization how frequently reports are expected to be prepared. If you are the executive of your own organization, consider when the financial report would be most useful to you and select that as your financial report date."

      "title": "Review your ledgers.",
      "content": "Review your ledgers. Next, you'll need to make sure everything in your ledgers is up to date and properly recorded. Your financial report will not be useful to readers unless the underlying accounting data is correct. For example, make sure all accounts payable and receivable have been processed, verify that the bank reconciliation is complete, and ascertain whether all inventory purchases and product sales have been recorded. You'll also need to consider any liabilities that may be unrecorded as of the financial report date. For example, has the company received any services that have not been invoiced? Are employees owed wages that have not yet been paid? These items represent accrued liabilities and must be recorded in the financial statements."

As mentioned previously, this is the money that would be left over if all assets were sold and all liabilities paid. Hence, liabilities plus equity should be equal to assets. If the balance sheet does not balance, double check your work. You may have omitted or miscategorized one of your accounts. Double check each column individually and make sure everything is included that ought to be. You may have missed a valuable asset, or a significant liability."
