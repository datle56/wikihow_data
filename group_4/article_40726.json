These licenses are usually covered by the state’s commerce office, or a similar department. Differences in state laws include whether you need a license, what kind of mortgages you can issue, and if you are required to have a physical office in the state. The Nationwide Multistate Licensing System & Registry (NMLS) system has a list of each state’s licensing requirements. [1]"

There are a series of steps you will need to take in order to join, each of which will also include a shipping or registration fee. You will need to undergo a background check, which includes submitting official fingerprints. If you have fingerprints on file with NLMS that are less than 3 years old, you will not need to be re-fingerprinted. You should know the results of your background check within 48 hours.

You will have 4.5 hours to complete both exams, which are typically not taken on the same day. You will need a pencil and calculator to work with, and perhaps other items depending on your state's requirements. You need a 75% score to pass the exams, and you should receive your results immediately after completing the exam. [2] X Research source"

Take a random sampling of your mortgage applications, and check to make sure that they have been filled out appropriately, that the information in them can be properly verified, and that they fulfill requirements for federal and state regulations as well as your business’ best practices. This needs to be a traceable and repeatable process, so you should have clearly defined steps for carrying out quality control.
