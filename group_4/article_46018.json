      "content": "Choose an Elumen Hair Color. There are many different colors, including both natural and fashion, that you can choose from.

GB@9, which means gold beige/brown on a hair level 9 (light). [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase Elumen Hair Color, Elumen Prepare, and Elumen Lock. To correctly dye your hair, you'll need the Elumen Hair Color, which is oxidant-free, ammonia-free, and peroxide-free. You'll also need Elumen Prepare, which improves the color's durability and intensity when applied before dyeing. Finally, you'll need Elumen Lock, which is applied after dyeing to keep the color from washing out over time. You can also purchase Elumen Clean if you want to easily remove dye stains from your skin."

      "content": "Wash and towel dry your hair. To prepare your hair for dyeing, wash it once or twice with your regular shampoo to remove the oil from your hair. Do not use conditioner or blow it dry afterwards with a hair dryer. Instead, dry it partially with a towel. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Section your hair.",
      "content": "Section your hair. Especially if you have a lot of hair and/or you're dyeing your whole head, it may be a good idea to separate your hair into sections. Use a comb to part your hair straight down the middle and also across your head from one side to the other. At this point, your hair should be divided into four equal sections. Twist and clip each one to ensure that they stay separated. [4] X Research source"

[7] X Research source Also lay out a towel on the counter where you'll be applying the color. This way, you can set your products and materials on top of the towel to avoid staining the countertop."

      "content": "Use your gloved hands or an applicator brush to apply the color. Put on some gloves and unclip one of your front sections of hair. Either reach your gloved hand into the bowl and scoop out a glob of dye, or do so by dipping an applicator brush into the dye. Carefully coat your hair with the color by starting at the roots and working your way out to the tips. [8] X Research source When the section is completely covered in dye, move onto the next section. Continue this until the color is applied to all of your hair. Apply carefully so that you don't get the color in your eyes or fling it around the room; it stains fairly easily. If you're dyeing your hair multiple colors and want to keep the colors separate, clip sheets of foil between the differently colored sections. If you're dyeing your hair multiple colors and don't separate them, the colors will blend together, which many find desirable and attractive. [9] X Research source"

While Elumen Hair Color often lasts longer than many other types of hair dyes, exactly how long varies and depends on different factors, such as the particular dye color and the healthiness of your hair. To make your hair color stay rich and vibrant for as long as possible, try to only wash your hair 1-2 times a week. Use dry shampoo in between washes to keep your hair from looking oily and dirty.
