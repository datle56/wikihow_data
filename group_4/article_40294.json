      "title": "Find a close seat in class or at assemblies.",
      "content": "Find a close seat in class or at assemblies. You might not be able to sit right next to your crush, but see if you can find a seat near them in any classes you have together or at assemblies. That way your crush will have a great view when you’re having an awesome hair day or you wear a new outfit to school. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Plan to cross paths.",
      "content": "Plan to cross paths. Don’t go overboard with it, but if you know your crush has a class across the hall from yours, you might linger casually in the hallway until they come out, or you might take a different path to class so you pass by your crush’s locker. Make eye contact and smile when you see your crush so they know you’re happy to see them. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Sit at the same table at lunch.",
      "content": "Sit at the same table at lunch. If you and your crush have the same lunch period, try sitting at the same lunch table. Be confident and make conversation with the whole table, not just your crush. This will help you to be more accepted at the table, and you won't seem like you're trying too hard to get your crush's attention. Try to be funny and witty without seeming like you’re trying too hard. Tell a funny story about your homeroom teacher who spits when he talks or a silly prank you and your best friend pulled last year. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask for help with a school project.",
      "content": "Ask for help with a school project. Don’t downplay your own intelligence, but if your crush is great at science and you’re better at English, ask to trade favors. Tell them that if they’ll help you with your science project, you’ll proofread their term paper for English. This will help both of you get better grades while giving you a chance to spend more time together. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Be a good friend.",
      "content": "Be a good friend. Be a friend to your crush without expecting anything in return. Ask about their day, really listen when they talk to you about an issue in their life, and offer to help when you see they need something. Even if the crush doesn’t turn into a relationship, you’ll benefit by having more friendships in your life.

      "title": "Join the same sports team.",
      "content": "Join the same sports team. Maybe you both love shooting hoops, or you’re both really good at soccer. Why not try out for the team? Being active together can cause a strong bond to form. [6] X Research source If joining the team doesn’t work for you, grab a couple of friends and cheer on your school at the next game! Your crush may notice you in the stands and appreciate your support."

      "title": "Become a member of the same extracurriculars.",
      "content": "Become a member of the same extracurriculars. Most schools have plenty of afterschool activities that you can join. If your crush is a member of a club you’re interested in too, go ahead and sign up! This will give the two of you plenty to talk about. As a bonus, extracurricular activities look great on a college application. [7] X Research source If your crush is on the yearbook staff and you love photography, consider asking if you can take candid photos of students and teachers for the yearbook. [8] X Research source This works both ways - if you’re a member of the Drama Club and you find out your crush loves old movies, invite them to join the club with you! Only join a club that you’re actually interested in; don’t just join a club because your crush is in it. You’ll be embarrassed when the rest of the club finds out you don’t actually know the rules of chess, for instance, or the difference between latex and acrylic paints."

      "title": "Hang out with the same people.",
      "content": "Hang out with the same people. Having friends in common means you and your crush will be more likely to spend time around each other, since you’ll be hanging out in the same group. You’ll also have more to talk about when the rest of your friends aren’t around. Start by talking to any friends the two of you have in common. See if you can get invited to a party or an after-school study session where your crush might be. As you get to know your crush's friends, you're more likely to be included in the same activities as them. If you notice one of your crush's friends sitting alone, go over and strike up a conversation. Not only is this likely to help get you closer to your crush, but you might just make a good friend in the process."

      "title": "Start a conversation",
      "content": "Start a conversation . Once you find yourself around your crush, try to strike up a conversation to see what you have in common. If you’re still feeling shy, send them a friend request on social media and see what you’re both into. Think about some questions you can ask your crush before you talk to each other. Ask what kind of music your crush likes. What kind of TV and movies do they watch? Have they traveled to any of the same places as you? Do you both like the same subjects in school? Do they do any work for charities after school? The more you have to talk about, the more time you're likely to spend around each other."
