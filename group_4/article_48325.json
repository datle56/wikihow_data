You two could watch a new movie, play board games, play video games, or make a meal together. Whatever it is, it will be fun if you do it together!

      "content": "No need to get glammed up for chilling at his house. If you know his family is going to be there, some pants and a nice blouse or shirt is a perfect combo of dressy yet casual. If it’s just him and his roommates, a pair of jeans and a well fitting T-shirt is perfect. Whatever you pick out, make sure you feel comfortable and confident before you head out the door! [2] X Research source Don’t focus on footwear too much—you’ll probably be taking it off when you get in the house. Sneakers, flats, and boots are great options to choose from since you can slip them off quickly. Reader Poll: We asked 698 wikiHow readers what they thought would help make the best first impression with in-laws, and 50% of them said dressing well and grooming yourself. [Take Poll] This is good advice for meeting your boyfriend's parents, too."

      "content": "Be polite by interacting with your boyfriend's housemates. Nowadays, a lot of people live with someone else in the home. Double-check with him about who’s going to be there that day—if he lives with other people, be prepared to say hello or hang out with them for a bit. [3] X Research source If he has roommates, it’s polite to say hi and talk with them for at least a few minutes before heading off to your boyfriend’s room. If he lives with his parent or parents, you can follow his lead on whether or not he wants to hang out with them. At the very least, be polite and introduce yourself. You can never go wrong by complimenting your boyfriend in front of them! [4] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Matchmaker Expert Interview. 1 October 2020. It can be nerve-wracking to meet the people your boyfriend lives with for the first time. If you’re nervous, ask your boyfriend about them beforehand so you can have some questions locked and loaded. For instance, you might ask his mom about her pottery business or his roommate about how college is going."

      "content": "Be a good house guest and try to follow the rules. You can ask your boyfriend about them ahead of time, especially if he lives with his parents. You might need to take your shoes off when you get there, use a coaster with your drink, or only eat in the dining room. The more respectful you are, the better impression you’ll leave! [5] X Research source When in doubt, follow your boyfriend’s lead. He’s the one who lives here, so he should know the rules like the back of his hand."

      "content": "It can be nerve-wracking to use someone else’s bathroom. However, holding it in will only make things worse! If you’re hanging out and you feel the urge to go, just excuse yourself and do your business. Hopefully, he’ll have some air freshener that you can spray if needed when you’re done. [6] X Research source If you’re super nervous about using his bathroom, try bringing along some Poo-Pourri. It’s a spray that you use in the toilet before you go, and it masks the scent of anything you expel."

      "content": "This is a great idea, especially if you’re having a movie night. Before you head over, stop at a convenient store and grab some beer, wine, soft drinks, or chips. He’ll welcome you with open arms, and it will start the night off right! [7] X Research source If he lives with roommates or family members, grab enough snacks or drinks for everyone to share. They’ll see you as a hero (and probably think you’re pretty cool, too)."

      "content": "You won’t need much, but a small bag might be helpful. If you plan on sleeping over , pack a small bag and throw your toothbrush, some comfy clothes, and some cleansing wipes. No need to pack your whole closet—a few key items will do. [8] X Research source If you have plans the next day with your boyfriend, pack some clean clothes to wear the next morning. Toss in a few toiletries, too."

      "content": "The house’s cleanliness might not quite be up to your standards. If your boyfriend lives alone or with other guys his age, his house might be a bit of a mess. It’s okay to help clear a place at the table or shuffle things around on the bed, but try not to make a huge deal about any messes. [9] X Research source Be on the lookout for huge messes in his home, though. If he didn’t clean up at all before inviting you over, he might be a little too comfortable with the mess (and that can be a red flag)."
