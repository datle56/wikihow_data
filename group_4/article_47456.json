      "content": "Prepare your underarms. You can wax your armpits without making a lot of preparations, but if you take these measures the experience will be less painful and more effective: Clean your underarms thoroughly. Wash them with soap or a good body wash, and scrub them a little to exfoliate the skin. [1] X Research source If you use hot water, the hairs and surrounding skin will soften, making the hairs easier to remove. Trim the hair. If the hair under your arms is longer than 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.6 cm), you should trim it with a pair of barber or nail scissors until it's 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.6 cm) long. This makes the waxing process less painful."

      "title": "Heat up body wax.",
      "content": "Heat up body wax. Make sure you use wax that is intended to be used to remove leg and body hair, rather than wax intended for use on the face. Follow the instructions on the package and heat the wax in the microwave or in a wax heater. It's ready to use when it's completely melted and runny. If this is your first time waxing, do a test on the back of your hand, where your skin is less sensitive, to make sure the wax isn't too hot. Body wax kits are available at drugstores and beauty supply stores. Sugar wax can be used to remove hair under your armpits. It has no chemicals, or resin, or doesn't need to be heated much. You can make your own sugar-based body wax using the following recipe: mix 2 cups of sugar with 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup lemon juice. Heat the mixture over low heat on the stove until the sugar dissolves and becomes a sticky syrup. The mixture is now ready to use."

      "title": "Use a waxing stick to apply wax to your armpit.",
      "content": "Use a waxing stick to apply wax to your armpit. Load it with a good amount of hot wax, then swipe it on your armpit in the direction of your hair growth. Continue swiping, always in the same direction, until all of the hair is covered with wax. Some people have hair that grows in more than one direction. If this is the case with you, you'll have to wax your armpit one section at a time. Do not swipe the wax in the opposite direction. Your hair strands will get tangled up and won't pull out cleanly."

Place it over the area with the wax and swipe it once with your hand, in the direction of your hair growth, to position it in place.

Leave the edge of the strip free of the wax, so you can grasp it to pull it off. If you can't cover all of the wax with one strip, work one at a time."

Repeat the process with the other armpit. If the wax and hair don't come off, you'll have to try again. Use a fresh wax strip. If the process is too painful, remove the wax with olive oil and warm water, and plan to shave instead of waxing."

If the waxing caused you to bleed, put on a small bandage until the bleeding has subsided. Do not use deodorant, moisturizer, or other creams and lotions for several hours after waxing."
