      "content": "Greening out is when you feel sick or anxious after consuming cannabis. When you green out, it typically means you consumed too much marijuana or weed for your body to handle. So, it’s essentially like overdosing on cannabis. Greening out can happen from any method of consuming cannabis, such as smoking weed or taking an edible. While greening out is often likened to an overdose, it is not fatal.

In some cases, people treat their symptoms in the emergency room. [2] X Research source Greening out comes from the term blacking out, which is when you drink too much alcohol and can’t remember what happened while you were intoxicated. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Consuming too much weed.",
      "content": "Consuming too much weed. The most common reason behind greening out is smoking or taking a lot more cannabis than you’re used to. In your brain, you have specific receptors that respond to THC and other cannabinoids, which are the compounds in cannabis that make you high. When you smoke too much weed, the receptors get overloaded, which makes you feel sick. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You might green out more if you are new to smoking weed, or don’t use cannabis that often. You typically absorb cannabis faster when you smoke it, which can cause you to consume more than you think. The best advice is to start at a low potency and take your hits slowly, especially if you’re a new smoker, as this can prevent green outs. Edibles usually take longer for your body to absorb, so you might think you need to eat more for the cannabis to work faster and to feel its effects. If you’re new to edibles, start with a dose of no more than 2.5 mg of THC and wait to see how it affects you before eating more. It usually takes 30 minutes to 2 hours to work. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Smoking really potent cannabis. The potency of cannabis is affected by how much THC or other cannabinoids it contains. So, even if you’re an avid cannabis consumer, smoking or taking an edible that’s made with really strong cannabis can cause you to green out.

      "content": "Mixing alcohol and weed. When you drink alcohol first and then consume cannabis, your body tends to absorb the THC faster. So even if you smoke your normal amount or take your regular dosage, you reach a stronger high much quicker. Drinking alcohol and smoking weed, or getting cross-faded, can cause some people to experience bad highs and feel anxious in general. While anecdotal, many cannabis users say they don’t experience bad highs or green outs when they smoke before they drink alcohol. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Ingesting synthetic cannabis. Man-made cannabis products, like Spice and K2, are often a lot more potent than natural cannabis, like marijuana. Their effects tend to be more unpredictable too, so you might feel good after smoking it one day, but the next time you smoke, you green out.

The most common symptoms of greening out are sweating, feeling nauseous and dizzy, and sometimes even vomiting. For some people, greening out feels very scary. They might say that they feel like they’re dying because they’re experiencing extreme anxiety and paranoia. In rarer cases, greening out might cause panic attacks, hallucinations or psychosis, heart palpitations, or chest pain. Greening out can be really frightening and make you sick, but know that it is not life-threatening. [10] X Research source It’s normal to feel a little embarrassed when you come out of a green out, especially if you were around other people.

Bring a bowl or plastic container with you in case you feel sick, then find a comfortable, quiet space to lie down on your side. Reassure yourself that greening out is only temporary and typically passes after a few hours. If you’re with a friend who is greening out, get them to a comfortable area and lie them on their side. If they throw up, this prevents them from swallowing or even choking on their vomit. Stay with your friend who’s greening out to make sure they’re okay. It is often a scary experience, so reassure them that you’re with them and that they are okay."
