      "content": "Sometimes, the 💋 emoji can be used in a friendly way. While it’s often considered flirty or seductive, it’s also common practice to send 💋 to someone you’d comfortably kiss on the cheek or forehead—a best friend or family member, for example. It’s a great way to say, “Love you, friend!” “Girl, you’re amazing. Thanks for the help yesterday! 💋” “I hope you’re having a lovely day, mom! 💋”"

      "content": "The 💋 emoji might mean that a person is being sassy. When someone talks about kissing in a playful or sarcastic context, they might use the 💋 emoji for emphasis. It can also be used as a cheeky follow-up after saying something with a little too much honesty. “I’m not saying a word! My lips are sealed. 💋” “You can keep talking, but I don’t actually care that much. 💋” “If you want that, you’d better 💋 your wallet goodbye!”"

      "title": "A 👄 emoji usually indicates speech or vocals.",
      "content": "A 👄 emoji usually indicates speech or vocals. You can use it more literally in place of writing the word “mouth” or “talk,” or you can use it as emphasis when referencing a conversation. You could even use it to compliment someone’s voice or ask them to stop talking. [2] X Research source “The vocal cords on this woman are amazing! 👄🎶” “I swear this dude will NOT stop talking. 👄” “Hey, can you keep it down out there? The 👄 is getting pretty loud.”"

      "title": "The 👄 emoji can also be used to send kisses.",
      "content": "The 👄 emoji can also be used to send kisses. In most versions of the emoji, its lips look slightly puckered, like they’re about to kiss someone. [3] X Research source As such, you can also use it in place of the word “kiss” and give someone a virtual smooch. The context of the “kiss” can be romantic, familial, or friendly! “Sending kisses today! 👄” “Please accept this digital 🤗 (hug) and 👄, since I’m not there to give you real ones!” “I’m gonna give you the biggest 👄 when I see you tonight! 😍”"

      "title": "Both 💋 and 👄 can be used interchangeably as a kiss.",
      "content": "Both 💋 and 👄 can be used interchangeably as a kiss. Because they look similar, it’s easy to associate either emoji with kissing—and you can use them to replace the word \"kiss\" or add emphasis to a message. However, they have secondary meanings that make them useful individually, with 👄 also referring to talking and 💋 having more sassy and seductive vibes. “Romance is in the air tonight…💋👄” “Enough chatting! Let’s get to the action. 👄💋”"
