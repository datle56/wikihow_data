      "content": "Playing area A cricket field is typically a large oval or round field with a line going straight down the middle. At each end of the line is a wicket, a set of 3 posts (\"stumps\") with 2 wooden bars (\"bails\") sitting on top. [1] X Research source The area between the 2 wickets, known as the pitch, is an area of short, dense grass. Two additional lines in front of the wicket, known as popping creases, set off the safe zone for the batters (the players hitting the ball or running). Generally, a batter is safe as long as they are behind the popping crease. Once they step forward (as when they run to the other wicket), they're vulnerable to being put out until they reach safety on the other end."

      "content": "Teams Cricket is played by 2 teams of 11. All players essentially play the whole match . Every player also will take at least 1 turn as batter throughout the course of the match. [2] X Research source Each team has a captain that typically makes all decisions on behalf of the team. When fielding, the team includes a wicketkeeper , a bowler, and 9 fielders. The bowler switches after every 6 deliveries of the ball. Fielders don't have set positions and can play anywhere in the field. Teams are technically allowed to have 12 official members. The 12th player acts as a substitute in the event of an injury, and can't bowl or bat while acting as a substitute. [3] X Research source There are far more than 9 names for the different fielder's positions. While some fielders may feel more comfortable playing in a particular part of the field, they don't have permanent positions like baseball players do."

      "title": "Gameplay",
      "content": "Gameplay Like many similar sports, a match begins with a coin flip to determine which team starts where. The fielding team takes the field with 1 person at a wicket as bowler and 1 person at the other wicket as catcher. Two players from the batting team take the field as well, 1 at each wicket. [4] X Research source The bowler bowls the ball toward the wicket and the batter tries to hit the ball away from the wicket. At any time while the ball is in play, the 2 batters can run to the other wicket. Once they've swapped places and are both safely behind the popping crease on the other side, their team scores 1 run. Each batter continues batting until they're put out in some way—for example, if the bowler hits the wicket or a fielder catches a ball the batter hit. The out batter is replaced with the next player on the team and the innings continues. When 10 players from the batting team have been put out, that's the end of the innings. The teams switch sides and it's the fielding team's turn to bat."

      "title": "Every player bats in each innings.",
      "content": "Every player bats in each innings. The batting team starts the innings with 2 batters, one at each wicket. The bowler bowls the ball toward the wicket opposite them and that batter tries to hit the ball away. A batter's main goal is to hit the ball and score runs. They score runs by running back and forth from one wicket to the other while the ball is in play. [5] X Research source Whenever one batter runs to the opposite wicket, the other batter must do the same. They only score a run if both of them make it back past the popping crease to the wicket. After 6 deliveries of the ball (called an \"over\"), the fielding team chooses a different player to bowl and switches to the other wicket. The batters don't move. The fielding team switches position like this after every over. Batters stay in the match until they're put out. The most common ways for a batter to get put out include getting bowled out (the bowler broke the wicket), run out (the wicket was broken while the batter was running), or caught out (a fielder catches a ball hit by the batter in the air). Batters must hit the ball with their bat. If the ball hits a batter's leg or any other part of their body, they risk a \"leg before wicket\" (LBW) out. [6] X Research source When a batter is put out, they can rest for the remainder of that innings. The next player in the lineup will be called up to take their place."

The batter stands with their bat between the bowler and the wicket and swings their bat to try to knock the ball away from the wicket. [7] X Research source If the batter misses and the bowler breaks the wicket, the batter is out. Otherwise, the batter takes another delivery. If the wicketkeeper or another fielder breaks the wicket while the batter is running to the other wicket, the batter might also be out."

      "title": "Batters can score runs whenever the ball is in play.",

They have to make sure their teammate will be able to make it as well, since both of them have to succeed to earn a run. [8] X Research source Unlike baseball, cricket doesn't have the concept of a \"foul\" ball—if a batter hits the cricket ball with their bat, it's playable. Batters are also free to run back and forth as many times as they can while the ball is still in play. Not for boundary hits, though— over the boundary is an automatic 6 runs and hitting, bouncing, or rolling over the boundary is an automatic 4—no running required. Unlike baseball players, cricket batters don't have to run when they hit the ball. As soon as they leave their box they risk getting put out, so if they decide it's too risky, they can stay behind the crease and wait for the next delivery. Even though both players have to make it past the crease for a run, the player who actually hit the ball is the one who gets the credit for the run."

The batting team has 2 batters on the field at any time, but only one of those batters actually faces the bowler (called the \"striker\"). The other batter (the \"non-striker\") still has to run though, which means it's possible for them to be run out even if they're not actually the one facing the bowler. [9] X Research source If the 2 runners haven't crossed paths yet when the wicket is broken, the runner closest to the broken wicket is out. If the 2 runners have crossed paths when the wicket is broken, the runner furthest away from the broken wicket is out. [10] X Research source While it's technically possible for both runners to be run out if they both happen to be out of their boxes and the same distances from the popping creases at the same time, but that's super rare. It's almost always the case that one of them is going to be closer than the other. [11] X Research source"

All 11 members of the fielding team take the field, but 2 of them are posted near each of the wickets—the bowler and the wicketkeeper. While nothing in the rules requires a team to designate a wicketkeeper, most teams do. [12] X Research source There will typically be several players on a team who specialize as bowlers and rotate bowling duties during the match. There are also different types of bowlers depending on their relative skill sets. Wicketkeepers are agile and capable of making quick, snappy catches. They also advise bowlers on the length to bowl and field placements, similar to the relationship between a catcher and a pitcher in baseball."

[18] X Research source At any point during the match, knowing how many wickets have been taken can give you some idea of where you are in the match. For example, if a team is currently 120 for 9 wickets, you know that they only have 1 wicket remaining before their innings is over. Depending on the score, things could get pretty intense!

The total number of runs for a side includes the runs earned by each batter plus any extra runs awarded for other reasons. [19] X Research source For example, if a team's score for their first innings is listed as 140 for 8, that means they scored 140 runs and gave up 8 wickets.

If the teams haven't completed their innings by the end of the agreed-upon time, the match simply ends in a draw. Because cricket teams would rather win than draw, a captain has the power to \"declare\" the team's innings over even if they still have several team members who haven't been dismissed yet. A captain can also forfeit an innings before it starts, which they might do if they were already ahead in runs and the opposing team had just completed their second innings."

[22] X Research source International matches typically have 3 umpires, but the third umpire doesn't rotate positions with the 2 official umpires and can't make a decision unless the other 2 umpires ask them to.

But in practice, test cricket matches last 5 days at most. [27] X Research source It's possible that a test cricket match won't take the full 5 days allotted, but at the highest levels it's unlikely. If both teams haven't completed 2 innings at the end of the allotted time for the match, the match must end in a draw. A team can only win if both teams manage to complete both of their innings.
