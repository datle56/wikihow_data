      "content": "Create a budget . Track your spending and income to get an accurate picture of your financial situation. Save receipts or write down your purchases in a notebook as you make them. Review your bills each month and add those expenses to your budget. Organize your purchases by category (food, clothing, entertainment, etc.). Categories with the highest monthly amounts (or monthly amounts you consider surprisingly high) may be good targets for saving money. Once you've tracked your purchases for a while, create a monthly (or weekly) limit for each category. Make sure the total budget is smaller than your income for that period, with enough leftover for savings if possible.

      "content": "Plan your purchases in advance. Making spur of the moment decisions can balloon your expenditures. Write down what you need to buy while you're calm and at home. Make a preliminary trip before you go on your real shopping trip. Note the prices of several alternatives at one or more stores. Return home without buying anything and decide which products to buy on your second, \"real\" expedition. The more focused you are and the less time you spend in the store, the less you'll spend. If you are motivated to treat each purchase as an important decision, you will make better decisions. Do not accept free samples or try something on just for fun. Even if you don't plan on purchasing it, the experience can convince you to make a decision now instead of considering it carefully in advance."

Follow these tips to avoid making shopping decisions for the wrong reasons: Don't browse store windows or shop for fun. If you're only buying something because you find the act of shopping fun, you'll likely end up spending too much on stuff you don't need. [2] X Research source Don't make purchasing decisions when your judgment is impaired. Alcohol, other drugs, or sleep deprivation [3] X Research source can harm your ability to make sensible decisions.

      "content": "Pay in full and in cash. Credit and debit cards increase spending for two reasons: you have much more money available to spend than you normally would, and because no visible money is changing hands, it doesn't register as a \"real\" purchase. Similarly, running up a bar tab or using a delayed payment scheme makes it harder to realize how much you're actually spending. [4] X Research source Don't bring more cash with you than you need. If you don't have the extra money, you can't spend it. [5] X Research source Similarly, withdraw your weekly budget from an ATM once a week rather than filling up your wallet whenever you run out."

      "content": "Don't be fooled by marketing. Outside influences are a huge factor affecting what we spend our money on. Be vigilant and try to be aware of all the reasons you're drawn to a product. Don't buy something on the basis of an advertisement. Whether on television or the product's packaging, treat ads with skepticism [6] X Research source . They are designed to encourage you to spend money and will not provide an accurate portrayal of your options. Don't purchase something just because it's reduced price. Coupons and sales are great for products you were already planning to buy; purchasing something you don't need just because it's 50% off does not save money! Be aware of pricing tricks. Translate that \"$1.99\" price into \"$2\". Judge the price of an item on its own merits, not because it's a \"better deal\" than another option by the same company. (By making the \"worse deal\" atrocious value, someone can trick you into paying more for add-ons you don't need). Don't automatically buy the mid priced product within a category. Marketers know that if they want you to buy a high-priced product instead of a low-priced product, they can influence your decision by adding an outrageously expensive product to make the high-priced product intermediate in price and look reasonable in comparison."

Only use a coupon or take advantage of a discount for an item you absolutely need or decided to buy before the discount occurred. The attraction of a cheaper price is an easy way to get customers to buy something they don't need. Buy products only useful at particular times of year during the offseason. A winter coat should be cheap during summer weather."

This may sound paradoxical (isn't this buying something you don't need?) but in fact, it's easier to maintain your spending goals if you give yourself the occasional reward. Try to go cold turkey on unnecessary spending and you may eventually \"crack\" and splurge much more than you should. [7] X Research source Jump to info on spending on food and beverages . Set aside a very limited amount of money in your budget for these treats. The goal is to give yourself a small reward to keep your spirits up and prevent a giant splurge later. If your usual methods of treating yourself are expensive, find cheaper alternatives. Take a bubble bath at home instead of going to the spa, or borrow a movie from the library instead of going to the theater."

Research what the longest lasting brands are rather than assume the most expensive option is best. Similarly, wait until the item you need goes on sale when possible.

Make sure you'll drink all that milk before it goes bad, or that you have enough summer months left to wear that skirt more than a couple times. Do I lack something that serves the same purpose? Beware specialized products whose role can be performed by basic items you already have.

[13] X Research source Will this item change my life for the better? This is a tricky question, but purchases that encourage \"bad habits\" or cause you to neglect important parts of your life should be avoided. Will I miss this item if I don't buy it?
