      "title": "Use business letter format on company letterhead.",
      "content": "Use business letter format on company letterhead. A formal business letter on company letterhead sets the appropriate tone and establishes the letter as official business communication. Set a standard font and margins, typing the body of the letter in block-paragraph style â€“ single-spaced, with a double-space between paragraphs. [1] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Avoid using any abbreviations when you type addresses in formal business letters. For example, instead of typing \"123 Main St.,\" you would type \"123 Main Street.\" If your letterhead includes the address for your business, you can typically eliminate the address block for yourself."

      "title": "List the job title, salary, and start date.",
      "content": "List the job title, salary, and start date. Begin your letter with an enthusiastic tone, welcoming the recipient to the company in their new capacity. You might also include a brief summary of the recipient's job duties unless the job title makes them obvious. [2] X Research source For example, you might write: \"On behalf of Bob Builders, Inc., I am pleased to offer you the position of Secretary at a salary of $28,500 a year.

      "title": "Summarize the terms and conditions of the offer.",
      "content": "Summarize the terms and conditions of the offer. If there are any limitations to your offer they should be clearly stated. Additionally, if the offer is contingent on anything, those contingencies should be stated up front. For example, the offer may be contingent on a clean background check, or a clean drug test. This section may also include any documents the new employee needs to sign, such as a confidentiality agreement or a non-compete agreement. If you include any contingencies, provide the new employee with a deadline by which those things need to be completed. If you're only asking for documents to be signed, you might state that those documents can be signed on the new employee's first day."

    {
      "title": "Provide details about any benefits your company offers.",
      "content": "Provide details about any benefits your company offers. If your company offers health insurance, retirement benefits, educational assistance, paid time off, or other benefits, list those briefly. Let the new employee know when they will be eligible for those benefits, and how they can find out more information about them. Some employers start benefits at day one, but most require employees to work 60 or 90 days before they become eligible for benefits."

    {
      "title": "Close by thanking the recipient.",
      "content": "Close by thanking the recipient. Let the recipient know that you're grateful for their interest in your company and that you're glad they're coming to work with you. Communicate your excitement or enthusiasm for having the new employee join your team. [3] X Research source For example, you might say \"Thank you so much for your interest in our mission here at Bob Builders, Inc.

    {
      "title": "Include your job title under your name.",
      "content": "Include your job title under your name. The business letter template provides 4 blank lines for your signature after the formal closing. Under that space, type your first and last name. Under your name, type your job title and the name of the company. [4] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For example, you might type \"Director of Operations, Bob Builders, Inc.\""

      "content": "Proofread your letter carefully. Make sure your letter is free of any typos and spelling or grammatical errors.

    {
      "title": "Start with a statement about the importance of confirmation.",
      "content": "Start with a statement about the importance of confirmation. The sacrament of Confirmation deepens baptismal grace, strengthening the bond between the confirmand and the Church. Address the confirmand personally, and congratulate them for taking this step and receiving this sacrament. For example, you might say \"As you prepare to receive the sacrament of Confirmation, I am honored to support you as you take this important step to deepen your bond with Christ and the Church.\" Use words and phrases from the Catholic Catechism to stress the importance of this step in the confirmand's journey of faith."

[7] X Research source For example, you might discuss memories of when the recipient was baptized. Questions the recipient may have asked you about the Church or about your faith are also good jumping-off points for reflection. Don't worry about making this long or overly detailed. Brevity can also be powerful."

      "title": "Include encouraging or inspirational quotes from Scripture.",
      "content": "Include encouraging or inspirational quotes from Scripture. Use quotes to further express the meaning of the sacrament and the teachings of the Church.

For example, you might try \"The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.\" (Proverbs 18:10). Another encouraging quote is \"For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil and not for harm, to give you a future with hope.\" (Jeremiah 29:11). You might also try \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\" (Philippians 4:13)."

      "title": "Write your final letter by hand to make it more personal.",
      "content": "Write your final letter by hand to make it more personal. Formal letters are typically typed. However, a handwritten confirmation letter feels more personal and authentic, as though it came straight from the heart. This can be a great touch to add. If you're going to write your letter by hand, go slowly. Write as neatly as possible, and make sure you aren't introducing any errors. It can help to type your letter out first and then copy it."

[8] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source In a legal sense, a confirmation letter also may be used to create a record of an agreement made orally. The formal business letter format is appropriate, as these letters may be used as evidence in court.

      "title": "Use an appropriate salutation.",
      "content": "Use an appropriate salutation. Typically you'll start the salutation line with the word \"dear,\" followed by \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" and the first and last name of the recipient of the letter.

If your confirmation included a request or an assignment of responsibilities, ask them to confirm their agreement on those terms. [12] X Research source Even if you don't have anything specific for the person to contact you about, it's usually a good idea to include a line with your preferred method of communication and let them know that they can contact you if they have any further questions.
