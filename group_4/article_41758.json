The best way to break a pair of sneakers in is by wearing them around your home—they’ll loosen even if you’re just sitting down. The heat and sweat from your feet will soften up the shells of the sneakers and cause the shoes to mold to the shape of your feet. Be aware that it can take 5 to 7 days to break in a pair of shoes. So, if you have a big track meet or other sporting event tomorrow, this may not be the most effective method. Tip : Wear a thick pair of socks to help stretch and break in your sneakers faster."
