      "title": "Start by learning the Dutch alphabet.",
      "content": "Start by learning the Dutch alphabet. If English is your first language, you’ll find that many letters are pronounced the same in both Dutch and English. However, a few sounds that are unique to Dutch might give you a little trouble. [1] X Research source Consonant sounds that are more or less pronounced the same in Dutch and English include: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, S, T, and V. Dutch vowels are pronounced: A (like the “a” in “hard”), E (either like the “e” in “set” or the “a” in “cane”), I (like the “i” in “sit”), O (like the “o” in “hot” or the “oa” in “boat”), and U (say it like the “e” in “her,” but round your lips into an “O” shape instead of keeping them relaxed). In Dutch, “J” is pronounced like the English “Y.” “R” is rolled, like in Spanish, but the sound is pronounced in the throat instead of the front of the mouth. Tricky sounds unique to Dutch include “G” and “W,” and it’ll take some practice to master them."

      "content": "Practice making the guttural “ghuh” sound. Pronounce “g” and “ch” with a throaty, guttural sound. It’s a bit like the sound you make when you gargle. Note that “ch” is hard, as in the Scottish word “loch,” instead of like the English word “chart.” The consonants in these guttural sounds aren’t voiced; rather, they’re aspirated. [2] X Research source Say the English word “zip.” The “z” is voiced, and you feel more of a vibration when you pronounce it. In “sip,” on the other hand, the “s” is unvoiced. Make the “ghuh” and “chuh” sounds with the back of your throat, but try not to voice the consonant sound. Practice saying Dutch words such as “goedemorgen” (ghooh-duh-mawr-ghuh), “goedenacht” (ghooh-duh-nahkht), and “gezellig” (ghuh-zell-eh-ghuh)."

      "title": "Learn the Dutch pronunciation for “W.”",
      "content": "Learn the Dutch pronunciation for “W.” The consonant sound “V” is similar in both Dutch and English. “W,” on the other hand, is like a cross between English “W” and “V” sounds. To make the Dutch “W” sound, try to make an English “W” sound with your bottom teeth pressed against your top lip. [3] X Research source Practice saying the words for who, what, and where in Dutch: “wie” (wvee), “wat” (wvaht), and “waar” (wvahr)."

      "title": "Work on Dutch vowel combinations.",
      "content": "Work on Dutch vowel combinations. Vowel sounds change when they're used in combination, so memorize how to pronounce each variation. In Dutch, double vowels (such as “aa”) are common, and are generally pronounced longer than single vowels. Additionally, there are several vowel combinations (such as “oe”), which produce sounds that are unique to the Dutch language. [4] X Research source Pronounce the double vowels: aa (“ahh”), ee (like the “a” in “may” or, when followed by r, like the “e” in “here”), oo (like the “o” in “no,” or as the “o” in “more” when followed by r), and uu (like “uhh” with the lips rounded and tongue brought to the front of the mouth). Sound out the vowel combinations: ai (rhymes with “I”), au (like \"aw\" in \"awesome\"), ei (rhymes with “eye”), ij (same as \"ei\" in Dutch), eu (somewhat like the vowel sound in “birth,” but with a rounded mouth), ie (rhymes with “we”), oe (rhymes with “who”), ou (like the “ou” in “house”), ui (no English equivalent; it sounds like a cross between “ow” and “oy”)."

Goedemiddag (ghoo-duh-mih-dahgh), or “good afternoon.” Goedenavond (ghoo-duh-nah-fohnt), which is Dutch for “good evening.”"

Generally, you can use informal expressions in most social situations. Use the formal version with people in distinguished positions, such as elders or your boss. [9] X Research source “Dank u wel (dahnk-ew-vehl) is the formal way to say “thank you.” “Dank je wel” (dahnk-yuh-vehl) is the informal version. You can also use “hartelijk bedankt” (hahr-tuh-lik buh-dahnkt), or “thank you very much.” To say “you’re welcome,” use “graag gedaan” (ghrahgh ghuh-dahn)."

Many Dutch people speak English, but it’s helpful and respectful to commit a few key phrases to memory before your trip. For instance, instead of just assuming a stranger speaks English, ask “Pardon, spreek je Engels?” (pahr-dohn, sprayk yuh ehng-uhls). Other useful phrases for travelers include: [12] X Research source “Ik spreek niet zo goed Nederlands” (ik sprayk neet zoh ghood nay-der-lahnds), or “I don’t speak Dutch very well.” “Mag ik een” (mahg ick uhn), which means “May I have a.” To ask for a coffee, for example, say “Mag ik een koffie, alsjeblieft?” (mahg ick uhn kof-fee, ahl-shuh-bleeft). “Wat kost het?” (wvat kohst ut), which means “How much is it?” “Waar is het toilet?” (wvahr is hut twah-let?), or “Where is the bathroom?”"

Add the number before the noun it describes just as you would in English. For example, “Mag ik twee vaasjes, alsjeblieft?” (mahg ick twvee vahs-yus, ahl-shuh-bleeft) means “May I have 2 beers, please?”"

[15] X Research source “Lekker” (it’s pronounced as it’s spelled) can mean “yummy” or “nice.” Use it to describe a tasty meal or to add a positive emphasis to a statement. “Slaap lekker” (slahp lekker), for example, means “sleep well.” “Te gek” (tuh ghehkh), which literally means “too crazy,” is used to describe something as “awesome” or “fun.” If someone asks you how your trip was, for instance, you’d say “Te gek!” “Zeg mar” means “so to speak,” and is sometimes inserted casually into sentences. In English, someone might say, “It’s so, like, cool, but a little weird.” A Dutch person would say, “Het is heel leuk, zeg maar, maar ook een beetje raar” (ut is hayl loke, zehgh mahr, mahr oke uhn bay-tyuh rahr)."

If you mispronounce something or say the wrong word, just jot down the correction in a notebook."
