The first step in the trademark process is to make sure your name - or \"mark\" - fits the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) definition of strong. [2] X Trustworthy Source United States Patent and Trademark Office U.S. government agency responsible for registering and protecting patents and trademarks Go to source The mark must have a non-intuitive, secondary meaning that represents your services or product, and no one else's. The USPTO divides marks into four different categories different strength levels, and those that fall into the \"weaker\" categories have very little chance of getting trademarked. Here are the categories, from strongest to weakest: Fanciful and arbitrary . Fanciful or arbitrary marks are the strongest type, because there's a slim chance someone else would independently think them up and start using them. Made-up words and words that aren't usually associated with a certain product or service fall into this category. For example, naming a shoe company \"Brunnox\" would be fanciful, and naming a beer product \"Flashlight\" would be arbitrary. [3] X Research source Suggestive . A suggestive mark is one that suggests, but doesn't overtly describe, a certain service or product. Marks in this category aren't quite as strong as those considered fanciful or arbitrary, but you can still get a suggestive mark trademarked if it meets other requirements. Using \"Soft and bright\" as the slogan for an undershirt company would be suggestive. [4] X Research source Descriptive . This category of marks is considered weak; there's a good chance other people could independently use the same mark, which would make the trademark protection difficult to enforce. Calling a cleaning service \"Wash and Scrub Cleaners\" would be descriptive. [5] X Research source Generic . It is not possible to trademark a word that falls into this category. Generic marks are in widespread, common use, and it would be impossible to enforce a trademark protection. Naming a lantern company \"Lantern\" is an example. [6] X Research source"

If another company has already trademarked your company name, you will be unable to trademark the name yourself. Start by thinking up some search terms. Since your goal in performing this search is to determine whether another company is using the name that you want to trademark or anything very similar, you will want to choose search terms that match your company name exactly and those that are very similar to your company's name."

Note the results of each of your search terms, taking special note of those results that are very similar or identical to your company name. Note the type of product or service that any similar marks are used to represent. Any mark that is very similar to your company name that also represents a similar product or service to your company should be noted. For example, if your company is engaged in the business of making and selling hair spray, look in the search results for the mark being used in connection with hair care products."

After conducting your search, you should have a good idea of whether another company has already trademarked your company name or something very close to it. You may also see applications of others that have already been denied for various reasons. If you find that another company has a mark similar or identical to yours but you still wish to proceed with using your company name, you should consult a trademark attorney in order to determine if you are legally entitled to do so. If you find no other company using your name as their own mark, you may still want to hire a trademark attorney to ensure that your search was accurate. An attorney will also help you complete the complicated filing process."

If you don't enforce your trademark, and it starts to get widely used \"generically\", you could lose your trademark protection. You will need to make additional USPTO filings to maintain your registration, starting 5 years after issuance, then renewal at 10 years. You should also have someone scan TESS and the Internet, from time to time, to spot possible infringements being filed or used before they get too far. Be sure to use the \"circle-R\" mark ® on your trademark, but only when used in association with the goods or services included in your registration. You may use TM or ™ when using your brand on other things not federally registered. Avoid using ® or ™ on the company name when used to identify the company rather than the particular goods or services under your brand."
