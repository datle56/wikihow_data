      "content": "Choose pasties in a nude color for minimal visibility. If your clothes are particularly loose or sheer and you don’t plan on wearing a bra, choosing nude-colored pasties will be the least conspicuous. If your clothes are slightly see-through or slip out of place, it will be less obvious. [1] X Research source If you don't want to be too revealing, you can choose a neutral nipple color if you have a semi sheer or sheer top.

      "content": "Use silicone pasties when wearing very sheer fabrics. These will be thicker and less visible through light fabrics. Paper or fabric pasties often create more visible outlines through thin fabrics than silicone pasties. These are usually available in lingerie shops and large department stores.

      "title": "Use paper or fabric pasties when you don’t need much coverage.",
      "content": "Use paper or fabric pasties when you don’t need much coverage. If you are not worried about the shape of your pasties being visible through your clothing, disposable or fabric pasties are typically cheaper and stay on better than reusable silicone ones. These can often be found in beauty supply shops and clothing stores. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid buying very heavy pasties that may fall off.",
      "content": "Avoid buying very heavy pasties that may fall off. If you are buying pasties with sequins or tassels for a costume, be aware that the heavier they are, the stronger the adhesive you use will have to be. If you are buying costume pasties, choose the lightest design you can find."

      "title": "Test your pasties at home before wearing them out for the first time.",
      "content": "Test your pasties at home before wearing them out for the first time. Even if your pasties seem to fit well and stay in place easily, it’s a good idea to wait a few hours and see if the adhesive lasts before wearing them out. If you can move around comfortably after an hour or two without feeling like your pasties have shifted or might be falling off, you can most likely be confident that they’ll stay put when you go out. If your pasties are not staying in place, you may need to try either a different shape of pasties or a different type of adhesive."

    {
      "title": "Read the instructions on your pasties.",
      "content": "Read the instructions on your pasties. Many pasties come with their own adhesive, while some attach by suction or require a separate adhesive. Look at the packaging of your pasties or any instructions included to see how they should be applied."

    {
      "title": "Use double-sided fabric tape when securing lighter pasties.",
      "content": "Use double-sided fabric tape when securing lighter pasties. If your pasties are made of a relatively thin material and are not decorated with heavy elements like sequins, beads or tassels, you can attach them with double-sided tape. Make sure to buy the kind that is meant for fabric, not for paper, as it will be stronger. Cut small strips of the tape to fit around the edges of the inside of your pasties. Apply the tape to the pasties first, then press them into place. If you want extra security and aren’t worried about the tape being visible, you can add another long strip of tape across each pastie after they are in place. Fabric tape or clothing tape is available in many beauty supply stores and lingerie shops."

      "title": "Use professional-grade spirit gum or body glue for heavier pasties.",
      "content": "Use professional-grade spirit gum or body glue for heavier pasties. Fancier pasties, like those used in burlesque costumes, tend to be a little heavier and therefore may require a stronger adhesive. If you are using particularly heavy or large pasties, look online or find a professional costuming shop that sells high-quality body glue or spirit gum. [5] X Research source Using a cotton swab or makeup applicator brush, apply the adhesive to the edges of the inside of the pasties, then press them into place. Some adhesives may instruct you to wait a few moments after applying the adhesive to allow it to become sticky."

      "title": "Make sure your skin is clean and dry where you will apply the pasties.",
      "content": "Make sure your skin is clean and dry where you will apply the pasties. Whether you are using stick-on pasties or applying an adhesive, they will stay on better if your skin is clean and clear of any oils, lotions or moisturizers. For this reason, it’s a good idea to apply pasties after taking a shower and drying off."

      "title": "Test any adhesives on your wrist before attaching pasties with them.",
      "content": "Test any adhesives on your wrist before attaching pasties with them. Some types of adhesive, particularly spirit gum, can cause reactions on sensitive skin. Put a small amount of adhesive on the inside of your wrist and wait a few hours. If there is no reaction, it should be safe to use for attaching your pasties."

    {
      "title": "Stick to the outer edges of the pasties when applying adhesive.",
      "content": "Stick to the outer edges of the pasties when applying adhesive. If you are using tape or adhesive to secure the pasties, keep it on the outer edges rather than the center of the pasties. This will keep it from sticking to more sensitive skin and make removal easier. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold the pasties in place for a few seconds after attaching them.",
      "content": "Hold the pasties in place for a few seconds after attaching them. Many types of adhesive take a few seconds to bond to both surfaces. For extra security, make sure your pasties are placed where you want them and then hold them on tightly for a few seconds to make sure they stick. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Clean any adhesive off your skin after wearing pasties.",
      "content": "Clean any adhesive off your skin after wearing pasties. Even mild adhesives often cause skin reactions if left on too long. To keep your skin healthy, wash any remaining adhesive off with soap and water after you remove your pasties. Some adhesives may require additional cleaning, such as spirit gum, which must be removed with an acetone cleaner. [8] X Research source"
