      "content": "Look for GPS location markers. Many social media accounts will allow people to post a location when they make posts. For example, if the person you want to track is on vacation in Germany, their Facebook account might show \"Berlin\" as the location for photos they post. If the person uses loose privacy settings, you may be able to see these locations and determine where the person is. This will only work if you are friends with the person, have a mutual friend who can look for you, or their security settings allow people who are not friends to see their posts."

It's a good idea to tell your child that s/he is being monitored and why. This will help avoid your child feeling like you have broken his or her trust. The laws are more complicated when people are not legally minors. In many cases, installing a tracking app on an adult's phone is illegal without telling him or her."
