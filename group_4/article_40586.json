      "content": "Gather the vegetable seeds and begin preparing them for planting. You should do this about 6 to 8 weeks before the average date of the final frost. Some vegetables to consider may include cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower and peppers. Fill your cell tray, old egg carton, or cut-off milk carton with some potting soil mix. You want to make sure the soil is damp before placing it in the container."

      "title": "Sow your seed into the soil.",
      "content": "Sow your seed into the soil. Place 1 or 2 seeds in each cell. You can always thin out the extra seedling. Read the seed package to determine the depth you should be planting vegetables. Sprinkle more soil on top of the seeds, enough to cover them."

      "content": "Remove the plastic bags or wrap once the seeds begin to sprout. They should appear in 10 to 14 days, but some may take as long as 21 days. If for whatever reason your vegetable seeds don't grow, just plant vegetable seeds again."

      "title": "Water your seedlings just enough to make the soil moist.",
      "content": "Water your seedlings just enough to make the soil moist. You can use a spray bottle with a mist function to ensure the soil doesn't get too wet."

      "content": "Harden your vegetable seedlings 2 weeks before planting in the ground. Place the cell trays outside for 2 to 3 hours per day in full sun. After 1 week, you can leave your seedlings outside day and night provided the frost threat is over."
