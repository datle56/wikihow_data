      "content": "Choose between a mechanical or electric typewriter. [1] X Research source There are a few broad categories of typewriter available on the market. The most widely-used of these are mechanical typewriters, which are completely hand-powered. Electric typewriters, on the other hand, need to be plugged in to function. However, they automate some of the trickier aspects of typewriter use, such as erasing and consistent printing. Choose a typewriter that fits the experience you would like to have. Mechanical typewriters can be taken around and used anywhere, regardless of your access to electricity. Electric typewriters will speed up your progress by removing the time-wasting setbacks of their hand-powered counterparts. There are also fully electronic typewriters available. These have an LCD display screen and the text is digital, much like a regular computer. [2] X Research source If you opt for a fully electronic typewriter, you can save the material onto a floppy disk and print it from there."

There are different ways to go about erasing mistakes, depending on the form of typewriter you're using.

Electric typewriters often come equipped with a second ribbon of white-out eraser to blot out mistakes. The best way to contend with typewriting mistakes is to avoid them altogether. Type with greater care than you would on a computer. A common trick for rubbing out mistakes is to backpedal over the unwanted text and type a row of x's atop them. If there are significant issues on a page, it may be prudent to start the page over and copy the good material over again."
