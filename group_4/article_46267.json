      "title": "Measure out your powder detergent per the instructions.",
      "content": "Measure out your powder detergent per the instructions. Refer to the detergent’s box to find out how much powder you need to use to clean your clothes. Typically, you should use 1/3 cup (80 mL) of powder detergent or less. Use the measuring cup that came with the detergent to weigh out the powder. People tend to overdo it with detergent—especially powder detergent. Unless you’re washing a full load that happens to be super dirty, you normally don’t need more than 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of detergent. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour the powder into the detergent drawer if you have one.",
      "content": "Pour the powder into the detergent drawer if you have one. Washing machines design their detergent compartment so that you can use liquid or powder detergent. [2] X Research source If you have a little container that pops out of the machine for detergent, pour the powder into the same compartment you’d normally put liquid detergent. [3] X Research source On most machines, the detergent compartment is the biggest container in the drawer. It will often say “detergent,” “II,” or “2” on the soap container. The other containers are for bleach and/or fabric softener. Detergent compartments are super common on newer machines and front-loading washers. On top loaders, the containers are often on the rim of the drum, inside the machine."

      "title": "Add the powder directly to the drum if you don’t have a drawer.",
      "content": "Add the powder directly to the drum if you don’t have a drawer. If you do not have a little compartment for detergent, simply load the machine with your clothes and pour the powder into the machine. Most older machines and a lot of top-loading machines don’t have a separate compartment for detergent. If you’re using a powder tablet, put it in a mesh delicates bag first and then set the bag in the machine. The bag will help the powder dissolve more evenly. You can do this even if you’ve got a little compartment for detergent. A lot of people do this because they’re nervous about the powder clumping up inside of their washing machine."

      "title": "Run your preferred washing cycle based on what you’re washing.",
      "content": "Run your preferred washing cycle based on what you’re washing. Don’t change your wash settings based on the type of detergent you’re using. Launder your clothes the same way you would with normally would. Set the load size, choose your soil level, and select the water temperature before pressing the start button. [4] X Research source High-efficiency (HE) washers—which includes most machines made after 2010—automatically detect the load size and set the water level accordingly. Once your clothes are done washing, toss them in the dryer or hang them out to air dry ."

      "title": "Powder detergent is a lot cheaper than liquid detergent.",
      "content": "Powder detergent is a lot cheaper than liquid detergent. Powder detergent generally costs around $0.10-0.24 per load, while liquid detergent can run you up to $0.47 per wash. That means that the average family can save up to $70 a year just by switching to a powder detergent—and your clothes will be just as clean! [5] X Research source Powder detergent is also a lot easier to measure out accurately, which means you’ll save money by not wasting detergent from overpouring."

      "title": "Storing powder detergent tends to be a lot easier.",
      "content": "Storing powder detergent tends to be a lot easier. Liquid detergent is mostly water, which means that you need to keep a giant, heavy jug around in your laundry room. Powder detergent, on the other hand, is usually 100% pure detergent, and it comes in a tiny, compact, and lightweight box. This makes it a great option if you’re short on space or live in a building with shared laundry. [6] X Research source If you don’t have a washing machine at home or in your building, powder detergent is a lot easier to haul to the laundromat!"

      "title": "Powder detergent is a lot more effective for mud and dirt.",
      "content": "Powder detergent is a lot more effective for mud and dirt. Powder detergent contains a handful of cleaning chemicals that most liquid detergents don’t, which makes it better at wearing away mud, dirt, clay, and grass stains. You can even pre-treat these kinds of stains by spot cleaning them with powder detergent and water if you’d like. [7] X Research source While powder detergent is quite phenomenal, you’re better off using liquid detergent on grease stains."

      "title": "It’s better for the environment to use powder detergent.",
      "content": "It’s better for the environment to use powder detergent. Liquid detergent comes in a thick plastic container, while powder comes in a biodegradable box. On top of that, liquid detergent requires a lot of clean water to manufacture, while the powder stuff is pure cleaning ingredients. All things considered, it’s a lot less wasteful to use powder detergent if you’re trying to be eco-friendly. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Leave room for your clothes to move around.",
      "content": "Leave room for your clothes to move around. Packing your washing machine to the brim makes it difficult for the clothes to spin around, which can keep them from getting clean. This is especially important with powder detergent, since the powder may form clumps on the clothes if they can’t move around."

      "title": "Choose a shorter wash cycle for small loads.",
      "content": "Choose a shorter wash cycle for small loads. There’s no point in wasting a full cycle’s worth of electricity and water when you’re only washing a few articles of clothing. Use the quickest cycle setting available if you’re just laundering a few things. [9] X Research source A high-efficiency washer will automatically measure water levels, but they won’t artificially change the wash time. Most washing machines have a timer setting. You don’t need more than 20 minutes or so for a handful of items."

      "title": "Always read the label on your clothes to avoid ruining them.",
      "content": "Always read the label on your clothes to avoid ruining them. Those labels aren’t arbitrary. If you throw something that needs to be hand-washed in the washing machine, you’re going to destroy it. Check the tags on your clothing to see if you need to use cold water, the delicate cycle, or if you can wash it using whatever settings you’d like. [10] X Research source This is especially important for any clothing items that are made of organic materials, like cotton or wool. You can really ruin the shape or feel of handwoven or natural materials."
