      "title": "Moths represent change or transformation.",
      "content": "Moths represent change or transformation. We usually give butterflies credit for undergoing dramatic metamorphoses, but moths do the same! That’s why moths, too, tend to represent transformation. That transformation is usually emotional or spiritual, reminding you that you’re always growing and shifting as a person. Unlike butterflies, though, which tend to be flamboyant, the changes associated with moths are often more subtle, but no less meaningful. If you see a moth in your home, it could be a messenger of changes to come. Now’s the time to take stock of your strengths , which will aid you through that change."

      "title": "Moths symbolize endings or conclusions.",
      "content": "Moths symbolize endings or conclusions. If butterflies represent new beginnings, it’s only right that moths represent endings. That ending might be a death, a conclusion to your troubles, the conclusion of a relationship, or anything else that you must let go of. But the moth’s metamorphosis represents what’s on the other side of that ending, which is a new beginning. Spotting a moth at night is often an omen of a soon-to-be ending. Think about the things in your life that might be leaving soon—a job that you’ve outgrown, a friend that’s moving away—and reflect on how they aided you to help ease you into the transition. Some Native American cultures believe that moths are spirit guides, traversing the space between life and death, beginnings and endings. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Moths are often positive omens. While it’s true that moths symbolize change or endings, they often promise a positive resolution to that change. [2] X Research source Though they may not always be as showy as a butterfly, they’re beautiful all the same, and this understated appearance serves to remind us that there’s always a silver lining. Some say that in Chinese culture, moths represent yin-yang energy; that with every negative omen, a positive omen is right around the corner. While spotting a dead moth might be concerning, it’s actually a reminder of the natural life cycle of everything, and an omen of a peaceful conclusion to your concerns. Stay motivated in your pursuits and trust that they’ll bear fruit."

      "content": "Luna moths represent knowledge and intuition. These moths are often light-green, slightly translucent, and have “moons” or “eyes” on their wings. They’re active at night, when the moon is in the sky, and like the moon, represent illumination or newfound knowledge. [3] X Research source Their graceful flight in the dark reminds us to trust our intuition, even when we can’t see, and also trust that our path will be revealed soon enough. Luna moths also represent spirituality or spiritual connections, sometimes appearing similar to guardian angels or spiritual messengers. If you see a luna moth, take it as a sign that you should be okay in not knowing everything, and that you should trust your gut in any major upcoming decisions."

      "content": "Death’s-head Hawk-moths are often seen as omens of death. That’s probably not surprising, though. After all, it’s right there in the name.

[4] X Research source It’s sometimes said that when these moths make an appearance, someone you know may soon pass. This moth was also featured in the iconic serial-killer film The Silence of the Lambs, further emphasizing its association with death.
