      "title": "Use a synonym for sexy.",
      "content": "Use a synonym for sexy. Many people’s go-to for telling a woman she’s sexy is to tell her that she’s, well, sexy. The word has power, but it gets old quick. (And if you’re trying to hit on a girl you’re not involved with yet, sometimes the word “sexy” can be too forward.) But there are lots of synonyms for “sexy” that are perfect for letting her know you find her attractive. Keep it elegant with “You’re ravishing” or be more forthright with “You’re so hot.” [1] X Research source “You’re captivating” “You’re absolutely irresistible.” “You're stunning.\" “You’re the most gorgeous woman I’ve ever seen.”"

      "content": "Take it up a notch by letting her know how much she turns you on. \"Sexy\" describes not only how gorgeous she is, but how she makes you feel. Let her know she excites you and that you can't wait to be together. \"I have to get you alone.\" \"I can't keep my hands off you.\" \"You're driving me wild.\" \"I can't wait for tonight, you sultry thing.\""

      "title": "Leave it up to imagination by keeping it vague.",
      "content": "Leave it up to imagination by keeping it vague. There's nothing wrong with being bold and direct about your feelings, but sometimes, it's what's left unsaid that hits the hardest. Really amp up the sexual tension by being intentionally vague or understated, and let your body language do the talking: undress her with your eyes, bite your lip, or gently brush her shoulder. \"You're indescribable.\" \"I don't know what it is about you.\" \"You're OK, kid.\" \"You're something, all right.\""

      "title": "Compliment a specific part of her that’s sexy.",
      "content": "Compliment a specific part of her that’s sexy. Whether it’s her eyes, her smile, or her rear end, specific compliments can feel more genuine than simply “You’re hot” (but there’s nothing wrong with an occasional “You’re hot”!). Of course, use discretion: for instance, if you’re not involved with a girl, probably best to avoid “Great butt!” “Your smile drives me crazy.” “I want to lick your freckles.” “Whenever you bend over I go wild.” “I lose control at the sound of your laugh.”"

      "title": "Highlight non-physical aspects of her sexiness.",
      "content": "Highlight non-physical aspects of her sexiness. She’s sure to appreciate that you find her physically attractive, but it’s also important for people to feel that their non-physical attributes are alluring, as well. Compliment her on her intellect, her kindness, her work ethic, or her passion. “You drive me wild when you get excited about something.” “Your passion is just intoxicating.” “I could listen to you talk about neuroscience all day.” “When I see you in the zone, it turns me on so much.”"

      "title": "Let her know you think of her even when she’s not present.",
      "content": "Let her know you think of her even when she’s not present. It will make her feel sexy to know she’s a cause for distraction. Telling her she’s on your mind when she’s not around will make her feel incredibly desirable. “I could barely do my work today, I couldn’t stop thinking about you.” “I haven’t been able to stop wondering what you were up to.” “Everything I saw today reminded me of you.” “I’ve been too distracted thinking about last night to function today.”"

      "content": "Make her feel unique . She’ll be pleased to hear she’s special. Turn her on by telling her she’s not like anyone else, and that you care for her more than you’ve ever cared for anyone. \"You’re like nobody I’ve ever met before. You’re totally original.” “You’re absolutely unforgettable.” “Nobody can make me feel the way you do.” “How could anyone not be utterly in love with you?”"

      "content": "Let her know you’re planning fun and sexy dates. Telling her she’s sexy will make her feel great, but don’t stop there: show her how excited you are to be with her by making plans to take her out (or stay in) and shower her with a good time. (Planning special dates is particularly important if you’ve been in a relationship for a while and the “honeymoon” period has worn off!) “I’m dying to see you in a cocktail dress. Let’s hit the bar.” “Let’s go show you off to the world.” “Get your coat: we’re going out for dinner at that fancy new restaurant.” “I’m making you dinner: we’re having a night in tonight. And after dinner? Who knows…”"

You can tell her what you want to do with her, or tell her how she makes you feel.

      "content": "Be direct. While it’s good to vary how you compliment your partner, there’s nothing wrong with not beating it around the bush once in a while. In fact, getting right to the point can have the effect of seeming more genuine, less cheesy, and more passionate. “I need you.” “You turn me on so much.” “I’m desperate for you.” “You’re so sexy.” (Hey, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.)"
