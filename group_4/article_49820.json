      "content": "Address the person best qualified to comment on your work. Often, this will be the manager immediately above you. In any case, you should start with them or a more senior colleague or co-worker. They will have the experience to help you and give you the feedback you need. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Be polite in the email, but follow your office norms too. If you have a more casual relationship with your boss, suddenly being so polite you sound stuffy or afraid might come off wrong. Humility goes a long way in asking for feedback, but don’t be so humble that your boss or manager thinks you know nothing about your job. Rather, frame the questions in ways that show your progress on a project or task. [2] X Research source This will let the boss know you aren’t just sitting on your hands waiting for feedback. [3] X Research source You can say, “I was working on the presentation for tomorrow when I ran into a snag with the format—I’m not sure if I’m following the company’s standard. I’ve attached the presentation. Do you have any suggestions for the format? Thank you for your help with this.” Harish Chandran, PhD, Executive Coach, says that there's no one way to ask for (and get) feedback. \"It's personal and depends on the [relationship],\" he says. \"There are some very candid ways of delivering feedback or getting feedback.\""

    {
      "title": "Be specific in your feedback request.",
      "content": "Be specific in your feedback request. This can help you avoid overly broad feedback that is unlikely to help you at your job. Avoid yes or no questions unless necessary. Instead, focus on specific parts of a project that need work. Try not to bombard your boss or co-worker with all the possible questions you could have about your job all at once. [4] X Research source Career coach and psychotherapist Katherine Kirkinis, Ed.M., MA, says that giving feedback is a skill that not all managers have. \"I definitely wouldn't assume that [getting less feedback is necessarily a good thing], and I think it's okay to help people give you feedback. If you haven’t gotten any [feedback], ask,\" she says. Because of this, being specific when asking for feedback is key to getting great feedback. You can say, for example, “I wasn’t sure how to proceed with the Eastman file. The client hasn’t responded to my emails, and since it is a high-priority assignment, I thought it best to email you to see what I should do.” If you are looking for more general feedback in the form of a review or report, request that specifically. Being polite and concise will help. For instance, you could ask for a report on your efficiency or creativity. If you are asking for feedback from those who report to you, you may need to conduct an anonymous survey."

      "title": "Send a thank-you email once they’ve responded.",
      "content": "Send a thank-you email once they’ve responded. Make sure you send the thank-you email within 1-2 days. If the feedback you got suggests you need a lot of improvement or that your work is not up to par, make sure to include a brief statement of how you’ll fix it. Give yourself time to process the emotions before immediately responding. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Identify yourself.",
      "content": "Identify yourself. Your teacher may have hundreds of students, especially if they’re a college professor. You’ll need to include your name (first and last), your class, and section. If you are still in high school, this might mean your period or time slot. This way, you won’t waste the teacher’s time making them figure out who you are, and they’ll spend more time on the feedback you need. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Keep it formal.",
      "content": "Keep it formal. Sometimes students struggle with formality when first emailing teachers. You can say “Hi Dr. Smith” or “Dear Ms. Turner.” If your teacher has emailed you, do not be less formal than they have been. Keep the tone professional. [7] X Research source Instead of saying, “Hey, what do ya think of my paper? It isn’t the greatest,” say, “I’m not sure I understand the assignment. I had some specific questions regarding the paper.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep it brief.",
      "content": "Keep it brief. Don’t worry about explaining all the context of your questions unless the context is necessary for those questions. For instance, if you’re requesting feedback on a possible extension, your teacher may need context, but if you are trying to ask a question about an assignment, don’t tell them the story about how your dog made you run late and why you’re emailing now (unless it’s very close to the assignment time), or anything else that might be irrelevant to the assignment at hand.

    {
      "title": "Don’t wait to ask for feedback until the night before an exam or due date.",
      "content": "Don’t wait to ask for feedback until the night before an exam or due date. Not only is your teacher not likely to give you feedback that close to a due date, they are likely to be irritated that you waited until the last minute to ask them for feedback. If you must send last-minute questions, be brief, specific, and apologetic. It will make the teacher more likely to respond, assuming they see the email in time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use file formats your teacher has requested.",
      "content": "Use file formats your teacher has requested. Often, the teacher will tell you on the syllabus what file formats they will accept for assignments or in emails. For instance, if your teacher specifies a .doc file, don’t send a .pdf or a .pages file. If you are unsure, you can send an .rtf or .pdf file or simply ask."

      "title": "Ask for feedback on a paper or exam you've already turned in.",
      "content": "Ask for feedback on a paper or exam you've already turned in. You simply need to email the professor and be polite. If the professor has office hours, you can visit those or make an appointment. You can say, \"Dear Professor Smith, I didn't do as well on my exam as I expected. Could you help me work through some of the mistakes I made so I can do better on the next exam?\" Your professor should typically respond favorably to such a request."

      "content": "Don't ask too many questions. Customers are overwhelmed with surveys from pretty much every business out there.

      "content": "Ask open-ended questions. Rather than using yes/no questions, ask questions that elicit fuller answers. Instead of asking, \"Would you recommend us to a friend?\" ask, \"How would you describe us to a friend?\" These kinds of open-ended questions give you more information in the answers than a simple yes/no question.

      "content": "Let the customer know you'll get back to them quickly. This makes the customer feel their opinion isn't just going to some giant inbox, where it may or may not be read or considered. You'll also likely get more candid feedback if they know you'll respond. [11] X Research source When you do respond, be candid and professional. In today's viral internet culture, you can ruin a company's reputation in a second if you respond with anything other than professionalism and sincerity."

If they are a famous author, they are unlikely to respond as they likely get a lot of emails just like the one you sent. Instead, ask your friends, colleagues, professors, etc., first.

      "content": "Be specific about what you want from their feedback. If you only want positive feedback, tell them so. Tell them whether you want detailed, local, or global feedback and aesthetic, grammatical, or structural feedback. This can go a long way in helping your reader know what you want from them. [17] X Research source Positive feedback need not be unconstructive. If they explain why they like what they like, you can learn a lot about your manuscript. [18] X Research source If you get negative feedback, give yourself time to respond. If they are your friend, they likely only want to help. No matter how angry or upset you feel, if they are a professor, you should not respond that way. Instead, thank them for their help and move on.
