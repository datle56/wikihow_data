      "content": "While a new tattoo is still healing, avoid direct sunlight altogether. If you’ve just gotten a fresh tattoo, it’s important to keep it out of the sun, explains Myles. Your skin will still be healing from all the tiny pricks of the tattoo needle, which makes it more inflamed and more sensitive to the sun than usual. It’s not safe to put sunscreen on while it’s still healing , so the best course of action is to stay out of the sun as much as possible during this period. [1] X Research source How long do you need to stay out of the sun after getting a tattoo? The amount of time it takes for a tattoo to heal depends on its size and location, but in general, it takes about 3-4 weeks for the skin’s surface to heal. You should try to avoid the sun for about this long. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover your new tattoo with clothing if you’re spending time outside. If you need to be outside during this 2-4 week healing period, cover your tattoo with clothing so it’s not exposed to direct sunlight. Regular clothes work well, but you can also purchase sun protective UPF clothing for some extra protection. [3] X Research source These garments are specifically designed to protect you from UV radiation, and some of them can block out up to 98% of the sun’s rays. This protects your new tattoo and also prevents skin cancer, so it’s a win-win situation! [4] X Research source Just make sure to pick loose garments, rather than tight or form-fitting ones, as your tattoo continues to heal. “You want to be careful that your clothes don't rub on it. That will definitely irritate a tattoo,” says Myles. Light fabrics like linen work well if it's summer or you live in a hot climate."

      "content": "Once your tattoo has healed, protect it from the sun with sunscreen. “After a new tattoo is fully healed, which I generally say is about three weeks to a month, you can start to apply sunscreen ,” says Lubbock. “So when you're out and about in daily life, go ahead and apply a small coat of sunscreen if you're going to be exposed to the sun,” he says. The same sunscreen rules that you'd follow for your regular routine apply for tattooed skin, but here are some specific tips: Pick a product that says “broad-spectrum” on the label. This means it protects from both UVA and UVB rays. Make sure that it’s SPF 30 or higher and water resistant. Apply your sunscreen 15 minutes before you go outdoors (it takes your skin about this long to absorb the product and get the protective effects). Rub a generous amount into your skin to make sure it’s thoroughly covered. Reapply your sunscreen every two hours.

The tiny needle makes little pricks all over the area, which leaves your skin extra sensitive and prone to irritation. In general, wounded skin and scars are more vulnerable to the negative effects of sunlight, which is why it’s important to keep your tattoo covered and protected while it’s still scabbing and healing.

The UV radiation from sunlight can cause the ink to fade prematurely, so if you want to keeping your tattoos looking fresh and vibrant for years to come, things like sunscreen, protective clothing, and staying out of the sun during the harshest hours of the day (10:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m.) are key.

The UV rays from the sun cause the breakdown of collagen and elastin in your skin, leading to wrinkles, looser skin, and discoloration.

      "content": "Make sure to follow the specific directions of your tattoo artist. “The first step is to always follow your artist's instructions, because we each do a tattoo a little bit differently. It's a good idea to follow exactly what the artist says,” Lubbock explains. However, there are some universal tips most tattoo artists will tell you to follow after getting a new tattoo . Here are a few: Wash your tattoo with warm water and a gentle cleanser twice daily. Apply a thin layer of gentle moisturizer to the area to keep it hydrated. Keep the tattoo out of the sun and don’t put sunscreen on it until it’s fully healed. Don’t scratch or pick at scabs. Don’t wear tight clothing that rubs at the scabbed area. Avoid immersing yourself in water (swimming, going in the hot tub, taking a bath, etc) for at least 10 days.
