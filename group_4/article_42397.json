      "content": "Buy a crate for your skunk. Before you obtain your little pet skunk, go to a local pet shop and pick out a large dog crate for it. Pick the biggest one that will fit in your home, so that your skunk will have room to move around in it. [1] X Research source Get a crate that is made for extra large dog breeds. These crates are usually about 4 feet (1.2 m) deep, 3 feet (0.91 m) wide, and 4 feet (1.2 m) tall. The cage should be big enough to hold a bed, toys, and a litter box. Skunks naturally live in dens, so the crate will serve as its den."

      "content": "Get several litter boxes for your skunk. Your skunk can be trained to use a litter box just like a cat.

Introduce your skunk to a litter box and they will remember where it is when they need to go to the bathroom. [3] X Research source Litter training a skunk can take a bit longer than it does with a cat. However, keep trying and your skunk is likely to get the hang of it. Put the litter boxes in the corner of rooms and the cage. Skunks tend to go to the bathroom in the corner of rooms."

      "content": "Create an outdoor pen or cage, if you have space for one. Skunks love to spend time outside, so it’s nice to create a space where they can do that. If you plan on letting your skunk stay out there when you are not around, you will need a secure cage. If you just want an area where your skunk can explore while you supervise, a pen will work well. [4] X Research source Ideally, an outdoor pet would be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) long, 6 feet (1.8 m) wide, and 3 feet (0.91 m) tall. There are commercial outdoor skunk cages and pens available from online retailers. If you want to use a cage to keep your skunk outside, it needs to have a welded metal bottom and top on it. Skunks are good at chewing through wood and can sneak out through small spaces, so the cage needs to be very secure. [5] X Research source"
