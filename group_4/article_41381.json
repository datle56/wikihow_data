      "content": "Stop mid-sentence when you notice yourself yelling. The moment you hear yourself raising your voice, pause. Don't even finish your sentence. Think to yourself, “What am I trying to say? And what is the best way to say it?” [1] X Research source Learning to stop yourself before or when you start yelling can prevent you from saying something you'll regret or jeopardizing your relationships."

      "title": "Breathe deeply",
      "content": "Breathe deeply to ease your anger. Deep breathing promotes the relaxation response, so after a few breaths you'll feel calmer and more in control. Draw in a breath through your nose for a few counts, hold it, then release it from your mouth for a few counts. Repeat until the tension fades.

      "title": "Think before you speak.",
      "content": "Think before you speak. If you have a tendency to shout when you’re mad, you are likely an “emotional communicator.” This means that you may tend to speak or act based on feelings and instincts, rather than reasoning things out. Taking a few moments to consider what you want to say can help you evaluate your reactions and communicate more calmly."

      "title": "Speak in a whisper.",
      "content": "Speak in a whisper. Ensure your tone and volume don't creep back into shouting territory by using a very quiet, “indoor\" voice or a whisper. Speak as though you are in a library. If you are talking to your children, get in the habit of whispering or using a hushed voice when you are mad. Whispering has a double-purpose: it helps you keep your voice at an appropriate volume and it ensures that the other person will be fully tuned in so they can figure out what you're saying."

      "content": "Remove absolute language. Some of the words you use while communicating can actually make you even more angry. Drop absolute terms like “always,” “never,” “should,” or “must.” [6] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source These words spark conflict because they are judgmental, accusatory, and leave little wiggle room."

      "title": "Use “I\" statements.",
      "content": "Use “I\" statements. Get your point across more effectively using statements that express your feelings without attacking the other person. These might sound like “I feel unimportant when you arrive late for our meetings.” “I” statements help you take ownership for what you feel instead of putting it all on the other person. Avoid “you” statements that place blame, like “You don't care about me. You're always late!”"

      "content": "Set a rule for yourself not to yell, ever. Yelling tends to be counterproductive in a conflict or argument, because it stresses the other person out and activates their fight or flight response. They are likely to tune out what you are actually saying and just get upset. This is especially true of kids. [7] X Trustworthy Source Child Mind Institute Nonprofit organization providing evidence-based care for children with mental health and learning disorders and their families Go to source Make it a goal to stop yelling completely. It may take time for you to achieve this goal, but don’t give up. If you find yourself yelling or about to yell, remind yourself of the rule and take a moment to calm down."
