Whatever you do to cope, find it and replace it with something more positive. [3] X Research source If you struggle with over-indulgence in food or drink, make it impossible.

How much weight you've gained or lost, how many steps you took yesterday on your pedometer, how many calories you've consumed. If you're struggling with body-issues and self-esteem, it's important to stay focused on what's most important: your health and happiness. While it may be a goal to lose weight, your ultimate goal should be developing a positive body image. Calorie-burning should be a good benefit of doing things you like doing, not torturing yourself.

      "content": "Wear clothes that make you feel confident . You don't have to dress any particular way except the way that helps you to feel the most comfortable and confident about your body. Ideas about what is \"flattering\" and what is \"sexy\" are highly subjective across cultures, and if you want to build a positive body self-image, it's important for you to decide how you can clothe yourself to feel like the most confident version of yourself. In general, it's good to put less stock in what fashion magazines have to say about the way you dress yourself. \"Feeling confident\" isn't synonymous with \"being trendy,\" especially if current trends involve super-tight high-waisted pants. Try to strike a balance between comfort and a style you like. It's over-simple to say that clothes don't matter. While they're not as important to work on as other things, it can be a big confidence booster to put some thought into your appearance, and clothes are one of the easiest ways to do this. Would a leather jacket make you confident? Consider it."

People with an internal locus of control look to themselves to decide whether or not they're successful. People with external locus? They look outward. You can't change the way others perceive you, and it's a waste of time to try. Instead, focus on shifting your locus of control inward.
