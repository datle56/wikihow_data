      "content": "Inspect the tulle. Check for any dirt and stains. If it is a dress, look at the interior, hem, and train if there is one. Take note of all of the stains or problem areas. Some problems may not be able to be fixed if damage has been done to the tulle. Spot cleaning may not be worth it if large areas of the tulle are stained."

      "title": "Use a mild stain remover.",
      "content": "Use a mild stain remover. Even if you have deep, set in stains, a mild remover is what you should use on tulle. A strong stain remover may remove tough stains, but it will most likely do permanent damage to the tulle. OxiClean offers a gentle stain remover, and you can also choose to make your own. Make your own mild stain remover with 1 tablespoon of baking soda, four tablespoons of mild dish soap, and eight tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide. Combine the ingredients, pour into a jar, and allow it to sit overnight. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Rub gently with your fingers.",
      "content": "Rub gently with your fingers. Apply the stain remover to the fabric by spraying it, or pouring a small amount directly onto the fabric or sponge. Use your fingers or a soft sponge with cold water to gently scrub the stain. Rub until you see the stain start to let up. Then, allow it to sit for thirty minutes. Do not use a hard sponge or toothbrush because the tulle could be damaged by using something too tough on it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use undiluted detergent.",
      "content": "Use undiluted detergent. If the stain is still there after thirty minutes, you can use an undiluted detergent to try to remove the stain. Use cold water and a small amount of the detergent and gently use your hand to rub it into the tulle. Rinse with cold water until all of the spot cleaner and detergent is out of the tulle. Hang it up to dry. Tide, Downy, and Arm & Hammer are a few brands of detergent you can use. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Clean the entirety of the tulle.",
      "content": "Clean the entirety of the tulle. Spot removing can often leave rings or marks behind. Wash all of the tulle by hand or in a washing machine if the stains have not been removed, or if marks are present from the spot removal process. If the tulle is fragile, take it to a specialist to see what can be done about it."

    {
      "title": "Make sure it isn’t too fragile.",
      "content": "Make sure it isn’t too fragile. Inspect the tulle to see if it is strong enough to withstand a thorough washing. If you have any doubts whatsoever, take it to a specialist to have a second opinion. Specialists will be able to test it to see if it is able to withstand washing. A specialist may be a dry cleaner or maker of tulle items, like tutus. Research specialists in your area on Google or in the phonebook."

      "title": "Lay the tulle between two towels.",
      "content": "Lay the tulle between two towels. Take two clean, white towels and place the tulle in between them. You will not remove the tulle during the washing process. The towels prevent the tulle from tearing under its own weight and from floating to the top of the water. Tulle floating to the top of the water can result in uneven cleaning."

    {
      "title": "Run a bath with soap and cold water.",
      "content": "Run a bath with soap and cold water. Fill the bathtub with water. Once it is filled, add a few drops of a mild detergent or soap to the bath. If you have white tulle, you can choose to bleach it instead of cleaning it with soap. The only thing you would do differently is use warm water and an all-color bleach. Clorox 2 is a bleach that would work. Mix the bleach with a small amount of hot water and add it to the bath."
    },
    {
      "title": "Submerge the towels.",
      "content": "Submerge the towels. If you are simply washing the tulle, submerge the towels for five minutes. If you are using bleach, submerge the towels from anywhere between twenty minutes and two hours. Check every twenty minutes or so if you are leaving the tulle in the bath for along period of time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse with cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse with cold water. Rinse the towels and tulle together thoroughly with cold water. Remove the towels from the tulle. If there are any spots left, you can gently scrub them with a soft toothbrush. Rinse until there is no soap left. Wring it out gently to remove excess water."

    {
      "title": "Allow it to dry.",
      "content": "Allow it to dry. You can choose to let the tulle dry on a dry towel, or by hanging it up. If using a towel, make sure it is clean and lay the tulle flat and wait until it dries. If hanging it up, make sure to use a plastic hanger, and hang it in a place where it has fresh air and enough open space surrounding it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the tulle inside out.",
      "content": "Turn the tulle inside out. If it is a dress or outfit, make sure that every zipper is zipped up, buttons are undone, hooks are done up, and ribbons are loosened. Then, turn the tulle inside out. This will prevent tearing and color fading. Loose hooks can get caught on the tulle in the washing machine and cause it to tear."

      "title": "Place in a laundry mesh bag.",
      "content": "Place in a laundry mesh bag. It is not absolutely necessary, but it is safer for the tulle if you use a mesh laundry bag. Mesh laundry bags are often used to store dirty clothing, but they can also be put in the washing machine to protect delicate fabric. You can buy mesh laundry bags for fairly cheap at places like Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree, and online at Amazon."

      "content": "Use a mild detergent. Make sure to use a mild detergent when washing tulle in the washing machine. Stronger detergents may remove the stains, but the tulle will probably be damaged. Dreft, Seventh Generation, and All Free and Clear offer mild detergents. [3] X Research source Mild detergents do not have any dyes, perfumes, or any harsh chemicals."

      "title": "Dry in low heat.",
      "content": "Dry in low heat. You can choose to hang the tulle up to dry on a plastic hanger in an open space. Or, you can tumble dry in low heat. If the tulle is extra delicate, it is better to hang it up to dry."
