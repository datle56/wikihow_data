  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Come up with a unique plot.",
      "content": "Come up with a unique plot. The beauty of animation is that you can come up with the craziest plot imaginable and have it drawn into life. Embrace the possibilities of animation and create a plot that is unique and imaginative. Avoid familiar plot ideas that you’ve heard before. Challenge yourself to create a plot that puts a unique spin on a familiar idea. [1] X Research source For example, rather than start with a familiar plot like boy meets girl and tries to get girl, you may go for a plot like boy meets cyborg girl and tries to win her heart by fighting off killer dinosaurs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on an interesting main character or cast of characters.",
      "content": "Focus on an interesting main character or cast of characters. Create a main character that has distinct characteristics or personality traits. Give your main character a backstory that makes them particular or strange. You may use a real life person as inspiration for your main character or create a main character from scratch. [2] X Research source For example, maybe you have a main character who is a young girl born with a third eye. Or perhaps you have a main character who is a creature from the swamp, half-man, half-animal. You can even have a main character that is not human, such as a walking square or a talking lamp. You can also focus your story on a cast of characters, such as an oddball family or a pair of strange siblings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Explore a surreal or strange setting.",
      "content": "Explore a surreal or strange setting. Make up a setting by combining your hometown with your favorite planet. Or exaggerate a setting, such as your high school, by putting it in a black hole in space. Use the setting as inspiration for your characters and your plot. [3] X Research source For example, if you decide to use a setting like your high school in space, you may then come up with characters like teenage aliens who go to the high school."
    },
    {
      "title": "Brainstorm with a partner.",
      "content": "Brainstorm with a partner. Tossing ideas back and forth with a partner may help you generate a stronger story for the animation. Ask a friend, peer, or family member to brainstorm ideas with you. Try yelling out a character idea and then having your writing partner respond with a different idea or add on to it. [4] X Research source You can also try making a mind map with your writing partner to help generate story ideas."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create storyboards.",
      "content": "Create storyboards . Bring your brainstorming ideas to life by drawing storyboards for a few possible scenes in your script. Draw out squares on plain paper and sketch out details like setting, time of day, and scenery for the scene. Include character dialogue and action in the storyboards. See how your ideas work visually in the storyboards. [5] X Research source Do storyboarding for a few potential plots or characters you are thinking about. You can then tweak your ideas when you sit down to write the draft of the script."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch examples of animated cartoons.",
      "content": "Watch examples of animated cartoons. Get a better sense of the genre by watching cartoons that are considered unique and well-written. Listen to the dialogue of the characters. Notice how the plot in each cartoon moves forward in interesting and unexpected ways. Watch a mix of animated television shows and films. You may watch: The Simpsons South Park Rick and Morty BoJack Horseman The Powerpuff Girls Up Steven Universe The Amazing World Of Gumball"
    },
    {
      "title": "Introduce the main character.",
      "content": "Introduce the main character. Establish your main character in the first scene of the script. Open with dialogue that shows the viewer the character. Place the main character in the setting and have them interact or reflect on the setting. Give the viewer a sense of the main character so they can feel immersed in the story. [6] X Research source For example, you may open with a scene where your main character goes to work at their job on Mars, showing their daily routine to introduce them to the reader. Or you may open with dialogue of a fight between the main character and their partner, showing their complicated relationship."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include conflict that involves the main character.",
      "content": "Include conflict that involves the main character. The conflict can be something the main character wants, but has a difficult time getting due to obstacles or issues. It can also be a conflict between the main character and another character, where neither character can agree or find common ground. The conflict can also come from an outside factor, such as a bad boss, a mean teacher, or a natural disaster. [7] X Research source For example, you may focus on a simple conflict like the main character doesn’t want to go to school that day. You can then come up with what the main character would do instead if they skipped school, focusing on the weird or strange things they might do."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the setting engaging.",
      "content": "Keep the setting engaging. Bring the setting to life by including details that make it unique and visually engaging. Make the setting particular by including certain objects in a room. Decide what the climate or weather is in the setting. Include buildings and structures that add to the world of the story. For example, you may set your script in a carnival that caters to aliens. You may then include rides that blast the rider to another galaxy or carnival foods that aliens might enjoy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write dialogue that explores character and conflict.",
      "content": "Write dialogue that explores character and conflict. Dialogue in your script should always be doing two things: exploring character and building conflict. Avoid dialogue like “Hi, how are you?” or “Nice day today.” Write dialogue that cuts to the chase and tells the reader something about the character. [8] X Research source For example, you may give one character a catchphrase that they say whenever they feel stressed or surprised, such as Homer Simpson's famous \"D'oh!\" You can also have one character with a more casual way of speaking and another character with a more formal way of speaking to create contrast. For example, one character may say, “Sup, alien?” and another character may respond, “Hello there, my illustrious alien friend, how lovely to see you.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Note the location and time of day of each scene.",
      "content": "Note the location and time of day of each scene. This is called the slugline and should appear in ALL CAPS at the beginning of a scene. Use “INT” for an interior location and “EXT” for an exterior location. [9] X Research source For example, you may write: “EXT. CARNIVAL - MIDDAY” or “INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Format the dialogue for each character.",
      "content": "Format the dialogue for each character. Whenever you use a character name in the script, write it in ALL CAPS. You can then write their dialogue under their name. Center the character’s name and dialogue on the page so it is easy to follow. For example, you may write: [10] X Research source AL THE ALIEN Come on Mom, let’s ride the Blaster! MAMA ALIEN Not a chance on Mars, honey, way too dangerous."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include important objects in the scene.",
      "content": "Include important objects in the scene. Only list objects that are essential to the scene and not merely to create the background setting. The object may be something the main character sees or touches. It could also be a sign that the character reads, and that should be shown to the viewer as well. Include the object in ALL CAPS in the script. [11] X Research source For example, you may write: “AL THE ALIEN stumbles over a ROLL OF CARNIVAL TICKETS” or “MAMA ALIEN reads a sign that says “NO MINORS, NO HUMANS.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Describe the sounds and actions in the scene.",
      "content": "Describe the sounds and actions in the scene. Include any sounds in the scene in parentheses and ALL CAPS. For example, you may write, “(CLANKING NOISES)” or “(EXPLODING NOISES).” [12] X Research source You should also write any actions done by the characters in ALL CAPS and bold. For example, you may write, “She KICKS the human” or “He CRIES into his pillow.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Read the script out loud.",
      "content": "Read the script out loud. Once you have created a draft of the script, read it aloud several times. Notice if it is easy to follow and has a clear conflict. Pay attention to how the dialogue sounds when read aloud. Make sure the dialogue is entertaining and explores character well. [13] X Research source You should also read the script aloud to check for any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask others to read the dialogue.",
      "content": "Ask others to read the dialogue. To hear how the dialogue sounds, ask friends, peers, or family members to play different characters and read the dialogue aloud. This will help you get a better sense of how the dialogue sounds with different voices. Try running through the script at least once to listen to how it sounds. In script writing, this is called a “read through.” A read through is often done with the voice actors who are playing the characters to ensure the dialogue sounds right in their voice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch a portion of the script and the animation together.",
      "content": "Watch a portion of the script and the animation together. Take one scene and have rough animation done to flesh it out. Then, watch it to confirm the scene is working and the script is effective on a visual level. You can do the animation yourself or hire an animator to bring your script to life. [14] X Research source If you like the portion that has been animated, you can then get the rest of the script animated. Then, watch the animated cartoon from start to finish to ensure it is to your liking."
