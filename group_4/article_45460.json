Whether you are aspiring to become a LEO, or just looking to expand your vocabulary, 10-codes can inform you of what is going on at the scene of a crime, or when you are on the streets. You can know when a riot is about to break out, or where there could be a shooting in progress that you can now avoid. And for more practical uses, you can know where there might be an accident on the highway which may cause traffic."

      "content": "Understand that a LEO may not want you to listen. If a LEO knows you are listening, and they want to protect sensitive information, they might transmit a 10-13 , which means civilians are present and listening . The dispatch and other LEO's now know to be careful what information they transmit, and will sometimes say other things to throw off bystanders, or even cut transmission completely."

Not all police jurisdictions and agencies have the same meaning for every code but are most times similar if not the same. If you are trying to listen in on radio transmissions for the FBI, ATF, or DEA, it may be different than for your local police department, as an example. Also, know that listening in on a federal agency may be more difficult to do, and may be very illegal."
