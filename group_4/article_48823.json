      "content": "You're not imagining it—your Facebook feed has changed. Like TikTok, Facebook now includes content and products it thinks you'll like in your feed, which can make it harder to find posts from your friends. TikTok's algorithm is successful at keeping its users engaged for long periods of time, so Facebook has implemented a similar approach. Instead of seeing your friends, favorite Pages, and an ad or two in your feed, you'll now see more posts from people you don't follow labeled \"Sponsored\" or \"Suggested for you.\" Because Facebook used to only show you content from people and Pages you follow, the change can make your feed feel unfamiliar. Ads in your feed are labeled \"Sponsored,\" while content Facebook thinks you'll like is labeled \"Suggested for you.\" Suggested posts are technically not ads, as they aren't paid for. They're posts that Facebook thinks you would like based on your interests, posts you've interacted with before, and what users similar to you react to. [1] X Research source"
