      "content": "“420” came from a code used by high school students in the 1970s. The number “420” can be traced to 5 California students at San Rafael High School who hung out at a wall outside their school and were nicknamed “the Waldos.” In 1971, the Waldos would meet at 4:20 pm to search for an abandoned cannabis plant using a treasure map. [2] X Research source The Waldos would remind each other to meet at 4:20 by saying “4:20-Louis.” Eventually, they dropped the “Louis” and just said “4:20.” The band, the Grateful Dead, brought the code into mainstream culture. [3] X Research source They used the number “420” to refer to cannabis products, and the slang term was born. The number “420” can refer to the time to smoke marijuana, the unofficial cannabis-oriented holiday on April 20th, or Adolf Hitler’s birthday (this one isn’t used much, though).

On Tinder and other online dating platforms, this phrase can mean that you either consume cannabis or would be okay if your potential partner does. [5] X Research source If that sounds like you (and you live in an area where cannabis is legal), put “420-friendly” in your bio. “Competitive snowball thrower. Full-time dog mom. 420-friendly.” “6’3” college student who can take you to the best spots in town—and I’m 420-friendly.” Sites like Tinder don’t have restrictions against using drug references. [6] X Research source If you’re using another dating site, make sure they allow drug references in your bio."

In gaming group chats and other social media sites, “420-friendly” might mean that the server is open to talking about cannabis or a user consumes it themselves.

Please use the 420-friendly chat for any marijuana-related discussions.” Make sure that the site you’re posting on allows it first. The live-streaming service Twitch, for example, doesn’t allow usernames that reference marijuana. [7] X Research source"

If you have an apartment or house that you’re renting to another person on a site like Craigslist or Airbnb, you can put this phrase in the description of your listing to let potential renters know they’re allowed to smoke or consume marijuana. [8] X Research source “Relax and unwind in this comfortable one-bedroom apartment in the heart of Austin. High-speed wifi, free parking, 420-friendly.” “This 2 bedroom 2 bathroom cottage is the perfect place to stay during your visit. Includes hiking trails, a fully stocked kitchen, and a 420-friendly room.” Airbnb allows adults to consume cannabis in places where it’s legal. [9] X Research source If you’re posting on another site, check their policies to make sure they allow drug references. If you’re planning to rent a “420-friendly” apartment or Airbnb, double-check to see if they allow all kinds of cannabis. Some places might be ok with edibles and won’t allow smoking, for example."
