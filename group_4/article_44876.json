      "content": "Leave in your piercing so that the discharge can drain. When you remove your piercing, your skin will start to close. This can trap discharge and pus under your skin, which can cause an abscess. This makes your infection worse and harder to treat. Leave your piercing in your nipple until your infection heals or your doctor tells you to take it out. If you’re having a bad reaction to the nipple jewelry you’ve chosen, then your doctor may recommend changing the piercing . This way, your piercing will stay open so it can drain. If your doctor recommends this, go back to your piercer to get the nipple ring changed."

The best time to clean and care for your piercing is after a shower. [2] X Research source"

Similarly, an abscess develops when the discharge or pus from your nipple piercing builds up under your skin instead of draining. Both a cyst and an abscess will make a hard lump under your skin. Your doctor will confirm if you have a cyst or abscess, then they’ll decide which treatment is best for you. Your doctor may recommend using a warm compress to soften the cyst or abscess to help it drain out on its own. This is more likely to happen if the cyst or abscess is small and just formed. If the cyst or abscess is large or partially hardened, your doctor may decide to drain it, which may cause discomfort. After numbing the area, your doctor will make a tiny incision over the lump so the fluids will drain. Then, they’ll likely give you an antibiotic to help the wound heal.
