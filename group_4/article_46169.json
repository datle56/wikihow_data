      "title": "Lay a wooden spoon over the top of a pot to prevent a boil-over.",
      "content": "Lay a wooden spoon over the top of a pot to prevent a boil-over. The foaming bubbles created by boiling water are filled with steam. If they touch something at a temperature below 100 °C (212 °F), the steam will condense (change back into a liquid) and break the surface tension of the bubbles. [1] X Research source A wooden spoon is the best choice because a plastic spoon might melt and a metal spoon will get very hot to the touch."

      "content": "Reduce the odor of water-based paint with vanilla extract. When painting a room, stir in 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of vanilla extract per 1 US gal (3.8 L) of paint. The vanilla will mask the unpleasant odor of the paint. Essential oils like peppermint work as well. This hack doesn’t work on oil-based paint, since the vanilla extract or other essential oil creates a solution with the oils in the paint—which may negate the pleasant scent you’re aiming for or make the paint smell even worse. The oils aren’t soluble with water-based paint, though, so they remain separate and help mask the paint odor."

      "title": "Organize cords at the edge of your desk with binder clips.",
      "content": "Organize cords at the edge of your desk with binder clips. This is a great hack if your desk is cluttered with several charger cables, printer cables, ethernet cables, and so on. Choose binder clips that are large enough to clip to the edge of the desk, but also small enough (if possible) to keep the head of each cable from falling through the binder clip opening. [32] X Research source If you can’t fit the head of a cord through the binder clip wires, squeeze the sides of each wire to remove them from the clip. Then, squeeze them again to put them back in place after you’ve pulled the head of the cord through."

      "content": "Carry multiple plastic bags at once with a large carabiner clip. The problem with carrying several plastic shopping bags at once isn’t that they’re too heavy, but that the handles dig into your hands. Instead, buy a large carabiner clip at a hardware, outdoor, or sporting goods store. Clip both handles of each bag into the carabiner, then carry everything more comfortably by holding onto the carabiner. [36] X Research source"

      "title": "Use snack chips as kindling to help start a fire.",
      "content": "Use snack chips as kindling to help start a fire. Light a loose pile of snack chips on fire, then slowly add wood to build up your campfire. Snack chips are made almost entirely of 2 components—hydrocarbons and fats—that burn readily, so you’ll be surprised how quickly and easily they go up in flames. [37] X Research source Cheesy tortilla chips (like Doritos) work great here, but any type of fried snack chip will do the job. Make sure not to eat all your kindling beforehand!"
