      "content": "Look for eggs. The most definitive way to determine the sex of a parrot is to observe whether or not they lay eggs. Only female parrots produce eggs. In the wild, a female parrot only lays eggs after mating with a male. But female parrots in captivity may lay eggs in their cage, even if a male isn’t present. [1] X Research source Parrots do not lay eggs until they reach the age of sexual maturity. Smaller parrots, like parakeets (also known as budgies) usually reach maturity by 6 months to 1 year. Larger parrots, like African greys, typically reach maturity at 3 to 5 years old. [2] X Research source Egg production can have a negative impact on a bird's health. If you have a solo parrot laying eggs, contact your vet."

      "content": "Get a DNA test . Unless your bird is a sexually dimorphic breed, Heartfield says “DNA sexing is the safest, most efficient way to sex a parrot.” [3] X Expert Source Hayley Heartfield Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 16 August 2021. As a plus, it’s faster than waiting for eggs. Many people do not want to wait several years to determine the sex of their bird. For instance, if you are a parrot breeder, you want to know if the birds you have are sexually compatible. DNA test results are typically accurate, but there is a slight chance they could be wrong. [4] X Research source Get a DNA test kit online or ask your vet if they perform DNA testing. If you use a DNA test kit, you typically have to collect feathers or draw blood from your bird. Simply follow the directions for the specific kit. Then, send the DNA sample to the specified lab. Monomorphic parrots do not have clear, visual differences between males and females, so a DNA test is usually the best way to determine their sex. Monomorphic breeds include lovebirds, African greys, and conures. Dimorphic parrots do have clear, visual differences between males and females. Dimorphic breeds include ringneck parrots and parakeets/budgies."

      "content": "Surgically sex a parrot. Surgical sexing should be performed by an experienced vet. If you are not an expert in animal medicine, it is unlikely that you will be able to properly find and identify the sex organs of birds. Ask your vet if they perform surgical sexing, or if they can recommend a doctor who does. [5] X Research source This method is not used as regularly since the advent of DNA testing. Surgical sexing is more invasive, riskier, and typically more expensive. Parrots' reproductive organs are inside their body. During the surgery, the vet makes a small incision to visually identify the parrot’s reproductive organs. Surgical sexing is mostly used to determine adult parrots with an unknown history. It has been known to harm the reproductive systems of smaller, younger birds."

      "title": "Ringneck Parrot",
      "content": "Ringneck Parrot The Ringneck differs from some other breeds because it is sexually dimorphic. This means that there is a way to visually distinguish the sex of these birds. A male Ringneck develops a brightly colored, dark ring around his neck. The female will have a very faint ring, or no ring at all. [6] X Research source The ring does not develop until the bird is sexually mature. This will occur when he is about 3 years old. A female Ringneck typically has a rounder face than a male."

She says “male budgies will have purple or dark blue ceres” while “females will have white, pink, or even a rusty red/brown” cere. [7] X Expert Source Hayley Heartfield Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 23 June 2021. Wait to identify your budgie’s sex once they’re mature, which is around 4 to 6 months. Heartfield says “it can be hard to tell gender in the young parakeets who have not hit sexual maturity yet, as the color hasn't always developed.” [8] X Expert Source Hayley Heartfield Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 23 June 2021."

      "content": "African Grey Parrots Most people consider these parrots monomorphic, so the best way to tell the sex of an African grey is to wait for eggs or get a DNA test performed. However, African grey parrots have several physical characteristics that can help you tell whether you have a male or female. It is just important to remember that these are general traits and do not lead to a scientific determination. [13] X Research source Male African greys tend to be larger. They are typically 12-14 inches (30-36 cm) in height, while females are usually less than 12 inches (30 cm) tall. Male African greys usually have eye patches that are pointed, while a female's eye patches are mainly rounded. Female African greys have light grey feathers on the underside of their bodies. In males, these feathers are typically a darker grey."

      "content": "Quaker Parrot With the Quaker parrot , the only definitive way to tell the sex is to get a DNA test or wait for the bird to lay eggs. Some female Quakers do not lay eggs until they are more than 10 years old, so you might have to be very patient to determine the sex of your Quaker. [14] X Research source You can make an educated guess based on some behavioral traits of Quaker Parrots. For example, a male parrot may move his tail briskly side to side during high hormonal periods. Females are more apt to move their tails up and down. Tip : When you purchase or adopt a parrot, make sure that you ask for information about the breed. Different types of parrots look and behave differently. Some of them have easier ways to discern sex, too."

It is very rare to find a male Senegal with any green in these feathers. [15] X Research source Female Senegals have under-tail feathers that are a combination of yellow and green. Male Senegals also tend to be larger and have wider heads. This method is not 100% accurate."

For instance, in order to be happy, parrots like to have at least a little bit of time outside of the cage each day. Be certain that you are comfortable having a parrot flying around or house before bringing one home. [16] X Research source If you have a spare room, consider devoting that room solely to your parrot. They will appreciate having their own space to fly.

[19] X Research source Feed your parrot a variety of vegetables, such as zucchini, peas, and green beans. Cut them into small pieces to feed them. Your parrot can eat almost any type of grain-based breakfast cereal. Feed them dry cereal each morning. Table foods should make up 20-40% of your parrot's total diet.
