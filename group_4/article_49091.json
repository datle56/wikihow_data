To do so, follow these steps (assuming you put him away using the method below): Carefully, drag him out by the wooden bar (the 'control') - never by his feet! Hold the control in two hands and twist it round and round to decrease the amount of spin and lower the puppet until all the strings are off the control. Open the control to form a cross."

      "content": "Dancing. Dancing is great fun with a puppet, and can be done in multiple ways. One such way is to make a walking movement again, but instead of moving the control forwards, bounce it up and down. Once you have mastered this, hold the right hand and left leg string together and move them up and down, up and down. To create the best effect, tip the control from side to side as he dances to make his head tilt in time with the music."

      "content": "When you have finished practising your puppeteering, you MUST pack your puppet away carefully. Close the control. Spin him round to his right until the strings are in one thick string. Now, take the control in two hands and roll over and over so about 3\" remain not on the control. Hold his legs to lay him in the box, separated from his control by some tissue paper to prevent scratching."
