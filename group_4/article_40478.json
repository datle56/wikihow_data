If the straight line between the two marks measures 5 feet (1.5 m), that particular corner is a perfect 90° angle. [5] X Research source The math technique that you use to measure the corner is called the Pythagorean theorem . It states that the squares of the smaller sides of a right triangle are equal to the square of the longer side: a 2 + b 2 = c 2 Only right triangles can be used in the Pythagorean theorem, so if the triangle's numbers don't add up, the corner of the triangle isn't 90°. You don't need to use 3-4-5 as your measurements. You can also double, triple, quadruple, etc. the measurements if your room is very large. Measuring 6-8-10 is the exact same as measuring 3-4-5."

If you are laying wood flooring, make sure to leave a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) buffer on all four walls, as the wood needs space to expand and contract. If you install the wood right up against all walls of a room, you'll likely get cracks in the wood when it doesn't have room to expand. [10] X Research source If you're laying tile, you don't have to leave any buffer space, as tile does not expand or contract."
