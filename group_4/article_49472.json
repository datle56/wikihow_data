      "title": "Choose between digital or physical production.",
      "content": "Choose between digital or physical production. If you plan on writing out your song by hand, you'll need a pencil, eraser, and staff paper . Digital production will require a suitable computer and a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), minimum. When building or buying a computer, choose one with a 3.0 dual core processor (or better), at least 8 GB of RAM, and no less than 500 GB of hard drive space. Popular DAWs, which are excellent tools for home or independent production, include Ableton Live, Fruity Loops (FL) Studio, Steinberg Cubase Pro, and Apple Logic Pro. [2] X Research source Feel free to use whatever writing utensil you desire for physical production. However, as the song develops, you'll likely have to make adjustments or changes, so pencil is recommended."

      "title": "Select a theme.",
      "content": "Select a theme. Tap into universal themes and emotions so anyone can connect with your song. Heartache is a common topic in hit music, but there are many other options, like falling in love, the feeling of a perfect day, betrayal, loss, and hope. [3] X Research source The theme of your song will guide you in the production of its lyrics and sound. These should align with the feelings and use words associated with your theme."

    {
      "title": "Draft lyrics",
      "content": "Draft lyrics that are timeless. Timeless lyrics will still be enjoyed even after a considerable time has passed. These kinds of lyrics also generally have a wide audience, which will improve your overall popularity with many different age groups. If your lyrics aren't catchy, you'll never be recognized as a hit songwriter. Look for lyrical inspiration in poetry, art (like exhibits at museums), and the natural world. [4] X Research source Some example of timeless hits from the 60s through the 70s include \"Paint it Black\" by The Rolling Stones, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" by Van Morrison, \"Go Your Own Way\" by Fleetwood Mac. Timeless hits from the 80s through the 2000s include \"Don't Stop me Now\" by Queen, \"Don't Stop Believin' \" by Journey, \"Billy Jean\" by Michael Jackson, \"Smells like Teen Spirit,\" by Nirvana, and \"Mr. Brightside\" by the Killers."

      "title": "Split your lyrics into syllables on staff paper.",
      "content": "Split your lyrics into syllables on staff paper . Alternatively, you can do this in your DAW if you've decided to produce your song digitally. By splitting your lyrics into syllables, you can be certain that each syllable gets a tone. Generally, each syllable of the lyrics will be assigned a tone (also called a \"note\"). In some situations, a single tone may be sustained for a few syllables or split into a run of tones, like sixteenth notes , for a single syllable. Even when you plan on sustaining a single tone for many syllables or beats, breaking up the lyrics into syllables will help you keep track of the rhythm of the song."

    {
      "title": "Set the tempo.",
      "content": "Set the tempo. Tempo is a musical term that refers to the speed of the song. This is usually recorded in BPM (beats per minute). You can set the tempo with a metronome , though most DAWs come with a digital version of this tempo-keeping tool. [5] X Research source Although a hit can be nearly any tempo, most use one that is between 117 and 122 BPM. You may want to use this trend in to your advantage when writing your hit song. Do some research on the genre or kind of music you want to produce. Some kinds of songs have specific speed requirements, like the usual 90 BPM of ballads. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Write the bassline.",
      "content": "Write the bassline . The bassline is comprised of lower-tones and percussion, like drums and cymbals. This part of the song is generally simple and repetitive, but catchy. It should follow along with the pulse of your tempo. [7] X Research source Although percussion instruments tend to dominate the bassline, low-tone single notes, chords, and runs of notes can be added in with other instruments. Try doing this with a piano, guitar, or baritone. The bassline of your song should loop so that it plays through most of your song. This pattern may be adjusted at transitions, like where the verse switches to the chorus, solos, or at a musical bridge towards the end of the song."

    {
      "title": "Design a catchy melody.",
      "content": "Design a catchy melody . The melody is the main through-line of the song. When you hum along with the main part of a song, you're humming the melody. In most cases, the melody is made up of a single instrument, a single voice, or a single instrument paired with a voice. [8] X Research source The melody of your song should complement and synchronize with the beat of the metronome and the bassline. Instruments frequently used for the melody include the piano, guitar, brass (like the trumpet or trombone), organs, synth tones, and more. Design your melody so it has contour. The natural rise and fall of tone throughout the melody, along with dynamic (volume) changes will make your melody more interesting to listeners. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Round out your song with accompaniment.",
      "content": "Round out your song with accompaniment. Be sparing when adding more instruments to your song. On average, most hit songs have no more than seven instruments (including voices). [10] X Research source Too many instruments/voices can make your song distorted and unclear. If you're a novice songwriter, you may want to keep the number of accompanying music instruments (including voices) added at this point to two or three to prevent oversaturation and muddiness. Harmonize the accompanying instruments in chords. Use pleasing sounding arrangements of single-tone notes or runs of notes in the accompaniment. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use a basic and engaging major chords.",
      "content": "Use a basic and engaging major chords . Although songs written in minor keys can be compelling, few rise to the top as hits. Chord structure that is too complicated can overwhelm listeners. Stick to simple, archetypal patterns that contribute to the atmosphere of the song. [12] X Research source One common chord progression in hit songs is I – V – VIm – IV, as in: C – G – Am – F ; D – A – Bm – G ; A – E – F#m – D ; G – D – Em – C ; and E – B – C#m – A. There are many different chords to choose from and unique ways of putting chords together. Experiment with these to find what works best with your song."

    {
      "title": "Showcase the important parts of your song.",
      "content": "Showcase the important parts of your song. When you reach the end of a build or powerful lyrics, increase or decrease the dynamics (volume) correspondingly. Use an extra instrument or two to emphasize these parts of your song. Use rests (pauses) to increase tension. [13] X Research source Unusual sounds or samples can create an enjoyable surprise in your song. DJ Premier did this artfully by bringing out the drumline with a sample of birds chirping. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Trust your instincts.",
      "content": "Trust your instincts. Even though many trends in hit music have been analyzed, no composer or researcher has figured out how to write a hit every time. Strong feelings usually convey potent messages to listeners, so using your feelings as a guide for writing your hit can be helpful. [15] X Research source Save drafts before making changes to your song. Some additions can make a song worse, in which case you might want to roll back the song to a previous version."

    {
      "title": "Inspire yourself with songs from the past.",
      "content": "Inspire yourself with songs from the past. Re-purpose themes, licks, and riffs from old music. Put your own spin on these and incorporate them into your own melody. Take inspiration from your favorite oldies or the classics. Revitalize forgotten hits of the past by creating your own song from them. [16] X Research source Avoid copying a song note for note, word for word, or even too closely. Doing so could be interpreted as plagiarism and could result in legal trouble. [17] X Research source Explore different avenues of inspiration. You may find that collaborating with another artist pushes you to make your best work."

    {
      "title": "Be flexible.",
      "content": "Be flexible. Trying to follow the rules too rigidly can stifle your creativity. It can also make your sound too stiff or lacking in fluidity. When brainstorming ideas for your song, be willing to try new things. You never know when an unexpected lyric or combination of sounds will occur to you. [18] X Research source Because music can be fickle, you might want to keep a physical notebook for ideas or take musical memos on your phone for ideas that pop into your head."

      "title": "Be persistent.",
      "content": "Be persistent. When mining for gold, it can take quite a while before finding the motherload. In the same way, even talented songwriters write many songs before they strike upon a hit. [19] X Research source Train your song writing abilities by practicing writing songs as frequently as possible."
