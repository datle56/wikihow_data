Then, multiply the denominator by itself. [3] X Research source The numerator will stay on top of the fraction and the denominator will stay at the bottom of the fraction.

When working with fractions, the last step is always to reduce the fraction to its most simple form or turn the improper fraction into a mixed number . [4] X Research source For our example, 25 / 4 is an improper fraction because the numerator is larger than the denominator. To convert to a mixed number, divide 4 into 25. It goes in 6 times (6 x 4 = 24) with 1 leftover. Therefore, the mixed number is 6 1 / 4 ."

      "content": "Check to see if you can simplify the fraction before you square it. It is usually easier to reduce fractions before squaring them. Remember, to reduce a fraction means to divide it by a common factor until the number one is the only number that can be evenly divided into both the numerator and denominator. [10] X Research source Reducing the fraction first means you don’t have to reduce it at the end when the numbers will be larger. For example: ( 12 / 16 ) 2 12 and 16 can both be divided by 4. 12/4 = 3 and 16/4 = 4; therefore, 12 / 16 reduces to 3 / 4 . Now, you will square the fraction 3 / 4 . ( 3 / 4 ) 2 = 9 / 16 , which cannot be reduced. To prove this, let’s square the original fraction without reducing: ( 12 / 16 ) 2 = ( 12 x 12 / 16 x 16 ) = ( 144 / 256 ) ( 144 / 256 ) has a common factor of 16. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 16 reduces the fraction to ( 9 / 16 ), the same fraction we got from reducing first."

In this case, it is actually easier to wait before you reduce the fraction. Adding an additional factor to the above example illustrates this. For example: 16 × ( 12 / 16 ) 2 Expand out the square and cross out the common factor of 16: 16 * 12 / 16 * 12 / 16 Because there is one 16 whole number and two 16’s in the denominator, you can cross ONE of them out. Rewrite the simplified equation: 12 × 12 / 16 Reduce 12 / 16 by dividing through by 4: 3 / 4 Multiply: 12 × 3 / 4 = 36/4 Divide: 36/4 = 9"

[11] X Research source For example: 16 * ( 12 / 16 ) 2 Rewrite with the numerator and denominator squared: 16 * ( 12 2 / 16 2 ) Cancel out the exponent in the denominator: 16 * 12 2 / 16 2 Imagine the first 16 has an exponent of 1: 16 1 . Using the exponent rule of dividing numbers, you subtract the exponents. 16 1 /16 2 , yields 16 1-2 = 16 -1 or 1/16. Now, you are working with: 12 2 / 16 Rewrite and reduce the fraction: 12*12 / 16 = 12 * 3 / 4 . Multiply: 12 × 3 / 4 = 36/4 Divide: 36/4 = 9"
