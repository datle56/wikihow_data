If you start knocking down her door and calling her every five minutes she'll only pull further away from you. The amount of space and time you give her depends on what happened when you tried to date her. [2] X Expert Source Courtney Quinlan Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 27 August 2021. If you ended a serious relationship, you'll need to give her more space than you would if you had just dated a few times. [3] X Research source Don't call her, chat with her at parties, or email her just to see how she's doing. If you see her socially, be polite and say hi, but make it clear that you're not going to bother her. Just don't give her too much space. If you leave her alone for a few months, that will give her plenty of time to find someone new. Reader Poll: We asked 1592 wikiHow readers how they’d handle a partner pulling away, and 53% agreed that they’d give them space to come to a decision on their own . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Give yourself some time to reflect. Not only should you give her some space, but you should give yourself some space to reflect and think about what went wrong in the relationship. Take the time to sit down and ask what you did to make her not want you; were you too attentive, too moody, or too distant? Whatever you did, you have to make sure never to do it again if you want a moment of her day. Write down the things that went wrong. Consider what you can do to improve this kind of behavior. Don't date anyone else during the reflection period. Focus on self-improvement and working on not repeating the same mistakes. Don't pursue her until you've figured out what went wrong and know how to change it."

Though you should avoid getting busy in the bedroom while you're trying to win your girl back, you should try to live a busy and active life so you can work on being independent and pursuing your interests. If you're just sitting around waiting for enough time to pass to start trying to hang out with her again, she'll know. Continue pursuing your hobbies and interests. Don't stop doing all of the things you love because your heart is aching. Spend time with your friends. They'll cheer you up and lend you a fresh perspective. Work out . Your self-esteem will improve if you exercise a few times a week, and all the better if she sees you out running."

      "content": "Let her see you having a great time. Once you've given her some space and have worked on self-improvement, she'll be much closer to wanting you. But now you have to put all the pieces together and let her see what an amazing guy you are and how much fun it is to be around you. Be strategic. Without looking like a stalker, make sure you're hanging out in some of the same places so she can see what a blast it is to be around you. Laugh it up. If she sees you, try to laugh with your friends as much as you can without being too obvious about it. Be animated. If she's around, be very animated and interested in the conversations you're having, showing that you're a passionate guy who loves to talk to his friends. Don't ignore her when she sees you. Give her a small wave and go back to the great conversation you were having. Dance . That's right. Chances are she was mad that you didn't dance with her more. Let her see you getting down on the dance floor and having a great time. Let her see you being your best self. There was obviously something she liked about you, so use your assets to your advantage."

      "content": "Make her jealous (optional). This is an optional move because it depends on the situation. If your relationship ended because she was so jealous that you were always hanging around with other girls, then you shouldn't make her jealous or she'll just be reminded of the reason why things didn't work out between you. But if your relationship ended because she thought you were just too into her, or that she was bored by you, then making her jealous is a great move. Here's how to do it: [4] X Research source If you're on speaking terms, casually mention other girls. You can mention one girl a few times, leading her to wonder, \"Who is this girl?\" Or you can just talk about a group of girls, mentioning that you were at a party that was filled with mostly girls but that you were \"okay with that.\" Let her see you with other girls. Chat with her for a few minutes before moving on to flirt with another girl that's nearby. Make sure you're close enough for her to watch it happen. Don't overdo it. If she hears you talking about other girls and sees you flirting with others, she may want you even more, but if you're all over every girl at every party, you may look desperate or sleazy."

      "content": "If it was too easy the first time, make her chase you . If you can't think of what went wrong in the relationship because you smothered her with love, then chances are that this was exactly what went wrong. She must have felt that your love and relationship was too easy, so you should try to make it more of a challenge. [5] X Research source Be aloof . You should still give her some attention, but act busy or distracted and like you're not giving all your attention to her for once. This will confuse her and will make her want you more. Be sparing with the compliments. If you did nothing but compliment her 24/7 when you were together, give her just one compliment to show that you're not obsessing over her. Let her come to you. She was probably used to having you come up to her, touch her, and talk to her all the time; now, it's time for some role reversal. If you're at a party, let her approach you instead of stopping everything you're doing to head her way."

If you broke up because she felt that you didn't give her enough affection or time or that you spent too much time flirting with other women, it's time to do the exact opposite and to make yourself available to her and have no other women on your radar. [6] X Research source Show her that your schedule is free and that you're up for hanging out whenever. She'll no longer have to hang out with you during the one hour you're free. Don't make her jealous. In your case, you should stay away from the other ladies as much as possible to show that you only have eyes for her. Take the time to listen. If she thought you didn't care about her feelings before, maintain eye contact and let her talk without interrupting. You can mention something she said in the conversation a day later to show that you really do hang on to her every word. Compliment her . If you never complimented her before, she'll see that you changed."

[7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Make sure to do this in person. It won't do if you just send her a text message or an e-mail; it has to be in person otherwise she will see that you are not very serious about this apology and so she won't take it seriously either. So own up and go apologise for what you did to her. Be sincere. Maintain eye contact when you talk to her and keep a calm, even tone. She won't believe you if it sounds like you're apologizing just because it's what you should do. [8] X Research source Be specific. Don't just say, \"I'm sorry for everything.\" Say, \"I'm sorry I didn't listen to you when you really wanted to talk. I should have been much more attentive.\" She will appreciate this, and it will make you seem more self-aware. Don't be disappointed if she doesn't accept your apology right away. If she doesn't accept it, she's probably still working through what happened but still appreciates your effort. Just say, \"You can't blame me for trying\" instead of arguing her into accepting your apology."

She should be able to see how much you've changed without you having to say it yourself or to convince her that you're completely different. Face it -- many girls are more mature than their male counterparts, so wow her with your ability to be rational and mature. [9] X Research source Don't be moody. Act even-keeled and calm, and she'll be impressed. Be confident. Show her that you're happy who you are and what you do, and she'll be happier with who you are too. Be responsible. Show her that you can manage your finances, hold down a good job, and take care of your dog at the same time. Don't be jealous. Don't ask her about that guy she's been talking to; this will only encourage her to talk to him more, and will make you look insecure for caring."

How else can you get the ball rolling? If it ended badly, she's not going to ask you to pick things up again, so you need to get your act together and open up. [10] X Research source Tell her at the right place and time. Pick a time when she's not too busy and you can be alone, ideally at night or in a semi-secluded location. Maintain eye contact when you tell her. No looking around, no checking your phone. No more Mr. Tough Guy. It's time to be open and honest and to share your true feelings. First, acknowledge what went wrong, and apologize for it again if you haven't already. Then, tell her how much you've changed and how much you'd love to give it another try. Say, \"I can't believe what an idiot I've been. You were the best thing that ever happened to me and I really screwed it up. Let me make it up to you.\" Don't sound like you're begging and pleading; instead, make it sound like barely a question at all.

Now, you shouldn't overdo it to the point that she feels uncomfortable. Just add a little bit of the romance that was probably missing before. [12] X Research source Compliment her. Let her know she looks nice when you pick her up, and compliment her throughout the date. Let her know how much you've missed her. Find one or two moments during the date when you tell her how glad you are to have her in your life. [13] X Research source In the end, be yourself. You can become a better listener , a more attentive person, or just learn to understand her needs, but in the end, you're still you, and you should make sure she likes who you really are.

Look at it as starting fresh. You don't have to rehash the old relationship, but work on building something completely new and much better. Relax. Just enjoy being with the girl instead of worrying about not screwing up again all the time."
