      "content": "Decide how much water to store. The average person needs 1 gallon (4 liters) of water each day, half for drinking and half for food preparation and hygiene. Increase this number to 1.5 gallons (5.5 L) per person or more for children, nursing mothers, and sick people, and for anyone in a hot or high-altitude climate. Based on these numbers, try to store a 2 week supply for your household. [1] X Research source In case of an emergency evacuation, store a 3 day supply in easily transportable containers. [2] X Trustworthy Source Federal Emergency Management Agency Federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency Go to source For example, 2 healthy adults and 1 child need (1 gallon or 3.8 liters / adult) x (2 adults) + (1.5 gal or 5.7 liters / child) x (1 child) = 3.5 gallons (13.25 liters) per day. A 2 week supply of water for this household is (3.5 gallons or 13.25 liters/ day) x (14 days) = 49 gallons (185.5 liters). A 3 day supply would be (3.5 gallons or 13.25 liters/day) x (3 days) = 10.5 gallons (40 liters)."

In areas that regulate bottled water, including the U.S. and E.U., sealed bottles of water are already sanitary and will stay good indefinitely. If you go this route, you do not need to worry about selecting appropriate containers or purifying the water. Check the label for certification by the IBWA (International Bottled Water Association), NSF (National Sanitation Foundation), or UL (Underwriters Laboratories). These demonstrate the product has met safety and quality standards.

[5] X Research source Plastics #4 (LDPE) and #5 (PP) are also safe, as is stainless steel. Never reuse a container that held anything besides food and drink, and only use brand-new empty containers if they are marked \"food grade,\" \"food safe,\" or with a knife and fork symbol. Milk and fruit juice leave residue that is difficult to remove and encourages bacterial growth. Do not reuse containers that held these drinks. [6] X Research source Glass jars are a last resort, since they can easily break in a disaster. Traditional unglazed pottery jars can help keep water cool in warm climates. Use one with a narrow mouth, lid, and tap if possible to encourage sanitary handling. [7] X Research source"

Look for the resin identification code on plastic containers, which typically consists of a number printed next to the recycling symbol. Avoid containers marked “3” (for polyvinyl chloride, or PVC), “6” (for polystyrene, or PS), and “7” (for polycarbonate). These materials can be hazardous to your health."
