      "title": "Wrap your book in tissue paper.",
      "content": "Wrap your book in tissue paper. Lay out a couple of pieces of tissue paper. Place the book at 1 edge of the tissue paper, and roll it up in the paper. If you want, tape the edges to secure it. This way, you can avoid damaging the book by taping the wrapping paper to the tissue paper and not to the book itself. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Roll out enough paper to cover the book and cut a straight line across it.",
      "content": "Roll out enough paper to cover the book and cut a straight line across it. Roll out some of your chosen wrapping paper and lay it flat so that the underside is exposed. Then, when you’ve rolled out enough paper to cover the whole book, use some sharp scissors to cut a straight line from one edge of the wrapping paper to the other, parallel to the roll. Use quick, small cuts to help keep the line straight. [2] X Research source If you’re concerned about making a straight cut, get wrapping paper that has a grid on the underside. You can also can use a ruler to lightly draw a line with a pencil and then cut over top of the line. Alternatively, just fold the paper and get a straight crease to follow with your scissors."

      "content": "Fold the sides in and tape them down. Center the book on the piece of wrapping paper and fold in one side so that it covers half of your book. Gently pull to ensure that the paper is snug against the book and tape this side of the paper to the center of the book. Then, fold the other side over the book in an identical fashion and tape it to the center. [3] X Research source"

Take the 2 corners of the paper at this end and fold them in towards the center of the book. This should create a triangular shape. [4] X Research source"

Then cut an upward slant from the left side to the right side of the folded ribbon. Unfold the ribbon and repeat this on the other side. Consider tucking some flowers or leaves under the tied ribbon, or adding a pom pom, a tassel or a handmade tag."
