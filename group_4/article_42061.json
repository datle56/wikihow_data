      "content": "Repair or refresh what you have instead of buying new stuff. Almost anything can be repaired -- cobblers, hardware stores, and electronics repair shops are all available for hire. For instance, instead of investing in a whole new couch, have it reupholstered. Instead of buying a new TV, take it to the repair shop to extend its life or replace broken parts. If a new household purchase is unavoidable, save money slowly over time in order to purchase the item you need. Avoid rent-to-own options. Rent-to-own furniture or electronic equipment is a tempting offer because you can pay in small installments over a long period. But in the long run, it will cost you more than if you had just paid the whole amount all at once.

[3] X Expert Source Samantha Gorelick, CFP® Financial Planner Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. Try to find stores that offer price-matching sales so that you can save time by bringing in competitors’ ads instead of hoofing it all over to the stores which offer the best deals. [4] X Research source Compare prices carefully. Many stores provide direct price comparisons if you look closely on shelf tags in the grocery store. For instance, price-per-unit shelf tags might indicate that one brand of juice might cost $1 per liter, while another might cost $1.20 per liter. Whenever possible, opt for the less expensive choice."

      "title": "Buy foods in bulk.",
      "content": "Buy foods in bulk. Buying in bulk means you pay by the pound for one large bag of something rather than buying several smaller pre-measured packages of the same foodstuff. Doing this will lower your grocery costs. Since grocers can move more product this way, you’ll get a lower rate per pound. For instance, instead of buying three two-pound bags of rice for $2 each, you might buy a seven pound bag for $5, and end up with more food for less money. Ethnic grocers are good places to stock up on staples like rice, beans, and vegetables in bulk."

      "title": "Buy economy size when you can.",
      "content": "Buy economy size when you can. Economy size indicates a product you’ll pay less per unit of measure for when buying more of it. For example, many grocery stores offer a one pound box of cereal for $3 per pound, or a somewhat larger two pound box of the same cereal for only $2.50 per pound. This nominal difference will save you more in the long run. Even though the total cost of the somewhat larger box is more expensive ($5 as compared to $3 for the smaller box), you’re getting more cereal for your money."

      "title": "Make a shopping list before going shopping.",
      "content": "Make a shopping list before going shopping. Shop consciously when you go to the grocery store (or any store, really). This way, you’ll have a kind of roadmap when you’re visiting the grocery store, and won’t just wander all over the store looking at (and possibly buying) things you don’t really need. [5] X Research source Obtain the items on your shopping list, head to checkout, and leave. Look for more spartan shops. Part of what you pay for when you visit a grocery store is the experience. An upscale place like Whole Foods is not the best place to shop if you’re trying to survive being poor."

      "content": "Take advantage of local food banks. A food bank is an organization run by a church, homeless shelter, or community aid organization which offers food to those in need. Community dinners are often offered at local churches and community aid organizations for free or at extremely low cost.

The program is provided by the US Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service, and funded publicly. To qualify for SNAP, you can have up to $2,250 in total household bank accounts, or $3,250 if you’re 60 or older. Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and most retirement plans do not count against the total financial resources used to determine whether you qualify. The amount of income you earn also determines eligibility. To apply, find your state’s public assistance office. A full list of such offices and the online SNAP applications of states which offer them are available at https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/apply-to-accept . Fill in the required paperwork and mail, digitally submit, or print your application. Response times vary by state. You might also try identifying and calling your local SNAP hotline with this list: https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-informationhotline-numbers . SNAP benefits can be used for food purchases only. Pet foods, soaps, household supplies, vitamins and medicines, alcohol, and hot foods (take-out or deli pizzas, for example) cannot be purchased with SNAP benefits."

Public housing is a comprehensive suite of three rental assistance programs, plus Section 8 vouchers, designed to give low-income individuals more affordable housing options.

[12] X Research source This can be a challenge when you’re living on a fixed or limited income, but there are positive steps you can take to reduce your financial risks. Don’t take out new credit cards; work instead on paying off the balance on your current credit cards and loans. Draw up a household budget. In one column, calculate your household’s total income. This includes revenue coming in not only from you, but from everyone in your house. Then calculate your household’s total expenses. Think about the costs accumulated by children and pets as well as by you and any other adults in the house. Subtract the expenses from the income total. If the expenses exceed the income, try to find where you can cut some expenses, or figure a way to increase your income streams. Before buying anything, always ask yourself this question: \"Is this really necessary?\" If not, put it back on the shelf for another day when you are not so poor."

You’ll likely have to cobble together a work schedule consisting of multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet. [13] X Research source While it can be inconvenient to juggle two or even three work schedules, such an arrangement will ensure you always have some source of income. If one job fails to provide an adequate amount of hours in a given week or month, you’ll already have your other job(s) to fall back on. Don’t be afraid to request working more hours if you think you can take them on. Employers like seeing helpful employees who are eager to work. If you have trouble finding additional time in your schedule to work due to the presence of small children, ask a trusted relative or neighbor to tend to them while you go to work. If you have a hard time locating transportation to get to or from a place of work, ask coworkers, friends, or family to give you a ride. Check local public transit options as well. If it is impossible to take on extra work, ask for a raise at your current place of employment. You are more likely to get a raise if you’ve been on the job for at least a year."

You’re focused on paying the rent, the electric bill, the car insurance, and so on. The constant threat that one of these costs will push you further into financial ruin can distract you from planning for tomorrow. [17] X Research source No matter how bad things seem, there’s always a new day tomorrow. Focusing on and planning for better days ahead can relieve stress and distract you from whatever problems you’re facing today. [18] X Research source Don’t worry about what-ifs. Focusing on things you did wrong or dwelling on the past will not help you change your current predicament. Envision yourself in 5, 10, and 15 years. Where do you imagine you’ll be living? What kind of work will you do? Share your thoughts with a friend and invite them to do the same. Try to find something positive in each week or day that you can look forward to. Try to make it something different each day (don’t just think about how desperately you want to get out of work every day). Things like meeting a friend for a bike ride, or taking your child to the playground might be some of the things you look forward to after each day."

You’ve become poor, but hey, it’s not the end of the world! Recognize that your situation is temporary and you’ll come out of it better and stronger. Challenge negative thoughts. [20] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When you feel a thought such as “I’m no good” or “I’ll always be poor,” do not dwell on it. Introduce a contrary thought such as “I am a good person and many people like being around me” or “Someday I will be financially independent.” Forgive yourself. You’re a fallible person, just like everyone else. Your mistakes do not define you, they are only bumps in your personal life path. Use positive self-talk to forgive yourself.

You’re often in situations where you need help -- financial and material -- immediately. Think about occasions where you did not exercise proper self-control. [22] X Research source You might have felt tempted to engage in habits like drinking or binge-eating which release endorphins and make you feel good. You might have lost your temper more than you did before you were struggling with poverty. Whatever the case, try to become conscious of occasions where you lose control and take positive steps to reign yourself in. Try to find positive outlets for your energy. When you feel that you might blow up on someone or want to have a drink, go for a run or bike ride instead. Try painting a picture or playing a musical instrument. Get enough rest. A full night’s sleep -- 6 to 8 hours -- is important for thinking clearly and deliberately. You’ll be more able to exercise self-control when you are well-rested. Set a regular bed time and stick to it each night."
