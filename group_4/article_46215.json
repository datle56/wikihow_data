Their cutting edge will also be curved slightly inwards to match the rounded shape of your fingernail tips.

Using these on your fingernails can cause damage."

      "content": "Open the clippers. Lift up and rotate the lever of the clippers. When you are ready to trim your nails, hold the clippers in your hand. Place a fingernail between the two cutting blades that face each other. You'll squeeze the upper lever and the lower parts together to clip the edge of the nail off."

      "title": "Choose where to begin.",
      "content": "Choose where to begin. Some people like to begin at one nail, either the pinky or thumb, and work their way across the others, one by one. However, you could also start with your shortest nail. Clip it, and then cut the others down to the same length. That way, you’ll be sure not to cut too much off of any nail.

      "title": "Clip at an angle, making several small cuts.",
      "content": "Clip at an angle, making several small cuts. Resist the temptation to cut straight across your fingernail in one go! Even though the clippers have a rounded edge, you should approach the nail from a slight angle and cut only a little bit at a time. [3] X Research source Your cuticle is the rounded part where the opposite end of the nail is covered by skin. Clip the free edge of the nail to basically mirror this rounded edge."

      "title": "Leave a little white at the edge.",
      "content": "Leave a little white at the edge. Avoid clipping your nails all the way to the skin, since this can make it too easy to be injured. Instead, leave some of the white portion of the fingernail. Unless you prefer to leave your fingernails long, don’t leave white hanging past the fingertip. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use larger clippers for toenails.",
      "content": "Use larger clippers for toenails. Since toenails are usually thicker than fingernails, you will need a stronger tool. Toenail clippers are larger than those used for fingernails. They also have a straight cutting edge, to properly and safely shape the nail. [5] X Research source Using fingernail clippers on large toenails can damage the clippers, the nails, or both. If you have small toes, you may be able to use fingernail clippers on them. However, you will still need toenail clippers for your big toe."

    {
      "title": "Open your clippers.",
      "content": "Open your clippers. Like those for fingernails, toenail clippers have two blades that face each other, held together by a pin. A third piece can swivel upwards and rotate to be used as a lever. You will hold the clippers in your hand, with the bottom part on your four fingers. Place the toenail you want to cut between the blades, and squeeze down on the lever with your thumb."

      "title": "Cut toenails straight across.",
      "content": "Cut toenails straight across. If you don’t cut your toenails right, they can become ingrown, which can cause pain and infection. To prevent this problem, cut the toenails straight across, just past the skin of each toe. [6] X Research source Rounding off your toenails makes it more likely that the edges will push under the skin of your toes, which may cause pain and infection. You can start with your big toe and then move to the others. Unlike fingernails, your toenails probably won't end up being cut to the same length."

      "content": "See a podiatrist if your toes develop problems. If you accidentally cut your toenails wrong and get an ingrown toenail , your instinct might be to just clip off the part that’s pushing into your skin. However, over time, this can just make the problem worse. Instead, see a podiatrist for professional help correcting the issue.

      "title": "File your nails.",
      "content": "File your nails. Many nail clippers include a file or combination file and pick. You can use this to file your nails in a pinch. However, try an emery board for a smoother finish. Work gently, moving the board or file in only one direction rather than sawing back and forth."

      "content": "Clean underneath your nails daily. Gently scrub underneath your nails with a brush, using soap and water to wash dirt away. If your clippers include a pick, you can also use it to gently scrape dirt out. Just be careful not to pick so deep that you pierce the skin under your nail.

      "content": "Clip hangnails only to the base of the skin. Hangnails are portions of the edge where a nail meets skin that get pushed up. You’re almost sure to have one at least occasionally, and they can be irritating. Clipping them will help, but use fingernail or toenail clippers and cut only to the base of the skin. If you try to cut too deep or pull the hangnail out, it can be very painful. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean and disinfect your tools.",
      "content": "Clean and disinfect your tools. Fingernails and toenails can become quite dirty, and cutting them can transfer that dirt, bacteria, and fungi to the clippers. To minimize passing germs, follow a few guidelines: Use separate clippers for your fingers and toes. Keep your own clippers rather than using another person's. Clean and disinfect your clippers after using them. For instance, you can wipe them down with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol."
