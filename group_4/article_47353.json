Before anything else, check the tag on your sweater to see if there are any special care instructions. The care tag is often on the inside seam on the side of the sweater, or behind the size tag at the back of the neck. [1] X Research source"

[2] X Research source Follow the instructions on the label of the cleaner you choose. For example, some stain removers may require that you leave the remover on the stain for 10 minutes before you put the sweater in the washing machine. Different stain removers are intended for different types of stains, so spend some time deciding what the right stain remover is for your sweater. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour in your laundry detergent. Check the back of your laundry detergent container to see how much you should use, given the amount of clothing in your load. For most cotton sweaters, you can use regular all-purpose laundry detergent or a gentle laundry detergent. Liquid detergents tend to work best for removing greasy or oily stains. Powder detergents work great for removing dirt or clay. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose the gentlest cycle. On your washing machine, turn the knob or press the button to select the cycle called “wool,” “hand-wash,” or “delicate.” If there is no delicate cycle option, choose the shortest cycle available. This will help prevent damage to your sweater from a rough wash cycle. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose your water temperature.",
      "content": "Choose your water temperature. Select cold water for bright-colored sweaters, and warm water for light-colored sweaters. Cold water can help the sweater maintain its color, so if in doubt, stick with a cold wash for your sweater. Avoid using hot water with sweaters, unless the care tag specifically says to."

      "title": "Lay the sweater flat on a towel or a sweater rack to dry.",
      "content": "Lay the sweater flat on a towel or a sweater rack to dry. Lay the sweater down in the shape that it will be on your body. This means that the body part is flat, and the arms and shoulders are in the form they are when you wear it. Do not hang your sweater, as that could cause it to stretch or get hanger bumps in the shoulders; however, if you must hang it, do so correctly––as advised here . If possible, set the towel on a tile floor, rather than on carpet. Otherwise, your carpet will get damp as the sweater soaks through the towel."

      "title": "Hand-wash",
      "content": "Hand-wash your sweater. If your sweater’s care tag advises that you hand-wash the sweater, it is best to follow that advice. Also, you can hand-wash the sweater if your washing machine does not have a delicate cycle. To do so, fill a sink or tub with cool water, pour in laundry detergent, place the clothes in the sink or tub, and allow them to soak. Gently knead the clothes for a moment or two, and then rinse until the water runs clear. Hand-washing can help extend the life and quality of your sweater because it is more gentle than machine-washing."
