      "content": "How to pack and avoid rising airline baggage fees How you pack for your trip is just as important as what you pack. Check out these hacks for saving space in your luggage, staying organized, and spending less on baggage at the airport: Roll your clothes to save space in your bag or suitcase. [1] X Research source Pack clothes made of wrinkle-resistant fabrics, like knits and synthetic materials, so you don’t need to iron once you arrive. [2] X Research source If it’s a short trip, only pack a carry-on bag. No more fees for checking bags or waiting to pick up your luggage once you land! Have an already-packed toiletries bag with doubles of your razors, deodorant, etc. Then, all you have to do is grab it and go! Pack old clothes you can ditch or donate on your trip so you can fill your bag with new mementos for the return journey. To make more space in your luggage, use vacuum bags to compress your clothes. Try packing light and doing a load of laundry at your destination to save space (and the cost of checking a bag). [3] X Research source Weigh your bags with a luggage scale to make sure you don’t owe extra fees for heavy suitcases. [4] X Research source Try to pack a backpack instead of a suitcase or duffel, if you can. It’s less likely to be weighed. Use a brightly-colored or distinguished-looking suitcase that’s easy to spot at luggage claim. If you’re traveling with a partner, put half of your stuff in each other’s bags. That way, if one person’s luggage gets lost, you’ll both still have access to some of your things. Use a luggage shipping company like LugLess instead of checking bags. LugLess offers the cheapest luggage shipping rates around so you can bypass checking lines and baggage claim. Their platform is super easy to use—just print a label, drop off your luggage at a FedEx or UPS location, and it’ll arrive at your end destination before you arrive. LugLess has over 250,000 users and 10,000 5-star reviews. Make them one of your travel hacks and check them out before your next trip!"

If you’re not sure what extras or essentials you might need, skim this list of hacks and advice before your trip to help you prepare: A default packing list you can use and alter for each trip (you’ll never forget to pack your most important items like chargers or medication!) [5] X Research source A tracker or geotag to put in your checked bag so you always know where your luggage is [6] X Research source A reusable water bottle to use at airports, while you’re sight-seeing, or in emergencies [7] X Research source A portable water filter or purifier (if you’re worried about water safety) A cheap or second-hand suitcase or spare tote bag to fill up with souvenirs [8] X Research source Fake versions of wedding rings, jewelry, watches, or other valuables (to prevent theft of the real thing) Extra printed copies of your passport and travel documents (and digital versions in your email as backups) A capsule wardrobe of pieces you can easily mix and match to create new looks Items you know you’ll need ahead of time to avoid premium charges (like sunscreen) An “essentials” bag to carry on in case your luggage is lost (with underwear, chargers and medication, toiletries, and other must-haves) [9] X Research source A cross-body purse or travel bag that closes with zippers to prevent pickpocketing [10] X Research source Extra snacks! (Load up at the airport or bring TSA-approved snacks from home to have on hand, just in case.) [11] X Research source A portable charger (since you’ll probably be phone-dependent for most of the trip) A universal adapter to use your electronics in different outlets around the world A voltage converter if your electronics are incompatible with different outlets Any downloaded media you want to consume on your trip like movies, music, audiobooks, or ebooks (Download these 1 or 2 days in advance.) A kids’ activity bag with coloring books, toys, snacks, and/or a tablet Free samples and trial sizes of cosmetics and toiletries (Keep them in your travel bag so you never have to worry about liquid size limits on planes.) Dryer sheets to keep your dirty clothes smelling “fresh” until you can wash them A few plastic bags or a mesh laundry bag to store dirty clothes or shoes A cold suppressant to get rid of symptoms as soon as you feelthem [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Booking and paying for flights",
      "content": "Booking and paying for flights Like packing, planning and paying for your flights is one of the more complex and important parts of traveling—but it can be the most rewarding if you land a sweet deal! Here are some traveler-tested hacks and suggestions for finding cheap flights , earning points toward future trips, and making booking a flight less headache-inducing: Look for flights leaving during off-peak times (like mid-week or a red eye) or that have layovers to save money on your flight. If you’re worried about delays, book an early-morning flight. They’re the least likely to be delayed or canceled. [13] X Research source Use a VPN or a browser like Google Incognito when you’re flight shopping. Using the same browser and internet connection may lead the airline website to increase prices since they know you’re looking. If you’re not ready to book a flight once you find it, set up price alerts to be notified if the price changes (some browser extensions or travel sites do this). If the price doesn’t drop, you’ll know to book soon before it gets higher or look for a new flight. [14] X Research source If you’re traveling during peak season, look for the lowest prices for domestic flights 3-7 months in advance, and 4-10 months in advance of international flights. [15] X Research source Purchase your ticket more than 21 days in advance. At 20 days or less in advance, the price will go up. [16] X Research source If you’re traveling domestically, compare the price of separate 1-way tickets vs. a round-trip fare on one airline. Enroll in loyalty programs with multiple airlines and rack up miles to use later if you’re not loyal to a single airline. Use an airline-specific credit card for bonuses and perks if you’re pretty loyal to one airline. If you almost have enough points for a free flight, look out for points sales on days like Black Friday or Cyber Monday, transfer premiums, and other deals. Research “mistake fares” (super discounted flights shared by mistake). Airlines will typically honor those deals, although some may cancel the flight. Consider volunteering for a later flight if the airline is offering compensation to offset the cost (or inconvenience). Wait to agree to see if they’ll increase the compensation—it could be over $1,000! If you have to make a connection, try to aim for a 90-minute layover to limit your chances of missing the flight due to delays or security problems. Don’t sacrifice your basic comfort to save money. If you know your back will be killing you after 45 minutes on your 5-hour flight, a cheaper economy seat may not be worth it! Consider plane alternatives like trains, buses, or other public transportation. They’re usually cheaper (and more eco-friendly). If you’re traveling in a pair, have one person buy a window seat and the other person take the aisle. You may just end up with an empty seat between you!"

      "title": "Dealing with luggage and security",
      "content": "Dealing with luggage and security It’s everyone’s least favorite part of air travel—getting your bags checked and getting through those security lines! Here are some ways to make the process less of an ordeal (and less expensive, too): Enroll in TSA PreCheck, CLEAR, or Global Entry for a faster run through security. [17] X Research source Wear a hat or small bag in the security line. You can easily throw in loose items like your phone, wallet, or jewelry and run it all through security together. Check your departure terminal before you arrive at the airport so you don’t go through security in the wrong one. If you’re comfortable, use a self-service station to check your bag. Then, all you have to do is drop it off at the airline counter before going through security. Use an alternative to checking bags, like LugLess , to breeze through the airport. You don’t have to handle all your luggage yourself—have LugLess take it to your destination for you. It’s a pricey pain to deal with skis, extra-large bags, or boxes when you’re flying. With LugLess , you just drop off your luggage at a FedEx or UPS location, and then it’s delivered straight to your destination address. No more waiting at baggage claim when all you want to do is start your vacation already! LugLess will even pick up your stuff at home instead, if that’s preferable."

      "content": "Staying comfortable You’ve made it past security, checked your bags, and successfully boarded—congrats! Now, check out these tips for staying comfortable on your flight and landing refreshed, relaxed, and ready to explore: Consider signing up for a Priority Pass for access to lounges at airports around the world. These lounges have free food, drinks, WiFi, and other amenities once you’re through security. [18] X Research source Download your airline’s app before your flight so you can access your boarding pass, check in, and pick meals or seats easily. On the airline app, you can also check for open seats before departure and switch to a better seat, if there are any open. If you find an open seat, politely ask a gate attendant for an upgrade. They might just say yes! Always schedule extra time for delays. Wear compression socks to prevent ankle swelling (or blood clots, if you’re prone to them) on super long flights. Wear layers while traveling. It makes it easier to pack your bag, and you can take off or put on layers as needed to stay comfortable. [19] X Research source Chew gum during take-off or landing to help “unpop” your ears. Apply moisturizer, lip balm, and/or a face mask during or right after your flight (flights can dry out your skin because of the low humidity and recycled air in the cabin). Try using a small case that fits in the plane’s seat pocket to hold your flight essentials like headphones, a charger, lip balm, etc. This makes boarding and unboarding a breeze."

      "content": "Keep these tips in mind for a comfy, affordable, and safe stay. Where you stay can make or break a trip, and you have tons of options depending on what your travel goals are. From resorts to hotels to rentals to hostels, here are some tricks and considerations to keep in mind: Stay at least a few blocks away from downtown centers or touristy sites to save a bit of money. See if there are locally owned hotels, hostels, or homestays. These are often cheaper than chain hotels or rentals. [20] X Research source Consider house-sitting or couch-surfing to save even more money (although this may feel uncomfortable if you don’t know the people or are traveling alone). Look into hostels as a budget-friendly option. They’re a great way to meet fellow travelers and maybe even organize a group outing! [21] X Research source Read reviews before booking a stay anywhere. Check if the reviews are posted by bots or seem planted, and trust your gut if you see any red flags. Consider booking through a travel agent for extra discounts and accommodations you might not be able to find otherwise. Try using local public transportation to get around, if it’s safe. Look for accommodations near train stations or bus stops to make getting around even easier. It’s also a great way to soak up the local culture! [22] X Research source"

Even if you’ve already saved big on your flight and accommodations, there are still ways to bring down the overall price of your trip even more. Check out these hacks and marvel at the savings: Be flexible on your destination and travel dates to find better deals. Why spend a fortune on a resort during tourist season when you could get a much cheaper hotel during the off months? [23] X Research source Sign up for and use a credit card with rewards points towards flights or travel. This could make your upcoming trip (or a future one) cheaper. Sign up for credit card bonuses where you get a lot of points after hitting a minimum spending bonus. Try tackling 2 cities or sites that are close to each other in one outing or trip. Add an extra 10-20% to your trip budget to account for emergencies. Think of this as your “oops” fund. Make lunch your big meal of the day instead of dinner. It’s usually cheaper, but is just as filling. Buy food from a local grocery store to keep at your hotel room or rental house so you’re not eating out and buying meals multiple times a day. [24] X Research source Have a friend or family member drop you off at the airport, train station, or bus stop so you don’t have to pay for parking or a rideshare to get there. Consider whether the souvenir you’re eyeing is really worth it. Photos are free and often make for stronger memories!"

International travel is a rewarding experience, but there are lots of opportunities for one overlooked detail to turn into a bigger problem later on. Set yourself up for success with these must-know tips: Buy travel insurance. You never know what will happen! [25] X Research source Use a 3rd-party encrypted app like WhatsApp, Viber, or Signal for international texts and calls to avoid data and call charges. Buy a SIM card at a kiosk in your destination airport after you arrive if you need access to international calls. Your carrier may also offer a temporary global SIM card. [26] X Research source Let your credit and debit card companies know you’re leaving the country so your purchases don’t get flagged as fraud or theft. [27] X Research source Consider using a bank that doesn’t charge ATM fees for international destinations. When you’re withdrawing from an ATM, ask for the local currency (not US dollars). To avoid credit card fees and bad conversion rates, pay with your card in the local currency. Travel just before or after peak time for your destination to get lower prices, but still enjoyable weather and conditions. [28] X Research source Make sure you’re up-to-date on required vaccinations and shots, which may vary by country. Schedule your appointments well in advance if you need to get one. Stay hydrated at all times. It’ll help you adapt to your new environment and time zone. Keep your passport in the same, secure place at all times unless you need it. You really don’t want to lose it! Let people at home know what your itinerary is and where you’ll be in case of emergencies. Turn on location services and sharing on your phone, too. [29] X Research source If you have a sensitive stomach or don’t know if the water is safe to drink, buy bottled water. Plan a low-key day when you land so you can rest and adjust to the new time zone. [30] X Research source"

Whether you’re renting a car or taking your own, skim this list of tips and hacks to make sure you have the smoothest, safest, and most budget-friendly drive across the country possible: If you’re renting a car , reserve it with a credit card that offers auto and collision insurance for rentals. The rental company will also offer insurance. Take pictures of the condition of your rental car before driving it to have proof of its original condition. Pack a neck pillow to make naps in the car more comfortable. Pack body or hand wipes for super long trips where you won’t have access to a shower. This way, you can at least get a little clean at your next rest stop! If you have a membership to a big box store like Costco or Meijer, try to stop there for gas (the items inside will be cheaper for you than at a regular gas station, too!). Pack a cooler and stop for food at grocery stores rather than fast food chains or gas stations. You can save ingredients or premade items for a day or 2 and eat them whenever you need. Take your car to a mechanic for a tune-up before the trip, and pack a roadside emergency kit with your license, registration and insurance information, snacks, jumper cables, a cell phone charger, and some cash for tolls or gas. [31] X Research source Pull over every 100 miles (161 km) to stretch, enjoy the view, and help yourself stay more alert. Get an International Driver’s Permit from your nearest AAA location if you’ll be driving in a different country."

If you’re planning a family vacation, use the hacks below to make sure your trip goes as smoothly as possible for you and the kids. Wrap small toys or entertainment items in wrapping paper and pass them out every few hours during long flights or drives as “surprise gifts” to keep the kids entertained. [32] X Research source If traveling with a fellow parent or other adults, take turns watching the kids for a few hours so the other parent has free time to enjoy themselves on the trip. Let small kids ride airport escalators and moving walkways during flight delays or layovers to keep them entertained and burn off some energy. Play easy games like “ Would You Rather ” or “ Two Truths and a Lie ” to pass time in traffic or during delays as an alternative to screen time. Pack enough snacks and other food to keep picky eaters happy and fed in case they don’t like the food at your destination. For young kids, pack 1 outfit per day and keep each outfit in a separate bag. This makes getting ready each day much simpler! (And pack one backup outfit, just in case.) [33] X Research source Remember that kids can slow you down. Build open time into your itinerary and try not to stuff it with more activities than the kids can keep up with. Research baby equipment rental companies at your destination so you don’t have to pack or check large toys like push cars. You can usually rent toys and other things for just a few dollars a day. [34] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Give kids a short and manageable packing checklist (for the big trip or smaller excursions once you’ve arrived) to teach them to be responsible for their things (just have them show you that they actually packed everything before you head out). If you’re flying with small kids, choose a seat near the front if they tend to get motion sickness or a seat near the back if they’re still potty training."

Here are some hacks and tips for absorbing the local culture and having a good time you can write home about later: Download offline versions of Google Maps (or take screenshots when you have data) so you can navigate remote areas without depending on data. Try the Google Translate app to translate signs and converse with locals who speak a different language. Meet up with tour groups or organizations if you’re traveling alone. For example, there may be groups for solo female travelers or LGBTQ+ travelers in your destination. If you’re traveling with others, decide on your itinerary and priorities ahead of time. That way, no one has to debate about what to do or when. Research the culture and customs of the native people at your destination. This will help you avoid any faux pas and get along better with locals. If you’re going to a very different time zone, get some natural sunlight as soon as possible once you land to help reset your circadian rhythm. Quick naps are fine, but try to stay up all day and stay in bed all night to fully adjust to your time zone. Consider walking tours (or just wandering around on foot yourself) as a great way to see important sites and get acquainted with your new area. [35] X Research source If it’s cooked in front of you and seems safe, eat some street food. It’s an excellent way to get a taste of the local culture and cuisine.
