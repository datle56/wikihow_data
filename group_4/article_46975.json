      "content": "Keep in mind that \"only\" is a modifier. This means that it helps explain what you are trying to say and acts as a descriptive word in your sentence. \"Only\" can have a strong presence in a sentence and can change the meaning of the sentence if it's used in the wrong place. [1] X Research source To create a clear sentence, you should place \"only\" next to the noun, verb, or phrase you are trying to modify. When the word \"only\" is placed incorrectly in a sentence, it becomes a \"misplaced modifier\". This means the modifier (\"only\") is not placed beside the noun or other word it is meant to modify. This can create confusion for the listener or reader, because the sentence becomes awkward, even misleading. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Be aware of the casual use of \"only\". You may notice that in everyday speech people tend to place \"only\" in the wrong place in a sentence, thus conveying nothing more than a general sense of what they are trying to say. As with certain other grammatical rules, it can feel awkward to use proper placement of a modifier in a casual conversation. Sometimes you won't need to use \"only\" correctly for your listeners to understand what you mean. [3] X Research source It’s important, however, to use the correct placement of \"only\" when writing a formal letter, a paper, or something for public consumption to ensure you do not confuse your reader."

      "content": "Notice the common misplacement of \"only\" in everyday speech. When we are talking informally we might use \"only\" to indicate that someone did just one thing. For example: \"She only ate strawberries for dinner\". [4] X Research source In this sentence the speaker probably means to say that she had strawberries for dinner and nothing else. The speaker is trying to modify \"strawberries\" when, in fact, \"only\" is placed before (and thus modifies) the verb \"ate\". This implies that the subject in the sentence, \"she\", does nothing with the strawberries but eat them for dinner. She doesn’t pick them. She doesn’t prepare them. She just eats them. The correct placement of \"only\" in this sentence, based on the probable intended meaning, is: \"She ate only strawberries for dinner\". The modifier \"only\" is next to the noun it's meant to modify and is now grammatically correct. At first, it can feel awkward to say this sentence out loud, because sentences like this are so often misspoken or miswritten. However, once you realize that the wrong sentence construction doesn't mean what you want it to mean, the correctly constructed sentence will start to feel more comfortable."

      "content": "Create examples of the different ways to use \"only\" in a sentence. The best way to get a sense of the proper use of the word \"only\" is to make your own \"practice\" sentences and note what \"only\" is modifying in each case. [5] X Research source For example, consider these six different placements of \"only\" in the same sentence: \"Only I like dancing at a party\". \"I only like dancing at a party\". \"I like only dancing at a party\". \"I like dancing only at a party\". \"I like dancing at only a party\". \"I like dancing at a party only\"."

      "title": "Use \"only\" before a subject to modify the subject.",
      "content": "Use \"only\" before a subject to modify the subject. For example: \"Only I like dancing at a party\". In this sentence, \"only\" is modifying the subject \"I\". You are saying that you (\"I\") are the only person who likes to dance at a party. [6] X Research source You could view this sentence another way: \"Only John danced at the party\". In this construction no one but John danced at the party. If this is the intended meaning, that John was the only dancer at the party, you would place \"only\" at the beginning of the sentence so that it modifies \"John\"."

      "title": "Place \"only\" before the verb in a sentence to modify the verb.",
      "content": "Place \"only\" before the verb in a sentence to modify the verb. For example: \"I only like dancing at a party\". In this sentence, \"only\" is modifying the verb \"like\". This sentence is saying that \"I\" is doing nothing other than liking dancing at a party. \"I\" isn't praising, criticizing or ignoring dancing at a party, s/he is simply liking it. Using \"only\" to modify a verb is less common than using it to modify a noun or pronoun. [7] X Research source The third \"practice\" sentence above -- \"I like only dancing at a party\" -- means that the person likes dancing and no other activities (talking, eating, etc) at a party. In the fourth sentence above, \"only\" could be seen as modifying \"dancing\" or \"at a party\". Because the distinction could be important, in speech you would have the option of orally stressing the word or words being modified. In the fifth sentence above, \"only\" modifies \"a party\", meaning no other location or event. This is a clearer usage than the fourth sentence. The final sentence above places \"only\" after \"party\". It more clearly expresses the same meaning as the previous sentence. You could look at these placements in a different situation or setting. For example: \"John only cooks meat for his family\". This sentence works if John is a vegetarian and does not buy, prepare, or eat meat. But when he is with his family, who are diehard meat-eaters, he will cook meat for them. In this case, the modifier is correctly placed, as the sentence indicates that John will cook meat for his family but not do anything else with the meat."

      "title": "Use \"only\" before a second verb in a sentence to modify the second verb.",
      "content": "Use \"only\" before a second verb in a sentence to modify the second verb. For example: \"I like only dancing at a party\". In this sentence, \"only\" is modifying \"dancing\". (\"Dancing\" in this case is a verb form known as a gerund, which acts as a noun.) This means that \"I\" like only one thing at a party -- dancing -- not talking, singing, chatting, or drinking. [8] X Research source The use of \"only\" works better in a sentence that indicates the speaker does just one thing in a certain situation. For example: \"I eat only vegetables\". This sentence means that you consume vegetables but no meat or other food products. \"I only eat vegetables,\" on the other hand, means that you do nothing with vegetables except eat them. While the above is academically true, so many people say, \"I only eat...\" when they mean, \"I eat only...\" -- or similar phrases -- it has become common and easily understood usage."

      "content": "Place \"only\" before the ending phrase in a sentence to modify the phrase. For example: \"I like dancing only at a party\". In this example, \"only\" is modifying \"at a party\". This indicates that the speaker likes to dance when s/he is at a party and that s/he does not dance at any other time or place. [9] X Research source You can look at this use of \"only\" another way: \"John drinks scotch only with his dad\". This sentence means that John drinks scotch with his dad and with no one else."
