      "content": "Scrape off as much leftover food as possible. Use your silverware, a rubber spatula, or a paper towel to push any leftover food on your dishes into the trash can. This not only makes it easier to clean your dishes, but it helps prevent your sink drain from getting clogged. [1] X Research source If you have a garbage disposal, put any uneaten food down the drain while your disposal is running. Don’t pour any grease down your drain, as it can solidify and clog your pipes. If the food is really stuck-on, add some dish detergent or baking soda to the pot or pan and fill it with hot water. Let it soak for 15-30 minutes, then drain and proceed with washing."

      "content": "Load your dishes from biggest to smallest. To make washing easier, place your largest dishes (like pots, pans, and platters) in the sink first, then stack smaller dishes (like bowls and plates) on top. Finally, add small cups and utensils. For best results, stack a few dishes at a time so they have time to soak while you work on washing. [3] X Research source Before submerging any dishes, double check to make sure it’s safe to wash them this way."

      "title": "Scrub your dishes underwater with a sponge or dishcloth.",
      "content": "Scrub your dishes underwater with a sponge or dishcloth. Start by cleaning small, lightly-soiled dishes, like drinking glasses , and work your way toward more heavily-soiled items, like pots and pans—this gives the stubborn food more time to soak and loosen. For the best results, keep the dishes underwater as you wash them to loosen any stuck-on food. Using circular motions, wipe each dish clean with a sponge or dishcloth. [4] X Research source If the water gets too dirty to see through, drain your sink and refill it. Be careful when handling knives! To clean knives safely, wipe them clean from the back so you aren’t holding onto the blade. Never keep sharp knives in the sink since they may be hard to see if the water gets dirty. Another option is to soak a sponge with soapy water and scrub your dishes without submerging them. This method works best if the dishes aren’t too dirty. If dishes like ceramics or baking sheets have stubborn stains , Chiu says, “Create a mixture of baking soda and vinegar until it [forms] a thick paste. Apply the paste with a towel or microfiber cloth and gently scrub the stains. Rinse the dish with warm water and repeat as necessary.” [5] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 15 October 2019."

      "title": "Rinse your dishes with hot water.",
      "content": "Rinse your dishes with hot water. After you wash a dish, rinse it under the hottest water you can handle until the suds are gone. Do so by dipping the dishes in a rinsing pan or sink, holding them under running water, or by placing them in a drying rack and pouring or spraying water over them. Be sure to rinse inside cups, bowls, and glassware. [6] X Research source Avoid using cold water, as it may cause water spots on your dishes. If you have a double sink, rinse off the suds on the second side to be more efficient. Otherwise, just alternate between washing and rinsing."

      "content": "Let the dishes dry on a rack or a clean towel. In general, allow your dishes to air dry for about 30-60 minutes on a drying rack or face down on a clean towel on your counter. Alternatively, dry them in the second side of a double sink. [7] X Research source Avoid wiping your dishes with a towel, if possible, as drying them with a dirty towel will only spread germs around more. Air drying is recommended."

      "content": "Rinse your sink after you put your dishes away. You don’t want any grease or food bits floating around the next time you need to use your sink. Run some hot water and wipe your sink down with a sponge or microfiber cloth and some dish soap. Work from the outside in and top to bottom so that dirty water doesn’t drip into areas you’ve cleaned. Take out and clean your strainer, as well. [8] X Research source Make sure your sink is clear of any items before you begin cleaning it. If your sink is really dirty, plug it and fill it up with water. Add a capful of bleach and let it sit for 5 minutes before draining. Then, wipe the sink down. If you need to clean your drain, Dulude says, “Vinegar and baking soda make a fine sink drain deep cleaner. Pour a few spoonfuls of baking soda [down] the drain and add about a cup of vinegar. Let it fizz up and keep it in there for 5 minutes before rinsing with hot water. This can help unclog minor clogs and deodorize a sink.” [9] X Expert Source Kadi Dulude House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 22 September 2019."

Before loading your dishwasher, scrape the food off of your plates or cookware into the garbage, removing as much as possible so that it doesn’t clog your dishwasher. It generally isn’t necessary (or recommended) to rinse your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, as it may actually prevent your dishwasher from getting them as clean. [10] X Research source Before loading your dishwasher, double-check that your dishes are dishwasher safe. If they aren’t, you’ll have to hand wash them. Do not load cookware made of wood, pewter, cast iron, crystal, fine china, bronze, or brass."

Set your cups and bowls between the tines on the top rack of your dishwasher, making sure they’re facedown or angled so that water doesn’t pool on them. Load from back to front so that you can fit more in. [11] X Research source Avoid nesting items, as this will prevent water from reaching and cleaning them. The bottom of the dishwasher is hotter and can melt plastic, so it's important to load any plastic items on the top shelf."

Keep large, flat pans and other oversized items on the sides or the back of the bottom rack so that they don’t block the water spray. Stand your plates on their ends so that their dirty sides face the water sprayer and are cleaned more effectively. Load your pots and pans upside down so that water doesn’t pool inside them. [12] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Most dishwashers have angled tines on the bottom rack so that your plates will point in the right direction. Never stack your dishes on top of one another, as the water won’t be able to clean them all."

Make sure the handles face downward so the dirty parts get cleaned, and leave space between each utensil so the water can get between the surfaces. Mix spoons, forks, and knives so they don’t nest together. [13] X Research source Don't load sharp knives because the dishwasher can dull them. Duller knives like butter knives are okay to put in the dishwasher. Make sure long-handled utensils aren’t bumping into the water sprayer in the middle of your dishwasher. If they are, lay the utensils flat on the top rack instead. Separate silver and stainless steel cutlery since the silver may pit when they’re touching."

Washing daily also helps prevent the growth of bacteria and fungus and keeps insects and other pests away.

      "title": "How do you wash cast iron skillets?",
      "content": "How do you wash cast iron skillets? To clean a cast iron skillet , pour hot water into the skillet immediately after you’re done using it. Hold the pan with an oven mitt or pot holder with your non-dominant hand, and use your other hand to scrub off any leftover food with a new sponge or stiff-bristled brush. Drain the water and dry the skillet on the stove over low heat for 10-15 minutes. Remove it from the heat, then oil your skillet with vegetable oil and a paper towel to keep it in good condition. [17] X Research source Don’t use detergent or steel wool on your pan, as these can strip the pan. Don’t let the skillet soak, or it could rust. If there’s still leftover food after draining, sprinkle in 2 tbsp (18 g) of coarse kosher salt and scrub away the remaining bits. The salt acts as an abrasive to remove stuck food. Let the oil dry for 20-30 minutes before putting the skillet away. To clean a burnt cast iron pan, Dulude says, “First, try soaking the pan for a few minutes in water, then use a cast iron scrubber to remove burnt-on food. Dry the pan very well and apply oil before putting it away. If this does not work, try boiling some water in the pan for a few minutes while gently nudging the stubborn spots with a wooden [spoon].” [18] X Expert Source Kadi Dulude House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 22 September 2019."
