      "content": "Start with dry hair . You’ll have to tie your hair while wearing the hijab, but tying up wet hair can damage your roots. Avoid hair damage or even hair loss by blow-drying or air-drying your strands completely before tying them back or putting on any layers of fabric over your hair. Covering damp hair keeps it from drying out, so you may end up with a scalp infection if you aren’t careful. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Secure your hair in a low ponytail , bun, or braid at the back of your head. Pull back your hair into whichever style you prefer. Bring the volume to the nape of your neck for a smoother line, or position your bun higher up if you prefer a bun-shaped silhouette. If your braid extends below your shoulders, tuck the end in the neckline of your top to prevent any hair from being exposed. [3] X Research source Don’t tie your hair too tightly as it might get uncomfortable and give you a headache over the course of the day. Aim to secure your strands away from your face without yanking on them. Constantly pulling at your roots can also cause hair damage. If you usually opt for a tight bun, opt for a softer braid once a week to put less stress on your roots."

      "content": "Clip short hair and bangs away from your face. Gather short pieces of hair in one hand and secure them in place with your other hand using a few hair clips or bobby pins. Clip face-framing strands at the side of your temple or behind your ear to keep them from falling loose. If your hair is cut short or you have bangs, it’ll be a little more difficult to tie back your hair, every strand will still need to be held in place. Try twisting your bangs together before pinning them back"

      "content": "Put on an underscarf before arranging your outer hijab scarf. The three main types of underscarves are each worn differently. Choose your preferred style and slip it over your head, tying or pinning it in place if necessary. [4] X Research source An underscarf will provide you with more coverage and will help hold your hair back. Since many varieties are stretchy and form-fitting to your skull, an underscarf will also help keep your hijab in place."

      "title": "Opt for a full underscarf for the maximum amount of coverage.",
      "content": "Opt for a full underscarf for the maximum amount of coverage. A full underscarf, also called a \"ninja” underscarf, will completely cover your hair and neck area. [5] X Research source Slip it on like a hood and align the front so it covers up your natural hairline and ears. The additional coverage will allow you to be more creative and less meticulous when pinning your scarf. [6] X Research source Since the full underscarf is opaque, it will also allow you to wear a slightly less opaque scarf over it."

      "title": "Select a bonnet cap for complete hair coverage.",
      "content": "Select a bonnet cap for complete hair coverage. While a bonnet cap doesn’t cover your neck, it will completely conceal your hair. Place the front side of the cap at your forehead below your hairline. Then pull the cap over your tied-back hair. Tug it forward slightly so that your ears are covered, and then tie the underscarf firmly at the bottom, near the nape of your neck. [7] X Research source Find a bonnet cap with a non-slip front panel so it stays in place along your forehead. Bonnet caps come with ties at the back, making them easy to secure around your head."

      "content": "Try a tube underscarf for comfortable but not complete hair coverage. Pull the tube underscarf completely over your head so it sits around your neck, then draw it back over your hair so the front opening encircles your face. Adjust the tube so that the front edge sits along your forehead, covering up your hairline and ears. Extend the rest of the tube smoothly over your hair. [8] X Research source The back opening can sit loose at the back of your head. A stretch knit tube underscarf is a comfortable option, especially for women with long hair, but since the back opening may expose your hair, you’ll need to wear it with an opaque scarf. A wide knit headband would be an alternative to a tube underscarf, although it won’t provide as much coverage."

      "title": "Arrange the flat scarf so it has one longer end and one shorter end.",
      "content": "Arrange the flat scarf so it has one longer end and one shorter end. If you’re starting with a wide scarf, fold over one side to make it a little narrower. Pick up the scarf along the folded edge with your hands about an arm’s length apart. Keep one side shorter, so there’s about 1 to 1.5 ft (0.30 to 0.46 m) hanging loose. Leave the rest of the fabric on the other longer side. [9] X Research source You could start with the longer end on the left side and the shorter end on the right side, if you like."

      "content": "Place the edge of the scarf at your forehead. Align the folded or front edge of the scarf at your forehead, centering your face between where your hands are gripping the scarf. [10] X Research source Start smoothing the edge over the sides of your forehead and bring the loose ends down below your chin. At this point, the shorter end will extend about 1 ft (0.30 m) below your chin and the longer end will hang loose. If you didn’t need to fold the scarf, just line the edge up to your underscarf. [11] X Research source Feel free to cover up the underscarf or expose 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of it if it’s a contrasting color. If the shorter end sits near your right shoulder, the longer end will be near your left shoulder."

      "title": "Smooth the fabric around your face, meeting the ends below your chin.",
      "content": "Smooth the fabric around your face, meeting the ends below your chin. Adjust the scarf to get the correct positioning around your entire face. It should lay smoothly and comfortably against your forehead and temples, and your hair and ears should be covered. Feel free to add a pleat in the fabric near your ear or jaw area. This will help non-stretch fabric wrap more elegantly around the curvature of your face. [12] X Research source Make sure the scarf isn’t placed too far forward so that it covers your eyebrows, or too far backward so that it exposes your hairline."

Pinch the ends of the scarf together and insert a small safety pin. [13] X Research source This pin can be readjusted throughout the day if needed. If you’re using a jersey scarf or you prefer not to use a pin, simply pinch the ends together while you start wrapping the long end around your head. If done correctly, the short end should stay in place. [14] X Research source"

[15] X Research source Keep the inner edge of the long end smooth along the base of your chin. This is especially important if you haven’t used a pin. If the long end started near your left shoulder, you’d bring it towards your right shoulder."

      "title": "Continue wrapping the long end around the back of your head.",
      "content": "Continue wrapping the long end around the back of your head. Instead of wrapping the long end horizontally around your neck, raise it up slightly as you bring it towards the back of your head. Lay the edge smoothly across your crown, positioning it where a headband might go. At this point, the scarf should drape nicely in front of your neck and make a smooth transition to the top of your head. [16] X Research source If you just brought the long end to your right side, pass it over your right shoulder, extend across your head, and let it hang loose over your left shoulder."

      "content": "Pin the long end at the base of your chin. Once you’ve positioned the long end of the scarf over the top of your head, smooth the remaining fabric along the side of your face. Take it back to the underside of your chin and slip a safety pin discreetly through the layers of material to keep the loose end in place. [17] X Research source If the long end started at your right side, it should be back at the right side now. If you’re using a longer scarf, you can continue wrapping the fabric in one more layer. Feel free to pin the end at your crown with a small safety pin if you prefer. [18] X Research source A brooch can also be used to hold the scarf in place instead of a pin."

Slide them smoothly beneath the neckline on your blouse, knit top, or sweater. [19] X Research source Secure the long end to your top with a small safety pin so it doesn’t shift around. [20] X Research source This will not only look elegant but will also keep the ends neatly out of the way."

      "content": "Leave the long end of the scarf loose as an asymmetrical accent. Once you’ve tied the basic hijab, you can let the long end hang down at one side of your face. If it’s very long, you can wrap it once, passing it low around your neck, and bring it back to the front. Try this with a fringed scarf or a floaty chiffon scarf. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Toss both ends behind your shoulders for an effortless style. Leave the shorter side a little longer before you start. Wrap the basic hijab style around your face and pin in below your chin. Crisscross the two ends of the scarf in front, then toss the long, loose ends over your shoulders so they drape over your shoulders and hang loose at the back. [22] X Research source Just make sure the base of your hair is completely covered with this style. Try wearing a full underscarf to get the most coverage. This can work well with a triangular scarf, since the tapered ends will drape beautifully."

      "title": "Twist one end into a coil and wrap it around your neck.",
      "content": "Twist one end into a coil and wrap it around your neck. This works well with a jersey scarf. Keep the ends of the scarf roughly the same length for this style. Once you’ve pinned the ends beneath your chin, twist one end into a coil and then wrap it a few times around your neck. Tuck the tip into the neckline of your top and secure it with a safety pin. [23] X Research source With the other end, you can either twist it into a similar coil and wrap it around your neck to finish the look. Alternatively, you can pass the other end up and over your crown and leave the rest of the fabric to hang loose at the side."

      "content": "Adjust the folds and drapery to flatter your face shape. As you wrap the scarf, try tweaking the volume and proportions of your hijab. Aim to add dimension and volume to help balance out your features. Look online to find advice for what style works best with your face shape. Try leaving your hijab slightly looser around the sides of your face to enhance a more rounded face. The extra drape will add dimension and break up the softness of your features. Add folds and texture below your chin to balance a long face or square jawline. Leave a V-shaped peak at the top of your forehead to mirror an oval or heart-shaped chin. This works best over a visible underscarf."

Instead of pinning them together, pinch them firmly. While pinching, bring the two ends toward the side and proceed to wrap the long end of the scarf around the back of your head. [24] X Research source You’ll notice that the shorter end will get folded in half below your chin. Just tuck away the remaining fabric into the folds of the scarf."

      "title": "Wrap the end of the scarf low around your neck instead of at your crown.",
      "content": "Wrap the end of the scarf low around your neck instead of at your crown. When you wrap a woven scarf up over your head, you’ll usually need a pin to hold the fabric in place. As an alternative, try bringing the end of the scarf low around your neck. [25] X Research source Wrap it across the front of your neck and around the back, then bring it to the front. Finally, toss the long end over your shoulder to finish off your stylish, pin-free hijab. For this style, leave the shorter end a bit longer and let it hang down. Keep the folds of the scarf tightly arranged to keep the scarf secure. [26] X Research source"

      "content": "Knot the scarf at the nape of your neck instead of pinning it below your chin. Once the scarf is sitting smoothly against your forehead, bring the ends past your ears and towards the back. Tie a secure single knot at your nape, beneath your hair. Then wrap one long end up and over your head like a headband. Knot it with the other end below your opposite ear, like a side bun. [27] X Research source Leave the ends loose at your side if you’d like, or tie them in loose bow to add some volume. This style will leave the front of your neck exposed."

      "title": "Use a scarf in the shape and size of your choice.",
      "content": "Use a scarf in the shape and size of your choice. Some hijabs consist of a single piece of fabric that may be square, oblong, or triangular, while others may involve two pieces of fabric. Practically speaking, you can use any type of scarf as long as it is big enough to cover your hair, ears, and neck. Select a scarf that has just the right amount of fabric to cover you completely without being too bulky and billowy. Scarves designed to be worn as hijabs can be found in Muslim stores and online specialty shops. A long rectangular piece of cloth called a shayla is a popular type of scarf used for the hijab. The al-amira is another common headscarf style. [28] X Research source Some women prefer hijabs with slim profiles while others prefer a fuller drape or even a few layers. Try different styles and sizes to see what you like the best."

      "title": "Aim for a lightweight, breathable fabric.",
      "content": "Aim for a lightweight, breathable fabric. Scarves made of natural fibers like silk, or cotton are typically more comfortable and breathable than those made of synthetic fibers. [29] X Research source Choose a woven fabric for a neat and nicely draping hijab, or a stretch knit material for extra comfort and flexibility. Chiffon can be very elegant, plus it's lightweight and breathable. [30] X Research source However, it's more sheer and prone to slipping, so you’ll definitely need an underscarf. Georgette has a little more texture than chiffon, which prevents slippage, and it drapes just as beautifully. [31] X Research source Jersey, a stretch knit fabric, can be comfortable and provide a lot of coverage since it's opaque. It can be a great casual choice, and typically doesn’t need to be secured with pins. [32] X Research source You should feel comfortable in the fabric you’ve chosen. If it's too slippery, too hot, or too tight, try a different material."

A patterned scarf can brighten up your outfit, while a solid-color scarf in a neutral shade that’s flattering to your skin tone can be worn with anything. [33] X Research source Neutral shades such as white, cream, beige, and brown can be flattering and versatile. Think about a color you find flattering in makeup and try a hijab in that color. You might like blush pink, silvery lavender, or dusty blue. Black is also a popular choice. Look for a black scarf with a discreet pattern as opposed to the usual solid."

Alternatively, a solid-color scarf can be easily worn with anything. [34] X Research source Keep in mind that the purpose of the hijab is to remain modest, not to draw attention. With that in mind, steer clear of any print or color you think is overly attention-grabbing."

If you lead an active lifestyle, purchase a hijab that’s made of a wicking performance fabric and designed to be worn with athletic attire. Find one that fits snugly around your head and doesn’t need to be pinned. Alternatively, choose a machine-washable jersey scarf and make sure it’s on securely before hitting the gym. [35] X Research source To maintain your hijab, machine-wash it frequently. Along with your hijab, loose jogging pants and a long sleeved t-shirt should serve for most exercise activities. If you play team sports, pick out a hijab in a color that matches your uniform. You may also need to wear a long shirt or bottoms underneath the team uniform."
