You're already emotionally intimate with them and have a strong connection that it can be easy to confuse with romance. Instead, look for someone who you know of but don't necessarily know super well. That'll make it easier to avoid getting emotionally entangled. Think in terms of people you might always see when you're out with a large group of friends but have never hung out with one on one. A friend of a friend can work too. Spread the word that you're looking and who knows, your BFF might introduce you to her cute coworker."

Someone who has experience with casual sexual relationships is also great because they have a general idea of what to expect.

If you're not used to initiating sexual encounters, you might feel awkward but try not to overthink it. Once you get the ball rolling, neither of you will be thinking about how it started. Don't worry about planning some big seduction if that's not your style. You could just casually mention that you'd be down if they were interested and see how they respond.

[8] X Research source For example, you might say, \"Hey, I had a really great time last night... how wild would it be if we made that a regular thing, like friends with benefits?\" If they're not interested in starting a FWB thing, keeping your tone light gives them an easy way to back out without feeling like they're rejecting you.

At some point, maybe the next time the two of you are hanging out after you've agreed to start a FWB relationship, take a few minutes to talk about the rules you want to have. While you'll likely have things come up as you go along, if there's anything on your mind from the outset, it's best to get it out there before it becomes a problem. [9] X Research source For example, the two of you might decide that even though you're \"just\" friends with benefits, you don't actually want to be involved with anyone else sexually. While it might seem weird to be monogamous friends with benefits, it's increasingly common among people who want a regular sexual partner without emotional strings attached..

You might be casual about your attachment to each other, but don't be casual about your protection against pregnancy and STIs.

While it stands to reason that you'll have at least some emotional connection with a friend, the aim is to keep that from bleeding into romance territory. [16] X Research source While friends do tend to lean on each other for emotional support, too much of that with a friend with benefits can make the whole situation feel more like a romance.

Since most people also consider their romantic partners to be friends, it can be hard to draw the line—but the key difference is the level of commitment you have for each other. [21] X Research source For example, you wouldn't feel as though you had to consult your FWB before you took your family up on a free weekend trip to the mountains.

      "content": "How long do FWB relationships usually last? Most FWB relationships tend to last a month or two and kind of taper off on their own and just kind of fizzle out. The casual nature of the whole affair means that people involved in these dynamics don't tend to have much invested in keeping them going. [22] X Research source The vast majority of FWB relationships either end or change into something else after a year, so don't go into this expecting it to be a long-term thing. Typically, FWB relationships are designed to be transitional in some way. For example, if you're getting over a recent breakup, you might use a FWB relationship to reconnect with your sexuality while you're still healing emotionally."

      "content": "What happens if one of the friends catches feelings for the other? Having sex with someone churns up a lot of feel-good hormones in your brain that feel a lot like falling in love. Despite your best intentions, sometimes one of you catches feelings while the other doesn't. What specifically happens depends on the two of you but it's usually pretty awkward and uncomfortable at best. If you're the one with the feelings, try going \"no contact\" with your friend for a couple of weeks. That will usually be long enough for those feelings to subside. If your FWB has caught feelings for you, suggest that the two of you take a break for a little while. That will give them time to calm down a little."

Keegan explains that unlike a FWB relationship, in a situationship you have \"some intimacy with that person or [feel] a deep connection in some way.\" [24] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 14 December 2022. While this isn't always the case, a FWB relationship can turn into a situationship if one of you catches feelings for the other and doesn't say anything about it. A situationship can also develop if both of you have feelings for each other but aren't ready to be in a full-fledged romantic relationship. For example, you might've both recently had bad breakups. Setting firm boundaries in your FWB relationship can keep it from drifting into a situationship. [25] X Research source"

If you have to make an effort to hook up with your FWB, or if you find the time between hookups expanding, it's probably time to just let it fade. Often, a FWB relationship will just sort of fade out on its own once the two of you get involved with something else that starts taking up more of your time. This tends to happen if the relationship started in a transitional time, such as when one of you is recovering from a breakup. Sometimes your situation provides a convenient endpoint for a FWB relationship. For example, you might have a FWB while you're at school and just cut it off when the two of you leave for the summer. Regular check-ins can help you figure out when things are starting to fizzle out so the two of you can just end things before they get awkward."

It might take some time before you can hang out together as friends before thinking about sex, but it'll happen. [26] X Research source Even if your FWB relationship ended on a pretty sour note with hard feelings, there's still a chance you can find your way back to being friends after enough time has passed.
