      "content": "Make sure all of your items are dishwasher-safe. The first step before adding your pod to the dishwasher is ensuring that all of the items you have loaded are dishwasher-safe. Avoid adding items that are made of cast iron, crystal, plastic, copper or nonstick pans, and insulated mugs into the dishwasher as these might be ruined by the heat and detergent. [1] X Research source Items that are not dishwasher-safe often have a warning on their packaging or right on the product, so check the product before you add it to your load. Try not to let your dishes sit for more than 24 hours. The less time you leave them sitting in your dishwasher, the less likely you are to have caked on food and grease."

      "content": "Use a single pod for a regular-sized load. One of the benefits of the pods is that they are individually packaged and measured for a typical dishwasher load, which makes it convenient and easy for you to pop one into the dishwasher. If you have a regular dishwashing load, use one pod. If you have a full load that is heavily soiled, you should add in a second pod. Be sure not overload your dishwasher. [2] X Research source Be aware that very light dishwashing loads may have leftover residue from the pod, so you may want to wait to turn on your dishwasher when you have a close to a full load.

      "title": "Place the pod in your dishwasher detergent dispenser.",
      "content": "Place the pod in your dishwasher detergent dispenser. Ensure that you are placing the pod in the correct place in your dishwasher – this is typically located on the inside of the door to your dishwasher and is designated for dish detergents or dishwashing pods. Close the latch tightly on the dispenser before closing the door to your dishwasher. [4] X Research source Do not try to pierce or open the dishwasher pod in any way. The casing of the pod is meant to help measure out the individual packaging of the pods, as well as easily dissolved in the dishwasher with the contents. Breaking the outer casing of the pod can create a mess and can be irritating to your skin. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Add a finishing liquid to your dishwashing load for optimal results. In some cases, adding a finishing liquid with the pod can help the pod clean away caked on food and grease, and leave your glassware shiny and streak free. Fill the rinse-aid dispenser in your dishwasher with the finishing liquid, and it will automatically add the correct amount of liquid to the load for you each time."

      "content": "Turn your dishwasher on and let the pod work its magic. If your dishwasher has temperature control settings, adjusting the temperature between 125 °F (52 °C) and 140 °F (60 °C) is the optimal heat setting for the pods to clean your dishes."

      "content": "Choose a high-quality dishwasher pod. To ensure that your dishwasher pod is going to effectively clean your dishes, you’ll need to find the right set of pods that work for best for your needs. Choosing a powerful dishwasher pod will ensure that you don’t have to use an extra one (and extra water and energy) on another cycle if there is food left behind. Look for pods that are labeled with concentrated cleaning power, for example, “15 X Power” or “12 X Power.” This means there are more grease-fighting ingredients per pod. Depending on your preference, you can choose between scented pods, which come in fragrances like Fresh or Lemon, or if you’d prefer you can opt for the odorless pods with no added dyes or fragrances. High-quality dishwasher pods tend to steer clear of toxic ingredients like synthetic dyes and chemicals, which will be printed on the labels. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Select pods that are environmentally friendly. If you tend to rinse your dishes quite well before you put them in the dishwasher and like to choose eco-friendly cleaning products for your kitchen, select a pod that is environmentally friendly to reduce your green footprint. In general, if you are looking for a more eco-friendly product, make sure to pick a dishwasher pod that is biodegradable and free from artificial fragrances and phosphates. [7] X Research source It’s good to remember that even if a product states on its packaging that it is “green,” you should always read the list of ingredients because this may not be the case.

      "content": "Store your pods in a fresh and dry environment. Since detergent is water-activated, be sure to keep the pods stored in a place where they will not be in contact with water. Keeping your pods away from the sink and stored in a kitchen cabinet near the dishwasher is optimal. [9] X Research source"
