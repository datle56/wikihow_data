      "content": "Prepare yourself and your stretching area. A designated stretching area and appropriate clothing will help you get the most out of the exercises. Have a designated area for stretching that is free of all clutter. If this isn’t possible, clear away any obstructive material (e.g. breakable china ornaments, expensive objects) from the area you will be using. Wear comfortable clothes (such as a tracksuit or bike shorts over a leotard or tight-fitting crossover). [1] X Research source Pull long hair back into a ponytail or a bun so it isn't distracting. If you have hard floors you may want to use a mat for floor stretches."

You can also lay on the floor, lift up one of your knees, and move it in circles to rotate your hip joint.
