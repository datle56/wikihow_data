      "title": "Bunch the curtain fabric into a signal column.",
      "content": "Bunch the curtain fabric into a signal column. Check that your curtains are securely attached to a rod. Scrunch the curtain material to 1 side so it forms a thick column of fabric. At this point, remove any cords or tie-backs that are currently attached to the curtain. [1] X Research source"
    },

      "title": "Loop a thin portion of the curtain clockwise around the column.",
      "content": "Loop a thin portion of the curtain clockwise around the column. Hold the middle portion of the curtain with 1 hand, then use your opposite hand to hold the outer edge of the curtain fabric. Wrap this thin portion of fabric behind the rest of the bunched fabric, then loop it back around the front. [2] X Research source You’ll only be wrapping 1 layer of fabric around the curtains to create the knot."

      "title": "Secure the knot with the loose end of the fabric.",
      "content": "Secure the knot with the loose end of the fabric. Take the loose, bottom corner of the curtain and stick it behind the wrapped section of curtain. Be sure to tuck the curtain in completely to make the knot sturdy. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Create a loop with the line on your right, line B.",
      "content": "Create a loop with the line on your right, line B. Try to leave at least 4 to 5 in (10 to 13 cm) of space between the loop and the end of line B, so you can tie back your curtains in a comfortable knot. Note that the loop itself only needs to be about 2 in (5.1 cm) long, depending on the size of your cord overall. [4] X Research source If you’re using a tasseled cord, make sure that there’s at least 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) between the end of the loop and the top of the tassel. You’ll be creating a knotted bow with your drapery tie, then using the loops of this bow to hold your curtains back."

      "title": "Wrap the left line, Line A, around the loop 4-5 times.",
      "content": "Wrap the left line, Line A, around the loop 4-5 times. As you work, try to wrap the loop in a counter-clockwise direction. Make sure that the left end of line B’s loop is still protruding from the newly coiled loops. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "String line A through the loop to make it secure.",
      "content": "String line A through the loop to make it secure. Take the end of line A and tuck it into the loop that’s protruding from the left side of the knot. Pull the end of line A through the loop to bring it back to its original position. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull out a new loop through the 5 coils of cord.",
      "content": "Pull out a new loop through the 5 coils of cord. Tuck line A to the right through the 4-5 coils of cord, then bring it out from the other end of the knot. Use your fingers to pinch this section of cord into a loop shape, so both sides of the knot can look identical to 1 another. [7] X Research source Try to make both loops even in size."

    {
      "title": "Tug on both loops to tighten the central coils.",
      "content": "Tug on both loops to tighten the central coils. Use both hands to pinch on the opposite loops for each side of the cord. Pull on the loops until the inner coils tighten, which fully form the knot. At this point, pull on the ends of lines A and B to make sure that they’re both even. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Attach the loops on 2 separate wall hooks.",
      "content": "Attach the loops on 2 separate wall hooks. Install 2 manual or adhesive hooks on either side of your knotted curtains. Try to position the hooks directly on either side of the bunched portion of curtains. String your side loops over the hooks to keep them in place so your knotted curtains don’t shift. [9] X Research source If you can't place wall hooks near your curtains, you can disregard this."
