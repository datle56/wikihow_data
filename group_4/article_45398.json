      "content": "Stop your hair removal regimen for 30 days. Blocked or inflamed hair follicles usually result from hair removal, and can affect all areas that you shave, wax, or trim. If you continue your hair removal regimen while the follicles are inflamed, your skin will take much longer to heal. Allow 30 days before restarting your regimen to give your skin enough healing time.

      "content": "Apply a warm compress to the affected area 3 to 4 times a day. A warm compress opens up your pores and helps free hair follicles of blockages. Apply one for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. Repeat this treatment 3 or 4 times every day to keep your pores open and allow blockages to work themselves out. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source There are many store-bought options for a warm compress, or you can make your own at home.

For example, if you use 1 cup (.24 l) of water, use the same amount of apple cider vinegar. Pour the mixture onto your hair after shampooing. Rinse out all the shampoo before applying the vinegar.
