      "content": "Ignore your dog's licking. If your dog is licking your skin for attention or affection, removing that reward may help curb this obsessive behavior. Don't scold your dog. Even a negative reaction is still, in your dog's mind, a reaction to their excessive licking behavior. Stop what you are doing, stand up, and leave the room when they engage in prolonged licking. This will help reinforce in your dog's mind that licking will not achieve these desired outcomes. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider medicating your dog. If your dog's licking is part of a larger separation anxiety, you may want to talk to your veterinarian about medication as an option for your pet. Clomipramine is often prescribed to pets with anxiety and obsessive compulsive tendencies. The medication helps to counteract obsessive compulsive behavior like licking. [7] X Research source Fluoxetine is another common medication prescribed to pets with anxiety. This medication treats canine compulsive disorder with relatively few side effects.

      "title": "Reinforce alternative behaviors.",
      "content": "Reinforce alternative behaviors. One way to help curb obsessive behavior like licking is to reinforce a different, incompatible behavior. An incompatible behavior in this situation would be any activity that occupies your dog's mouth and keeps them from licking you. Start a game of fetch or tug-of-war as soon as they begin licking. This will distract them from whatever anxiety was causing the obsessive licking, and you will make it physically difficult for them to lick you while playing with a toy. [9] X Research source Try taking your dog for a walk whenever they lick you. This may condition them to lick you whenever they need to go out, and it may become less of a compulsive behavior."

      "content": "Reward your dog's good behavior. If your dog is licking you because they want your attention, then give it to them while they are behaving appropriately. Rewarding good behavior should take place immediately after your dog has acted responsibly, in order to maximize their association of that action with your reward. Rewarding your dog in this manner will teach them that calm, “normal” behavior is desirable. [11] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Try playing a game where you let your dog catch you, then give them a treat right before they stick out its tongues to lick you. It can be tricky to get the timing right, but if you do this enough, your dog will stop licking you. [12] X Expert Source Elisabeth Weiss Professional Dog Trainer Expert Interview. 3 September 2020."

      "title": "Train your dog to lick on command.",
      "content": "Train your dog to lick on command. This will help teach your dog that licking is only acceptable when you initiate it. Choose a word to initiate licking. It can be \"lick,\" \"kiss,\" or any other word you want your dog to associate with licking. Hold out your hand while saying the command word you've chosen. You can use a small dab of peanut butter on your hand to prompt licking in the early phases of training. However, this option should only be taken if you know your dog is not aggressive with food. Issue an end command, such as \"stop,\" \"no more,\" or \"no kiss.\" Wait to see if your dog responds on their own. If they stop licking, even for a few seconds, reward them. If not, repeat the command and move your hand away. Praise your dog when they lick and stops on command. Praising your dog's good behavior is crucial in training them to respond to your commands."

      "content": "Be consistent. If you want your dog to stop licking you, you must commit to stopping the behavior altogether. You cannot praise your dog for licking you one day and scold them for the same behavior the next. Doing so will only confuse your dog, making it harder for them to understand what you want from them. Remember, any type of training requires patience, dedication, and consistency. [13] X Research source"
