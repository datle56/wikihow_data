      "content": "There is no one, perfect way to find out if a girl thinks you're cute. Signs that one girl likes you may be a sign from another girl that she isn't interested. The only way to get around this is to spend time with a woman. The better you know her, the better you'll be able to read her and figure out if she thinks you're cute. Shy girls often stay quiet, avoid eye contact, or maintain some distance, especially if they like a boy and are nervous he might find out. [1] X Research source Louder, outgoing girls may act friendly or flirty with everyone, making it harder to see who they actually think is cute. The more you know her, however, the more you'll see how she treats the ones she really admires."

      "content": "If you can spend time alone, this is always going to be best. You cannot tell if a girl is into you if you're always off on your own, or if you're trying to judge her from afar. You need to spend quality time with her, even if it is just casual, to see how she treats you. Sit down next to her in class or at lunch, or join her games at recess. Any time spent nearby will help show you how she feels. Invite her to group events, where the pressure to be together or romantic is low and you can casually see how she feels by her response to the invitation."

      "content": "A big indicator of attraction is how she responds to conversations. Is she looking away, making up reasons to leave, or sitting silently whenever you're not talking? If so, chances are good she is not interested in you. However, if you give a pause or lull in the conversation and after a second or two of silence and she reengages you by asking you a question such as “where are you from?” “How about you? Do you like xyz?”, that is a sign that she wants to keep the interaction going on between you two and see where the vibe is headed unwinds. This is an important precursor to her thinking you’re cute."

      "content": "Body language is a great way to gauge how someone might feel about you. It's not the only way to see if someone thinks you're cute, but some good signs include: Touching you, especially on the arms or back. Smiling frequently at you. Turning and facing you during conversations especially in group settings. Agreeing frequently, showing that she enjoys similar things. [2] X Research source Making eye contact. Reader Poll: We asked 1872 wikiHow readers to tell us what the clearest indicator was that a girl liked them, and 51% said prolonged eye contact. [Take Poll] Every girl is different (and you shouldn’t assume she likes you unless she says so), but this could be a strong sign that she’s interested!"

      "title": "Teasing is one of the best ways to subtly see where her heart is at.",
      "content": "Teasing is one of the best ways to subtly see where her heart is at. You never want to be mean, but making jokes, having small, competitive challenges in class, at recess, or at work, and slightly making fun of her for mistakes is classic flirting. If she engages back, teasing and joking with you, there is a good chance she thinks you're cute. Note, however, that some people are shy and don't show their affection this way. If she doesn't joke or tease back, but still smiles and seems interested, she might still think you're cute."

      "title": "Observe whether the girl pays more attention to you or her friends.",
      "content": "Observe whether the girl pays more attention to you or her friends. If it is friends, then you know she isn't crushing on you, but if she pays more attention to you, then you know that she is crushing on you. She may try to impress you, make lots of jokes, or spend most of her time talking to you. She also may be quiet but attentive. If she doesn't smile or talk a lot, but makes eye contact, listens to you really intently, and doesn't try to get an opportunity to leave, this is a very good sign."

Know, however, that this can quickly turn into a rumor that leaves all of your friends asking \"do you have a crush on her?\" Only ask trusted friends their advice, and keep it to a minimum.

Be a gentleman by listening to her when she talks and offering to help her out when possible. She may not think you're cute now, but with simple, easy gestures like holding the door open or asking how she is doing each morning you can give her a great impression to remember you by."

      "content": "The only way to really know if she thinks you're cute is to let her know you find her cute. This may be the most terrifying-sounding action in the world, but that doesn't make it any less important. This doesn't have to be a grand, enormous profession of love. In fact, it shouldn't be -- it should be casual and lighthearted. Let her know \"I think you're cute,\" give a light smile, and move on if she rejects you. More likely than not, however, this little complement will open her up to say how she feels as well."
