      "content": "Notice the gaps between numbers. Unlike an ordinary ruler, the numbers on a slide rule scale aren't spaced on an even, linear scale. Instead, the numbers are spaced using a special \"logarithmic\" formula, closer together on one side than the other. This lets you line up the scales to get the answer to multiplication problems, as described below."

      "title": "Look for scale labels.",
      "content": "Look for scale labels. Each scale on the slide rule should have a letter or symbol identifying it, printed to the left or right. This guide will assume your slide rule uses the most common notation: [1] X Research source The C and D scales each look like a single stretched out ruler, reading from left to right. These are called \"single decade\" scales. The A and B scales are \"double decade\" scales. Each one has two smaller stretched rulers stacked end-to-end. The K scale is a triple decade scale, or three stretched rulers stacked end-to-end. Not all models have this. The C| and D| scales are the same as the C and D scales, but read right to left. These are often printed in red. Not all models have these. Note that slide rules vary, so the scales marked \"C\" and \"D\" on your slide rule may not be the same as those described here. One some slide rules the scales used for multiplication are marked \"A\" and \"B\" and are on the top. Whatever the designating letter, these scales often have the Pi symbol marked at the suitable place and are almost always the two scales opposing each other on the slides, either the upper or lower gap. It is suggested you try a few simple multiplication problems to verify that you are using the correct scale as described in the article. If \"2x4\" doesn't come to \"8\", try the scales on the other side of the slide rule instead."

Take a look at the vertical lines of the C or D scale, and get used to reading them: [2] X Research source The primary numbers on the scale begin with 1 on the extreme left edge, extend up to 9, then end with another 1 on the far right edge. These are usually all labeled. The secondary divisions, marked by the second-tallest vertical lines, divide each primary number by 0.1. Don't be confused if these are labeled \"1, 2, 3;\" remember they actually represent \"1.1, 1.2, 1.3\" and so on. There are usually smaller divisions, typically representing increments of 0.02. Pay close attention, since these may disappear on the high end of the scale, where numbers get closer together."

Slide rules are used for quick calculations, not for purposes that require extreme precision. For instance, if the answer falls between the 6.51 and 6.52 marks, write down whichever value it's closer to. If you can't tell, write 6.515."

Line the cursor up with the second number in your multiplication problem, on the C scale. The cursor will point to the answer to your problem on the D scale. [5] X Research source If it can't slide that far, go to the next step. Example 1: slide the cursor so it points to 3 on the C scale. At this position it should also point to 7.8 on the D scale, or extremely close to it. Skip ahead to the estimation step . Example 2: try to slide the cursor so it points to the 9 on the C scale.

Slide the C scale so the right index , or the 1 on the extreme right end, is located over the larger factor in the multiplication problem. Slide the cursor to the location of the other factor on the C scale, and read the answer on the D scale. Example 2: slide the C scale so the 1 on the far right lines up with the 9 on the D scale.

No matter what multiplication you try, your answer will always be read off the D scale, which only displays numbers from one to ten. You'll need to use some estimation and mental math to determine where to put the decimal point in your actual answer. Example 1: Our original problem was 260 x 0.3, and the slide rule gave us an answer of 7.8. Round the original problem to convenient numbers and solve it in your head: 250 x 0.5 = 125. This is much closer to 78 than it is to 780 or 7.8, so the answer is 78 . Example 2: Our original problem was 410 x 9, and we read an answer of 3.69 on the slide rule. Estimate the original problem as 400 x 10 = 4,000. The closest we can get to that by moving the decimal point is 3,690 , so that must be the actual answer."

[6] X Research source Just like a multiplication problem, you'll need to determine the position of the decimal point yourself. For example, to solve 6.1 2 , slide the cursor to 6.1 on the D scale. The corresponding A value is about 3.75. Estimate 6.1 2 to 6 x 6 = 36. Position the decimal point to get an answer near this value: 37.5 . Note that the exact answer is 37.21. The slide rule answer is off by less than 1%, easily accurate enough for most real-world circumstances."

Similarly, the K scale, which is a D scale shrunk to 1/3 scale, lets you find the cubes. Simply slide the cursor to a D value and read the result on the K scale. Use estimation to place the decimal. [7] X Research source For example, to solve 130 3 , slide the cursor to 1.3 on the D value. The corresponding K value is 2.2. Since 100 3 = 1 x 10 6 , and 200 3 = 8 x 10 6 , we know the answer must be somewhere between them. The answer must be 2.2 x 10 6 , or 2,200,000 ."

However, since the A scale is printed twice, you'll have to decide which one to use first. To do so, follow these rules: If the exponent in your scientific notation is even (such as 2 in Example 3), use the left side of the A scale (the \"first decade\"). If the exponent in your scientific notation is odd, (such as 3 in Example 4), use the right side of the A scale (the \"second decade\")."

The original number in scientific notation had 10 2 . 2 is already even, so just divide by 2 to get 1. The final answer is 1.975 x 10 1 = 19.75 . Example 4: The corresponding D value at A=7.1 is about 8.45. The original number in scientific notation had 10 3 , so round the 3 down to the nearest even number, 2, then divide by 2 to get 1.

      "content": "Use a similar process on the K scale to find cube roots. The process for finding cube roots is very similar. The most important step is determining which of the three K scales to use. To do this, divide the number of digits in your number by three and find the remainder. If the remainder is 1, use the first scale. If 2, use the second scale. If 3, use the third scale. (Another way to accomplish this is to repeatedly count from the first scale to the third, until you reach the number of digits in your answer.) [11] X Research source Example 5: To find the cube root of 74,000, first count the number of digits (5), divide by 3 and find the remainder (1 remainder 2). Since the remainder is 2, use the second scale. (Alternatively, count the scales five times: 1–2–3–1– 2 .) Slide the cursor to 7.4 on the second K scale. The corresponding D value is approximately 4.2. Since 10 3 is smaller than 74,000, but 100 3 is larger than 74,000, the answer must be in between 10 and 100. Move the decimal point to make 42 ."
