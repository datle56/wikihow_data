      "content": "Blot it dry. Don't entirely dry your hair; just blot it gently with a soft towel, making sure it's no longer dripping wet."

    {
      "title": "Apply gel.",
      "content": "Apply gel. Any type of strong-hold hair gel will do. Use a liberal amount toward the top and front of your hair, where the finger waves will be, and spread a smaller amount throughout the rest of your hair."
    },
    {
      "title": "Part your hair.",
      "content": "Part your hair. Use a fine-toothed comb to create a deep part on one side. Extend it back further than you normally would, so it almost reaches the crown of your head. Make sure it's nice and straight."

      "title": "Comb your hair forward on the bigger side of the part.",
      "content": "Comb your hair forward on the bigger side of the part. Leave the other side of the part, the smaller side, untouched for now. Comb your hair straight forward on the larger side."

      "content": "Place your forefinger parallel to the part and press down. You want to align your finger with the part and press down to keep the hair right next to the part in place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Comb the hair next to your finger back.",
      "content": "Comb the hair next to your finger back. This is a little tricky. Keep your finger firmly in place, so that the hair underneath it stays in its forward-combed position. Now take the comb and use it to comb the hair right next to your finger backward, so it's going in the opposite direction of the hair under your forefinger."
    },
    {
      "title": "Position your middle finger next to your forefinger.",
      "content": "Position your middle finger next to your forefinger. You're using your middle finger to hold the hair right next to your forefinger in place."

      "content": "Pinch the two fingers together and secure the hair with a metal wave clamp. The hair that lifts between your fingers is going to become a finger wave. Hold it in place with one of the metal wave clamps. The clamp should run parallel to your part."

    {
      "title": "Make more waves.",
      "content": "Make more waves. Comb the hair right next to the clamp forward, and hold it there with your forefinger. Comb the hair next to your forefinger backward, and hold it there with your middle finger. Pinch your fingers together and secure the hair that lifts between them with a metal wave clamp. Keep making waves until you've created waves down the top of your ear."

      "title": "Wave the hair on the other side of the part.",
      "content": "Wave the hair on the other side of the part. Do the same thing to the other side, using your fingers and the clamps to create waves all the way to the top of your ear."

      "title": "Let your hair dry.",
      "content": "Let your hair dry. Your hair should completely dry in the clamps. Don't take them out while your hair is still wet, or the waves will fall out."

      "title": "Consider the rest of your hair.",
      "content": "Consider the rest of your hair. The finger wave is typically only done to either side of the front of the hair. The rest of your hair should also be styled to create a polished look. Choose one of these options: If you have long hair, create soft curls . After you've put the clamps in and while your hair is still damp, roll the rest of your hair up in curlers. Do a bob. If your hair is short, you can curl the rest of it under using a few large curlers. Make a chignon . This is a pretty way to style your hair, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the clamps.",
      "content": "Remove the clamps. Gently un-clamp them to reveal your new finger waves. If your hair is totally dry, they should stay in place. If you put curlers in your hair, take those out as well. Don't comb your hair or the waves will get loose."
