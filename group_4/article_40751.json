      "content": "Determine what kind of publisher you will be. Publishing companies and entities tend to fall into one of five categories, and knowing which category your company will fall under can help you plan out your business. Trade publishers are publishing companies that deal with industry-specific publications. This category includes the major, well-established publishing houses that put out the majority of fiction in the marketplace. [1] X Research source Textbook publishers primarily deal with academic learning materials. Books published by textbook publishing companies will be primarily bought and used by students. [2] X Research source Scholarly/academic publishers tend to include university presses and not-for-profit publishers. Although this category is lumped in with academic publications, scholarly/academic publishers do not typically publish textbooks. [3] X Research source Reference publishers put out books and other learning materials that build on a body of information. The most common example of a reference publication is a dictionary or thesaurus, but can include many other non-traditional forms of information dissemination. [4] X Research source Self-publishers are authors who choose to take the reigns on how their own work is published. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a market.",
      "content": "Choose a market. There are many existing book publishers, small and large, in operation around the world. The key to success as you think about starting your own publishing company is to decide upon a primary genre and corresponding market for your books. Knowing what market you intend to work in will help you when it comes time to draft a business model. Try to start out with a narrow focus. It's best to work within one or two primary genres or markets. If you try to start too big, it may be difficult to manage your company, and potential authors may lose interest if it seems as though the company lacks direction. Consider working in a market you know. If you have any kind of background in a given market, whether it's through formal education, work or intern experience, or even personal interest, you may find your business more successful in than market than if you tried to jump into unfamiliar waters. You will likely be more dedicated to and passionate about your business working in a market you're familiar with, and you will bring some level of knowledge or familiarity to the table."

      "title": "Understand your audience.",
      "content": "Understand your audience. This is where working in a familiar market can be exceptionally helpful, and may take some planning if you're working in an unfamiliar market. Think about trade publications. The publishers of those publications know what the intended audience will want to read and learn about, and the publishers also know where potential readers look for that information. Tapping into that kind of knowledge may drastically improve the chances of success, and could even give you some contacts as you launch your publishing company. A good question to ask yourself is, as someone who is interested in a given subject, would you want to read this? You can also expand on this question to consider what other things someone with a shared interest would want to read."

If you have a marketing and/or legal team, consult with those workers on a list of names you come up with. It should be easily marketable yet unique and memorable."

      "content": "Register your name. If you're using a name for your publishing company other than your own name, you'll need to be sure that that name is not already taken. One way to do this is by filing a fictitious business name statement, or a doing business as (DBA) name. [6] X Research source The process may vary slightly, depending on where you live, but the process will entail certain key points no matter where you plan on setting up your business. Conduct an investigative inquiry within your county and state records to determine if the name you've chosen is in use. [7] X Research source Register your publishing company's name with the appropriate regional office. This may be your county clerk or state government office, depending on the location of your business. Some regional governments may require you to take out a legal notice in an approved newspaper, usually for one month or less, to announce your business's name to the public and ensure that no one comes forward saying that they are already using that name.

      "content": "Buy an ISBN. ISBN stands for International Standard Book Number, usually included with the bar code on virtually every single book sold through a bookstore. [9] X Research source Expect to spend around $125-150 in the United States on your ISBN, though discounts usually exist for publishers who purchase ISBNs in bulk quantities. [10] X Research source ISBNs are important because they help buyers and sellers identify your publishing business as the publisher of a given book. [11] X Research source ISBNs used to be assigned as 10-digit numbers, but in 2007 the format of ISBNs was changed to adopt a 13-digit number. After the first three digits, an ISBN is typically broken up into four sets of numbers. The first single digit identifies the language of a given book. Zero is used for most publications in English. [12] X Research source After the language digit comes a multi-digit set of numbers called the publisher identification number. This group of digits is your publishing company's unique identification number. Note that small publishing companies tend to have long identification numbers, which means that, due to the limitation on how many digits an ISBN may be, smaller publishers will be able to publish fewer titles under a given ISBN than larger publishing houses. Once a small publishing company has published its allotted number of titles under a given ISBN, that company must then purchase additional ISBNs. [13] X Research source Immediately after the publisher's identification number comes the title identification number. This number or group of numbers identifies the book title by its edition or version. Different editions will require different ISBN title identification numbers. [14] X Research source The last digit in an ISBN is called a check number. It is calculated by a precise algorithm [15] X Research source and is used to check (hence the name) that the ISBN was coded correctly. [16] X Research source"

There are a few business-related decisions you should make before you open up your publishing company, such as how many books you will publish each year, how you will budget your company's finances, and how you will advertise and market your publishing company. Adequate planning in this phase of starting up your company may be crucial in determining whether your venture into publishing is successful. Be realistic when planning your budget. Try to keep overhead costs to a minimum, and understand what kind of taxes you should expect to be paying, if you are taxed as a small business."

You'll want to start small, as most established authors already have publishers and editors. You can find authors by reaching out to a previously-unpublished writer whose work you admire, but putting out an open call for manuscript submissions allows you to select from a broader pool of writers. Choose a website or print periodical that is primarily marketed toward writers. You can try different sources, such as the Association of Writers & Writing Programs (AWP), New Pages, [17] X Research source and Poets & Writers, [18] X Research source just to name a few. Determine the scope of your call for submissions. Decide upon a submission period, and estimate when interested authors can expect to hear back from you on their work. Specify what genre(s) and/or subgenre(s) you are interested in publishing. If you are accepting from multiple genres, specify any genres or subgenres you are not interested in. Think about opening the reading period as a contest, rather than an open call. In a contest, an author typically submits his work and pays a submission fee. That submission fee may be used to off-set the cost of publication."

Duties may include reading submissions, contacting authors of interest, and arranging contract details.

Printed books have stood the test of time, but digital books allow convenience, reduce the cost to consumers, and allow for updates as they come out.
