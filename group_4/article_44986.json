      "content": "Learn to be open and vulnerable. Part of what happens when trust is broken is that people build walls and become harder and more distant. This is often necessary, but when you find someone you care about, you should let yourself be vulnerable. Being open with your new partner can give you the opportunity to build a wonderful new relationship.

      "content": "Question mistrustful thoughts. When you find yourself not trusting someone, stop and analyze those thoughts. Ask yourself why you are having these thoughts.
