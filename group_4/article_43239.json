      "title": "Check around your bird's eyes and beak for any crusty looking areas.",
      "content": "Check around your bird's eyes and beak for any crusty looking areas. Mites affect your bird by burrowing into their skin, often in the area around their eyes and beak. This is known as an infestation of Knemidokoptes pilae, or burrowing face mites. In the early stages of this infestation, the mites are barely visible and will not affect the overall condition of your bird, but you may notice crusty plaques on or near your bird's eyes or beak. [1] X Research source These bright white deposits will become thicker and more crusty as the mites continue to burrow. The upper area of your bird's face may appear to have deep burrows or holes, as the mites will dig tunnels or paths in your bird's skin. The skin around your bird's eyes and beak may eventually appear cavernous or full of thick, deep tunnels that appear crusty and irritated."

      "content": "Examine your bird's legs for scaly, irritated skin. Mites can also affect your bird's legs, known as scaly leg mites or Knemidokoptes mutans . The mites will burrow into the skin of your bird's legs and lay eggs inside your bird's skin. As a result, your bird's legs may appear very dry, swollen, scaly, or show white deposits that may turn crusty. [2] X Research source This is caused by irritating metabolites released by the mites.

      "title": "Watch to see if your bird is restless at night or preens excessively.",
      "content": "Watch to see if your bird is restless at night or preens excessively. Mites come out to feed at night, so your bird may be very restless or irritated during the night as a result of bites from the mites. Ornithologist Dr. Roger Lederer also warns that your bird may be restless or appear to scratch or bite their skin. Your bird may also groom or preen himself excessively, though the mites cannot be removed by grooming or preening. Some birds may rub up against the cage in an effort to remove mites or scratch hard-to-reach spots."

      "title": "Watch for labored breathing, coughing, or sneezing.",
      "content": "Watch for labored breathing, coughing, or sneezing. Sternostoma tracheacolum mites can also burrow and infest your bird's trachea, air sacs, bronchi or sinuses, resulting in symptoms like coughing, sneezing, or difficulty breathing. Your bird may also start to open-mouth breathe, almost as if they're gasping for air. [4] X Research source Your bird may also experience weight loss due to the mite infestation, and may make clicking sounds or have a change in vocal sounds as a result of mites burrowed in his respiratory system."

    {
      "title": "Look for any feather damage or feather loss.",
      "content": "Look for any feather damage or feather loss. Lederer also says that your bird may have noticeable feather damage, with missing patches of feathers or piles of feathers in his cage. This is as a result of excessive preening or cleaning by your bird in an attempt to remove the mites from their skin."

      "title": "Examine your bird's head and legs at night for swarms of mites.",
      "content": "Examine your bird's head and legs at night for swarms of mites. Since mites are nocturnal, they will reproduce during the day and feed at night. Use a flashlight to check your bird's head and legs for any crawling mites during the night. They may appear as small, red or black spots or specks, like pepper flakes that move and burrow close to your bird's skin. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Check for clusters of small red spots in your bird's cage.",
      "content": "Check for clusters of small red spots in your bird's cage. Mites are very small—about 1 mm (0.039 in) in length—and are semi transparent until they ingest blood. They then turn bright red or black. [6] X Research source One way to identify a mite infestation is to check your bird's cage for clusters of small red or black spots. Watch them to see if they move after 5 minutes, as mites are mobile and tend to crawl around looking for their host. Examine places where your bird spends most of their time, like perches, nesting spots, or the food dish."

      "title": "Check your own body for mites or signs of mites.",
      "content": "Check your own body for mites or signs of mites. Your bird can transfer mites to you very easily, and you may experience symptoms of a mite infestation as you care and live with your bird. You may have raised or reddish bites on your body, especially in areas that come into contact with your bird, like your hands. [7] X Research source Mite bites cause irritation and itchiness, but don't transmit any diseases. However, you may experience a secondary infection caused by itching irritated skin."

      "title": "Take note of any crawling sensations at night when you are in bed.",
      "content": "Take note of any crawling sensations at night when you are in bed. You may also experience feelings of tiny movement or crawling sensations on your skin at night, as this is when mites come out to feed. [8] X Research source Keep in mind mites can feed on humans, but they will not live on humans, as they cannot complete their life cycle via a human host."

      "title": "Bring your bird to the vet to be examined and diagnosed.",
      "content": "Bring your bird to the vet to be examined and diagnosed. Mites may not be visible on your bird during the daytime, but your vet can analyze other symptoms like those listed above, and confirm an infestation. Bring your bird in a clean carrying cage, and also consider bringing an object from the cage in a sealed plastic bag for your vet to inspect, like bedding or a perch. Bring each bird in your house for inspection. Your vet will likely treat each bird, since mites are contagious."

      "title": "Ask for a prescription according to your bird's needs.",
      "content": "Ask for a prescription according to your bird's needs. The most effective medications for mites are prescribed by vets, and will need to be dosed specifically for your bird's body weight and breed, so always use a prescribed medication to treat mites. Your vet will likely prescribe a topical treatment or possibly injections, like a pyrethrin spray, to help treat the mite infestation on your bird. [9] X Research source Over-the-counter mite medications may not provide long-term treatment of the infestation and may not be effective for your bird. You will also need to schedule follow-up appointments with your vet to ensure the mites have been eradicated from your bird. If it's not possible to see the vet, look for Avimec (Ivermectin), Scatt (Moxidectin) or other topical treatments available to purchase at pet shops or online. [10] X Research source Follow the dosage instructions on the packaging carefully."

      "title": "Bathe your bird to bring temporary relief.",
      "content": "Bathe your bird to bring temporary relief. Provide your bird with a shallow dish of lukewarm, non-chlorinated water, or spritz them with lukewarm water, to help them bathe . Do not use any products containing soaps, chemicals, or any other ingredients (even vinegar), which may irritate their skin. [11] X Research source Note that bathing alone will not get rid of mites, but may offer your bird some relief during treatment."

      "title": "Thoroughly clean, or replace, your bird's cage and toys.",
      "content": "Thoroughly clean, or replace, your bird's cage and toys. Once the problem is diagnosed and being treated, keep your bird in a clean, spare cage, away from any infestations in their regular cage. Clean their regular cage thoroughly, disassembling it and scrubbing it with dish soap. [12] X Research source Then, rinse and dry it, and move your bird back in once their treatment is finished. After, spray the cage with a prescribed, bird-friendly ivermectin spray or pyrethrin spray. Dispose of any wooden or porous toys, like perches or nest boxes, in an outdoor garbage can, as these are likely infested beyond rescue."

      "title": "Avoid using mite protectors, which can be dangerous.",
      "content": "Avoid using mite protectors, which can be dangerous. Mite protectors are often found in pet stores and online, and claim to prevent or control mite infestations. But they're typically ineffective, and often contain paradichlorobenzene, or mothballs, which can be harmful to you and your bird. [13] X Research source Mite protectors may be linked to liver damage, respiratory tract problems, depression and increased risk of some cancers. Instead, consider using a dehumidifier in your bird's room. Mites enjoy humid spaces, so running a dehumidifier can discourage infestations."

      "content": "Consider hiring an exterminator to remove mites from your home. Some pest control companies are qualified to treat bird mites in your home. If the infestation is extensive, consider hiring an exterminator sooner than later so the infestation does not get any worse. [14] X Research source Some companies will inspect your home free of charge and give you an estimate of the extermination. Look for a pest control company that specializes in bird mites as they will use the correct chemicals to remove the mites and prevent another infestation. Access a database of qualified exterminators to find one. Note that mites need bird blood to survive, so once your bird is treated, they often die off naturally."
