      "content": "Facebook no longer tells you when someone sees your invite. It used to be possible to see whether someone you invited to an event had seen the invite, even if they hadn't responded yet. At some point in 2023, Facebook removed this feature. While you can't see if someone viewed the event anymore, you can still see whether they're going, are interested, or can't go as long as they've RSVPed. It can be easy to miss an event invitation. If your friend hasn't RSVP'd to an event yet, you might want to message them to let them know you've invited them."
