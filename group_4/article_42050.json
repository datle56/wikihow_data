      "content": "He’ll be touched that you noticed and remembered what he likes. You can get a lot of ideas by watching what he says, does and has conversations about—not only with you but with others as well. Keep an eye on what he orders at restaurants, the things he does for fun and what he watches on TV. Listen when he mentions something he really enjoys while you two are out or when cuddling together. Find out what makes him smile."

      "content": "Write down your ideas about what you know or think he likes. Try to write as many as possible so you will have a lot of ideas to choose from for future surprises as well. Writing ideas down will probably help lead to other ideas you should also write down."

      "content": "Something that your boyfriend enjoys may not be enjoyable for you. For example, you buy you and your partner tickets for a football game just because you know he enjoys it and wants to spend time with you—even though you may not like football or crowds. It’s ok sometimes to make reasonable sacrifices so you two can share an experience together that he may happen to like a lot more than you. Hopefully, he will return the favor one day and surprise you the same way. [1] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Relationship Advisor Expert Interview. 6 April 2021."

      "content": "Going the extra mile can really make a difference. Just buying something pre-made on Valentine's Day, for example, because it is expected won’t be as meaningful as something unexpected. If you can create a gift or experience that will be unique for just the two of you, that would be ideal. This is your chance to really show (rather than just say) how much the other person means to you. [2] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Relationship Advisor Expert Interview. 6 April 2021. The action that you take to create the surprise is actually less important than the idea that you want to introduce something unexpected or new. This is what creates the rush that makes the surprise so powerful. [3] X Research source Know that your surprise does not have to be big or expensive. Little things can be meaningful too. Just make sure your boyfriend isn’t able to predict that you are going to do it."

      "content": "Guys always appreciate gifts out of the blue. If there is something you know he has had his eye on, like a game or some sports gear, go out and buy it for him. If you do not know of anything he specifically wants or if that item is out of your budget, surprise him with something affordable that you know he will still enjoy, like a book or DVD about something he's interested in. If you're too young for big gifts or any of these other treats, slip a little note into his locker at school, or decorate his locker when he isn't around. Big surprise! The less you treat your gift like a big deal, the more awesome it will seem. If you give it to him and say, \"No big deal, just thought of you,\" he'll be blown away. Guaranteed."

If you're not super-into what he's super-into, it's still good to go together. Doing this shows that you're interested in him, even if you're not interested in watching pro wrestling. Go along and decide to have a good time anyway. Alternatively, plan a boys-night for him. Buy him and his friend some concert or game tickets and send them off for the night.

If you want to surprise your boyfriend, wait for his day off, then tell him that he gets to make all the decisions for the entire day. Let him be in charge. Give him a day off from doing any chores, or planning anything yourself. Go out of your way to keep him relaxed. Let him plan things out. If he wants to go out, then go out.

      "content": "You know the saying: the way to a guy's heart is through his stomach. It's probably true for many people, though, guy or gal. Preparing his favorite dinner is a nice treat no matter how long the two of you have been going out. If the relationship is new and you have never cooked for him before, inviting him over for a home-cooked meal will be a nice surprise, regardless of what you make. Then you can cook him breakfast in bed the next morning. Plan a picnic lunch, or make reservations at his favorite restaurant. Eating in is nice, but every once in a while, going to a restaurant he really enjoys can demonstrate just as much consideration. Go on a snack tour of his favorite food in town. Visit every local brewery to let him sample the local beers (you drive), or check out the fried pickles at every local barbecue place. Pick something you know he loves and hit up all the places. Plan out the routes. Surprise him with lunch at work. Even if he is too busy to eat it with you, making the extra effort on your part will be a sweet surprise and an effective way to show him how much you think of him even when you are not physically together."

Planning out something super-elaborate, like a scavenger hunt for relationship-mementos, could come off as corny to some guys. But things that seem kind of lame to you may get him feeling the big feelings. Try out the following for a little treat: Borrow his car and put gas in it. Ask to watch an action movie he loves. Make him a huge sandwich while he's watching TV. Clean up his place for him."

      "content": "Don’t underestimate how much guys like to eat and drink. If you're going to throw a surprise party, get the dude-food in hand. Figure out what he likes best and provide those drinks and refreshments. If your guy's a meat and potatoes kind of guy, plan a backyard barbecue. Get a friend of his who is good on the grill to make up some brats or grill some ribs, and make sure to get enough for everyone. If your guy prefers healthy food, plan out a trip to a local spot he hasn't tried yet. Make reservations for all of his friends, buy him a full tasting menu, and plan the meet-up."

You can wish him a happy birthday to avoid letting his mood sink too low, but do not give away any hints to suggest that you have a roomful of his favorite people, food and gifts waiting for him back home. Alternatively, you can also plan a surprise party for an occasion that does not usually get a party. A promotion, for instance, is an exciting life event that is not always celebrated formally, but you can surprise him by planning a party to celebrate his accomplishment."

If your boyfriend has a strong relationship with his parents, feel free to reach out to them, along with any other close relatives. It doesn't have to be a big party.

It will make a nice surprise welcome home for him, especially if you know that he has had a long or frustrating day. You do not necessarily need to wear something skimpy. Anything that makes you look your best will show that you put some extra effort into surprising him. Just make sure that he is alone when he comes through the door. If not, it could get awkward. Better yet: Forget about the door. Wait for him in the bedroom."

If you know this is something that might embarrass your guy or make him feel uncomfortable, then just don’t overdo it. If dirty-talking makes you feel awkward, try asking him to talk dirty to you.

Getting a dirty text is one of the best kinds of surprises. Let him know what you plan on doing with him later. Be careful with pictures. If you're in a committed relationship and you trust your boyfriend, that's one thing. If you're just texting someone you don’t know that well or someone who may turn around and use your pictures against you if you break up, think twice."

      "content": "Learning more about your partner's fantasies is a great way to get closer and become more intimate. You don't want to risk throwing some wild and kinky thing at him in the bedroom, only for him to turn up his nose. Always talk to him about what he wants to do, and try your best to be open-minded. Don't do anything that makes you uncomfortable. Him wanting to do something doesn't mean you have to do it to surprise him. Be honest with him in return. Besides, just having the fantasy-talk can sometimes be hot enough to spice it up."
