Make sure the towel isn’t too tight around the bird, and keep a loose grip on it. Toweling the bird helps them safe and secure. Make sure you gently fold the wing you’re not working on against their body. If you don’t have a towel of the right size, you can use a sock or t-shirt."

      "title": "Remove the feather carefully with a pair of pliers.",
      "content": "Remove the feather carefully with a pair of pliers. Removing feathers is very delicate work. You can accidentally break the bird’s bones or cause them more harm. Have someone hold your bird while you use a pair of pliers or hemostats to grip the feather. Get as close to the skin as possible and grab the feather shaft above the break. Secure the wing against the surface of your work area, and pull with a quick, firm yank. The end of the feather should have a rounded bulbous end if you removed the entire feather shaft. Coating the feathers with water before you remove it can help you move the feathers and find the broken one. Use a cotton swab to coat the feathers in water. If you don’t think you can remove the feather from the follicle, stop the bleeding until you get your bird to the vet."
