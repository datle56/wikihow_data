      "content": "Decide if you didn’t do something but wanted to. Sometimes you may feel guilty because you contemplated doing something that violates your personal morals. Even if you didn’t act on it, you may feel guilty for even considering it. If you’re feeling guilty for no obvious reason, you might have considered doing something you believe is wrong, but quickly pushed it out of your mind. The guilt might have stayed even though the thought left. [2] X Research source You might have forgotten the immoral thing you considered doing, such as cheating on your spouse or stealing from your friend. Sit and think about it to recall if you did want to do something like this. If you did have a thought like this, take a moment to forgive yourself. Then ask the person you thought about doing wrong against to forgive you. After you have made amends, let it go by not blaming yourself and focusing on the present. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Evaluate yourself for thinking you did something wrong. Sometimes we feel guilty for thinking we did something wrong when we didn’t actually do anything. For example, maybe you wished something bad would happen to your ex’s new partner, and then they got in a car accident. Even though you didn’t actually do anything, you can feel like you caused their accident. If you feel guilt for no apparent reason, perhaps you thought you did something wrong and then forgot about it. [4] X Research source Try to remember if you have ever wished bad would happen to someone and then it did. If you can’t talk to that person, take measures to forgive yourself . Keep in mind that you may also be judging yourself too harshly. For example, you might be thinking that you said something rude or did something insulting, when in reality the other person does not think that at all."

Even if this is not something you think about every day, it can be a cause of constant guilt. Identify survivor’s guilt by noticing if you feel sad when you perceive that you are doing better in life than others. [5] X Research source For example, if you survived an armed robbery, then you might have guilt when hearing about someone who was killed in an armed robbery. If you feel guilty for surviving the robbery because someone else did not, then you might have survivor's guilt. If you identify survivor’s guilt in yourself, you need to take some time to process your negative emotions and forgive yourself. Talk to someone about what happened, such as a psychologist."

If you’ve looked at these techniques and you still feel guilty, maybe you need to admit there is a real reason you feel guilty. You may have forgotten about what you did. Sit down and think about your actions over the last few weeks and months to discover if you have done something wrong. This can explain why you feel guilty. [7] X Research source You may need to verbalize your thoughts through writing or talking to help you remember committing any wrongful acts. Write down your actions in a bullet list, or talk to a friend to help you remember. Maybe ask people who are close to you if they can remember you doing anything you should feel guilty about. If you can’t think of anything you did wrong, then you can stop giving in to the guilty feelings. Tell yourself that you did nothing wrong and focus on the present.

It is helpful to take a moment and do a reality check when you’re feeling mysterious guilt. The truth about what is happening around you can show you that it’s not your fault. In these cases, give yourself permission to let go of the guilt. [12] X Research source Perform a reality check by sitting down and considering what is truly happening, not what you imagine is happening. You might need the help of a friend or family member to help you see things the way they truly are. Ask someone to sit down with you and give their perspective. For example, if you usually are very organized and one day you miss an appointment, you should not feel guilty. You are allowed to make mistakes. Let go of guilt by recognizing your responsibility, expressing your sadness that the situation occurred, and focusing on the present. [13] X Research source"

To help yourself stop feeling guilty, take a moment to release yourself from your own judgements. Make a list of all the things you feel guilty about or recognize that you have judged yourself for. It could be as broad as telling yourself that you are a bad person, or as specific as telling yourself you are stupid for dropping your coffee this morning.

When that happens, imagine that you are pulling your car to the side of the road, identifying the source of the problem or guilt, and figuring out what you can do to fix it. [14] X Research source For example, if you feel guilt over something that you can fix, such as by apologizing to someone, then take some time to fix it. If there is nothing you can do to fix your car, then imagine yourself getting back on the road and driving straight ahead."

Since guilt usually indicates that you need punishment, you may be caught in a vicious cycle of internal punishment.

[15] X Research source Help yourself get out of the punishment mode by thinking about something you did correctly that day. For example, congratulate yourself for making it to the gym, making a healthy food choice, or spending time with your family when you didn’t have to. There are many ways to relax, such as practicing breathing exercises, meditating, visualization techniques, and so on.
