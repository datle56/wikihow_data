      "content": "Decide how much you’re willing to spend. You should purchase the highest quality birds that you can afford. It is better to purchase a smaller number of pairs of a higher quality, than a larger number of pairs of a lower quality. You should buy pigeons in pairs, unless you’re buying a very specific pigeon of a particular pedigree. If you’re buying the pigeons for the purpose of racing, base your buying decision on performance before anything else. This can include the performance of the specific pigeons you’re purchasing, the performance of the family line (i.e pedigree), or even the performance of the breed. [2] X Research source If you’re buying the pigeons for show purposes, or you just want really cool looking pigeons, then you’ll want to base your buying decision on conformation. For show purposes, judges pick winning pigeons based on a certain list of physical characteristics. [3] X Research source Homing pigeons can cost anywhere from approximately $50 up to several hundred dollars, depending on the pedigree and breeder. Keep in mind that in addition to the cost of the pigeons, you must also pay the cost of shipping. And because you’re shipping live animals, shipping can be quite expensive, depending on where you’re ordering from. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Build a home for your pigeons before they arrive.",
      "content": "Build a home for your pigeons before they arrive. Your pigeons are going to need a place to live the minute they arrive at your door, so be prepared. Pigeon homes are referred to as lofts and lofts can come in a variety of sizes and configurations. You can build your own, hire someone to build one for your, or order one pre-made. Each pair of pigeons should have approximately 8-10 cubic feet of space inside the loft - so the space you have available for a loft might also dictate the maximum number of pigeons you can have. [5] X Research source Some of the most important things to remember about a loft is that it should: protect your pigeons from predators (including the neighbourhood cat), have both interior and exterior (protected) space for the birds, have an excellent ventilation system, and have additional space for feed and equipment (you don’t want to store this stuff outside). If you’re breeding your pigeons, you will also need to separate out a space just for them and their eventual offspring. [6] X Research source Pigeon lofts need to be located in an area somewhat free of aerial obstructions. Remember, your pigeons fly, so wires, trees, lamp posts, etc., can be a distraction for your pigeons when you’re trying to train them. Racing pigeon lofts should be designed so the birds don’t spend a lot of time on the roof. This means the roof should not be flat, if possible, and might need bird spikes to help deter your pigeons from landing."

      "content": "Locate a breeder or seller and order your pigeons. Pigeon breeders and sellers are located around the world. If you’re concerned about the cost of shipping your pigeons, you’ll probably want to choose a breeder located as close to you as possible. Otherwise you’ll want to choose a breeder based on pigeon performance and pedigree. [7] X Research source [8] X Research source Most breeders band their pigeons when they’re young, so this is not something you’ll have to do once you receive your pigeon. [9] X Research source Ask for recommendations from a local pigeon club if you’re unsure as to the reputation of a breeder."

      "title": "Take good care of your pigeons.",
      "content": "Take good care of your pigeons. Your pigeons need clean water everyday. Their food should be consumed within 15-20 minutes of you giving it to them. After 15-20 minutes cleanup and remove anything they haven’t eaten. They’ll also need grit to ingest, which helps them obtain vitamin and minerals, and assists with digestion. [11] X Research source You’ll need to feed your pigeons (using the 15-20 minute technique) twice per day. Remember to clean your loft on a regular basis, especially the floor. There are several bird-specific online stores located around the United States that specialize in pigeon care. Their level of experience will be helpful if you’re new to the world of pigeons. Pigeons will require more protein if they’re breeding, but more energy (i.e. fat and carbohydrates) when they are racing. The protein amounts contained in the feed should be listed on the bag. For breeding season you should feed them a 16-18% crude protein mix. For racing and training season you should feed them a 14-15% crude protein mix. When you pigeons are molting, in the off season, you’ll want to feed them the 16% crude protein mix again. While all veterinarians have learned to care for birds as part of their training, not all veterinarians will take care of birds on a regular basis. If you already have a vet whom you trust, and they feel confident they can treat your pigeons, great. If not, ask for recommendations or referrals to a bird-specific vet in your area. You can also ask for referrals from a local pigeon racing club, or pigeon rescue organization."

      "content": "Start your pigeons’ training program when they’re 6 weeks old. At 6 weeks you can help your pigeons figure out the trapdoor in your pigeon loft. The trapdoor is designed to allow your pigeons to get into the loft anytime they want, but you’ll be able to set the trapdoor to only let them out when you want. These trapdoors might be a little confusing to your pigeons at first, so you might have to help them go in and out at first. [12] X Research source It may be helpful to put together a training schedule so you have something specific to follow everyday. Training requires dedication on your part, so knowing what you have to be ready for each day will help keep the training consistent. The training schedule should allow for training to occur at least once a day, and either the method or distance being worked on should change once a week. For example: everyday during week 1 practice going in and out of the trap door with the pigeon; everyday during week 2 practice returning to the loft from 1 mile away; etc. Read pigeon club blogs - specifically ones written from your geographical area. Local blogs will have advice on your specific geography and climate."

      "content": "Expand the training distance by 5 miles per week. Each week go further away from home to release your pigeons, and go in different directions each time. [15] X Research source Don’t expand the distance too far, too fast. If your pigeons have any trouble, stop increasing the distance and continue training them at the last distance they were successful. Some of the longest pigeon races are several hundred miles in a single flight. This is the maximum distance from home that you should practice with your pigeon, but do not go to these distances until your pigeon is able to return from shorter distances, in any direction, consistently."

      "content": "Be careful of bird loss. Bird loss is unfortunate, but not uncommon. If you experience bird loss, reduce the training distance and frequency for a while. [16] X Research source For example, if you were training at the 10 mile distance, reduce back to 5 miles for several weeks. Pigeon clubs all have lost bird reporting processes that you can take advantage of if you lose a bird. People who find lost birds can report those birds (using their leg bands) on these websites. You can then contact the finder and arrange to have your bird brought home. Some pigeons might simply get tired on their return journey and need time to rest. While they may normally come back to the loft in one day, it may take them a few days to return if they've stopped for a break."

Feed your pigeons at both lofts periodically, to give them incentive to want to return to each loft. If they’re at one loft and are hungry, they’ll fly to the other loft to look for food."

The ARPU has a number of different memberships available, including junior memberships (for kids under 18), family memberships, and memberships for people interested in pigeon racing, but unable to participate.
