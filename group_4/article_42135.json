      "content": "Move immediately to an underground shelter, whenever possible. At the first sign of a tornado, or if a tornado warning has been issued, stop whatever you're doing and seek appropriate shelter immediately, even if you don't see a tornado. A warning, as opposed to a watch, means an actual tornado has been sighted or is indicated by radar. An underground tornado shelter or a specially designed tornado safe room is the safest place to be during a tornado. Some homes, businesses, and schools in areas prone to tornadoes have these shelters. If a tornado shelter is not available, go to the basement of a building. Stay away from windows, and cover yourself with a mattress, cushions, or sleeping bags. If possible, get under a heavy table, which can protect you from falling debris."

      "title": "Stay in a windowless room on the lowest level, if you can't go underground.",
      "content": "Stay in a windowless room on the lowest level, if you can't go underground. In a building with no basement, avoid windows and go to the lowest floor. Alternatively, seek shelter in a small room that is located near the center of the house, under a stairwell, or in an interior hallway with no windows. Regardless of where you are, crouch low to the ground or lie down, face down and cover your head with your hands and arms. Take cover under a strong table if possible, and cover yourself with a mattress, cushions, or blankets. Bathrooms can be particularly effective because they are fortified by pipes and you can lie in a bathtub. Stay out of elevators, as you could be trapped in them if power is lost. Instead, use the stairs to descend to the lowest floor."

      "title": "Remain in your shelter until the danger of tornadoes has passed.",
      "content": "Remain in your shelter until the danger of tornadoes has passed. If possible, listen for advisories from the National Weather Service (in the U.S.) and Environment Canada on a NOAA weather radio or on local radio or TV. Keep in mind that multiple tornadoes often form in an area and it may not be safe to leave shelter even after one tornado has passed. [2] X Research source Even if the last tornado has passed, you should still use common sense. If the surrounding area looks dangerous, it may be safer to remain in your shelter."

      "title": "Exit your shelter carefully.",
      "content": "Exit your shelter carefully. Exercise caution moving around in a tornado stricken area. After a tornado strikes, you are likely to encounter hazards such as flooding, falling debris, collapsing buildings, and blocked roads. Be alert and proceed with caution, as there may be sharp objects scattered about the ground. [3] X Research source Avoid fallen power lines and puddles with wires in them, and avoid using matches or lighters in case of natural gas or fuel tank leaks. Do not enter damaged buildings under any circumstances, as they may be prone to collapse."

      "content": "Know the warning signs of potential tornadoes. Being able to quickly determine your risk is one of the key steps to finding shelter and surviving. Unfortunately, there are few proven ways to stay safe in the open if caught in a tornado, and the number one advice is to find shelter as soon as you see these warning signs. Most tornadoes are accompanied by thunderstorms, hail, and, of course, high winds, but there are other things to look out for as well: [4] X Research source Dark, green-tinted clouds Loud roaring noises, like airplanes taking off \"Wall clouds,\" where the base of a thunderhead seems to lower Funnels or rotating clouds Debris and dust \"walls.\""

      "title": "Drive, if possible, to the nearest shelter.",
      "content": "Drive, if possible, to the nearest shelter. If you hear the warning and it is still safe to drive, get to the closest building you can find. Keep your seat belt on and get off the open road as soon as you can. Turn on your high beams and move immediately to some sort of structure, preferably with a basement. You are almost always better off in a building than in your car. If you can see the tornado and/or flying debris makes driving dangerous, stay put. If your car is pelted with debris while driving, this is your cue to pull over. Never try to out-drive a tornado in an urban environment; get to any building as shelter instead."

Take your coat, a blanket, a pillow, etc. and put it over your head and back, and hold your hands over your head to protect your skull. [5] X Research source Stay put until you can safely drive to shelter. Be on the lookout for multiple tornadoes. Again, there may be multiple tornadoes after the first one has passed."

      "content": "Stay away from overpasses, bridges, or areas with potential for lots of debris. Falling and spinning debris is the cause of most tornado fatalities. While being caught in the open is not ideal, try to hunker down in a spot without the potential for lots of structural damage or fast moving debris. [7] X Research source If torn between an overpass or an open area, choose the open space and try to get as low as possible."

      "title": "Move perpendicular to the tornado's direction, if you're caught on open water.",
      "content": "Move perpendicular to the tornado's direction, if you're caught on open water. Waterspouts, tornadoes that form over water, pose a special problem. While they are generally weaker and slower than tornadoes on land, it's not possible to seek shelter on the open water. If waterspouts have been sighted in the area, get out of the water, if possible. If you're in the water when a waterspout hits, experts recommend trying to avoid it by sailing at right angles to its path, not straight away from it. If a waterspout is about to hit the boat, it's probably best to dive overboard, as you then have a better chance of avoiding injury from flying debris. If you are on land and a waterspout is very close to shore, you are not necessarily safe. While they rarely come on land, they can. Treat them like any other tornado and get to cover in case they come on land."

A tornado warning is much more serious. Tornado warnings mean that a sign of rotation has been detected and that you should take immediate action depending on the tornado's location and its predicted track. [8] X Research source Whenever you see a tornado watch, keep the news and radio on for further news. Whenever you see a tornado warning, get to cover immediately."

Note the places in each room where you should seek cover if you cannot escape, like under tables or cabinets. Are there any places where you would be trapped or in extra danger, such as upstairs rooms? Are there ways to make them safe, such as stashing a cheap rope ladder?

Dead branches, decorations, and lawn chairs will be whipped at hundreds of miles an hour in the event of a tornado, which can turn into a serious hazard. To keep your property safe during a tornado, take the following precautions: [11] X Research source Cut away dead or damaged tree branches that could be ripped off in high winds. Tie down or secure lawn furniture. If you are unable to, consider moving heavier pieces indoors, but only if you have time. Keep your lawn free of anything that could turn into a weapon when picked up by a tornado, such as glass gazing balls."
