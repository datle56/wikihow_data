      "content": "The abbreviation “POV” stands for “point of view.” On TikTok, creators often include “POV” in captions and on-video text when they want the viewer to watch a video from their own perspective. This format allows the audience to feel like they’re present in a specific situation, whether it’s going on a first date, getting a paycheck, or being late to class.

Popular POV TikTok videos include “ POV: you get paired up with the popular girl ,” “ POV: that one friend who has a privacy screen on their phone ,” and “ POV: you grew up with strict parents. ”"
