      "content": "Stay hydrated. Water is essential for keeping you cool during hot weather. Water keeps your body cool and should be drunk even if you don't feel thirsty. It's okay to also drink commercial waters (such as Vitamin Water) or sports drinks such as Powerade or Gatorade but they're usually not necessary unless you're deliberately replenishing lost vitamins/electrolytes following a sporting activity. [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source The best way to check your hydration level is to measure your urination color. Anything darker than straw colored is probably an indication that dehydration is on the horizon, and water is needed. Stay away from sugary drinks such as sodas(even if they are sugar-free!); they decrease the ability of your body to store water. Also, steer clear of alcoholic drinks, coffee, and caffeinated drinks, which are natural diuretics."

If you wait too late, you could experience cramps, which are a sign of heat-related illness. [2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Remind yourself to drink water frequently with one of the following options. Purchase a durable water bottle or water pack that you can tote everywhere and refill at any safe water tap. Freeze a bottle of water to carry around with you. It'll be solid when you leave the house, but the heat will start melting it from the moment you take it out of the freezer. Wrap it in a towel to prevent water condensation affecting other items in your bag. Download a water drinking app onto your phone. Set reminders, daily targets, and even track when the last time you had a drink. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose cooling foods. Food can keep you cool provided you make the right choices. Choose salads, fresh raw food, vegetables and fruit. “Cool as a cucumber” is literal; it is nearly 100% water, providing hydration to keep you cool. Avoid eating meat and protein-heavy foods during the heat of the day because these can increase metabolic heat production, which can add to loss of water. It may seem counter-intuitive, but eating spicy peppers may help cool you off. They make you sweat, which provides a cooling sensation. [4] X Research source Smaller meals may also help keep your core temperature down. Large meals require the body to work harder breaking everything down. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Make food without using the oven or stove.",
      "content": "Make food without using the oven or stove. Find foods that don’t need to be cooked, or don’t need heat to be cooked. If you must actually cook, keep the cool air in, and the temperature down, by using the microwave instead of the stove or oven. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source For example, you can microwave frozen vegetables and canned soup instead of cooking them on the stovetop. Cold soups are great in warm weather. If you haven't tried them yet, hot weather is the excuse you need! The fact they are often healthy is just an added benefit. [7] X Research source Make popsicles, slushies, frozen fruit, frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats to help you cool down."

      "content": "Stay out of the sun while it's at its hottest. This commonsense approach isn't always easy to adhere to when summer fun beckons, so it bears repeating. Avoid activities in the noonday sun as much as possible. It's best to limit your sun exposure between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. each day during warmer months. When you are outside during these times, limit your exposure as best as you possibly can. Schedule activities early in the morning or later in the afternoon Some people are particularly vulnerable to heat and should stay in cool places during hot weather, such as children, the elderly, obese, redheads, gingers, and those who have health problems."

      "content": "Wear sunscreen! While sunscreen doesn’t necessarily have a cooling effect, its protective effect is vital during warmer weather. As well as being painful and damaging, sunburn can cause a fever and various signs of dehydration. [8] X Research source If left unchecked, sunburns can lead to heat exhaustion or heat stroke. [9] X Research source At the minimum, use SPF 15. If you're planning on being outside for a while, SPF 30 would be a better option. Reapply often. Every two hours is recommended, but it should be reapplied more often if you're swimming or sweating a lot. Apply roughly a shot glass worth of sunscreen to cover the entire body.

      "title": "Stay in the shade.",
      "content": "Stay in the shade. Retreat to shade as much as possible. Taking breaks under trees works doubly well because trees release water into the air that absorbs some of the heat. While shade doesn’t lower the actual temperature, the lack of sunlight exposure makes it feel like the temperature is up to 15 degrees cooler. If a cool breeze comes by, that can feel like an additional lowering of 5 degrees in the shade. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear lighter clothing.",
      "content": "Wear lighter clothing. Lightweight, loose-fitting clothing will help to keep you cooler. If it is light in color, it’s even better, as this will reflect the heat and sunlight better. Shorts and short sleeved shirts are good choices. Something that lets the air flow freely through, hitting the sweat on your body, works best. The following suggestions are specific ways clothing can maximize your ability to stay cool: Cotton and linen clothing tends to keep you cool and absorb moisture. Clothes you can hold up to the light and see through are great choices. Be sure to apply sunscreen when wearing really thin clothing, however, as the clothing doesn't provide adequate protection from the sun's harmful rays. Synthetic clothing tends to trap moisture, which makes the fabric feel heavier, stick to your skin, and restrict air-flow. Working in lower humidity settings with short sleeves has been shown to have a minor benefit. Weigh the options of UV exposure with your choice of clothing. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your head covered. Wear a wide-brimmed hat, one that sufficiently covers the top of your scalp as well as the tops of your ears. This helps to keep you cooler by providing shade. Choose a brim that is wide enough that it can also cover the back of your neck. [16] X Research source Light-colored hats can help keep you cool."

Cotton socks are great, but moisture wicking socks help your feet stay cooler. [18] X Research source Some running shoes are designed with the summer months in mind, providing ventilation in a variety of designs. [19] X Research source Be careful if you decide to go barefoot.

While the efficacy of fans during extreme heat and humidity has been debated, some research suggests fans are beneficial up to 97 °F (36 °C) with 80% humidity, and 108 °F (42 °C) with nearly 50% humidity. [23] X Research source Whether hand-held or electric, fans can keep you cool by continuously circulating air. In your home and office space, locate fans in rooms where you are working or resting to keep the air circulating freely and to reduce the mugginess of heat. Try making your own \"swamp cooler.\" These evaporative coolers can reduce temperature by significant amounts. They range from the simple (i.e. a bowl of chilled water in front of a fan) to the semi-complex. With just a few PVC pipes, a bucket, an electric fan, and a frozen gallon of water, you can create mid-40 °F (4 °C) wind. [24] X Research source However, keep in mind that swamp coolers will not work with humid heat. A fan should not be the primary source of cooling down in extremely hot weather.

For example, you could place the air conditioner in the room where you spend the most time, such as the living room, kitchen, or your bedroom. You can also try running the air conditioner at the highest comfortable temperature to avoid racking up a high electricity bill.

      "content": "Plan ahead . Whatever you're doing outdoors, having a plan will help cut down on unnecessary activity in the heat. By having a plan, you can set time limits on your exposure to the heat and plan ways to minimize the effects of the heat before you head into it each day. Always be sure to stick to your time limits by prioritizing and leaving less important things to be finished when it's cooler. When hiking, study the map at the beginning of the day, and calculate the best route, especially one that makes the most of shade where possible. While swimming, monitor your time in the pool. You may think there is minimal sun exposure because of the cooling effect of the water, but staying in too long without reapplying sunscreen or taking a break could lead to sunburn. If you have to travel a lot during hot days in your vehicle, plan ahead by having your vehicle inspected and ensuring that your air-conditioning is in working order. When you notice the temps aren’t as frigid as you’d like, take it in for service. The car is likely low on Freon."
