      "title": "Open the wine key and cut the foil off the top of the wine bottle.",
      "content": "Open the wine key and cut the foil off the top of the wine bottle. Unfold the wine key . You’ll notice a long, metal spiral, called the “worm,” and a flatter portion that serves as a lever. Some wine keys also have a short blade which you can use to cut through foil if a cork is covered in it. Use the point of the worm, or the included blade, to cut all the way around the foil of the bottle. Cut just under the bottle’s lip, then peel the foil away and discard it. [1] X Research source The spiral and lever parts will be folded into the wine key handle. Unfold them and your key is ready to use. Wine keys are a great choice for an inexpensive, easy-to-use, and portable corkscrew."

      "content": "Twist the worm down and clockwise into the cork. Poke the sharp tip of the worm down into the center of the cork. While applying slight downward pressure, gently twist it clockwise until only one spiral of the worm shows. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Fold the notched arm down against the lip of the bottle.",
      "content": "Fold the notched arm down against the lip of the bottle. The notched arm has 1 or 2 indentations on its sides. Bend this arm down so that one of these fits against the lip of the glass bottle, next to the cork. This will provide leverage to help you extract the cork. [3] X Research source On keys with 2 notches, use the upper notch first, then switch to the lower notch later if you need more leverage once the cork starts to rise out of the bottle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift the key’s lever arm to remove the cork.",
      "content": "Lift the key’s lever arm to remove the cork. Firmly but gently pull on the lever arm, which is opposite the notched arm. As you pull, the cork will lift out of the wine bottle, until it’s eventually completely removed. Twist the cork off the worm and discard it. [4] X Research source Use your other hand to hold the bottle in place as you pull the cork out. Take your time. If you try to force the cork out, it may break before it is fully removed."

    {
      "title": "Lower the corkscrew’s levers and remove the foil around the cork.",
      "content": "Lower the corkscrew’s levers and remove the foil around the cork. A winged corkscrew has 2 long levers (the “wings”) positioned on the sides of a center ring. Inside the ring there is a long metal spiral (the “worm”), controlled by a tab at the top that can be twisted. Start by lowering the wings toward the center ring. The worm will rise simultaneously. [5] X Research source Also, use a sharp object to cut the foil around the lip of the bottle, then remove it. Practice caution if you use the point of the worm to do this. Winged corkscrews are fairly common and user-friendly, but are less portable than other small corkscrews."

    {
      "title": "Place the center ring over the cork.",
      "content": "Place the center ring over the cork. The center ring is just a little wider than the opening of a standard wine bottle, so it fits easily. Keep the wings down as you position the corkscrew. [6] X Research source It can help to first lift the wings, then position the worm in the center of the cork, then lower the wings again, which may result in a more precise uncorking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the center tab clockwise.",
      "content": "Turn the center tab clockwise. The sharp tip of the worm will pierce the cork. As you turn the tab, the worm will continue to wind its way into the cork, and the wings will rise. Keep turning gently until the wings are raised all the way up toward the tab. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Fold the levers back down.",
      "content": "Fold the levers back down. Grasp the levers with one or both hands and gently lower them back towards the sides of the corkscrew and the bottle. As you push them down, the cork will start to lift up and out. Satisfying! [8] X Research source If the cork doesn’t come quite all the way out, gently twist and rock it side to side until it is fully removed. Enjoy your wine! Use your free hand to hold the bottle in place if you have to pull the cork out at all. Don’t forget to unscrew the cork from the worm before putting your corkscrew away."

      "title": "Assemble the corkscrew and remove the foil from the cork.",
      "content": "Assemble the corkscrew and remove the foil from the cork. The simplest corkscrews are “T” shaped, just a spiral metal “worm” with a handle attached at the top. Travel corkscrews , however, often have a worm with a plastic handle capped by a sheath that narrows at one end. Pull the sheath away, then slide it into the base of the corkscrew to make a handle. [9] X Research source Before you start, use a sharp object to cut the foil around the lip of the bottle, then remove it. Exercise caution if you use the point of the worm to do this. The handles of some simple corkscrews will fold down against the worm. If yours is like this, just raise them upwards until the tool resembles a “T” shape. Pocket corkscrews are the most portable, but require a little more elbow grease than other types."

With the other, position the sharp tip of the worm in the center of the cork and gently but firmly twist it clockwise, applying downward pressure as you do.

Then serve! [11] X Research source Take your free hand and hold the bottle at the neck as you pull the cork out. Unscrew the cork from the worm after removing it. Remove the sheath from the hole and place it back over the worm when you are done if you are using a travel corkscrew."

      "content": "Clamp or mount the corkscrew onto a solid countertop. Many old-school, mounted lever corkscrews are clamp-mounted. Unscrew the clamp, then position it around the lip of a solid, sturdy countertop. Then twist and tighten the clamp until the corkscrew is stable and doesn’t move. [12] X Research source Some mounted corkscrews must be screwed onto a surface. If this is the case, follow the manufacturer’s instructions to mount your corkscrew, as methods vary by model. Mounted corkscrews are a great option for businesses or restaurants that need to open many bottles, but are the most expensive and least portable option."

Then, insert the bottle’s mouth up and into the corkscrew’s opening. [13] X Research source Insert the bottle as far as it will go, and hold it there with 1 hand. Some models of mounted corkscrew provide a clamp to keep the bottle in place."

Operate the lever with a firm hand, and do your best to operate it in one smooth motion. [14] X Research source After, reverse the lever to release the cork. Some models allow you to re-cork a bottle by reinserting the bottle into the corkscrew and reversing the lever."

      "content": "Cork extractor A cork extractor is a handy tool for removing corks without damaging them. To use one, remove the foil from around the cork. Then, squeeze the prongs of the extractor together and slip them around the cork, on either side, so that they’re wedged between the cork and the nozzle. Rock the cork extractor from side to side while pushing down. [15] X Research source Once the extractor is as far down the cork as possible, hold the bottle with one hand and twist and pull the extractor with the other, until the cork is removed. Work the extractor down slowly. Going too quickly or pushing too hard may push the cork into the bottle."

To use one, remove the foil from the bottle’s nozzle, then place the worm of the corkscrew in the center of the cork. Then, just turn the handle counterclockwise continuously until the worm works into the bottle and is pulled out.
