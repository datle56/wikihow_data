      "content": "It depends on which IQ test you take, but it’s around 130–150. Your Mensa membership isn’t directly based on your IQ score, but you can still use an approved IQ test to join. If you took the Stanford Binet 5 or the Reynolds Intellectual Assessment, scoring an IQ of 130 is enough to get in. For the Stanford Binet or California Test of Mental Maturity, you’ll need at least 132 on your test. If you’ve taken the Cattell IQ test, you need a minimum IQ score of 148. [1] X Research source Each test measures IQ differently, so scoring 132 on one test may be the same as scoring 148 on another. That’s why Mensa avoids only using your IQ score when they consider your membership."

      "content": "You can take a qualifying in-person test given by Mensa members. You’re able to sign up for a test directly through Mensa as long as you take it at one of their test centers. Just search on the Mensa site to find your nearest local branch and check their schedule for when they’re running the next testing session. You can choose to either wait for a group testing day where multiple people take the exam, or schedule a private test session with an administrator. It all just depends on what type of testing environment you prefer best. Unfortunately, you cannot qualify for Mensa using an online test you’ve taken at home."

The Mensa site lists all of the approved tests and scores you may have already taken, so scroll through them and check if you’ve already qualified. If you’re able to use your outside test, just mail an original or notarized copy of your scores to your local Mensa Admissions office and pay the $40 USD fee. They’ll verify your scores and send you an acceptance letter if you qualify. Some common tests and qualifying scores are: [2] X Research source Cognitive Abilities Test: composite score of 132 Differential Ability Scales: GCA 132 Otis-Gamma Test: IQ 131 LSAT: 95 percentile ranking Henmon-Nelson: 132 You can find other approved tests and their qualifying scores here: https://www.us.mensa.org/join/testscores/#qualifying-scores . Unfortunately, you cannot use composite ACT or SAT scores if you took them after 1989 and 1994 respectively."

Mensa doesn’t post or publish copies of their official tests, so the questions you get are different with each exam. However, practice tests and quizzes on the Mensa site ask multiple questions about choosing the next shape or number in a logical sequence. [3] X Research source You can take free Mensa practice tests here: https://www.mensa.org.au/membership-information/practice-tests/practice-tests . You can play the Mensa IQ Challenge quiz game to get an idea of questions that might appear on the admission test. You can find the game here: https://www.mensa.org/public/mensa-iq-challenge ."

The culture fair test is a nonverbal option that you can choose if you aren’t fluent in English or if you don’t want to take the standard test. It tests if you can determine pattern recognition and the relationships between different figures and shapes. Simply request the culture fair test when you sign up so you’re given the right exam.

The tests usually start with some easier questions, but they get more difficult as you get further on. [5] X Research source The test takes around 1–2 hours to finish completely. Even though it may seem intimidating, taking your time with each question and double-checking your answers can help you do well."
