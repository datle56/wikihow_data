      "title": "Choose a large bowl that is twice the size of your ingredients.",
      "content": "Choose a large bowl that is twice the size of your ingredients. This will give you enough room to move the salad around while tossing it. Don't worry if it's not pretty; you can always move the salad to a nicer bowl or platter when you're done."

    {
      "title": "Rinse and dry the lettuce well.",
      "content": "Rinse and dry the lettuce well. Dressing will not stick to wet lettuce, so you'll have to make sure it is dry before you start tossing it. Rinse the leaves with water, and then dry them in a salad spinner. If you don't have a salad spinner, gently pat them dry with clean paper towels instead."

      "title": "Put the heaviest, bulkiest ingredients into the bowl first.",
      "content": "Put the heaviest, bulkiest ingredients into the bowl first. This includes things like tomatoes, carrots, and cucumbers. They will help spread the dressing around better if they are at the bottom. They will also be less likely to bruise the lettuce. Consider leaving some of the heavier ingredients for garnishing at the end. If you are making a fruit salad, you can put everything in at once."

    {
      "title": "Add the lettuce.",
      "content": "Add the lettuce. If this is a pasta salad, you can add the pasta at this point. If you plan on adding herbs, save them until the very end."

      "title": "Hold off on the dressing until you are ready to serve the salad.",
      "content": "Hold off on the dressing until you are ready to serve the salad. If you are making the salad in advance, don't put the dressing in yet. If you add the dressing in too soon, your salad will be soggy by the time you are ready to serve it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour a quarter of the dressing into the salad.",
      "content": "Pour a quarter of the dressing into the salad. You will be adding the dressing bit by bit as you toss the salad. This will keep you from using too much dressing. It will also ensure that the dressing mixes into the salad evenly. Too much dressing is not a good thing. It will overpower the different flavors in the salad. The dressing should just cover the lettuce, and not pool at the bottom."

      "content": "Use a pair of salad tongs to pick up some salad from the bottom of the bowl. If you don't mind getting dirty, you can also use your hands instead â€” just make sure that they are clean."

      "title": "Add a little bit more dressing, and toss the salad some more.",
      "content": "Add a little bit more dressing, and toss the salad some more. Keep doing this until you have used up all your dressing for the recipe. Plan on using about 2 to 4 tablespoons of dressing for every 4 cups of salad."
