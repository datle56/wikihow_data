Other members of your Circle will see the “ No network or phone off ” message and your last known location when you had service. While you can turn off location sharing or log out of Life360 to prevent tracking, Circle members will see a message that you shut off your location or logged out. If you don’t want members of your Circle to be suspicious, turning off service and explaining you had a weak signal is more believable."
