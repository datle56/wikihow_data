      "content": "Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) The WAIS tests your verbal and performance-based IQ, and it's appropriate for individuals over the age of 16. This IQ test is the primary assessment used to measure cognitive ability by professionals. Currently, the test involves IQ measurement on four scales: verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. [1] X Research source The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) is available for children ages 6-16, and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) is an accurate IQ assessment for children ages 2-7. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The WAIS is not considered an accurate IQ measurement for extremely high or low IQs (above 160 or below 40). [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The Weschler IQ test must be administered by a certified individual or institution. Search online for psychologists or educational institutions that administer the test near you. Accommodations may be available for those with disabilities.

      "content": "Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale The Stanford-Binet test assesses the IQ of children and adolescents. Although this IQ test can be used for adults, it was initially developed for children and is best suited for young children, adolescents, and young adults. [4] X Research source It is not uncommon for preschoolers to receive a low score on the Stanford-Binet assessment, not because of their intelligence but their unwillingness to cooperate. The Stanford-Binet IQ test should be administered by a certified psychologist or trained administrator. Search online for psychologists or educational institutions that administer the test in your area. If you have any sort of testing disability (visual, audial, etc.), contact your test administrator ahead of time for accommodation options."

The Mensa admissions test is one of the most widely available IQ measurements and the most affordable. The test is administered at set times during the year and costs $60 USD. [5] X Research source Generally, the Mensa assessment takes around two hours. Contact your nearest Mensa office for information on taking their qualifying IQ test. Mensa International only accepts members with an IQ within the top 2% of the general population. Don't beat yourself up if you don't meet the minimum requirement.

Studying for an IQ test can be tough, especially because most are meant to measure your raw intellectual potential. Familiarizing yourself with sample questions and the different sections of the IQ test, however, could help you to boost your test score . [8] X Research source Mensa International offers a free \"IQ Challenge\" online. However, give yourself a 24-hour break before the test so that you don’t exhaust your brain.

If you can't sleep from nerves, try a calming technique . [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In the morning before the test, eat a protein-rich breakfast: eggs, yogurt, nuts, and raw vegetables are all great choices. [10] X Research source Avoid foods made from white flour or refined sugar, which take more energy to digest. Stay hydrated, too. Drink plenty of water before the exam, and bring a water bottle with you to drink before you enter the testing room.

If you’re still feeling stressed in the days or hours (or minutes!) leading up to the assessment, practice a stress-relief technique like meditation or deep breathing . [11] X Research source A little stress can be positive, as it's the body's way of telling you to focus. Excessive stress, however, is detrimental and can limit your cognitive functioning."

Avoid wearing new or overly formal clothes to your IQ test. Save your Sunday best for dances or job interviews, and wear clothes you enjoy to the assessment, like your comfiest pair of jeans or leggings and a loose T-shirt. [12] X Research source Showing up in your pajamas may seem enticing, but opt for a balance of comfort and style. Flattering clothes can help you feel confident and ready to do your best."

If a question is too difficult, move on to the next one and come back if you can. [14] X Research source If you can choose which questions you answer first, spend your time on the easiest questions. This approach will build your self-esteem and allow you to answer as many questions as possible in the allotted time. Divide your time limit between the questions or sections so you can plan to tackle every question."

Anything below 80 indicates a potential deficiency and anything above 120 is considered high intelligence. 68% of the population falls in the 85-115 range. However, your score may also fluctuate based on which IQ test you took—scores between the WAIS and the Stanford-Binet scale vary by several points, for instance. You can also look at the percentile you placed in to get a clear idea of how your IQ score compares to the general population. If your score is in the 70th percentile, for example, this means that you have scored higher than 70% of others in your age demographic. [15] X Research source Read your score as scaled, not linear. An IQ score of 50, for example, is not half the capabilities of a score of 100."

      "content": "Along with the overall average, compare your score to your age group. Although IQ stays relatively stable over a single person’s lifetime, it may be worth comparing your score to the average IQ scores for other people in your age range to get a sense of where you fall. [16] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source Here are some of the average IQ scores for different age groups: [17] X Research source Teens & Young Adults: 16–17 y.o. (108), 18–19 y.o. (105), 20–24 y.o. (99). Middle-Aged Adults: 24–34 y.o. (97), 35–44 y.o. (101), 45–54 y.o. (106). Older Adults: 55–64 y.o. (109), 65–69 y.o. (114), 70–74 y.o. (119). However, make sure you’ve taken the correct test for your age group in order to get an accurate IQ score. Also, remember that IQ tests are designed with age in mind, so getting a high score when you are young is not any more or less impressive than getting a higher score at an older age. In other words, a 12-year-old with an IQ of 143 is not \"better\" than a 30-year-old with an IQ of 143."

      "content": "Intelligence quotient (IQ) is a measure of how one processes information, logic, and reasoning compared to others. The first IQ test was created in 1904 by Alfred Binet, a psychologist who believed that intelligence was not genetic but a combination of many different skills influenced by environment and experience. Binet hoped that teachers would use his research and assessment to adjust their methods to the individual learning styles of their students. [21] X Research source The purpose and usage of IQ as a measurement tool evolved over the years, with more and more IQ tests emerging that assessed different skills in different ways."

      "title": "How is IQ tested?",
      "content": "How is IQ tested? IQ is tested with an IQ assessment, of which there are many different types. A reliable IQ test, however, tests one’s IQ by asking questions designed to get an idea of someone’s general intelligence level. [22] X Research source Some IQ tests test general knowledge (or “crystallized” intelligence), while others may measure logic and reasoning skills (or “fluid” intelligence). [23] X Research source Depending on how an individual’s brain works and their individual strengths, they may score higher or lower on one type of test versus another. The type of IQ test that a person takes will also depend on their age, culture, and purpose (i.e., for a job vs. a Mensa qualification)."

      "title": "Are IQ tests accurate?",
      "content": "Are IQ tests accurate? Experts still debate the accuracy and usefulness of the IQ test, largely due to the vast departure from the original purpose of the test to how it's used today. Originally, the IQ test was designed to help teachers understand and adapt to their students’ learning styles (although some people of that time period also used IQ tests to justify the sterilization of people with extremely low scores). Now, it's used as a general measure of so-called intelligence, which can sometimes limit or exclude certain people from being viewed as intelligent. [24] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Some people believe that IQ tests don’t give an overall assessment of intelligence or even truly test for intelligence at all. Rather, they evaluate one very specific skill (i.e., the ability to quickly process and interpret information) but not other forms of intelligence or ability. [25] X Research source Other groups, including the American Psychological Association , argue that IQ testing should continue, but with more research to maximize learning opportunities rather than create barriers to measured intelligence."

      "content": "What are the differences between aptitude tests and IQ tests? Aptitude tests assess a specific set of skills and abilities, providing individual scores for each. On the other hand, an IQ test seeks to measure overall intelligence and only provides one summarized score. An aptitude test also will not factor in age, while an IQ test does. IQ tests are also mainly used for research and education purposes, and they’re not considered to be highly predictive of job performance. [26] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Aptitude tests, however, are thought to be able to predict whether or not someone will succeed in a workplace.
