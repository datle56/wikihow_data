      "content": "Pull 1 foot at a time up towards your rear to stretch your quads . Bend your left knee so that your foot is behind you and grab your left foot in your left hand. To stretch out your quadriceps, pull up on your foot. You’ll feel the muscles on the front side of your left thigh stretch and loosen up. Keep your knee pointed straight down towards the floor. Hold this pose for 10–15 seconds, and release your leg if you feel any pain in your thigh muscles. [1] X Research source Once you’ve stretched out your left quadriceps, switch legs and hold your right foot in your right hand. As with the left leg, pull up on the foot to stretch your quads. While you’re holding the stretch, push your hips forward to stretch the muscles even farther."

      "content": "Stretch 1 thigh at a time by bending your knee and placing a foot on a bench. Find a knee-height bench or, if you’re at the gym, a knee-high jump box. Bend your left knee and rest the top of your foot left on the bench. Lean your torso backward and press your hips forward to stretch out your quadriceps. Hold the stretch for 5 seconds, and repeat it 4–5 times. Then, repeat the stretch on the opposite side by placing your right foot on top of the box. [3] X Expert Source Eric Martinez Clinical Performance Specialist & Registered Clinical Exercise Physiologist Expert Interview. 18 May 2021. Stop stretching if you feel any pain.

      "title": "Bend 1 knee at a time while in a seated position on the floor.",
      "content": "Bend 1 knee at a time while in a seated position on the floor. If you don’t have access to a jump box or bench, you can stretch out your quadriceps in a similar way from a seated position. Sit down, extend 1 leg out in front of you, and bend your other leg at the knee. When it’s fully bent, your heel should be resting on the ground next to your buttocks. To stretch your quadriceps, lean your torso back until you’re at a 45-degree angle relative to the ground. Hold the pose for 5 seconds, and repeat it 4–5 times. Then, switch legs and repeat the stretch with your right quad. [4] X Research source If your knees start to ache during this stretch, use one of the other options to stretch out your quadriceps. This stretch can be potentially painful for people with injured or weak knees."

      "content": "Kneel on a yoga mat and lunge forward with 1 leg at a time. This stretch is a great way to focus on stretching your quads separately. Kneel with your right knee and place your left foot out in front of your body. Your knee should be bent at a 90-degree angle. To stretch your right quad, slide your hips and the trunk of your body forward until you feel your right quad stretching. Hold the stretch for just 1–2 seconds. Repeat the kneeling lunge 10 times before switching your position. [5] X Research source When you switch, kneel with your left leg and place your right leg in front of you. Lean forward until you feel your left quad stretch."

      "content": "Reach down and touch your toes with your fingertips. This simple stretch is a great way to loosen up the muscles on the back and inside of your thighs. Let the weight of your upper body pull your hands and fingertips lower towards your feet. It’s okay if your fingertips don’t touch your toes at first. Never force your body to bend more than is comfortable; doing so could tear a muscle. Stop stretching if you feel any pain. You should feel the muscles at the tops of your thighs stretch, but the sensation shouldn’t be painful."

      "content": "Stretch your hamstrings by aligning your feet and leaning to the side. Stand with your hands on your hips. Place your right foot 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) in front of your left foot. Keep your right leg straight and slightly bend your left leg. Lean to the right until you feel a slight burn in the back of your right thigh. Switch your stance so that your left leg is in front of your right, and lean to the left until you feel your left hamstring stretch. [6] X Research source If you have trouble keeping your balance during this stretch, rest 1 hand against a nearby wall. Your hamstrings are long muscles that run down the back of your inner thigh. They go from the back of your knee up to your hips."

      "content": "Press your feet together and open your knees to stretch the adductors. Do this stretch when you’re lying flat on your back. Press the soles of your feet together, and bend your knees to draw your feet up towards your groin. Keep bending your knees until you feel your quadriceps stretching. To further stretch your inner thighs, just use your hands to press your knees out and downward (towards the surface you’re lying on). Hold the pose for 15–20 seconds. [7] X Research source Repeat this stretch 4–5 times to really loosen up your inner thighs. If you’re not feeling much of a stretch, try lightly pushing down on your knees to stretch your adductors a little farther. You can adjust the amount that your inner thighs stretch by bringing your knees closer to or farther from your torso."

To stretch out your adductor muscles, separate your legs and slide them down toward the ground. To make the stretch more difficult, bring your legs farther apart and your feet closer to the ground.

      "content": "Try a butterfly pose by sitting with your feet pressed together. This is a more challenging inner-thigh stretch. Sit on the ground (ideally on a yoga mat) with your knees bent. Press the soles of your feet together and wrap your hands around the outsides of your feet. Exhale and, as you do so, bring your heels in towards your groin.
