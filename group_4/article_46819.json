      "content": "Select a whitening product that is convenient for you. Familiarize yourself with ingredients that are in different whitening pens. While almost all products include peroxide, note that other pens require you to use teeth trays to set the whitening agent in place. Try choosing a product that best fits into your routine. [1] X Research source Although they’re known to work slower than whitening pens, whitening strips are also an affordable option."

      "title": "Brush your teeth to ensure that they’re clean.",
      "content": "Brush your teeth to ensure that they’re clean. Take 2 minutes to fully clean your teeth before applying any whitening product. Take extra care to brush the front surface of your teeth, as this is where the whitening pen will go. To develop a consistent routine, choose to use your whitening pen in the morning or evening so you can apply it right after you brush your teeth. [3] X Research source It often works well to use the pen after you're done eating for the day before you go to bed."

    {
      "title": "Floss your teeth to clean them more thoroughly.",
      "content": "Floss your teeth to clean them more thoroughly. Make sure that your teeth are completely clean when you go to apply the whitening product. Use a strand of floss that’s long enough to wrap around both index fingers several times, creating a straight length of floss that’s at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) long. Work your way between all of your teeth, prioritizing the gum line as you go. If you don’t want to use regular floss, try using plastic flossers instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open your mouth with your lips stretched away from your teeth.",
      "content": "Open your mouth with your lips stretched away from your teeth. Spread your lips apart into a toothy smile with both your upper and lower teeth visible, as well as your gum lines. Hold this position whenever you use the whitening pen, as you don’t want your lips to move the product around. [4] X Research source Make sure your teeth are as dry as possible before applying the whitening product. Whenever you whiten your teeth, be sure to work in front of a mirror."

    {
      "title": "Brush on the product in short, vertical strokes along the surface of each tooth.",
      "content": "Brush on the product in short, vertical strokes along the surface of each tooth. Remove or unscrew the cap from the whitening pen to access the brush portion. Don’t worry about adding any product to the tip, as the bristle will already be coated in whitening formula. Apply the whitening product in short, vertical strokes, working from the top of the tooth to the bottom. Aim to paint over each tooth 3-5 times with the applicator. [5] X Research source Avoid getting any of the whitening product on your gums. Twist the pen if the tip doesn’t seem to have any product on it. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Hold your mouth in place for 1 minute to set the product.",
      "content": "Hold your mouth in place for 1 minute to set the product. Keep your lips pulled back and teeth visible for 1 minute after you finish applying the pen. Set a timer or count to 60 while you keep your mouth in this position. Try not to relax your mouth until you’ve waited for this amount of time. [7] X Research source As you wait, try to avoid swallowing the serum. Leaving the solution on for 20-30 minutes and avoiding activities that can dislodge the whitener from your teeth can also help the success of treatment."

    {
      "title": "Rinse out the whitening product with warm water.",
      "content": "Rinse out the whitening product with warm water. Spit out as much of the whitening agent as you can, then swish some warm water around your teeth to dislodge any excess product. Continue spitting until there’s no longer any whitener on your teeth. [8] X Research source If you think you’re able to spit out all of the product, don’t worry about swishing or gargling."

    {
      "title": "Keep applying the product daily for at least 1 week.",
      "content": "Keep applying the product daily for at least 1 week. Read the instructions on your specific whitening pen to figure out when you’ll start seeing results. Continue using the pen once a day, directly after you brush and floss your teeth. [9] X Research source When you’re not using the pen, keep it stored in a cool, dry place. Apply the product twice daily if the instructions allow. Some products might not show results right away. Be patient, and continue using the pen for several weeks before deciding if it works or not. That said, when used daily over a 7-10 day period, most pens will show visible results."
