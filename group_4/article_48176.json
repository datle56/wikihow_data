      "content": "Amazon's frustration-free packaging is minimal packaging that can be opened quickly and easily. Products with frustration-free packaging are wrapped and shipped with as few packing fillers and in as small a package as possible. Amazon launched frustration-free packaging to make it easier for customers to open their packages, to help sellers cut down on shipping costs, and to reduce packaging waste that harms the environment.

      "content": "In 2024, Amazon rebranded FFP as Ships in Product Packaging (SIPP). This program includes two shipping certification tiers for sellers. It also gives Amazon customers a “Ship in product packaging” option for qualifying items they put in their cart, like these LEGO sets . [2] X Research source Tier 1 is the FFP certification, which requires products to be easy to open, use recyclable packaging materials, ship in their own packages with minimal damage during transportation, and not require Amazon overboxes (the cardboard boxes or mailers with the Amazon logo on them). Tier 2 is the Ships in Own Container (SIOP) certification. Unlike the FPP, it doesn’t require recyclable packaging materials or easy-to-open packages. When a customer receives an SIOP product, they will find it in its original container and not in an Amazon-branded package."

      "content": "Less packaging helps the environment. Plastic packaging is part of the 20 million metric tons of litter that end up in the environment every year. Choosing brands that use frustration-free packaging is a small but meaningful action anyone can take. [3] X Research source Since 2015, Amazon has reported saving 2 million tons of packaging and cutting shipment weights by 41%. The FPP and SIPP are some of the efforts that made that happen. [4] X Research source In October 2023, an Amazon fulfillment center in Ohio became the first to eliminate plastic packaging from its delivery system. And in June 2024, Amazon announced they had replaced 95% of their plastic air pillows with recyclable paper materials. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Frustration-free packages are easier for everyone to open.",
      "content": "Frustration-free packages are easier for everyone to open. This means more people who can’t use scissors or box cutters can access their Amazon orders without someone helping them. That’s a big step for the inclusion of disabled individuals in product development!"

      "title": "Customers pay the same price for frustration-free packaging.",
      "content": "Customers pay the same price for frustration-free packaging. If you order, for example, a LEGO set through Amazon and select “Ship in Product Packaging,” it won’t cost you any extra. It also won’t save you money, but you can feel better knowing you’re reducing your environmental footprint by opting for fewer packing materials."

      "title": "Frustration-free packaging is cheaper than standard for sellers.",
      "content": "Frustration-free packaging is cheaper than standard for sellers. That’s because there are fewer packing materials and the packages are generally lighter, which translates to lower shipping costs. Additionally, Amazon offers incentives to FBA sellers who get SIPP-certified. [6] X Research source"
