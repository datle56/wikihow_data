      "content": "Take deep, slow breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try to relax your body and focus only on your breathing. You may find it helpful to count to five slowly as you inhale and then count back down from five as you exhale. Closing your eyes or focusing on an image or object may also help to keep you calm as you work to get your breathing back under control. As you breathe in focus on pulling air down into your stomach, then use your stomach muscles to help you push the air out. This is called diaphragmatic breathing and it will help you to take in deeper breaths. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To make sure that you are taking in full deep breaths, try placing one hand on your stomach (just below your ribcage) and the other on your chest. As you breathe, you should notice that the hand on your chest is staying still while the hand below your ribcage is rising and falling."
