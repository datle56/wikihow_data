      "title": "Grind up your flower until it’s in a fine powder.",
      "content": "Grind up your flower until it’s in a fine powder. For most vapes, all you need is between 0.25 grams and 0.5 grams to fill the chamber completely. Grab your marijuana nugs and place them in a grinder, then grind them down into fine chunks. If you’ve smoked flower before, the process is the same—your marijuana needs to be small enough that it will vaporize evenly. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a grinder, you can find one online or at most cannabis dispensaries. Marijuana flower, or bud, is the smokable part of the cannabis plant. It’s different from oils or vapes in that it’s the raw flower, and it hasn’t been pressed or extracted for oil."

      "title": "Load your ground flower into the chamber.",
      "content": "Load your ground flower into the chamber. All vapes are slightly different, but the ones that take flower will have a small chamber, usually on the bottom or one of the sides. Pop this chamber open and stuff your ground marijuana into it. Try to fill the whole chamber so you don’t have to keep refilling your vape over and over. When you’re done, seal the chamber carefully with the its lid or flap. [2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Most vapes require you to press down on the flower and pack it in tightly, but some don’t. If you aren't sure, check your user manual for specific instructions."

      "title": "Adjust the temperature settings if your vape has that option.",
      "content": "Adjust the temperature settings if your vape has that option. Flower vapes work by heating up your ground marijuana to release the THC and CBD into a smokable form. Not all vapes have a temperature setting, but if yours does, make sure it’s between 360 to 380 °F (182 to 193 °C). If your vape doesn’t have a temperature setting, use the power button to turn the vape on and let it warm up. [3] X Research source You can also adjust the temperature to fit your specific needs. Anything below 360 °F (182 °C) will be more mild, which is good if you’re new to smoking marijuana. Temperatures above 400 °F (204 °C) will produce a stronger effect, which is great if your tolerance is fairly high."

      "title": "Let the vape warm up.",
      "content": "Let the vape warm up. Most vapes take 2 to 5 minutes to warm up completely. If you try to use the vape too early, you might not actually inhale any marijuana. Some vapes have a small light that will turn on when they’re ready, but most don’t. [4] X Research source You can sometimes feel the vape getting warm on the inside as it heats up. Because of the high heat, flower vapes sometimes have a faint marijuana smell to them."

      "title": "Inhale through the mouth piece.",
      "content": "Inhale through the mouth piece. Bring the vape up to your lips and breathe in through the hole. Most flower vapes don’t have a button to press, but if yours does, press it while you inhale. The amount of marijuana you inhale is up to you—the more you inhale at once, the more effects you will feel. Hold the marijuana in your lungs for 5 to 10 seconds, then slowly exhale to release it. [5] X Research source Studies show that for infrequent users, vaping marijuana produces a stronger effect than smoking it.

      "title": "Throw away the marijuana when you can't taste it anymore.",
      "content": "Throw away the marijuana when you can't taste it anymore. After about a dozen hits, your marijuana will be spent. You can tell when it’s time to change it out when you take a hit out of your vape and it doesn’t taste or smell like marijuana. To reload the chamber, pop it open and dump the old marijuana out into the garbage. After that, you can reload it with fresh marijuana. [7] X Research source If you need to clean your vape, open up the chamber where the marijuana is and dump out any large Pisces, then dip a cotton swab into a bottle of isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Gently swab out the chamber to get rid of any sticky marijuana, and let the vape air dry before using it again."

      "content": "Attach your battery to a charger. An oil vape comes in 2 parts: the battery (usually a long metal piece) and the cartridge (usually a plastic piece filled with oil or resin). Before you attach a cartridge to your battery, make sure it’s fully charged by plugging it into the charger and waiting for the light to turn green. [8] X Research source Although some cannabis oil vapes claim they’re healthier than smoking flower, there’s not enough scientific evidence to back that up yet. [9] X Research source When you purchase oil cartridges, make sure you’re buying from a reputable company, and ask to see a list of ingredients to make sure there aren’t any additives. Experts recommend looking for “solvent-free oils” to avoid propylene glycol, an ingredient that can degrade at high temperatures and irritate your nose and throat.

The mouthpiece of the cartridge should stick up and point away from the battery.

Put your mouth on the mouth piece and press the button to release the vapor. You’ll taste and feel the vapor in your mouth, which is how you know your vape is working. Inhale the vapor into your lungs and hold it for 5 to 10 seconds, then slowly exhale the marijuana.
