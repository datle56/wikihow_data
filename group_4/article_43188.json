      "content": "Locate the turkey's thigh. To find the thighs, look for the drumsticks. The thigh will be directly below the drumstick and next to the breast on both sides of the turkey. [1] X Research source The thighs are dark meat, which take longer to cook than white meat, such as the breasts."

[2] X Expert Source Ollie George Cigliano Private Chef & Food Educator Expert Interview. 30 August 2021. Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh that's directly below the leg. [3] X Research source Ensure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone, which could give your thermometer a false reading."

      "content": "Check to see if the turkey has reached 165 °F (74 °C). Leave the thermometer in the thigh until it's registered the internal temperature. You can remove the turkey from the oven once it reaches 165 °F (74 °C) and stays at that temperature for at least 1 minute. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that the turkey will continue to cook once you remove it from the oven, so don't cook your turkey beyond 165 °F (74 °C) or the meat will become dry."

      "title": "Remove the turkey and rest it for 45 minutes.",
      "content": "Remove the turkey and rest it for 45 minutes. Turn off the oven and remove the roasting pan. Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and let it rest while you prepare gravy. Once the turkey has rested for 45 minutes, you can carve it. [5] X Research source The juices within the turkey will redistribute while the turkey rests. This will prevent the juices from running out of the turkey as soon as you start carving it. Since most turkeys are large and will retain heat, there's no need to cover the turkey while it rests."

      "title": "Find the thighs on the turkey.",
      "content": "Find the thighs on the turkey. If you don't have a thermometer, you'll need to determine if the turkey is done based on the part of the turkey that takes the longest to cook. Look directly below the drumsticks and next to the breasts to find the turkey's thighs. [6] X Research source Since thigh meat is muscular and dark, it takes the longest time to cook."

      "title": "Insert the tip of a knife or a skewer into the thigh.",
      "content": "Insert the tip of a knife or a skewer into the thigh. Poke the knife or skewer into the crease between the thigh and the breast. This will probably be covered with skin that you'll have to cut through. [7] X Research source You don't need to cut very deep into the thigh. Cut about 2 inches (5.1 cm) or until you see the juices start to run out."

Then put the turkey on a cutting board and let it rest, so the juices redistribute within the meat. Make a gravy with the pan juices while you wait to carve the turkey."
