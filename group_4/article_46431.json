      "content": "Determine if you need to use wall plugs, or if you can hang an item on a stud. Purchase or rent a stud finder and mark the locations on your walls. If those areas don't match up with the project, then move on to finding wall plugs and screws that will work. Installation in the center of a stud is always preferred, because it is a load-bearing support. Walls, especially dry wall, are not designed to hold large, heavy objects by themselves. Wall plugs are designed to hold a certain amount of weightâ€”so, the item you're hanging and the wall assembly you're hanging it on (block, drywall, tile, etc.) will actually dictate what type of anchor you're going to use."

      "content": "Buy a set of universal wall plugs if your item weighs less than 15 lbs. (6.8kg). If it does, the universal version is likely to work well. If possible, purchase wall plug and screw combos to ensure they will fit. If the wall plugs and screws are sold separately, test the screws by inserting them inside the plug. If it fits through the center and comes out the other end with a few mm to spare, the screw will likely work with that plug. These universal wall plugs and screws often come with hanging objects in the original packaging."

      "content": "Choose butterfly wall plugs if you are hanging light items, like paintings, in hollow walls. The plug opens up perpendicular to the wall once it's installed into panel or plasterboard. There is also a special plasterboard plug you can buy that expands like an umbrella once behind the wall."

Keep them closed and push them through the ceiling, and then the wings will sit against the inside of the ceiling material while you tighten the screw. [3] X Research source"

You will be able to compare them side-by-side to ensure the size is right.
