      "content": "Test a popcorn ceiling if your home was built between 1945 and 1980. Before 1980, asbestos was an extremely common material. Since asbestos was cheap and easy to apply to ceilings by spraying it on, it was popular for construction. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source By 1978, spray-on asbestos was banned, so homes built after this law were made using different methods. [2] X Research source If your home was built after 1980 and your ceiling is in good shape, it's better if you don't test it. If asbestos wasn't sprayed on, then your ceiling is unlikely to pose a health risk. Removing a sample might release asbestos, though."

If you do choose to use it yourself, make sure to follow all the kit's instructions to be as safe as possible. If you purchase a sampling kit, you can still hire a professional to use it for you.

This kit will contain everything you’ll need to safely remove the sample and contain it for shipping. Then, contact a certified asbestos-testing lab and ask about their sampling requirements. [8] X Expert Source Andre Kazimierski Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 26 January 2022. An asbestos kit contains a face mask, disposable coveralls, gloves, wipes, sample bags, shipping materials, and sample submission documents. Ask for instructions about how the lab wants the sample collected and sent to them. They may also have specific requirements for the size of the sample. As an extra safety precaution, hire a professional to use your asbestos sampling kit."

      "content": "Move your furniture out of the room and turn off any ventilation. Before you take your sample, empty out the room. If you can’t do that, then move the furniture and everything else far away from the sampling area and cover it all with plastic drop cloths . Then, shut any windows or doors and turn off your healing or cooling system, as well as any fans. Since even a small speck of asbestos can cause health problems, it’s a good idea to completely clear out the room where you’ll be taking a sample from. Shutting off the ventilation prevents asbestos particles from becoming airborne."

Remember that you’ll need to toss everything that you’ve worn as outer protection, including goggles and gloves. Try to buy cheap items made to be disposable.

To contain dust from any possible asbestos, place this sheeting on the floor directly underneath the part of the ceiling where you’ll take the sample. Use duct tape to secure the sheeting to the floor so that it won’t shift around. Set your ladder directly on top of the sheeting and beneath where you’ll take the sample. [10] X Research source"

Use the tip of your utility knife or chisel to form an outline around the area that you wish to remove. Don’t fully remove the piece of ceiling—instead, loosen it up. [12] X Research source Check with the EPA, your chosen testing company, or your sample kit to determine how big of a piece you’ll need. Some samples can be relatively small while other labs might need a larger piece. If the piece begins to fall out when you try to loosen it, skip ahead to the step where you'll put the sample in plastic baggies."

Place the tips of the pliers against the ceiling so they grasp the edges of the piece you've chosen for your sample. Push the plier tips deeper into the ceiling material and gently squeeze them. Slowly pull your pliers away from the ceiling, taking the sample with you. [14] X Research source If the sample is stuck in the ceiling, you may need to rock it back and forth a bit, but do this very gently so you don't loosen any potential asbestos dust. Take your time when pulling out the sample from the ceiling. If you move too fast, you risk breaking up extra popcorn and creating additional dust."

Follow the kit's directions to mail the sample to their lab for testing. [16] X Research source For extra security, place this original bag in another one and seal that, too. Use a permanent marker to write your name, your city, and the date on the bag. Some sampling kits provide additional instructions regarding labeling the bag, such as using a particular stick-on label."
