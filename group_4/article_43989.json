Keep pulling both corners all the way around your body until you can tie them at the small of your back. If done correctly, there should be no slit in the material, and the sarong should almost look like a regular skirt from the front."

After covering your hair with the sarong, one end in each hand, bunch up those ends, bring them together, and double-knot them. With the wrap in place, you can let the ends of the sarong hang down over your shoulder for style!"
