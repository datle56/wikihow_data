Work around furniture you can’t move, and make sure to move the carpet cleaner around carefully to avoid leaving marks or scratches on the furniture."

Rohr recommends going over the carpet with your regular vacuum to remove as much dirt, dust, and debris as possible first. “Before any carpet cleaning takes place, the first step is to use a traditional vacuum with a beater bar to remove the dry soil from the carpet,” he says. “I would also use a carpet rake to remove additional pet hair, if present.” [1] X Expert Source Andrew Rohr Carpet Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 15 April 2021. This prevents the dirt from being worked further into the carpeting later. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Treat heavily stained areas with a carpet shampoo (optional). Target areas that handle a lot of foot traffic, as well as any deep stains you find. A carpet cleaner alone sometimes isn't enough to clean these areas, so pre-treating with carpet shampoo can help you achieve a spotless carpet. Spray the shampoo onto the carpet directly, or blot it on with a wet paper towel, then let it soak in for about 3 minutes before operating the carpet cleaner. You can find bottles of carpet shampoo at any general store. Some carpet shampoos require different application methods, so make sure to read the instructions on the back of the bottle."

      "content": "Fill the water tank with hot water. Detach the tank on the carpet cleaner’s front end. Run your sink until the water is hot, then place the tank’s spout under the faucet. The tank should have a line, about ¾ of the way up, indicating how far to fill it up. [3] X Research source For help locating and removing the cleaner’s tanks, consult your owner’s manual. Usually, all you’ll have to do is lift up some plastic clips to free the tank."

      "content": "Add carpet cleaning formula to the water tank. Check the instruction manual to make sure you pick a carpet cleaning formula that is specially designed to work with your machine. The tank should have a second fill line above the first one; pour the formula directly into the hot water until it reaches that line. [4] X Research source Some cleaners have separate hot water and formula tanks. For these, fill the hot water tank full with water, then fill the formula tank to the fill lines with hot water and formula. You might be tempted to pour in extra cleaning formula to tackle a particularly dirty carpet, but Rohr cautions against this, as it ends up hindering the cleaning process. Instead, always use the recommended amount. [5] X Expert Source Andrew Rohr Carpet Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 15 April 2021. Keep in mind that these carpet cleaning formulas are designed to work with the carpet cleaning machine, so they’re different from the carpet shampoo you may have used to pretreat stains."

Try not to overwet areas while you clean. “If you leave the carpet and pad soaked, it can take days to dry,” cautions Rohr.
