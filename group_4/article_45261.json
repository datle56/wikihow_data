They’ll spin lies and microaggressions to make you doubt yourself. [1] X Research source One of the best ways to turn the tables on a gaslighter is to simply not listen to or engage with them. When they start gaslighting you, shrug and walk away or think about something else. Consider deleting or blocking their number so they can’t reach you."

Write down your boundaries to easily remind yourself of them. Do your best not to ignore when your boundaries are crossed. They may try to turn your boundaries against you, but remember that you are strong and capable no matter what they say."

      "content": "Outsmart a gaslighter by questioning them. Gaslighters will lie about things you know are true and accuse you of being in the wrong. Clap back at a gaslighter by gently asking them why they feel this way. More often than not, they’ll get flustered and might not be able to fully explain themselves. [7] X Research source Kill a gaslighter with kindness when questioning them. In other words, avoid being aggressive or accusatory, as this could cause them to retaliate and conjure up more stories. Try saying something like, “You say this didn’t happen, but I have a video of it. I don’t understand. Can you please clarify?”"

When they lie, try shrugging it off or saying, “Okay.” Then, take a step back as ask yourself how their comment made you feel. Focusing on your emotions inwardly can help you acknowledge a gaslighter’s tactics. [9] X Research source Try not to focus on who’s right and wrong.
