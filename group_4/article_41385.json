      "content": "Switch your cat to a bland diet. Take your cat off their usual cat food and feed them small portions of bland, unseasoned food throughout the day, like boiled skinless chicken breast and white rice (flavored with chicken broth, if you’d like). [1] X Research source Stick with 1-2 tbsp (9-18 g) of food once every 2-3 hours; if your cat responds well to the diet, give them ¼ to ½ cup (35-70 g) of food once every 4 hours. [2] X Research source Pan-fried turkey or extra-lean ground beef are possible options for this diet. You can also switch out the rice with sweet potatoes, cooked pasta, or cooked oatmeal. It’s not a great idea to feed your cat large portions of food while their GI system isn’t at 100%. [3] X Research source Once their poop starts to look solid again, transition your cat back to their usual diet. [4] X Research source Over a period of 2 weeks, add a little bit more of their original food to their meals. Once your cat is comfortable with the mixture of old and new food for 7 days straight, switch them back to their original food. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your cat hydrated as they recover. Check your cat’s water bowl often and make sure that it’s topped off with plenty of fresh, clean water. Diarrhea makes your cat lose a lot of fluids, so it’s important to keep them hydrated as they get better. [6] X Research source Pour a little bit of low-sodium chicken broth and water into your cat’s food to help boost their hydration. [7] X Research source Feel free to offer rice water, too—this is the leftover water after you've cooked rice on the stovetop. Simply combine water and rice at a 3:1 ratio on the stovetop to get the liquid you're looking for. [8] X Research source"

Shop around for fiber supplements designed specifically for cats, checking the nutritional info before you make any purchases. As a general rule of thumb, cats don’t need a lot of fiber in their diets—in fact, healthy and older cats only need 1.4-3.5% of their daily calories to be fiber. [10] X Research source Good fiber supplements: VETNIQUE LABS Glandex Feline Anal Gland Fiber Supplement Powder , kin+kind Pumpkin Boost Organic Fiber for Cats , FiberVet Fiber Supplement for Dogs and Cats Let’s say that your cat eats around 200 calories each day—that means they only need 2.8 to 7 calories worth of fiber each day. Since there are 4 calories in 1 gram of fiber, your cat would only need 0.7 to 1.75 grams of fiber each day."
