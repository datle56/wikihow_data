      "title": "Spend the evening eating like royalty at your favorite restaurant.",
      "content": "Spend the evening eating like royalty at your favorite restaurant. Invite a group of friends you’d like to hang out with and make reservations at a restaurant for your birthday evening. Indulge and pick something fancy if you can afford it, or go to your favorite restaurant and get whatever you want. Try a tapas, fondue, or family dining restaurant—somewhere that will give you dishes that can feed a whole table of people rather than everyone ordering individually. If you're having a big party and want catering, order everyone the same entre to save some cash. It'll be much cheaper than giving people an option. You could also sign up for a cooking class and make the gourmet dinner yourself—with a couple of friends helping!"

      "content": "Enjoy the great outdoors and a scrumptious meal at the same time. Maybe a celebratory meal sounds good to you, but you’re looking for a more creative venue. No problem! Find a picturesque park, a scenic viewpoint, or a beach where you and your friends can go for a picnic. Bring food, blankets, drinks, and even a tent if it’s going to be a sunny day. Planning the picnic is easier if everyone brings something. Ask each guest to bring some food, and coordinate in a group chat to ensure nobody brings the same thing. If you go to a park, you could turn a simple picnic into a whole field day! Play lawn games and outdoor team games like tug-of-war, capture the flag and relay racing. When you're planning an outdoor party, always have a backup plan in case the weather is stormy. Reader Poll: We asked 362 wikiHow readers what their go-to finger food is for a party, and only 9% of them said mini sandwiches and sliders. [Take Poll] However, sandwiches are usually a great idea for a picnic!"

[2] X Research source Make sure you have a designated driver or hire a driver to bring your group to each bar. For some variety, try hitting up different types of bars! For instance, you might visit an Irish pub, a tiki bar, a lounge, a beer garden, or a bar with live music."

      "content": "Pick a costume theme you love and encourage everyone to dress up. The sky’s the limit! In addition to costumes, be sure to get some themed decorations, snacks, and drinks for the occasion. Ensure your costume theme is broad enough to appeal to friends and family alike. You could make a couple of costumes or props for people who show up without them. For example, you might throw a Y2K-themed party and have everyone show up in early 2000s fashion. Other themes might include your favorite movie franchise, TV show, or game. Themes can also be an aesthetic or time period, like “masquerade,” “Hollywood glamor,” or “disco”"
