      "title": "Women’s intuition is an instinct for what others are feeling or thinking.",
      "content": "Women’s intuition is an instinct for what others are feeling or thinking. “Intuition” is what happens when the brain draws on past experiences and external cues (body language, facial expressions, etc.) to make a decision—this instinct happens so quickly that the reaction is almost unconscious. Scientists aren't sure exactly why women may be more in touch with their intuition, but recent studies have led many to believe that everyone has an intuitive side to them. [1] X Research source In the past, women were believed to be better at reading nonverbal cues like facial expressions and body language, however, scientists weren’t sure if this was because of women’s biology or because of how they were raised to behave based on their gender. [2] X Research source In pop culture, it was believed that women were more sensitive to emotions and could detect if something was amiss with a person or situation. There wasn’t an exact male equivalent of “female intuition.” Instead, men tend to call their intuition a “gut” instinct or feeling."

      "title": "Women were socialized to express better emotional intuition than men.",
      "content": "Women were socialized to express better emotional intuition than men. One of the leading theories about where women’s intuition comes from says that both women and men have intuition—men have just been taught to separate their hearts from their heads. For example, in a series of studies that measured the ability of men and women to intuitively predict what others were thinking or feeling, the women’s scores were similar to the men’s. However, when the scientists reminded women that they \"should\" be better at reading emotions because of the women’s intuition stereotype, the women outperformed the men. [3] X Research source Another group of researchers repeated this study but told men that they could earn money by getting the highest intuition scores. As a result, they found that money motivated men as strongly as the women's intuition stereotype motivated women. [4] X Research source The idea that women are less intelligent than men because they are more emotional is relatively outdated—female qualities like intuition are more likely just human qualities.

      "content": "Women had to develop their intuition to survive in a patriarchal society. Some scientists and psychologists have theorized that because women have historically had lower social power, they’ve spent more time observing those in power to become more attuned to their nonverbal cues. As a result, women have had to develop a higher level of emotional awareness and sensitivity to survive in a male-dominated society. [6] X Research source An older theory believed that women evolved to be more empathetic and intuitive than men to better protect their offspring from threats and decode the needs of their potential mates. [7] X Research source However, a more recent study suggests that the difference in empathy between men and women is not genetic, but is more likely based on socialization or prenatal hormones.

      "content": "Women’s brains were naturally optimized for intuitive decision-making. Women’s corpus callosum, the part that connects the right and left sides of the brain, is thicker than men’s, which may give women a better ability to integrate their emotions and intuition with the more logical side of their brain when making decisions. [9] X Research source However, scientists are still not sure if these structural differences are a result of a difference in brain function or if they are different in brain function because they’re structurally different. [10] X Research source The results of a 2013 study also suggest that male brains might be more optimized for motor skills while female brains may be more optimized for analytical and intuitive thinking.

You may sense immediately when someone else is feeling bad, or know that something is happening without needing any evidence.

If your attention is drawn to your hearing or your speech, it may mean your intuition is trying to tell you that your throat chakra needs to be healed. The throat chakra is responsible for how we communicate with others—if it’s blocked, you may have difficulty expressing yourself to others. [17] X Research source To open and unblock your throat chakra, practice healing yoga poses or meditate."

      "content": "Ground yourself and practice listening to your body’s responses. Connect with your body’s wisdom by asking yourself questions and paying attention to your solar plexus—the area of your chest just below your ribcage. Close your eyes and breathe deeply . Start by asking simple yes or no questions out loud, such as “Is my name Josh?” or “Am I wearing the color blue?” Ask a question you know is true, and then ask a question you know is a lie to feel the difference in your chest. After you’re comfortable with knowing how you feel, then move on to ask more in-depth, deep questions about the issues or choices that trouble you, such as “Is it in my highest and best interest to do this?” Pay attention to your dreams—your unconscious mind may say things that your conscious mind doesn’t pick up on. You can also listen to what your gut is telling you to develop your intuition . If you feel butterflies or queasy feelings in your stomach, it may be because your gut’s neurotransmitters are trying to tell you something important. [22] X Research source"

However, your intuition will pull you towards whatever’s in your best interest and may make you feel excitement, anticipation, or contentment. Gut feelings tend to cause your body to relax because your subconscious knows that you are making the best choice for you.

Fear can often push you to hide or compromise yourself, but intuition can do the opposite."
