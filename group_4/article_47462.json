If you are using a shortboard, wax the topside of the board from the front logo to the back edge (about two thirds of the length) and from edge to edge. [1] X Research source You can get by just fine without a basecoat wax, but your wax won't last as long. If your board doesn't have the right basecoat, the topcoat won't stick to the board, leaving you with a naked spot on your board where slipping and sliding can happen. Your basecoat should stay on the board until you re-wax your board. Your topcoat clings on to the basecoat."

      "content": "Use any one of several techniques to apply the basecoat. When it comes to getting the basecoat to stick onto the board, surfers tend to use different techniques â€” sometimes in isolation, sometimes in combination: [2] X Research source Circle pattern: Rub the wax onto the board in small circles, moving up and down the board until bumps start forming. Straight line pattern: Rub the wax onto the board in straight lines up and down the board, parallel to the rocker. Crosshatch pattern: Rub the wax onto the board on a diagonal, and then perpendicular to that diagonal, completing a crosshatch pattern. Kitchen sink: Rub the wax onto the board in any direction, using any of the patterns listed above or making your own."

      "title": "Apply the basecoat until bumps start to form.",
      "content": "Apply the basecoat until bumps start to form. Use the edge of the wax stick, not the flat side. Apply until there is a bumpy coat. Your topcoat will adhere to these little bumps. Depending on the size of your board, you may need to use an entire stick of wax, or up to two sticks, in order to get the basecoat right. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply your temperature wax.",
      "content": "Apply your temperature wax. Wax over the entirety of the area you just covered with base coat. [4] X Research source Rub the edge of the wax onto the board in small, 3 to 6 inch (7.6 to 15.2 cm) circles, or using any of the techniques listed above. To be safe, try using a different-colored topcoat wax than your basecoat. If your topcoat wax is the same color as your basecoat it will be harder to tell where you have applied it, so be sure to wax in one direction if this is the case."

      "title": "Comb the wax.",
      "content": "Comb the wax. Run your wax comb through the wax on your board. Run the comb in diagonal crosshatch lines to rough up the wax and allow you to grip to your board even better. Be sure to run it through all of the wax on the board. [5] X Research source Use the wax comb each time you surf if you haven't applied a new topcoat. Sometimes, your wax will get flat and lose some of its traction. If you don't want to apply a new layer of topcoat, take the comb-side of your comb and make a crosshatch pattern using diagonal scrapes."
