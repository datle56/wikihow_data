      "content": "Put on gloves to protect your hands from sticky resin. The marijuana plant’s resin can be difficult to wash off, and handling it in large quantities without protection might contribute to developing allergies.

      "content": "Clean your trimming shears and scissors. Use trimming shears or scissors to cut away branches without straining the muscles in your hands. [2] X Research source Disinfect your tools with isopropyl alcohol wipes to keep them ready to snip and avoid spreading pathogens between plants. [3] X Research source Marijuana plants are fragile and can be sensitive to rough treatment. Take your time, and trim carefully. Your fingers are your third tool in your trimming arsenal—you’ll pluck away the plants’ tips with your gloved fingers. Some growers use machine trimming solutions, but specialized trimming machines are pricey and not typically practical for small-scale growers."

      "content": "Arrange a few metal trays to separate your trimmings. As you trim, don’t simply discard the leaves and other cuttings—these can be used to make edibles or hashish. Set out a few cookie sheets or other wide containers near the plants you’ll be trimming. Use 1 to catch trimmed buds, and others to collect discarded plant matter. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Trim your crop when the resin is cloudy or amber-colored.",
      "content": "Trim your crop when the resin is cloudy or amber-colored. Wait to harvest until your marijuana plant has a cluster of cloudy white or reddish-brown hairs sticking out the top. These are the plant’s trichomes, which produce the THC-laden resin. As the plant ages, the resin on these trichomes changes from clear white to cloudy or amber (depending on the strain), which means your crop is ready to harvest. [5] X Research source Note that the top of the plant tends to mature faster than the bottom, so you may need to harvest different areas of the plant at different times."

      "title": "Perform a wet trim if your space is limited.",
      "content": "Perform a wet trim if your space is limited. There are 2 common methods of trimming: “wet” and “dry.” With a wet trim, you trim the plant right after harvesting, while it’s still hydrated. A wet trim makes it easier to prune leaves, speeds the drying process, and prevents mold from forming on your crop. It’s great for growers in a humid environment or with limited space that can’t fit industrial drying racks. [6] X Research source A “dry” trim, on the other hand, is performed after the plant has been hung and dehydrated. A dry trim preserves the bud’s shape and is generally less sticky. Because the plant is dry, though, you need to be extra careful not to crinkle off any trichomes."

      "title": "Clip the fan leaves.",
      "content": "Clip the fan leaves. The fan leaves are the large leaves with 5 distinct points—a large, long point in the center and two smaller points on either side. Pluck fan leaves with your fingers, scissors, or shears. [7] X Research source Some people choose to clip their fan leaves later, after they’ve cured the plant. This slows down the drying process and produces more flavorful buds."

      "title": "Trim the sugar leaves.",
      "content": "Trim the sugar leaves. The sugar leaves are those that emerge from the buds themselves. They are so short that their stems often cannot be seen. Use your scissors to carefully reach into the bud and snip them off at the stem. If you like, leave any sugar leaves that have a healthy amount of trichomes, which can contribute to the overall THC yield. [8] X Research source Trimming all the sugar leaves often makes for a smoother and more potent crop. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Snip buds off the branches, leaving some stem attached to hang them.",
      "content": "Snip buds off the branches, leaving some stem attached to hang them. Once the excess leaves are gone, use your shears or a sharp knife to sever the bud stems near the branch. Generally, it’s a good idea to leave the buds on the stem. This slows the drying process and allows you to hang the buds to dry, as opposed to using specialized drying racks. [10] X Research source If you’re in a high-humidity environment, remove the buds in order to advance the drying process. Cutting individual buds from the branches is called “bucking.”"

    {
      "title": "Hang the branches to cure.",
      "content": "Hang the branches to cure. When the bud-bearing branches have been removed and partitioned into individual pieces, it’s time to dry and cure them. Using string or twist ties, hang the branches on your laundry line in a well-ventilated area so that all parts are exposed to air. Hang your plants in a room with a temperature of about 60–70 °F (16–21 °C) for 1-3 months. [11] X Research source Keep a fan or window open in the room to improve ventilation. Use a humidity meter to ensure the humidity level of the room never drops below 50%. Don't expose your harvested plants to direct sunlight, heat, or moisture. The latter is especially bad, as it can produce mold, which can ruin a crop. Your crop is done curing once the buds are springy when you touch them, and the stems snap easily rather than bend."

      "title": "Pluck the dried buds from the stems.",
      "content": "Pluck the dried buds from the stems. Once dry and ready, use your fingers to carefully pinch the buds away from the greater stems. Then, clip the rest of the leaves from all of the branches. Store these in airtight containers. [12] X Research source Once a marijuana plant has been totally trimmed of its buds and leaves, place it in your compost bin or put it out with the rubbish."

      "title": "Remove dead fan leaves leading up to harvest time.",
      "content": "Remove dead fan leaves leading up to harvest time. As harvest time approaches, reach into the branches of the live plant and remove all of the dead and dying fan leaves (identifiable by their yellow hue) from the branches. This process allows the plant to focus as much energy as possible on growing healthy leaves, rather than wasting energy maintaining leaves that may die anyway. A gentle tug, sometimes firm, is all that's required to remove most dead leaves. Trimming away dying plant leaves also lets more sunlight through to the lower parts of the plant, helping you grow better marijuana ."

      "title": "Cut all branches and shoots that are not directly connected to the trunk.",
      "content": "Cut all branches and shoots that are not directly connected to the trunk. As branches grow out from the main stalk of the plant, they in turn develop shoots and branches of their own. However, they will struggle to get enough light and sap energy from the leaves located at the ends of the main branches. Trim these leaves and shoots away at the base with heavier pruning shears for a clean cut. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "“FIM” or top your plant.",
      "content": "“FIM” or top your plant. FIMing refers to the process of cutting the topmost vegetation (known as a \"top\") from your plant in order to double the number of buds it produces, and causing the plant to grow out instead of up. \"Topping\" means to remove the whole topmost shoot down to the base. Both techniques encourage greater bud growth, making the most of limited growing space. [14] X Research source To FIM your marijuana plant, locate a new shoot, then use your shears or other trimming instrument to snip 2/3 of the shoot’s length. The term “FIM” comes from the phrase, “F***, I missed,” often said when a grower makes a mistake while topping, which is where the practice originated."

      "content": "Super crop your plant to encourage stronger branch growth. Select a mature green branch. With both hands, gently bend the branch back and forth until you hear the branch crack and see a bit of white discoloration. Finally, rest the bent branch on top of or against a nearby branch to support its weight. Super cropping causes the plant to heal and rebuild a stronger branch, allowing for more efficient circulation of nutrients and water within the plant."

      "title": "Trim your marijuana plant about twice a month.",
      "content": "Trim your marijuana plant about twice a month. After trimming your plant, it needs time to recover and heal. Your plant will often only need to be trimmed twice a month. Prune more often, every 3-4 days, during your plant’s early vegetative stage (when it first produces leaves) and toward the end of its flowering (bud-producing) stage. [15] X Research source"
