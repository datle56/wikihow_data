It will always be identified with the prefix ISBN and will be either 10 or 13 digits long. The ISBN should also be available on the copyright page. [1] X Research source It is separated into four parts, each separated by a hyphen. For example, the ISBN for the classic cookbook The Joy of Cooking is 0-7432-4626-8. Books published before 2007 were given 10 digit ISBNs. From 2007 on, they have been given 13 digit identifiers. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine the publisher. One of the most interesting things you can learn about a book with the ISBN is the publisher’s scale of operations. 10 and 13 digit ISBNs have their own ways of identifying the publisher and the title. If the publisher identifier is long, but the title number is only one or two digits, the publisher only plans on releasing a handful of books and the book might even be self-published. Conversely, if the title string is long and the publisher string is short, the book was released by a major publisher. [3] X Research source"

You can purchase an ISBN number at ISBN.org. You will need to purchase an ISBN number for each title you plan to publish and for different editions of the title, including hardback and paperback versions. The more ISBN numbers you purchase at time, the cheaper it will be. Each nation has its own ISBN granting corporation.
