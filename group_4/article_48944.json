      "content": "Set up notifications on your eBay account. Log in to your account and click on the “Account” tab. Go to “Communication Preferences” on the left-hand side and set all of the notifications to real-time. It’s important to receive notifications when someone outbids you or the price on an item changes so that you can update your bids."

      "content": "Look at when auctions end and set reminders to check on them. Set up reminders on your computer or phone to check on auctions on their last day. The last day is when prices will really start going up so you will have a better idea of how much you need to bid. Make sure you will be able to bid on an item before it ends and set any necessary reminders to do this at a time when you won’t be busy."

      "title": "Use eBay’s automatic bidding system and enter the max you want to pay.",
      "content": "Use eBay’s automatic bidding system and enter the max you want to pay. eBay will automatically bid on an item for you up to the highest amount you are willing to pay. Take advantage of this so that you don’t have to keep manually increasing your bid. Don’t bid too high early on or you can unnecessarily drive up the price of an item. Your maximum bid does not mean you will pay exactly that amount if you win. You will only pay the amount you need to beat the next highest bidder."

      "title": "Look for items listed with spelling mistakes.",
      "content": "Look for items listed with spelling mistakes. Many sellers make small mistakes when listing their items for sale. Look for items listed with one letter off in the name or common misspellings. [1] X Research source Items listed incorrectly will have less competition bidding for them because not as many people find them."

      "title": "Look at when the auction ends and set a reminder for 2 minutes before.",
      "content": "Look at when the auction ends and set a reminder for 2 minutes before. Check the upper right-hand corner of an item’s auction to see how much time is remaining. Set a reminder on your computer or phone to go to the page 2 minutes before it ends. The sniping strategy only requires you to place a bid seconds before an auction ends, but it is best to log in a bit earlier to give yourself plenty of time."

      "title": "Log in to eBay and go to the item’s page 2 minutes before the auction ends.",
      "content": "Log in to eBay and go to the item’s page 2 minutes before the auction ends. Hang out on the auction page and wait for just before the end of the auction. Don’t place a bid yet but keep and eye on the bid prices. [2] X Research source The sniping technique keeps you from unnecessarily driving up the price of an item by only placing your bid at the last minute. You can also use special software to automatically place sniping bids for you. Keep in mind that you will have to provide your eBay login info to these services, but it will save you from having to do the work yourself."

      "title": "Wait until 10 seconds before the auction ends then place a bid.",
      "content": "Wait until 10 seconds before the auction ends then place a bid. Enter the maximum amount of money you are willing to pay when there are only 10 seconds remaining in the auction. eBay’s automatic bidding system will only make you pay what you need to beat the next highest bid. [3] X Research source The idea behind sniping is that you don’t give anyone else enough time to react and beat your bid. Bidding manually is the best way to beat other people who are using sniping software. It is considered acceptable to use sniping software on eBay."

      "title": "Keep an eye on the bid price and place another higher one if you need to.",
      "content": "Keep an eye on the bid price and place another higher one if you need to. Occasionally other people may be using the same bidding strategy as you, or automatic sniping tools, and may outbid you. Try to sneak in another bid in the last few seconds if you see this happen. [4] X Research source You can often win auctions with this strategy, but your bid can always be beaten by someone who manages to get one in at the last moment before an auction ends, so it is not a guaranteed strategy to win auctions. Sniping keeps prices on items lower, but it does not necessarily mean you will end up paying less than an item is worth. Sniping is a controversial bidding strategy among eBay users, however it is allowed by eBay itself."
