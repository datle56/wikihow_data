      "content": "Remind yourself that you don't need anyone's approval. If you're especially sensitive to how people treat you and you often overreact, you might have a strong radar for rejection. You worry that you're doing something wrong if you pick up on any kind of displeasure, and you want to fix it. However, it is important to understand that just because someone isn't happy with you doesn't mean you've done something wrong. In many cases, it means that person isn't happy with themselves and expects you to fill in the blanks (which is impossible).

Sometimes, sensitivity is a product of having people be especially harsh or mean to you, or abandoning you, in the past. Consider your childhood, teen years, and later experiences (if any). Past experiences with rejection, judgment, and abandonment may make you especially sensitive to these things. People with overly critical parents or guardians may end up especially sensitive as a result (and may show signs of anxiety or depression). [2] X Research source Untangling some of these feelings might help you understand why you feel this way. Reader Poll: We asked 251 wikiHow readers if they felt that their self-esteem had been impacted by the way their parents treat them, and 50% of them said yes .

It can also be a sign of codependence . You may need to work on self-soothing and separating your own feelings from other people's. Just become someone else feels stressed doesn't mean you have to feel that way. Remember that other people's emotions are their problems, not yours. You can help with their problems, but you are not ultimately responsible for them."

We become more susceptible to someone’s opinions if we are feeling doubtful and placing too much of our own self-worth on the opinions and actions of others. When you are confident in your abilities, another person’s rude behavior or negative opinion will be less likely to affect you. Feeling proud and confident in your own skills is more important than the passing opinions of others. Write a list of your strengths and abilities to remember what your strong points are. Make a list of things or moments that you’re proud of. Reward yourself for these good things. Think about the sorts of skills that you demonstrate during these moments. How can you do more of those things? This will help build your self-confidence. Remember, there are benefits to being a sensitive person—you can see more deeply into interactions with other people, for instance.

There are a number of strategies to help you stop ruminating over a problem. Some of these include: Try mindfulness exercises. Be present in the moment, which will bring you away from a previous moment that you’re ruminating about. Take a walk. Get a change of scenery to distract your mind from the problem.
