Keep your skin clean and follow your preventive skincare regimen as closely as possible, wearing makeup only when needed. Note that, for some people with acne problems, even non-comedogenic products clog their skin and cause pimples. Test all makeup products and replace them if they start to clog your skin."

[10] X Expert Source Mohiba Tareen, MD FAAD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 26 March 2020. Sweat and moisture on your skin increases the chances of pimple formation, so rinsing off sooner rather than later can help to prevent this problem. This is the exception to the washing your face only twice daily rule — it's okay to wash once in the morning, once after working out, and once before bed. Also, wear loose-fitting clothing. Areas that are covered by tight-fitting clothing, where moisture and sweat can collect (such as under a sports bra or tight-fitting shirt), are often where breakouts occur."

[11] X Research source You will want to use water-based cosmetics (labeled \"non-comedogenic\") rather than oil-based ones, as these will help to prevent your pores from getting clogged. Also, only use makeup when needed, as any skin products, including those that are labeled as \"non-comedogenic,\" are worse for your pores than wearing no makeup at all. When you are done wearing makeup, wash it off your face. Always remove your makeup before going to bed at night, as this will give your pores a chance to clear during the night.

[13] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If you find that you are unable to control or prevent acne breakouts using skin care strategies alone, speak to your doctor about other options. Common medical treatments for persistent or recurrent acne breakouts include: Using topical acne creams. These usually contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient, and the formulations provided from your doctor can be more potent and effective than those available at your local pharmacy or drugstore. Taking oral antibiotics. Because acne is linked to bacteria on your skin, taking an oral antibiotic such as minocycline can help to diminish outbreaks. Using the birth control pill. For women with acne, the hormones provided in the birth control pill (namely, the boost of estrogen) can help to prevent acne breakouts. This is because acne is fuelled by androgens such as testosterone, so raising female hormones can help to counterbalance the effect of the testosterone that is present in all of us (both women and men have testosterone — the difference is that men have more of it). Taking isotretinoin. Also known as Accutane, isotretinoin is a powerful medication to prevent acne and is used only in more severe cases, as it can have serious side effects. Speak to your doctor if you think this may apply to you. If you are planning to get pregnant, isotretinoin should be avoided, as it is known to cause birth defects."
