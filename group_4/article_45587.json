      "content": "Start preparing for 7-Star Tera Raid Battles as soon as possible. While there's more than one way to win these battles, the tips below can help you prepare to complete these extra-hard endgame fights: [5] X Research source Select the right Pokémon for the battle. The absolute best physical attacker is Ogerpon, but you can also use Ursaluna, Annihilape, Iron Hands, Koraidon, Azumarill, or Chesnaught. The absolute best special attacker is Arceus, but you can also use Calyrex (Shadow Rider), Miraidon, Magearna, Manaphy, Munkidori, or Hoopa Unbound. The absolute best support Pokémon is Mew, but you can also use Grimmsnarl, Clefairy, or Toxapex. Level your Pokémon to level 100, as 7-Star Tera Raid Pokémon are also level 100. Use an Adamant or Modest Mint to change their nature to Adamant or Modest. Nature Mints can be bought at Chansey Supply. Select an individual Pokémon with good IVs , then Hyper Train them. The NPC that will Hyper Train your Pokémon is located in Montenevera. EV train your Pokémon to 252 HP and 252 Attack/Special Attack. The fastest way to EV train is with Vitamins, but it is expensive. However, earning money in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is much quicker than previous games."
