      "title": "Anticipate your biting.",
      "content": "Anticipate your biting. Notice when you bite, and reflect on how you feel. You might have the habit of biting your lips when you're feeling anxious, or bored. Tell yourself when you are about to enter a situation that might prompt biting, so you will be on the alert. In many cases, biting is just one of several physical signs that you're feeling anxious. Other signs include shallow breathing, a faster heartbeat, blushing and sweating. When you feel one of these other symptoms, be ready to stop yourself from biting."

      "title": "Use the competing response technique.",
      "content": "Use the competing response technique. When you feel the urge to bite, do something else that makes it impossible. Lick your lips, or rub a finger across them. Lightly bite a pencil or small cushion, or do something that makes it impossible to bite, such as breathing with your mouth open, speaking, or singing. This technique is used to treat deeply engrained compulsions, along with relaxation techniques and cognitive behavioral therapy. [1] X Research source Try this routine: when you want to bite, breathe deeply from your diaphragm for 60 seconds, relax your muscles one by one, then use your competing response for 60 seconds. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Substitute other movements, such as pursing your lips, chewing gum, whistling, or yawning. Remember not to touch your lips or face, as this can be unsanitary and cause later problems, such as pesky acne! Ask your doctor or therapist for advice on developing your competing response technique. The same moves don't work for everyone."

      "title": "Block your bites.",
      "content": "Block your bites. Wearing an unpleasant-tasting lip balm can help remind you not to bite your lips. Try a medicated one meant to cure chapped lips or block the sun. If you are training yourself to lick instead of biting, try wearing a sweet-tasting lip balm, like mint or fresh vanilla. [3] X Expert Source Tymia Yvette Makeup & Lash Artist Expert Interview. 22 April 2020. The taste and smell of the balm will help you think about licking your lips instead of biting. You can also apply the lip balm or lipstick when you have the urge to bite. Rub a little mentholated lip conditioner right below your nose as a reminder. If you are in a situation that triggers your lip biting, try sucking on hard candy, chewing gum, or wearing a mouth guard."

      "title": "Visit your doctor.",
      "content": "Visit your doctor. A doctor can help you isolate the cause of your biting, or can refer you to a specialist. Serious chewing and biting that causes bleeding, scarring or another damage to your lip or mouth requires medical attention. Lip biting is often a symptom of anxiety, but it can also be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or body-focused repetitive behavior (BFRB). Lip biting can be a tic. These are most common in young men and often disappear without treatment after a few months. A doctor can help you eliminate other possible causes. [4] X Research source Ask your dentist about acquiring a mouth guard for help with lip biting, chewing, and clenching. If you tend to bite at night or during sedentary activities such as reading, watching television, or studying, these can be extremely helpful."

      "content": "Seek the help of a therapist. Whether you bite your lips due to anxiety or a severe compulsion, getting therapy is more effective than medication. Your therapist will likely train you in habit reversal. This will involve mindfulness techniques, relaxation techniques, and competing response techniques. Ask for a referral for a therapist with experience treating compulsions and anxiety. [5] X Research source Ask your therapist about cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on the relationships between thoughts and behaviors. Support groups can also be helpful, especially if you don't know other people who understand what you're going through.

      "content": "Talk with a psychiatrist about anxiety medication. If nothing seems to be helping, you may have an anxiety disorder that could be mitigated with medication. Generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other anxiety disorders don't always respond to talk therapy. Depending on your diagnosis and health profile, a psychiatrist might prescribe a medication to treat your anxiety.

      "content": "See a dentist to get your teeth checked. In some cases, biting is triggered by the structure of your mouth. If your teeth are misaligned, your body might be unconsciously trying to realign them by placing your lips between them. If you have an overbite or another type of misalignment that you think might be causing your biting, see a dentist so you can discuss how to fix it. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A dentist will be able to let you know whether misalignment is a factor in your biting. Treatments may include getting braces or a retainer to correct the issue. Once your teeth are aligned, you should stop biting."

      "content": "Ice your wounds. If you bite down on your lip or cheek by accident, you might create a lump. It can be difficult to avoid biting down on the protrusion as it heals. To help prevent repeated accidental bites, ice your bump on and off until the swelling subsides. Put a wedge of cloth in your mouth during sedentary activities to prevent mindless accidental biting."

      "content": "Chew wisely. You might accidentally bite yourself if you eat quickly or have a misaligned jaw. Like another accidental biting, one bite can put you at risk for repeated and increasingly painful bites. If you bite your lip or cheek while chewing, give your mouth time to heal. Eat soft foods like yogurt, applesauce, and soup for a few days until the swelling goes down."

      "content": "Practice deep breathing. Deep breathing, also called diaphragmatic breathing, helps you relax both physically and mentally. Research has shown that using this technique during times of stress helps alleviate symptoms of stress like lip biting and other bad habits. When you feel the urge to bite your lips, try doing this instead: [11] X Research source Sit up straight so that your torso is perpendicular to the ground. Take slow, controlled breaths that fill your abdomen. You should feel your stomach moving in and out. If your chest is moving up and down, you're breathing is too shallow. Focus on breathing deeper. Continue deep breathing until you feel relaxed and no longer want to bite your lips. Deep breathing is commonly included as a step in habit reversal techniques."

      "content": "Practice progressive muscle relaxation. This is another physical technique with profound mental effects. It takes several minutes to complete. Do this technique in times of great stress to resettle yourself and stop the urge to bite your lips. Like deep breathing, this is also a common step in habit reversal techniques. [12] X Research source Tense the muscles in your arms as hard as you can. Breathe in deeply and hold your muscles tight for five seconds. Exhale and release the tension at the same time. Stay completely relaxed for 15 seconds. Choose another muscle group to tense for five seconds. Try your legs, torso, buttocks or jaw. Continue alternating between tensing and relaxing until you've gotten to all the main muscle groups. Keep going until the urge to bite your lips passes. You may need to rotate between muscle groups for up to fifteen minutes."

      "content": "Practice mindfulness. Mindfulness is the act of being fully in the present. When you pay more attention to your body and how it feels, you'll be less likely to bite your lips absent-mindedly. Mindfulness takes a bit of practice, but once you get the hang of it you can use this technique anytime, anywhere to great effect. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When you feel anxious, immediately focus on your five senses. What do you see in front of you? What do you taste in your mouth? What do you hear around you? What do you feel with your hands? What do you smell in the air? Keep focusing on your physical state until you ride out the anxious thoughts. If you're having trouble focusing, try the quick trick of looking at your hands while you clasp them together. This will help to ground you in your body immediately."
