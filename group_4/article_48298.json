      "content": "A partition is a division of a disk drive that is a specific size. The computer's operating system (i.e, macOS) treats each partition as a separate disk drive. When you partition a disk drive, you are asked to select how much storage space you want to allocate to the partition on the disk drive, as well as what format you want to use for the disk drive."

It also determines what code is used to boot from the hard drive, if Every operating system has different partition schemes that they support and don't support. MacOS has three partition schemes that it supports. You can choose which scheme you want to use when you erase and format a hard disk. [2] X Research source A disk drive can only have one partition scheme. You can not select a different partition scheme for different partitions."

Other formats are compatible with a wide variety of computer systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and other electronic devices, such as cameras or game consoles."

It is the bootable standard for computers that use united extensible firmware interlace (UEFI). It is the standard for all the latest versions of Windows, macOS and Linux. However, older Power PC Macs and other non-intel-based Macintosh computers and non-UEFI based computers running a 32-bit version of Windows will not be able to boot from this partition map."

Master Boot Record only supports drives that have less than 2 TB storage space and less than 4 primary partitions. You only need to use Master Boot Record if you are making a bootable drive that is compatible with non-UEFI computers running a 32-bit version of Windows.

It is optimized for solid-state drives (SSD) and Flash storage drives, though it can be used on older hard disk drives (HDD) as well. It is not compatible with Windows or other devices. You can also select APFS Encrypted or APFS Case-sensitive. [3] X Research source APFS Encrypted keeps the data on the hard drive secure by requiring you to enter a password in order to access the data on the hard drive. APS Case-sensitive organizes the file system so that all folders and files on the system are sensitive to letter capitalization. On a case-sensitive partition, two folders called \"Documents\" and \"DOCUMENTS\" would be two separate folders. Using the non-case sensitive format, they would both be the same folder."
