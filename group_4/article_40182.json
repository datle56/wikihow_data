      "content": "In AAVE, soul sister means a Black woman. While soul sister has now taken on a more spiritual context, its original meaning still stands. The phrase is typically used by Black women to greet other Black women. The first known usage of the term was in 1959. [2] X Research source For example, if someone saw her Black friend, they might say, “There’s my soul sister.” Because the term is widely used in AAVE (African-American Vernacular English), it may not be appropriate to call someone soul sister in this context if you are not Black yourself."
