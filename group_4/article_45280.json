      "content": "This message usually occurs when a third-party app exceeds the maximum number of API calls in an hour. The X API (application programming interface) is what third-party apps use to request and send information to X servers. X places a maximum number of API calls an account can make using a third-party app per hour. This only applies to third-party apps. It does not apply to the official X website or the X platform app. [1] X Research source Any time a third-party requests data from the X platform servers, it counts as an API call. Checking DMs or replies counts as an API call. Requesting data from X counts as an API call. However, sending data to X (posting, direct messaging , favoriting, or following/unfollowing) does not count as an API call. A third-party app is any app that requires you to log in to X that is not the X platform itself. Third-party apps can be any application that manages and schedules tweets, like X Pro , formerly called TweetDeck. As of 2011, X Pro is no longer technically a third party app, but still maintains the same usage and purposes. Other social media websites have a crossposting feature to post on multiple platforms. It can also be a desktop or web application or a widget on your phone. It can also be an internal application that developers create to study and analyze data on X. While you won't be able to use the third-party app when your rate limit is exceeded, you'll still be able to use the X website or mobile app."

If you exceed one of X's limits, you will generally receive an error message that specifically says what limit you have exceeded: [2] X Research source Max number of tweets per day: 2400 Max number of DMs per day: 500 Max number of accounts you can follow per day: 400 Max number of accounts you can follow in total: 5000 Max number of changes to your account you can make per hour: 4"

      "content": "Third-party apps can make up to 100 API calls per hour. However, different actions can count as more than one API call. For example, refreshing your page takes three API calls because it will request all Tweets, replies, and DMs. There are some exceptions to the 100 API call limit. The following are just a few examples: [3] X Research source Requesting information about why users create, delete, or update X lists allows 300 requests per 15-minute interval. Requesting information on who users follow and like allows 900 requests per 15-minute interval. Requesting information about who liked a tweet and/or what tweets they liked, allows for 75 requests per 15-minute interval."

      "content": "There are a few reasons X places a limit on the number of API calls. The following are some of the reasons X has this policy: Keep the servers running. X gets tons of API calls at any given moment. Limiting the number of API calls a user helps ensure that the servers don't get overloaded and can keep up with demand. Prevent spam and hacking. Limiting the number of API call requests also prevents users from sending out spam in the form of mass tweets. It also prevents distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks from hackers."
