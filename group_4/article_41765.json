      "content": "Prepare the shoes for stretching. Depending on what your shoes are made out of, you will need to either dampen them or heat them up. This method will work for most materials, including synthetics. Keep in mind, however, that leather stretches more than synthetic materials, such as vinyl and fabric. Dampen leather or fabric shoes. Warm water is the easiest, but can stain or discolor the leather. A leather stretching solution would be safer, if you can find it. Heat shoes made from vinyl or urethane with a hairdryer. Keep in mind that this can damage some vinyl or urethane surfaces."

[3] X Research source Place them onto your feet and wear them until they dry. The wet material will stretch to the shape of your foot, and it will keep that shape once it dries. This method is best for stretching shoes in the toe area. It is not good for lengthening shoes. This method works best on shoes made from canvas , leather, and microfiber. If you have very sensitive skin, consider diluting the rubbing alcohol with some water first. You can also use just plain water. Consider doing a spot test first. Some materials do not react well with rubbing alcohol. [4] X Research source"

Dampen them every four to eight hours, as needed. Let the shoes dry fully before you take the newspaper out and try them on. If you are worried about the ink staining your shoe, you can use a paper bag or butcher paper instead. You can also use olive oil, Goo Gone, or even petroleum jelly, but keep in mind that these may stain your shoe. Use the oil only once during the 24 hour period."
