      "content": "Get to know the great heroes of Greek mythology. While the same gods appear in myth after myth, they are rarely the protagonists, the leading characters of Greek myths, who are typically human or half-human (quite a few have one divine parent). These heroes are famous for a variety of reasons, from fighting monsters to winning glory on the battlefield to suffering family tragedies. The most famous include: [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Heracles (Hercules) – He was the strongest human, but he also had a horrible temper. He completed 12 labors to absolve the guilt of killing his own family in a fit of madness. Perseus – Cast into the sea in a chest as a child; defeated the Gorgon Medusa and the Kraken; and married Andromeda. Theseus – A cousin of Hercules, he was as wise as Hercules was strong. He defeated the Minotaur and escaped the labyrinth on Crete and became the king of Athens. Achilles – The hero of Homer’s Iliad , which tells the tale of the Trojan War. His mother, the nymph Thetis, dipped him in the river Styx as a child to make him immortal, but since she held him by the heel, this part of him remained vulnerable. (This was considered punishment for not fully trusting the gods.) After killing Hector, the greatest warrior of the Trojans, he is struck in the heel by a poisoned arrow and dies. Odysseus – The hero of Homer’s Odyssey . He had the idea for the Trojan horse – a giant hollow horse with Greek warriors hidden inside – which was used to defeat Troy. After the war, he spent 10 years returning home, battling monsters, gods, and witches along the way. Jason – Set sail with the Argonauts, and after fighting off monsters and Sirens, found the golden fleece with the help of the witch Medea, who fell in love with him."

      "content": "Study the major myths. While the heroes each have their own stories, there are a number of other myths featuring less prominent protagonists that have become famous, such as the story of Narcissus, who was so vain that he became transfixed upon seeing his reflection in a pond, and stayed staring at it until he died. Other important myths include: [4] X Research source Sisyphus – A trickster who cheated the gods more than once, he is famous for his punishment after death: in the underworld of Hades, he is condemned to forever roll a boulder to the top of a steep hill; and as soon as the boulder reaches the top, it rolls down the far side and he must start again. Tantalus – Tantalus was a favorite of the gods, and invited them to a feast at his home, where he had his own son cooked up and served to them. This was not a good idea. He, too, became famous for his punishment: forever standing in a pool of clean water, with delicious fruits hanging from trees overhead. Yet when he reached for the fruit, the wind tossed the branches out of reach, and when he bent down to drink, the water drained away. Pygmalion and Galatea – Pygmalion was a sculptor who created a statue so beautiful and lifelike that he fell in love with it. Aphrodite took pity on him and brought the statue to life as the woman Galatea. Persephone – The beautiful daughter of Demeter, goddess of the harvest, she was abducted by Hades, who took her to the underworld to be his wife. She was forced to dwell there four months a year, while she could spend the rest of the time on earth. This myth explains the seasons: the winter months are the ones in which she is in Hades. Midas and the Golden Touch – King of Phrygia, Midas found favor with the god Dionysus who offered to grant him whatever he wished. He asked for the power to turn whatever he touched to gold, and then quickly realized his mistake, when everything he tried to eat or drink turned to gold. Prometheus the Fire Thief – He stole the fire of the Zeus and taught mankind how to use it. As a punishment, he was chained to a rock and each day an eagle came and ate out his liver, which was magically restored overnight. Europa – A woman so beautiful that Zeus fell in love with her. He came to her in the guise of a beautiful white bull, and bowed before her. When she climbed on his back, he carried her to a cave where he revealed his true nature. Europe is named after her. Daedalus and Icarus – Daedalus designed the labyrinth on Crete, where king Minos later had him and his son Icarus imprisoned. Daedalus built wings of wax and feathers for himself and his son so they could fly to freedom, but Icarus flew too high and his wax wings melted. He fell and drowned in the Icarian Seas, which was named after him. Orpheus and Eurydice – Orpheus was a great musician. When his love Eurydice died, he went down to the underworld and played his lyre so beautifully that Hades agreed to let Eurydice go, so long as Orpheus agreed not to look on her until they reached the surface. But Orpheus worried that he had been tricked. He looked back only a few feet from the surface, only to see Eurydice be whisked away back to the underworld because he had looked too soon."

      "title": "Start with an introductory text.",
      "content": "Start with an introductory text. There are several authors who have synthesized multiple ancient Greek authors in order to create compendiums of mythology. Some books to consider include: Jenny March's The Penguin Book of Classical Myths (2009) – Professor March's work provides a clear, easy to read retelling of the major myths, alongside the latest scholarship on their origins, development, and meanings. Richard Buxton's The Complete World of Greek Mythology (2004) – Buxton offers an overview of mythology, placing the myths in their social and cultural context. His book is also packed with extras such as genealogical tables and beautiful illustrations. Edith Hamilton’s Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes (1942) – Hamilton draws on all the great Greek writers, and some Roman ones, too, in compiling her introductory text that covers all the key gods and myths. Timothy Gantz’s Early Greek Myth: A Guide to Literary and Artistic Sources (1993) – Gant’s book is the most scholarly, and also the densest introduction to Greek mythology. He draws on both early Greek writers and art in order to recreate the myths as they were in the days of Homer and Aeschylus. [5] X Research source Robert Graves’s The Greek Myths (1956) – Graves is a sort of anti-Gantz. He is a wonderful writer, and his myths make for an easy and enjoyable introduction to Greek mythology. His scholarship, on the other hand, is decidedly sub-par, and his theories of the origins of Greek mythology and the relations between its cast of characters have been more or less all disproven."

Regardless of its authorship, this compendium brings together most of the major Greek myths and orders them in a way that is still used by the writers of compendiums today.
