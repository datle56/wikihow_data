Arabic is very different than English, so it is important to have some kind of grammar book to assist you in your language education, especially if you are a beginner learner of the language. Here are a few books to consider to help you learn the foundational elements of Arabic grammar: Teaching and Learning Arabic as a Foreign Language: A Guide for Teachers by Karin C. Ryding. This book was published by Georgetown University Press in 2013. The Arabic Alphabet: How to Read and Write It by Nicholas Awde and Putros Samano.

While there are many heralded programs that can cost and arm and a leg (like Rosetta Stone), there are also quite a few online tutorials that offer guidance at no cost. Here are a few of the most reputable free online Arabic language learning sources: Salaam Arabic, hosted by Pangaea Learning, offers free online tutorials in learning Arabic. The lessons are broken down by category: Numbers, Days, Greetings, Religion, Subject Pronouns, etc. There are even some grammar sections for beginner and intermediate learners.

      "content": "Learn the Arabic alphabet. Arabic letters and text and read horizontally from right to left (the opposite of English and other European languages). Some sounds/letters that exist in the English alphabet can't be found in the Arabic alphabet, and vice versa. [6] X Research source Use an online source, such as Salaam Arabic, to memorize the Arabic alphabet. Websites like this usually have audio pronunciation guides to help you learn how to say each letter correctly. (ت is taa or \"t\", ب is baa or \"b\", and so on). Additionally, short vowels aren't written in Arabic as letters, but as symbols (called harakat or tashkel ) that are written above or below the consonants to indicate a vowel sound."

      "content": "Learn some basic words. When learning a new language, it is important to familiarize yourself with some of the basic words so that you can get comfortable with pronunciation and start building your knowledge of the language. Here are a few of the most basic Arabic words that you should memorize. [7] X Research source \"مرحبًا\", or Marhaban , is the formal word for \"Hello.\" \"مع السّلامة\", or Maᶜa ssalamah , is the word for \"Goodbye.\" \"أهلًا وسهلًا بكَ\", or Aahlan wa sahlan bika , is the word for \"Welcome\" addressed to a male. \"أهلًا وسهلًا بكِ\", or Aahlan wa sahlan biki , is the word for \"Welcome\" addressed to a female. Tanween ( ـً , ـٍ , ـٌ ) is the addition of one of three vowel diacritics (harakat) to the end of a noun or adjective. It's used to indicate the word ends in a nasal sound without adding the actual letter \"nun\" (ن). Notice how in the words ‘سهلًا’ (Sahlan), ‘أهلًا’ (Ahlan), and ‘مرحبًا’ (Marhaban), the nasal ‘n’ sound is present even though the letter (ن) is not included in the written word. This is an example of tanween. \"كبير\", or Kabeer , is the word for \"big.\" \"صغير\", or Sagheer , is the word for \"small.\" \"اليوم\", or Alyawm , is the word for \"today.\" \"واحد\", \"اثنان\", \"ثلاثة\", or wahed, ithnaan, thalatha , are the words for \"one, two, three.\" \"أَكْل\", or aakl , is the word for \"food.\" \"ذهب\", or zahaba , is the word for \"to go.\""

      "title": "Make vocabulary flashcards.",
      "content": "Make vocabulary flashcards. The only way to learn a new language is to start memorizing the words. Make flashcards with the word in Arabic on one side and the same word in English on the other side. You can use them to test your memory. Plus, flashcards are less bulky than textbooks, so you can take the flashcards with you and practice whenever you have a free moment. It might be helpful to group words together by meaning as you learn. Unlike English, Arabic uses roots that will indicate and allow Arabic speakers to anticipate the meaning or context of a word. For instance, in English, words like computer, keyboard, and internet may be related ideas or objects but they do not sound similar. In Arabic, related words are also related sonically."

      "content": "Learn the basic sentence structure. Arabic sentences are usually constructed in this order: verb-subject-direct object. [8] X Research source This is one of the main reasons why it differs so much from English, which typically structures its sentences subject-verb-direct object. Some Arabic sentences, however, exclude verbs altogether because they have an implied \"to be\". These sentences start with a noun and are called nominal sentences . [9] X Research source For example, الولد مصري, or al-walad miSri , means \"The boy is Egyptian,\" but there is no verb. So, literally translated, it means \"The boy Egyptian.\""
