      "content": "Splurge on the real thing. Birkenstock is a brand, not a style, and the shoes can be expensive, costing over $100 a pair. Other companies make less expensive knock-offs, some for as low as $25. However, real Birkenstocks are well-made and long-lasting, with special patented soles. [1] X Research source There are a number of ways to make sure your Birkenstocks are authentic and not fake. Birkenstocks come in a Birkenstock-branded box, not a plain box or plastic bag. The logo, registered trademark, and words \"Made in Germany\" are stamped on the footbed of every shoe. Real Birkenstocks are never made in China. The Birkenstock logo also appears on the inner side of each shoe, and on every buckle and button. Knock-off Birkenstocks are heavier than the real thing, and might have clumps of glue holding the shoes together. To be sure you're getting real Birkenstocks, buy them from an authorized Birkenstock retailer. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a two-strap Birkenstock for a classic and versatile look. This style, with a strap over the toes and one over the top of the foot, is the iconic Birkenstock. It works in many settings, from a beach resort town to a fashion runway. The two-strap Arizona model is the brand's top-seller. [3] X Research source If you find the straps on the Arizona too bulky for your tastes, try the Sidney model. The straps on these sandals are slimmer and the buckles are smaller. This is a more feminine take on the classic Birkenstock. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a T-strap style for a dressier take on flip-flops. These shoes with a toe piece provide a slightly more upscale alternative to the classic beachwear. You can also choose a model with a stylish loop around the big toe for a more feminine version of this look. For another take on the flip flop aesthetic, try the one strap Birkenstock models, such as the Madrid. One thick strap holds the sandal on the foot. This can mean that your foot slides around a bit more in this style than in ones with more straps. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Give your foot more support with a heel strap.",
      "content": "Give your foot more support with a heel strap. If you are worried about your foot sliding around in a one- or two-strap model, try a style like the Bali or Milano that sport heel or ankle straps. These hold your foot firmly in the shoe. Be aware that it is not as easy to simply slide your foot in and out of this particular style of Birkenstocks as it is with other models. If you don't want the heel strap but you do want a more secure fit, try a three-strap style such as the Florida. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Dress up your look with patterned straps.",
      "content": "Dress up your look with patterned straps. Some Birkenstock models, like the Granada and the Bali, come with laser cut-outs in the straps. This gives them a more delicate, elegant feel. These styles are also more feminine. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep your feet warm in cooler weather with a closed-toe style.",
      "content": "Keep your feet warm in cooler weather with a closed-toe style. Some Birkenstock models, such as the Boston, look like slip-on clogs rather than the classic strapped sandal. These shoes will keep your feet warmer on colder days. They can also make comfortable slippers to wear around the house. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick a color that fits the look you are going for. There are over 300 models, colors, and textures of Birkenstocks, so you will be able to find a shade that fits your style. [9] X Research source Don't be afraid to experiment! Neutral colors like black, brown, and white are the most versatile, since they can be paired with any outfit. Black in particular is always flattering, and can be worn in every season. For a bolder, more summery look, try a pop of color, like bright pink. For a more dressed-up, fashion-forward aesthetic, try a metallic Birkenstock."

      "content": "Flex your new shoe. Take your sandals out of the box and gently bend and unbend the sole. Birkenstocks are stiff at first and need some working in before they mould to the shape of your feet and feel comfortable. [10] X Research source Some customers report using a hammer on the arches to help with the softening process. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Unbuckle the straps. With all of the straps undone, put your foot in the shoe. Make sure your heel is all the way back in the heel cup. Your shoe fits correctly if the contours match up with your foot's arch and the toe bar lies comfortably under the place where your toes join your foot. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure your foot has enough room before you stand up.",
      "content": "Make sure your foot has enough room before you stand up. There should be about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) between your toes and heels and the edges of the shoe, and 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) on the sides. Your feet will expand when you stand and walk, so don't forget to leave this extra space. [13] X Research source According to the company's head of communications, a lot of people make the mistake of buying a pair that fits too tightly. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear the shoes to break them in.",
      "content": "Wear the shoes to break them in. Start by wearing them around the house. They will feel stiff at first, but wearing them helps them to mould to your feet and soften up. Once they start feeling more comfortable, wear them outside. [16] X Research source The first few times you wear your new Birkenstocks, you should only leave them on for a few hours. Your feet are adjusting to the new support. [17] X Research source The process of breaking Birkenstocks in can be quite painful at first. Try not to be discouraged if the sandals you were promised would be so comfortable hurt the first few times you wear them instead. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Throw on Birkenstocks with shorts for a casual summer look. Sandals and shorts are a go-to combination in warm weather. Add a basic T-shirt or a tank top in a neutral color to complete this simple look. For a slightly dressier take, pair a leather Birkenstock with smart chino shorts if you're a man. Women wanting a more dressed-up version of this look can pair Birkenstocks with lace shorts. Try a flip flop-style Birkenstock with more casual shorts, such as those made of jean or light cotton."

      "content": "Wear Birkenstocks with pants for a chic, simple look in cooler weather. On days when you want to keep a relaxed summer feel to your wardrobe but the weather isn't cooperating, try pairing your sandals with jeans or casual trousers. Birkenstocks look cute with all styles of jeans, from skinny to boyfriend. The lighter the wash of your jeans, the more casual the overall look will be. Experiment with cropped pants if you aren't afraid of showing a little ankle."

      "content": "Create a fancier look by pairing Birkenstocks with tailored clothes or dresses. You can easily make your casual aesthetic even more chic by combining Birkenstocks with unexpected choices, like dresses and blazers. Take your look up another notch by adding an accessory like a wide-brimmed sunhat or Panama hat. Men can try pairing leather Birkenstocks in a neutral color with a statement blazer in a fun, bright summer color, like turquoise, for a dressier look. Women can try wearing Birkenstocks with a simple summer dress or a long maxi dress. The chunkiness of the sandals contrasts pleasantly with the flirty feminine vibe of the dress. Toss on a leather jacket or a fitted blazer for an extra touch of glamor in cooler weather."

      "content": "Treat yourself to a pedicure. Most styles of Birkenstocks are open-toed. They're going to show off your feet. Gnarled, overly long toenails will spoil your look. Keep your nails trimmed and your feet clean. Try painting your toenails. This lends fun visual flair to a look and gives you a chance to show off your personality. Don't be afraid to experiment with bold colors like bright blue or green. Remember that pedicures aren't just for women. Men can also benefit from these spa treatments, which leave your feet feeling great and looking sandal-ready. [19] X Research source"

      "content": "Transition your Birkenstocks from summer to fall by wearing them with socks. Many people are still resistant to the idea of wearing socks and sandals together. However, this unexpected combination can create a fun visual surprise. Warm socks also extend the use you can get out of your Birkenstocks by allowing you to wear them comfortably in colder weather without your feet freezing. For a bolder look, choose colorful socks to match the rest of your outfit. For example, try wearing bright red socks with brown Birkenstocks and a red plaid shirt."
