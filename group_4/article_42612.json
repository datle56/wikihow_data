      "title": "Be frank.",
      "content": "Be frank. Lay out your thoughts as plainly as possible. Avoid euphemisms, and try to work past your initial discomfort. If you aren't comfortable referring to \"sex,\" try using a similar but \"softer\" phrase. Instead of saying that you are \"having sex,\" say that you are \"making love,\" or \"being intimate,\" or \"getting down.\" Each of these phrases has its own set of connotations. Remember that sex is perfectly natural. One might argue that, indeed, nothing is more natural. It is how you came into being."

      "content": "Ask about STI (sexually-transmitted infection) testing. Before you become intimate with a person, initiate a casual conversation about their sexual health and their testing history. Don't make a big deal about it—just ask if they've been tested recently. Remember that you have the right to look after your own sexual health. You deserve to know if you're about to have sex with someone who might be carrying an infection. Use protection. It never hurts to use protection, even if a partner has assured you that they are STI-free. If you have an STI, be upfront about it. It can plague your partner for years, and it can have serious health implications."

      "content": "Make it a dialogue. Each of you should feel equally empowered to negotiate the terms of the conversation. Someone will probably need to initiate the conversation, and that person may well be you—but you can still create space for your partner to speak their mind. Listen. Be patient. Avoid accusatory \"you\" statements like, \"You never want to have sex anymore!\" Instead, focus on the way that things make you feel, or try to remain objective. Say, \"I feel that our sex drives have been unbalanced lately,\" or \"I want to open up a dialogue about the way that our sex life has been lately.\" Again: a relationship is a mutual understanding. A healthy sex life is built upon communication. Don't let one person make all of the moves! Consent is an important factor in order for both you and your partner to have a good time in bed. Talk about what you both want and not want during sex. And to then understand that persons boundaries. [6] X Expert Source JT Tran Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 May 2020."

If your child is approaching their teen years, then hormones are coming, and the time is right. In this digital age, more children are learning about sex from the Internet. If your child gets curious, then they may do a lot of exploratory searching. Use your knowledge to act as a guiding figure. Your child may know more than you think. Many schools incorporate some form of sexual education into their curriculum. Try using this as a reason to engage with your kids about the realities of sex.
