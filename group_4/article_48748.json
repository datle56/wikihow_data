      "title": "God may allow bad things to happen for reasons unknown to us.",
      "content": "God may allow bad things to happen for reasons unknown to us. If God so loved the world, why does evil and suffering exist? If He’s there to protect us, why do bad things happen? While there are theories, there’s no set-in-stone answer—we don’t always know why God does things. While there isn’t a sure answer, we do know God does everything for a reason, even if that reason isn’t noticeable right away. [1] X Research source Think of it this way: Bad things challenge us. When you face hardships, your faith is tested; your love and belief in the Lord are challenged. For example, say you're diagnosed with a critical illness. You may start to doubt God, asking, “Why me?” But as you push forward, you realize that God wouldn’t thrust anything on you that He knew you couldn’t handle. The life path this “bad thing” puts you down may lead you exactly to where God wants you to be."

      "content": "God may allow bad things to happen to give you a choice. Our Almighty God has given us the valuable gift of choice. You have agency in your life, meaning you have the ability to make decisions. God doesn’t control your life. While He may send you messages and trials, He ultimately lets you have the final say—you can choose between good and evil. For example, say your hometown is hit by a catastrophic flood. You have the choice to let the tragedy define you, or you can choose to look on the bright side of things, help your neighbors, and rejoice with the knowledge that when God closes one door, He opens another. As Proverbs 3:5-6 says, “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.” [2] X Research source"

      "content": "God might allow suffering to make you a stronger person. The world is full of pain and suffering, and the harsh realities of life can strengthen your faith and belief in the Lord. Bad things can happen to good people, but God doesn’t make you suffer as a punishment. Think of it this way: God only sends hardships He knows you can handle your way—He wants you to be the best version of yourself; He wants you to grow. 1 Corinthians 10:13 says it best: “And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.” [3] X Research source Remember, “we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose” (Romans 8:28). [4] X Research source Keep in mind that God knows now one is purely good, as Luke 18:19 states, “No one is good—except God alone.” [5] X Research source"

      "content": "God is always with you when bad things happen. The Lord is everywhere you go—He’s always there to guide you or be a supportive ear. It can be frustrating to know this when bad things happen; however, understand that God is helping you grow by not interfering. He’s a constant protector, even if He doesn’t always make His presence known. [6] X Research source As Jeremiah 23:24 says, “‘Who can hide in secret places so that I cannot see them?’ declares the Lord. ‘Do not I fill heaven and earth?’ declares the Lord.” [7] X Research source"

      "title": "In Christianity, evil means preferring anything that isn’t for God’s sake.",
      "content": "In Christianity, evil means preferring anything that isn’t for God’s sake. God is the most powerful and valuable thing, and not valuing Him and His word is an act of evil. [8] X Research source In this context, anything that goes against God’s word or the Ten Commandments is evil or sinful (murder, adultery, idolatry, blasphemy, etc.). [9] X Research source Take a look at how evil is described in scripture: Mark 7:20-23: “What comes out of a person is what defiles them. For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. All these evils come from inside and defile a person.” [10] X Research source Jeremiah 2:13: “My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns.” [11] X Research source Romans 3:23: “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” [12] X Research source Ezekiel 18:20: “The one who sins is the one who will die.” [13] X Research source"

      "content": "You can focus on the moment and the things that you do know. While we may not know exactly why God lets bad things happen, there are still many things we do know. The unknown can be scary, but if you switch your focus to what is known, you can ease your worries. Take a look at what Christians do know below to help guide you: [14] X Research source You have agency. God has given you the ability to make choices—you can choose between good and bad. Hardships make you stronger. Every time you make a choice or go through something difficult, you grow and build your faith. God is always there. Through every trial, tribulation, and choice, God is there to listen."

      "title": "If you're questioning your faith, reach out to a trusted religious advisor.",
      "content": "If you're questioning your faith, reach out to a trusted religious advisor. Struggling with your belief in the Lord is normal; it’s all a part of growing and evolving. You may question the Lord’s love or power with each new life path. Asking hard questions like “Why does God allow bad things to happen?” takes courage and ultimately strengthens your faith. But if you’re struggling, don’t hesitate to reach out for help. Talk to your pastor, priest, or religious counselor. They can help guide you on your spiritual journey and strengthen your faith in God. [15] X Research source Keep in mind that God wants you to be curious. Be open to learning new things, asking questions, and developing opinions. Be honest with God about how you’re feeling. Pray about your questions and spiritual journey. As Olivia Woodford, the Founder of Bible Women Speak, says, “Prayer is the foundation for any religious practice or relationship with the divine.” Have patience . Taking your time is okay; there’s no rush to find or strengthen your faith. Woodford advises not to “put a time thing on it.”"
