      "title": "Use a conservative and common font style.",
      "content": "Use a conservative and common font style. Business letters tend to be typed in a Helvetica, Arial, or Times New Roman font because they’re easy to read. Avoid script or cursive fonts to remain professional. [1] X Research source Keep your font black throughout your letter, even if you’re composing a business email ."

    {
      "title": "Change the top margin to 2 inches.",
      "content": "Change the top margin to 2 inches. A typed business letter has a top margin of 2 inches, while the other 3 margins are the standard 1 inch. Change the margins in your word processor by selecting “Page Layout,” “Margins,” and then “Custom Margins.” [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stick to a left-justified block format.",
      "content": "Stick to a left-justified block format. There are 3 types of business letter formats: full block, modified block, and semi-block. Full block format is the most traditional and widely used amongst companies, making it perfectly modifiable for any context. With this format, there are no indentations, and everything in your letter is aligned to the left. [3] X Research source In modified block formats, the heading, close, and signature are right aligned. In semi-block formats, each paragraph is indented."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your document single-spaced.",
      "content": "Keep your document single-spaced. Your business letter should always be left aligned and single-spaced (unless you’re told by your company otherwise). This small traditional spacing gives you plenty of space to write out your message, so you don’t venture onto a second page. [4] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Hit “Enter” twice between the first, second, and third body paragraphs, as well as the complimentary close and signature."
    },
    {
      "title": "List your company’s name and address in the top left corner.",
      "content": "List your company’s name and address in the top left corner. This allows the recipient to know exactly where the letter is coming from and where they should send their follow-up letter. [5] X Research source If you’re self-employed or an independent contractor, add your name in place of the company’s name or above it. If your company has a pre-designed letterhead, use that instead of typing out your own."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the date 2 lines underneath the address.",
      "content": "Put the date 2 lines underneath the address. Writing out the full date is the most professional choice and lets the recipient know when you mailed the letter. Keep a left indent for this line as well. [6] X Research source For example, rather than writing “10/15/12,” write the full date as “October 15, 2012” or “15 October 2012.” Putting the date before the month is standard in European countries. If you are writing your letter over several days, date it with the day when it was finished."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the recipient's information.",
      "content": "Add the recipient's information. Write out the recipient's full name, title (if applicable), company name, and address in that order, with each piece of information on a separate line. If necessary, include a reference number. The recipient's information should be left-aligned a few lines below the date. Address the letter to a specific individual rather than a full company, so it gets to the right person. If you don’t know the name of the person you’re sending the letter to, contact the company to see who you should reach out to for your specific demands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a salutation.",
      "content": "Choose a salutation. The salutation is an important indicator of respect and indicates professional familiarity. It officially starts your letter and formally greets the recipient. Keep your salutation left-aligned with a line space between it and the recipient’s address. [7] X Research source Here are some formal salutations you can choose from: If you don’t know the recipient well, \"Dear Sir/Madam\" is a safe choice. The recipient's title and last name can also be used: \"Dear Dr. Smith.\" If you know the recipient well and have an informal relationship with them, you may consider a first-name address, like \"Dear Susan.\" If you’re unsure of the recipient's gender, type their full name: \"Dear Kris Smith.\" Use \"To Whom It May Concern\" only if you don't know whom, specifically, you're addressing. Don't forget a comma after a salutation or a colon after “To Whom It May Concern.”"

    {
      "title": "Include at least 3 body paragraphs.",
      "content": "Include at least 3 body paragraphs. Typically, a business letter has a beginning, middle, and end. This is called the body of your letter and is where you state your purpose or reason for writing. Think of it like writing any other paper or letter, except you should remain professional and follow these standard guidelines: [8] X Research source The first paragraph is your introduction and states the main purpose or subject of the letter. Avoid going into too much detail, and stick to vague points of interest that’ll keep the recipient reading. The second paragraph details specific information about your purpose or subject. Put statistics, data, or first-hand accounts in this paragraph. Your second paragraph could consist of more than one small paragraph, as long as it stays on a single page. The third paragraph is your conclusion and restates your purpose or subject. Explain your “main idea” or reason for writing again while giving the recipient an incentive to get back to you."

      "title": "Strike the right tone.",
      "content": "Strike the right tone. Time is money, as the saying goes, so the tone of your letter should be brief and professional. Make your letter a quick read by diving straight into the matter and keeping your comments brief in the first paragraph. For instance, you can always start with \"I am writing to you regarding...\" and go from there.

Your intent should be to communicate what needs to be said as quickly, clearly, and cleanly as possible. Be persuasive in your letter and state your needs or wants in a way that makes the recipient want to help you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use personal pronouns.",
      "content": "Use personal pronouns. It’s perfectly fine to use “I,” “we,” and “you” in your business letter. Refer to yourself as “I” and your reader as “you.” This makes your letter personable so the recipient doesn’t feel like they’re reading a generic, generated message. [10] X Research source Be aware if you’re writing the letter on an organization’s behalf. If you’re stating the company’s perspective, you should use “we” so the reader knows that the company stands behind your statement."

    {
      "title": "Use active voice.",
      "content": "Use active voice. When describing a situation or making a request, make sure to write in the active voice rather than the passive voice. Passive voice can make your writing ambiguous or impersonal, while active voice is more streamlined and straight to the point.

      "title": "Be conversational when appropriate.",
      "content": "Be conversational when appropriate. Letters are written by people to people. You can’t build a relationship with generic, impersonal letters. However, stay away from colloquial language or slang such as \"you know,\" \"I mean,\" or \"wanna.\" Keep the tone business-like but be friendly, polite, and helpful.

      "content": "Wrap it up with a call to action. In the last paragraph or conclusion, summarize your points and clearly outline your planned course of action or what you expect from the recipient. Note that the recipient may contact you with questions or concerns and say thank you for their attention to the matter at hand.\\ Your call to action could be as simple as, \"Please read the attached document and send your feedback,\" or as detailed as, “Let’s work together to fight climate change by integrating eco-friendly transportation and shipping into our company.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "End the letter",
      "content": "End the letter with a formal but polite closing. The closing, like the salutation, is an indicator of respect and formality. \"Sincerely\" or \"Best regards\" are common professional closings. Place this complimentary close 2 lines below the last line of the body of your letter with a comma after it. [13] X Research source \"Yours sincerely,\" \"Cordially,\" \"Respectfully,\" \"Regards,\" and \"Yours Truly\" are also acceptable and respectable. \"All the best,” “Best wishes,\" \"Warm regards,\" and \"Thank you\" are slightly less formal but still professional."

You can either sign the letter after you’ve printed it before slipping it into an envelope, or you can digitally sign the document or upload your signature into your word processor. [14] X Research source Avoid using a colored pen when signing a business letter or professional document. Always opt for black or blue ink. If you’re signing the letter on someone’s behalf, write “pp:” before your signature. This stands for “per procurationem,” which means “by agency” or “on behalf of.” [15] X Research source"

Run your letter through a grammar checker such as Grammarly or Writer before printing it out. You can also ask a coworker or friend to read it over. Ask yourself whether the letter is clear and concise. Are any paragraphs more than 3 or 4 sentences long? If so, determine if you can eliminate any unnecessary statements."
