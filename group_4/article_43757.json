      "content": "Get on the same page about the future for peace of mind. In newer relationships, it’s common to not talk about what the end goal for the relationship is. But discussing this with your partner now can save you a lot of confusion later on, especially if you two aren’t on the same page. Ask your partner if they see you two getting married one day or if this is more of a casual situation. [2] X Research source Defining your relationship might sound scary, but you’ll be glad you did it! Ask your partner something like, “So, where do you see this relationship going?”"

      "content": "Discover your partner’s hobbies to spend more time together. Finding out what your partner does for fun is pretty easy, but it’s an important part of getting to know each other. Once you learn what your partner’s favorite hobbies are, you can find ones that overlap (or discover new ones ) that you two can bond over with each other. [4] X Research source Maybe your partner loves to cook, and you like to bake: dinner and dessert, anyone? Or, maybe you love hiking and your partner loves running—time for a trail run! Love grows by sharing experiences together. The more you and your partner can connect through activities, the better your relationship will be."

      "title": "Find out how you can support your partner in the workplace.",
      "content": "Find out how you can support your partner in the workplace. Not everyone has a major career goal. But if your partner does, it’s important to ask them about it.

      "title": "Faith is important to some people, so ask your partner about theirs.",
      "content": "Faith is important to some people, so ask your partner about theirs. If your partner subscribes to a specific religion, you might know about it already. But even if they don’t, you can learn more about how spiritual they are or what kind of higher power they believe in (or don’t believe in). You and your partner don’t have to be of the same faith—there are plenty of interfaith couples who make it work with consistent communication and respect. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Someone’s politics shows you where their values are. Even if you’re not a political person, you likely have opinions about politics, laws, or people in office.

[9] X Research source Similar to religion, you and your partner can have different political viewpoints and still make things work. However, it’s going to take a lot of good communication and respect from both sides."

      "title": "Learn what to celebrate together as a couple.",
      "content": "Learn what to celebrate together as a couple. Maybe your partner doesn’t love celebrating their birthday, but they really like to decorate for Christmas.

      "content": "Look toward the future by learning your partner's definition of family. Some people want the traditional family life: 2 parents, 2 kids, and a dog.

Ask your partner what their ideal family life looks like so you two can talk about your goals.

      "title": "Talk about money so there are no surprises down the line.",
      "content": "Talk about money so there are no surprises down the line. While discussing finances with your partner isn’t the most fun subject in the world, it’s important to chat about your spending habits and any debt that you’re in.

[11] X Research source Bring up the subject in a delicate way. Say something like, “I know this is a little weird, but I wanted to talk finances with you. I have about $5,000 of debt.

      "title": "Daily routines tell you whether or not you two will mesh together.",
      "content": "Daily routines tell you whether or not you two will mesh together. It’s not a huge deal if you don’t know your partner’s routine early on, especially if you aren’t living together. But learning about your partner’s habits and what they do every day can tell you if you two are compatible in the long run. [12] X Research source For instance, maybe you’re a night owl and your partner is a morning person. This isn’t a huge deal, but it could require some compromise down the line (like when you want to stay up late and hang out but your partner would rather be snoozing)."

[13] X Research source Bring up sex in a casual setting that doesn’t put any pressure on your partner. Say something like, “Is there anything you’ve been wanting to try in the bedroom?” Being able to communicate about sex is a great indicator that you and your partner are compatible.
