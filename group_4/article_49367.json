[5] X Research source You might start by saying, “ Great Expectations is full of imagery that makes the reader feel as if they are in 19th century England with Pip.

[7] X Research source You might write something like, “Miss Havisham is an example of the theme that love can sometimes go terribly wrong. This is also an important theme when examining the relationship between Pip and Estella.” Make sure to use smooth transitions. When you move to a new example, use a good transition word or phrase. Some examples are “similarly”, “conversely”, and “again”."
