      "title": "Purchase jojoba oil.",
      "content": "Purchase jojoba oil. Jojoba oil can be found at specialty herbal shops, beauty supply stores, and nicer grocery stores. Most stores stock it in the skincare section. Look for pure jojoba oil instead of beauty products with jojoba oil in them. If you’re having trouble finding it ask a store associate for help. Alternatively, you can use argan oil for moisturizing dry hair without making it look greasy. [1] X Expert Source Kana Ishii Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 22 December 2021."

      "content": "Determine how often you will treat your hair. If your hair is damaged and dry, start by doing a leave-in treatment once a week. If your hair is dry but not very damaged, do a treatment every two or three weeks. If you start to notice that your hair looks limp and oily, do the treatments less often. Inversely, if your hair still seems dry, do the treatments more often. If you do too many treatments and your hair looks oily, shampoo your hair to remove the excess oil."

      "content": "Apply the oil to your scalp. First, dip your fingertips into the bowl of oil. Next, massage the oil into your scalp. Make sure to cover the easy-to-miss spots behind your ears and at the nape of your neck. Focus on covering every inch of your scalp and the first half-inch of hair growth.

      "title": "Apply the oil to your ends.",
      "content": "Apply the oil to your ends. Once your scalp is saturated with oil, apply it to the rest of your hair. Pour out some jojoba oil into your palm and work it into your hair. Apply a thick coat from roots to tips. Depending on how thick your hair is, you may need to use more jojoba oil than you might expect. When in doubt, use more jojoba oil than you think you’ll need. It’s better to apply too much than not enough."

      "title": "Let the treatment soak into your hair before washing.",
      "content": "Let the treatment soak into your hair before washing. You can leave the oil treatment in your hair from 20 minutes to overnight. The longer you leave the treatment in your hair the more time the oil will have to soften your dry locks. Next, wash your hair normally. If you have a lot of trouble washing out the oil you may have to shampoo your hair twice. If you leave the treatment in your hair overnight, wear a shower cap to protect your pillowcase from oil stains."

      "title": "Mix the oil with shampoo or conditioner.",
      "content": "Mix the oil with shampoo or conditioner. If you want a daily moisture boost, try mixing jojoba oil with your favorite shampoo or conditioner. First, pour a small amount of shampoo or conditioner into a small bowl. Next, add a few drops of jojoba oil. Mix the ingredients together with a spoon until they’re completely blended. Wash your hair and style it normally. The more damaged your hair is, the more jojoba oil you should add. Experiment with different amounts to see what works for you."
