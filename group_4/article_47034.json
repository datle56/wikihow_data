A Venus in Virgo man shows affection through advice and acts of service, so show him you appreciate his efforts.

Beyond that, find ways to do the same for him; look for ways to help him out, anticipate his needs, and offer him support when he’s struggling. He’ll be delighted by your care and compassion. Take your Venus in Virgo’s advice sometimes. You’re certainly not obligated to do it, but taking his advice is a great way to show him you value his input while also proving that his advice is genuinely helping you out. Since your Venus in Virgo can be a little insecure and perfectionistic, support him by letting him know how amazing he already is. Try not to be harsh, since he’s already hard enough on himself. Try giving him a thoughtful gift that he might not get for himself. For example, a comfy blanket or pillow set might help a Venus in Virgo destress, but it might not be his first instinct to buy.

      "content": "Perfectionistic Virgo is a zodiac sign with high standards; thus, Venus in Virgo men tend to be perfectionists who are willing to work hard for self-improvement.

At the end of the day, however, they’re also trustworthy and genuine people. [4] X Research source If a Venus in Virgo guy seems aloof or quiet when you meet him, give him time to open up. Socializing is more manageable when he can ease into a situation (rather than just jumping in headfirst)."

Thus, Venus in Virgo men can be surprisingly adaptable—and, in fact, they’re most open-minded when it comes to finding new ways to attain stability in life. Since stability makes Venus in Virgo men feel more comfortable, they’ll switch things up if it gives them a greater sense of security.
