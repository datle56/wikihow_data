      "title": "Park the trailer on flat ground.",
      "content": "Park the trailer on flat ground. Pull your trailer onto a flat, level patch of ground. For safety, do not use slanted areas like driveways. Then, put the vehicle you used to tow the trailer in park and activate its emergency brake. [1] X Research source For extra security, place wheel chocks in front of and behind each tire."

      "title": "Extend the trailer’s rear ramps.",
      "content": "Extend the trailer’s rear ramps. If you’re using a trailer made specifically for towing cars, it should come with 2 heavy duty ramps. To use these ramps, simply pull them out of the vehicle’s rear body and make sure they’re parallel and secure. If your trailer doesn’t have built-in ramps, you can purchase a metal ramp from an auto supply store and connect it yourself by following the manufacturer’s included instructions. Do not try to create a makeshift ramp. Doing so is extremely dangerous and can result in major damage to you or your vehicles."

      "title": "Line your car up behind the trailer.",
      "content": "Line your car up behind the trailer. Once you’ve parked the trailer, pull your car up behind it. Make sure to line your wheels up with the trailer’s metal ramps. Do not back your car up to the trailer as towing your car with the tail end first can cause problems like whipping or swaying."

    {
      "title": "Drive onto the trailer slowly.",
      "content": "Drive onto the trailer slowly. Put your car in drive and slowly accelerate up the ramp and onto the trailer. As you drive, the front of the car will raise up slightly, then return back down and distribute its weight over the surface of the trailer. [2] X Research source Keep the steering wheel straight so you don’t drive on crooked. If you’re unsure whether or not you’re driving straight, ask a friend to help direct you."

    {
      "title": "Park the car and check its placement.",
      "content": "Park the car and check its placement. Keep driving until you’re centered on the trailer. Then, put the car in park, turn it off, and activate its parking brake. Finally, hop out of the vehicle and double check the car’s alignment. If you’d like, ask a friend to stand off to the side of the vehicle so they can check the alignment while you’re driving it. If you have a manual car, put it in first gear, turn off the motor, and set the handbrake."

    {
      "title": "Use tire straps to secure modern or small vehicles.",
      "content": "Use tire straps to secure modern or small vehicles. Tire straps use your trailer’s weight to keep your car steady. When properly attached, these straps cannot damage your car’s body or mechanical parts, making them perfect for slender cars made after 1990 and small vehicles like smart cars. Tire straps may not fit on vehicles with extremely large tires."

      "content": "Thread the lasso strap through a ratchet strap . Pull the exposed end of your lasso strap through the center hole of a ratchet strap buckle, making sure to leave just a little bit of slack. Then, crank the ratchet’s handle 3 or 4 times to connect the straps. [3] X Research source If your ratchet strap has 2 metal clips, hook 1 of them onto the looped end of the lasso strap."

Then, hook the open end of your ratchet strap onto the D-ring. [4] X Research source D-rings are small, inset rings bolted onto each corner of your trailer."

      "title": "Tighten the straps by ratcheting them.",
      "content": "Tighten the straps by ratcheting them. Double-check that both your ratchet strap and lasso strap are secure and connected. Then, move the ratchet’s handle up and down to tighten the straps. When finished, your lasso strap should squeeze into the tire’s sides. While tightening your straps, make sure they don’t come into contact with your car’s body. If they do, loosen the straps, reposition them, and repeat the tightening process."

      "title": "Use axle straps to secure large or old vehicles.",
      "content": "Use axle straps to secure large or old vehicles. Unlike tire straps, axle straps use your vehicle’s weight and suspension to help keep it in place. This is typically the best option for bulky classic cars produced before 1990 and large vehicles like trucks and four wheelers. Axle straps can cause unwanted damage to small or modern vehicles."

If your strap has a padded section, make sure that section is the part that touches the axle. [5] X Research source Your car’s rear housing holds its rear axle, which is the long horizontal bar that connects the back wheels."

Connect the clip to the D-ring on the back left side of the trailer, then give it a tug to make sure it holds. D-rings are the inset rings bolted onto the trailer. They’re generally located on each corner of the vehicle."

      "content": "Thread the axle strap into the ratchet. Pull the free end of your axle strap through the ratchet buckle’s center hole, leaving just a small amount of slack. Then, raise and lower the ratchet’s handle 3 or 4 times to lock the strap in place. [6] X Research source If your ratchet strap has a second metal clip, hook it onto the axle strap’s metal ring (the part you tied to the rear axle housing)."

Then, move the ratchet’s handle up and down until the straps are fairly taut. Make sure to keep the straps straight and don’t twist them as you tighten, since twisting can make unloading more difficult. [7] X Research source Overtightening the straps can lead to axle damage. If your straps feel like they’re starting to strain, loosen them slightly. If you’re left with any loose strap ends, tie them up using bungee cords or cable ties."

      "content": "Repeat the process on the rear right side. Grab a second axle strap and a second ratchet strap. Then, repeat the fastening process by wrapping the axle strap around the right side of the rear axle, hooking the ratchet strap onto the adjacent D-ring, and connecting the straps together. Just like with the previous side, make sure the straps are tight enough to secure the car but not so tight that they strain the axle."

Then, wrap the axle straps around the left and right sides of the front axle, clip the ratchet straps into the adjacent D-rings, and connect the corresponding straps together. Finally, ratchet the straps until they’re tight with no slack. [8] X Research source If you’d prefer, you can wrap the front axle straps around your car’s A-arms or chassis rail. Be careful not to secure any straps around the car’s sway bars, steering arms, or steering racks. These are located on the bottom of the car and look like small axle rods."

      "content": "Attach, but do not tighten, your trailer’s safety chain. If your trailer has a rear safety chain, make sure you attach it to the front of your car. To do this, pull the chain around your car’s chassis rail or A-arm. Then, twist the chain and clip the chain hook onto 1 of the chain loops. You do not need to tighten the chain, just make sure it’s attached securely. This chain helps hold your car in place if any of the straps break."

In particular, make sure your straps are not crushing your car’s body, brake lines, or oil lines. [9] X Research source You’ll find brake and oil lines on the bottom of your car. They typically look like thin, flexible cords."
