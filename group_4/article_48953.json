      "content": "Understand the goals of a good opening move . Chess openings are the first 10-12 moves in the game, and they will determine your general strategy and positioning for the entire match. Your goal in the opening is to develop or move off the starting squares as many strong pieces as possible. There are several key considerations in a good opening: Move your pawns toward the center of the board while opening up your stronger pieces for easy movement. The most common yet very efficient path would be to move the king's pawn 2 spaces forward (e4 for White, e5 for Black) and then the queen's pawn forward 2 spaces (d4 for White, d5 for Black), if it is not at risk after the opponent makes their move. This formation allows you to develop bishops, increases castling speed, and forms a defensive but less offensive fortress with the right moves. Your opening moves will also be dependent on whether you are Black or White. Since White moves first, you'll want to move in on the attack and try and control the game. Black should hold back and wait a bit more, letting White expose themselves with a mistake before attacking. Never move the same piece twice unless it could get in trouble and be taken. The more pieces you move, the more your opponent needs to react to you. Don't make too many pawn moves. The goal of a good opening is to develop your major pieces efficiently, and moving too many pawns can give your opponent a tempo advantage. Try not to move the queen out too early. Many beginners make the mistake of moving their queen out early, but this can leave your queen vulnerable to attack, causing you to have to move it again and lose a tempo. Keeping these principles in mind, check out the list of opening moves used by Grandmasters at modern tournaments."

      "content": "Think 4-5 moves in advance, using each move to set up more complicated attacks. To win at chess, you need to be constantly thinking a few moves in advance, setting up longer, more complicated attacks to outfox your opponent. Your first move is about setting up the rest of the game, leading to your first attack or controlling certain sections of the board. The best way for a beginner to learn how to plan ahead is to practice some common openings: The Ruy Lopez is a classic opening to get bishops out and attacking. Move your king's pawn up two spaces, then your knight up f3 (as White). Finish by pushing your king's bishop all the way until it is one space in front of the opponent's pawn. [1] X Research source The English Opening is a slow, adaptable opening. Move the c2 pawn up 2 squares (c2-c4), then follow with the g2 pawn (g2-g3) to free your king's bishop (if Black moves to the center) or the queen's knight, (if Black moves along the sides). [2] X Research source Try the adventurous King's Gambit. Used by grandmasters from Bobby Fisher onward, this exciting opening can put beginners off-balance early. Simply move both king pawns (e2 and f2) up two spaces with the opening move. Black will frequently attack early, feeling like they have you opened up, but your pawn wall will quickly cause them problems. [3] X Research source Try the Queen’s Gambit to control the center of the board. White moves the queen’s pawn to d4, drawing out Black’s pawn to d5. White typically retaliates with bishop’s pawn to c4. This maneuver brings the game out to the center and opens up the lanes for your queen and bishop to move. [4] X Research source A good defense to a Queen’s Gambit is the Queen's Gambit Declined . After the opening moves, start by moving your king’s pawn to e6. You’ve now opened up a path for your bishop to attack. If he moves their knight to c3, you can move your bishop to b4, pinning the knight."

That said, Scholar's Mate is a great way to catch a beginner opponent off guard and snag the game from them quickly. As White: king's pawn up 1 (e2-e3); king's bishop to c4; queen to f3, queen to f7. [5] X Research source As Black: king's pawn moves up 1 (e7-e6); king's bishop to c5; queen to f6; queen to f2. Countering Scholar's Mate: Pull your knights out as blockades if you see Scholar's Mate happening—chances are good they won't sacrifice a queen just to take your knight. The other option is to use a nearly identical move, but instead of pushing your queen up, leave her back on e7, in front of your king."

      "title": "Control the center squares to control the game.",
      "content": "Control the center squares to control the game. Your biggest concern is controlling the center tiles, specifically the four in the very middle, when playing chess. This is because you can attack anywhere from the center of the board, allowing you to control the game's pace and direction. For example, the knight has eight potential moves in the board's center, but only 1-2 on the edges. There are two general ways to do this. Supported Middle is when you move slowly into the center of the board with several pieces. Knights and bishops support from the fringes, able to move in and take pieces if you get under attack. In general, this slow development is more common. Using the Flanks is a very modern style of play that controls the middle from the outsides. Your rooks, queen, and knights run up both sides of the board, making it impossible for your opponent to move into the middle without being taken."

      "title": "Develop as many pieces as you can.",
      "content": "Develop as many pieces as you can. Once you’ve made the opening moves, it’s time to start developing an attacking position. You want to give each of your pieces the best possible square to move to, getting pieces off of the starting squares. [6] X Research source Unless you are forced to, the best method is to move your pieces in turn. Don’t move the same piece twice unless you must defend it from an unexpected attack or make a vital attack. Do not count pawns as pieces during an opening. Moving all your pawns out will only make your more valuable pieces vulnerable to capture and can potentially open you up to checks and checkmates. Save your pawn moves for the endgame. Counterintuitively, your king is \"developed\" by castling . This moves your king into the corner of the board in a place where it is far less likely to be put in check. It also moves one of your corner rooks closer to the center."

    {
      "title": "Learn to castle.",
      "content": "Learn to castle. Castling is when you move the king over a rook, effectively using the rook to form a wall against attack. Above the king, you still have a line of pawns protecting you as well. This is an incredibly effective tactic, especially for beginners learning the game. To do it: Clear the path between your king and rook by moving the bishop and knight (and potentially your queen). Try to keep as many pawns as you can in place. You can do this on either side. Move your king two squares to the right or left, then cross the rook over your king. The end result is that your king is on the G or C file, and your rook is on the D or F file, for kingside and queenside castling, respectively. Note that the king and the rook cannot have moved once before castling. If they do, the move is no longer allowed. You also cannot castle into check, through check, or out of check. You cannot make any move that puts your king into check, including castling, but you also cannot castle if you are currently in check. Finally, you cannot castle if your king will cross through a square that would put your king into check, even if that square is not the destination square. You can also castle queenside. Clear the queen, queen's knight, and queen's bishop out of their starting squares. Then, move your king two spaces and move your rook directly to the king's right in one move. In a chess tournament setting, make sure to move your king first, then the rook. If you move the rook first, that'll count as one rook move, and not a castle. Part of what helps you win at chess is your ability to read your opponent without letting them read you. Don’t begin your move until you are sure it is the right move. You want to be thinking several moves ahead at all times. This means knowing where each of your pieces can move in any situation and predicting how your opponent will react to your moves. This skill isn’t always easy to gain and will take practice."

      "content": "Understand the value of each piece and protect them accordingly. Obviously, your king is the most important piece on the board, since you lose if it's taken. However, the rest of your pieces are not easily dispensed cannon fodder. Based on the math and geometry of a chessboard, certain pieces are more valuable than others. Remember these rankings when taking pieces. You do not, for example, want to put a high-value Rook at risk just to take an opponent's knight. Pawn = 1 point. Knight = 3 points. Bishop = 3 points. Rook = 5 points. Queen = 9 points. Chess pieces are sometimes referred to as \"material.\" Having a material advantage going into the endgame can give you much better chances of beating your opponent. Most of the time, the bishop is stronger than the knight. However, there can be exceptions."

      "content": "Know when to trade pieces. Trading pieces is obvious when you end up with the material advantage, such as giving up a knight to get their queen, but it is much trickier when trading off similar pieces. In general, you do not want to trade pieces when: You have the advantage in position, center control, and development. The fewer pieces are on the board in total, the less of an advantage you have and the easier you can defend against. The opponent is cramped or stuck in a corner. When you have them locked in, it is more difficult for them to move or maneuver many pieces, but fewer pieces can get them out of the jam and free again. You have fewer pieces than your opponent. If you have more pieces than them and the advantages are otherwise similar, start taking pieces. You'll open up new attacking lanes. You would double-up pawns. A doubled pawn is when you have one pawn in front of the other. This makes them both much less useful and clogs up your side of the board. However, if you can make your opponent double pawns as a side-effect of an even trade, this could be a useful move. [8] X Research source You're trading a bishop for a knight. In general, bishops are better than knights. There are many exceptions to this, though, so you have to take into account the situation."

Each piece you move should be done with three common goals in mind. If you keep these points in your head, you'll find you can easily start improvising multi-move plans to win the game: Develop multiple pieces (rooks, knights, queen, bishop) early and often. Get them out of their starting spots to open up your options. Control the center. The center of the board is where the action happens. Protect the king. You can have the best offense in the world, but leaving your king open is a sure-fire way to lose at the last minute. [9] X Research source"

If your opponent is purely reacting to you, moving pieces out of the way frequently and unable to mount an attack, take your time and whittle them down. Remember, you can win a match-up and still lose the game. Don't move in if you're opening up to a counter-attack. Instead, pick off their defending pieces, take full control of the middle of the board, and wait to hit them until it really hurts."

      "title": "Learn to pin pieces.",
      "content": "Learn to pin pieces. Pinning is when you \"trap\" a piece such that it cannot move without leaving a more valuable piece open to attack. This passive sort of warfare is a great way to control the game, helping you master your opponents. To do it, look where a piece can move. Usually, pieces with limited options are your best bet. Then, instead of attacking, position your piece so that you could take them no matter where they move, effectively making the piece useless for a period of time. A pin where the king is the more valuable piece behind the pinned piece is an absolute pin. The pinned piece can't move at all. A pin where a more valuable piece other than the king behind the pinned piece is called a relative pin. The pinned piece can move but at the cost of a more valuable piece. A pin where a piece isn't behind the pinned piece is called a situational pin. The pinned piece can't move due to leaving a resource open to the opponent (tactic, attack, files, etc.). Sacrifices are when you allow your opponent to take your piece. The only catch is knowing that you can take their piece right back. They may take it, and they may not—the important thing is that you're in control. [10] X Research source"

Planning and executing a fork is a great way to win material and put yourself at an advantage. For example, if you fork the king and the queen, the opponent will have no choice but to give up their queen, giving you an advantage that is normally enough to win the game. When attempting a fork, keep the following things in mind: Forking is most easily done with the knight, as its unusual movement lets it attack multiple pieces hidden behind others. Try to fork the most valuable pieces. The best possible fork is the fork of the king and queen. This is called a royal fork. A fork is most effective when it forces your opponent to react to it immediately, such as attacking the queen or putting the king in check."

Always protect and support the queen, as most players will sacrifice just about any piece (other than their own queen) to take her down. Queens only reach their full potential with support.

They know that moves and pieces traded in the early stages will profoundly affect the game's end, and they plan accordingly. Opening: This is where you set the tone of the game. Your first 4-5 moves develop a lot of pieces quickly and begin fighting for the board's center. You can go offensive, taking the fight to them, or defensive, holding back and waiting for them to make the first move. The Middlegame: This exists purely to set up your endgame. You trade pieces, seize control of the middle of the board and set up 1-2 lines of attack that you can spring into motion at any time. A trade-off now may be beneficial, but you have to know how losing a piece affects your chances to win at the end. Endgame: There are only a few pieces left, and they are all incredibly valuable. The endgame seems like it is the most dramatic stage, but really most of the work has already been done—the player who \"won\" the middlegame and ended up with the best material should wrap it up with a checkmate."

When there are very few pieces left on the board, a push upward to promote into a queen can win you the game. [14] X Research source When behind in material, exchange pawns and go for a draw. If you are behind in material, exchange pawns because it increases your chances for a draw. If you exchange all the pawns and your opponent only has a bishop or a knight, he will not be able to checkmate you. If you are ahead, exchange pieces and not pawns.
