      "content": "Purchase a false lash glue remover. Most false eyelash kits come with eyelash glue, but they don’t often contain glue remover. However, you can find many brands of eyelash glue remover in the beauty department of your local department store. Choose a brand that meets your specific skin requirements; when possible, choose glue remover made by the same company that made the eyelash glue you used. Always check to make sure you’re not allergic to any of the ingredients."

      "title": "Remove your eye makeup.",
      "content": "Remove your eye makeup. It’s best to take off your eye makeup prior to using the lash glue remover, as the buildup of makeup on your eyelid can make it more difficult to take off your lashes. Use makeup remover or baby oil to gently wash off your eye makeup. Put a bit of the remover on a cotton pad, and wipe at your eyelid until the majority of the makeup is gone. Don’t try removing your mascara at this point, if you’re wearing it. This can rip at the false lashes and pull the skin on your eyelids uncomfortably. Don’t wash your face with soap and water to take off your eye makeup though, as this can damage both your false and natural lashes."

If you want to save your false eyelashes and reuse them later on, use tweezers to remove them. Grab the false eyelashes as close to your eyelid as possible, starting at the inner corner of your eye. Hold your eyelid to keep your skin from stretching, and then gently tug upwards on them to pull them away from the eyelid. They should remove easily; if there is tension when you try to pull them off, apply more glue remover and wait 30 seconds before trying again. Make sure that you do not pinch any of your own lashes. If you feel any pain when you start to pull the lashes free, stop pulling and let go of your real lashes."

It is likely that there is some residual glue left on your natural lash line which needs to be removed. To do this, put a bit more of the glue remover on the cotton swab, and spread it over the glue that’s remaining. Then, use the dry end of the cotton swab to gently rub off the glue, cleaning your eyelid. Use a bit of warm water and your face wash of choice to finish off the job. [1] X Research source"

Before you have a go at your lashes though, remove any eye shadow or eyeliner you may be wearing. Pour some of the remover onto a cotton pad, and gently rub your eyes to remove the makeup. Don’t remove any mascara yet though, as this might damage your false eyelashes. Some makeup removers will not dissolve your lash glue, so you may want to look for a product that is labeled for both."

      "content": "Choose a type of oil. Oil will very easily remove the glue used to secure false eyelashes in place, but it also coats the false eyelashes and makes them unusable in the future. As a result, you should only use oil to remove your false eyelashes if you intend on throwing them away afterwards. The most effective types of oil to use are coconut, almond, and baby oil. Not all oils are suitable for use on your face, so stick to those recommended for facial use."
