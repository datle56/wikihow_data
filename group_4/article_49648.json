      "content": "Visualize your recipe. A recipe is a set of steps that lead to a delicious end. In a way, it's a gift from you to the people who read it. If you're writing down a recipe you've made so many times you could cook it in the dark, take a step back and think about the best way to present it to other people. Who will your readers be, and what is their cooking style? Your intended audience should influence the way you write your recipe. [1] X Research source If you're writing down a family recipe to make sure it's never forgotten, authenticity will be important to you and your readers. You'll need exact ingredients and measurements so that people in future generations will be able to recreate Grandma's biscuits or Uncle Benny's chili and taste a piece of family history. If your recipe will have a public readership, tradition is less important than taste and accessibility. Make sure your readers will be able to find the ingredients you list, and ensure the final outcome will be tasty enough to make it worthwhile for your readers. Consider the skill level of your readers, too. Decide if there are ways you can make the recipe easier to follow for beginner cooks. If there's no getting around complicated cooking techniques, write the steps out as clearly as possible."

      "title": "Gather your ingredients.",
      "content": "Gather your ingredients. Set out all the ingredients required to make your recipe. You may need to cook the recipe more than once to make tweaks, so make sure you have plenty of each ingredient. Don't forget to measure out the water, ice, and other ingredients you might be inclined to leave out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gather your supplies.",
      "content": "Gather your supplies. Get out all the pots, pans, spatulas, whisks, and any other equipment needed to make the dish. If you normally use specialized equipment, like an electric mixer, determine whether people without the equipment can make the recipe by hand. You may want to provide alternate options and ideas to make the recipe as accessible as possible."

    {
      "title": "Start cooking.",
      "content": "Start cooking. Imagine that you're making the recipe for the first time, and make the recipe the way you want your readers to make it. Start with the prep work, preheat the oven or stove, and build the recipe using raw ingredients. As you work, pay attention to the measurements and techniques you use, and the order in which you incorporate the ingredients. Take notes on what you're doing. Write down measurements for each ingredient. Describe each step of the process using common cooking and baking terminology. Be sure to record each and every step - you can edit later if you need to. Consider taking photos. Colorful step-by-step photos can draw readers in and provide helpful information on complicated techniques. Try taking pictures of each step as you go, or have someone else take pictures while you work. Even if you don't include step-by-step photos, you may want to have at least one picture of the finished dish."

      "content": "Provide exact measurements and volumes. For each ingredient, write exactly how much you used. List all the measurements in a consistent format - either imperial or metric (or both, if you'd like). [2] X Research source Use consistent abbreviations for measurements. For example, tsp. or tbs for teaspoon or tablespoon. If an ingredient doesn't have a numerical measurement, capitalize it. For example, Olive oil ."

      "content": "List ingredients used together in order of volume. For example, if you're writing a recipe on baking a cake, all the dry ingredients will probably be sifted together at once. Since you can't list them in order of usage, list them in order of volume: 2 cups flour , 1 teaspoon baking soda , 1/4 teaspoon salt , and so on. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Write \"divided\" after ingredients to be used in several parts. In many cases, you may need to use one ingredient in several different steps in the recipe. For example, you may cream butter with sugar to make a coffee cake batter, then use butter again later to make a crumb topping. For instances like these, list the total amount of butter followed by the word \"divided\" - as in, 6 tablespoons butter, divided ."

      "title": "List generic items instead of name brands.",
      "content": "List generic items instead of name brands.

In order to make the method section of your recipe less wordy, you can include simple techniques like chopping, mincing, and melting as part of the ingredient list.

      "title": "Describe the equipment needed.",
      "content": "Describe the equipment needed. Equipment can make or break a recipe, so be very specific about the size, shape, and composition of the supplies needed to cook a dish. For example, write Use a 9-inch pie pan or In a large cast iron skillet or frying pan, to direct your readers as carefully as possible. Let readers know if one type of equipment can be substituted for another. For example, a blender might do in the absence of a food processor. You may want to include a list of special equipment needed - a double boiler, kitchen twine, a baking stone, and so on."

Long, complicated steps should be separated into their own paragraphs to make the method easier to follow. Don't use too many adjectives or provide too much information - just the minimum needed for the recipe to turn out right. Here are a few examples: Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute longer. Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt."

      "content": "Write exact temperatures and cooking times. If the recipe calls for the use of an oven, be sure to write exactly what temperature to preheat it to. For stovetop cooking instructions, use common terms like \"medium-high\" and \"medium-low\" to indicate how hot the pan should be. Temperatures can also be described through techniques. For example, write simmer on medium-low to indicate that the soup shouldn't be at a rolling boil. Indicate how long the food should cook.

Since everyone's oven and stove are a little different, it's helpful to add hints about how the food should look, feel and smell at various steps. Here are a few examples: Bake until the cheese is bubbly, about 15 minutes. Bake until the top is brown and crisp. Simmer until the flavors have melded. Cook until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Cook until the quiche filling is just set. Cook until the salmon's flesh is opaque and firm."

Include serving suggestions, such as optional garnishes or other dishes that pair well with the recipe (e.g. \"Top with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream\" or \"Serve with slices of crusty baguette.\" Include ingredient substitutions to account for dietary restrictions (e.g. \"Cashews may be substituted for walnuts\" or \"Use tofu instead of chicken to make the dish vegetarian\"). Give sufficient warnings about any problems which may occur during the cooking.

      "content": "Test your recipe. Once your recipe is complete, cook it again to test it. You might also want to share it with someone else who has never made it before. See if the recipe as you wrote it turns out \"just right.\" If it is too sour, sweet, salty, spicy, or otherwise fails the taste test, consider what you might do to correct the problem, then begin the process over again. Guessing an adjustment, either in ingredients, cooking times, or temperatures does not always yield success. This is the reason \"Test kitchens\" are operated like laboratories, and results are carefully documented and repeated."
