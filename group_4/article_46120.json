There are some factors you will need to consider when making your decision: Will the weather permit me to reveal more parts of my body so it can be shown? Do I have any formal events to attend in the next couple of days that may call for location discretion? Questions like these can help narrow down what part of your body you want the henna to be drawn. Popular locations are the hands, arms and feet."
