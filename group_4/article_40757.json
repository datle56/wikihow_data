Seeing each other frequently will give you the chance to connect with the other person.

Seeing each other few times a week is fine, but seeing each other every day can actually damage a new relationship. Giving the other person space is not a bad thing.

      "content": "Learn about the other person. While you are spending time with the other person, it is important to ask genuine questions and pay attention to their answers. The more you learn about the person, the deeper your relationship can grow. They will also appreciate your honest desire to understand and care for them. [2] X Research source For example, you might ask them about what things they liked to do as kids or whether or not they have any family nearby. Delay sexual intimacy until you feel comfortable communicating with them. That way you are less likely to have a misunderstanding when you finally do hook up.

      "content": "Create trust. Creating trust takes time. You have to be consistent and show up when the other person needs you. You have to keep promises that you make to them, whether it’s showing up for a date or helping them clean their house. It is also important to always tell them the truth, and if they ask something that you are uncomfortable sharing, tell them that. [3] X Research source For example, if they asked you something deeply personal on a second date, you could say “I’m not really comfortable talking about that right now, but we can discuss it when we know each other better.” Trust often is conferred when you make yourself vulnerable. Opening yourself up to someone and showing them both your positive traits as well as your fears and insecurities helps create deeper, lasting connections. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Express your interest in a sustained relationship. Even though you are seeing each other frequently and going out on dates, the other person can’t be sure of your intentions unless you tell them. Let the person know that you are ready and interested in a relationship. You should also be willing to hear whether they want the same thing or not.

      "content": "Discuss boundaries. Once you agree to be in a relationship, there are certain rules that come with that. The tricky part is that these rules are not the same for every person or couple. You should both sit down and discuss what boundaries you expect to be followed in the relationship. [6] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, your partner might be okay with staying friends with exes, while that makes you uncomfortable. Discuss both sides and agree on something that makes you both comfortable. Creating boundaries can help you find a happy medium between what makes you and your partner feel comfortable. For example, you might agree that being friends with exes is okay, but constantly communicating with them is crossing the line."

      "title": "Be willing to compromise.",
      "content": "Be willing to compromise. One of the hardest things about a relationship is that both people must be willing to compromise to make it work. That means you will have to do some things that you don’t like, and so will the other person. Keep an open line of communication about the relationship, and make sure that both people are giving and taking. [7] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, you might both hate doing dishes and laundry. As a compromise, one of you could do dishes, and the other do laundry. Work to keep your lines of communication open throughout the course of your relationship. Unspoken issues may arise and create even larger problems later on if not addressed."

While this can fill one of your needs, you have no way of knowing if that person will make you happy in the long run. Instead, reflect on what you want out of a partner and a relationship, and what you find attractive. Think about things like: [8] X Research source Do I want to be with someone who is career or family oriented? What do I find attractive in other people? Do I want someone who is spontaneous or predictable? These traits should compliment what you want in a happy life, so don't depend on someone else to fulfill your happiness.

Sometimes, a friendship can transition into a relationship easily if there’s an attraction between the two people. Friends can also introduce you to someone that they know and think you’d like. Do not try to force a relationship with a friend. This can lead to a failed relationship and a failed friendship."
