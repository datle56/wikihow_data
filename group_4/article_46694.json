Plug the narrow end of the controller's USB charging cable into the controller and the large end of the USB cable into one of your computer's USB ports. To turn your controller on, press the stylized \"PS\" button in the middle of your controller. USB port locations vary depending on the type of computer you're using. If you can't locate the USB ports, check the sides or the back of your computer's CPU (desktop) or the back of the casing (laptop). If you're connecting your controller via wireless dongle, you may need to first install the dongle's drivers. Make sure you follow the on-screen prompts to do so after plugging in the dongle. If your PS3 controller is paired with your PS3, first unplug the PS3 from its power source."
