      "content": "Gather supplies. If you’re using a styptic pencil, you’ll need it and a bit of water to moisten it with. Styptic pencils are relatively easy to obtain and contain an astringent that stimulates blood vessel contraction, which encourages bleeding to stop. [2] X Research source Clinical Procedures in Vet Nursing. Aspinall. Publisher : Butterworth-Heinemann Styptic pencils are available from most pharmacies. You can also use a styptic powder to treat the bleeding. [3] X Expert Source Natalie Punt, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 15 February 2022."

      "title": "Remain calm.",
      "content": "Remain calm. Hopefully you’ve anticipated this scenario, and, if you happen to cut the quick, you can calmly reach the materials you gathered beforehand. The blood loss from a bleeding quick is not dangerous to a healthy dog. [4] X Research source The bleeding nail can, however, look a bit alarming, especially if the dog is scrambling around and spreading blood over the floor. Know that the dog is in no danger, but act quickly to minimize its discomfort. Remember that remaining calm is important for you but also for your dog. The quick is tender and full of nerves, so having it clipped will be painful to your dog and it will be looking to you for cues about how to react. If you get panicked or frantic, your dog likely will, too."

      "title": "Apply the styptic pencil.",
      "content": "Apply the styptic pencil. Hold the bleeding toe steady and gently restrain your dog to prevent it from moving while you apply the styptic pencil. Place the styptic pencil directly in contact with the bleeding toe and press firmly. Keep the pencil held firmly in place for at least 2 minutes, then remove."

      "title": "Repeat.",
      "content": "Repeat. If the bleeding hasn't stopped, repeat the process above but hold the styptic pencil in place for 5 minutes. The bleeding should stop after holding the pencil in place for five minutes. If it doesn’t phone your vet and ask whether you should bring your dog in."

      "title": "Collect your supplies.",
      "content": "Collect your supplies. If you’re using a bar of soap, the soap is the only thing you’ll need. An ordinary bar of soap, when pressed into the claw, will form a plug that covers the quick, like putting a cork in a bottle. [6] X Research source Clinical Procedures in Vet Nursing. Aspinall. Publisher : Butterworth-Heinemann This plug generally dislodges itself several hours later and needs no further attention."

A healthy dog won’t be at risk from blood loss from a bleeding quick, but the blood can be somewhat alarming, particularly if your dog seems distressed. [7] X Research source Know that the dog is in no danger, but act quickly to minimize its discomfort. Remaining calm is important to both you and your dog. If you cut the dog’s quick, the dog will likely be distressed and will look to you for cues on how to react. If you show alarm or become frantic, your dog likely will, too."

      "title": "Hold the foot still in this position for 3 - 4 minutes.",
      "content": "Hold the foot still in this position for 3 - 4 minutes. This places gentle pressure on the blood vessels and stops them from bleeding. Remove the toe from the soap after 3 - 4 minutes with a gentle twisting action. If your dog won’t hold still, push the claw firmly into the soap and then remove the soap with a slight twist of the wrist."

      "title": "Repeat.",
      "content": "Repeat. If a plug doesn’t form, repeat the above process again, pressing the claw into the soap until you’re successful. You’ll know a plug has successfully been formed when the soap is blocking the tip of the nail and no more blood is seeping through. If the bleeding won’t stop, contact your vet."

      "content": "Get your supplies ready. If you’re using potassium permanganate, you’ll need the potassium permanganate crystals, cotton swabs, and a bit of water to moisten the swabs. Potassium permanganate is a powder made up of bright purple crystals and is the preferred method of veterinarians to stop bleeding nails. [8] X Research source Clinical Procedures in Vet Nursing. Aspinall. Publisher : Butterworth-Heinemann It’s highly effective and the permanganate is a natural disinfectant. [9] X Research source Clinical Procedures in Vet Nursing. Aspinall.

      "title": "Bandage the paw.",
      "content": "Bandage the paw. Do your best to bandage the paw before transporting your dog to the vet. Use a bandage from a first aid kit to put a temporary dressing over the paw to help stop the dog from hitting the sore nail and to keep the car a bit cleaner. Alternatively, you can place a swab or gauze dressing over the toe and wrap a bandage around the paw to hold it in place. Put enough tension on the bandage that it grips the paw and doesn't fall off, but don't pull it too taut or the bandage may cut off circulation to the paw. If the bandage is too tight, your dog will seem distressed and chew at the bandage; if that happens, loosen the wrapping. If you don’t have access to a first aid kit, wrap clean toilet tissue or cotton wool around the toe and apply a tight-fitting sock over the paw to hold it in place. If you have someone available to help, ask them to hold cotton wool over the nail while you’re en route to the vet."
