      "content": "The law of attraction has three fundamental principles. Those who ascribe to the law of attraction believe that these principles hold the key to manifesting positive experiences. Here they are fleshed out in more detail: Similar things attract each other. For example, kind, generous people attract other kind and generous people into their lives, while angry people may attract other angry people to commiserate with. This also goes for thoughts—positive thinking attracts positive experiences into your life, and vice versa. It’s impossible to have truly empty space in your mind. Free areas will always be filled. Because of this, it’s important to fill your mind up with positive things, to prevent negative things from coming in to fill that space. It’s also important to clear out negativity from your mind, to make room for more of the positive. [3] X Research source It’s essential to feel gratitude for the present moment. It involves doing all you can to make the present the best it can be, rather than dwelling on the things you’re unhappy about. [4] X Research source This helps you focus your energy on manifesting positive things, instead of being stuck in disappointment."

      "content": "Use positive self-talk and positive affirmations. It’s normal to have negative thoughts about yourself, but this can hold you back. When you catch yourself thinking negatively, question that thought and try to replace it with a positive one. [11] X Research source You can also repeat your favorite mantra or positive affirmation throughout the day to keep yourself on track. Speaking positive things aloud can help you bring them into existence! Let’s say you catch yourself thinking, “I’ll never be that good at public speaking.” Question this thought by pointing out that everyone starts somewhere, and practice leads to improvement. Then replace that negative thought with a positive one. For example, tell yourself “I am improving at public speaking every time I do it.” Throughout your day, repeat positive affirmations to keep the positive energy going. You could say something like “I’m living my dreams,” “I’m a success,” or “I radiate joy.”"

      "content": "Challenge your worries. Think about whether or not your worries have come true in the past—chances are that some of them have, but certainly not all of them. Next, consider how bad the worst-case scenario would be if your worries actually came to fruition. You'll likely realize it's not that big of a deal in the long-run, and that you’ll be able to face the challenges as they come. [12] X Research source Staying in this more positive mindset will help you use the law of attraction to your benefit. For example, let's say you're worried you'll embarrass yourself during a presentation. How likely is that to happen? Has it happened before? If you did mess up, would it be the end of the world? Would you still think about it a year later? It also helps to think about what your life might be like in 5 or 10 years. Will the thing you're worried about even matter then? If the answer to this question is “no,” try to let go of your worry, and just focus on doing the best you can in your current situation."

Once you’re aware of them, tell yourself that it’s time to clear them out. Picture yourself letting go of these negative things, and being filled up with positive, healing energy instead. Next, bring your awareness to what you want to manifest or attract to your life. Picture it in your mind in as much detail as possible, as if it’s already happened and you’re recalling a memory. Inhale deeply as you visualize this image. As you exhale, imagine yourself breathing positive energy and life into it, making it even more real and powerful. When you’re ready, slowly open your eyes and end your meditation session."

As you work toward cultivating positivity and gratitude, you’ll also need to take real, tangible steps toward your goals. For example, if you’re trying to use the law of attraction to achieve your dream of becoming a successful singer, it’s not enough to simply visualize yourself on stage. You’ll also need to take lessons, practice, and put yourself out there at auditions in order to reach your fullest potential."

This belief can cause people to blame themselves when unfortunate things occur or people treat them poorly, which isn't healthy. [18] X Research source If you want to use the law of attraction, it’s important to remember that some negative events are completely out of your control, and you're not to blame for them. Remember, hardships and setbacks happen to everyone, regardless of how positively they think. You aren’t always in control of what happens to you, but you are in control of how you respond. Let’s say, for instance, that you lost a job you really wanted. Instead of blaming yourself, try to accept that this time it wasn’t meant to be. Then, think about how you can use this experience to do better next time."
