If your Verizon router has an Ethernet cable connected to its WAN/internet port and the port's light is on, you're all set. This is the typical setup. If the router is connected to the ONT with a coaxial (cable TV) cable but not via Ethernet (true of older setups), you'll have to perform some additional steps. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Switch to Ethernet if you're using a coaxial connection. If you're already connected via Ethernet, you can skip to the next step. If not, perform the following steps to switch to Ethernet: Find the ONT in your home. It's usually in a white or silver box with the Verizon logo, and it's typically installed out of the way of foot traffic. It could even be mounted on the outside of the house near your telephone box. Find the Ethernet port. It's usually near some green LED lights on the bottom of the unit. You may have to unscrew or unhinge the cover to get there. Run an Ethernet cable from the Verizon FIOS router's WAN/Internet port to the Ethernet port on the ONT. Leave the coaxial cable intact for now, as the Ethernet port is not actually active yet. Call Verizon FIOS support (800-837-4966) to have the Ethernet port on the ONT activated. Until support makes the switch, continue using the coaxial connection. [2] X Research source"

If you have TV service through Verizon FIOS, switching to a new router will prevent internet-specific TV features (such as the guide, On Demand, and the DVR) from working. You may lose the ability to program your DVR remotely when using your own router. You should still be able to use regular DVR functions in your home."

If you prefer to connect via Ethernet, run an Ethernet cable from your computer's network port to one of the LAN ports on the router. The router's wireless access point name usually has something to do with its make or model. Check the manual for login instructions. If the new router was specially configured for another network, you may need to do a full reset of the router. Specific instructions can be found in the router's manual, but it's usually as simple as pressing the end of a straightened paperclip into the small hole labeled \"Reset\" on the back of the router."
