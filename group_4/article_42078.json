      "content": "When you're overthinking, you tend to get caught up in details. While you might be able to learn something new by giving these things some quick consideration, it's better to step back and look at the whole picture. If you're crushing on someone, for example, you might think about their every comment or facial expression after you see them—but scrutinizing every interaction for telling details can keep you from seeing what's really going on. [1] X Research source Does your crush treat you, for the most part, like they're interested in you? Or are you just hoping to find a subtle sign because of how you feel about them? Being realistic about your overall relationship can help you stop overthinking every small interaction."

      "content": "Big problems seem less intimidating when you break them down. Sometimes you might find yourself overthinking about a problem that just seems too overwhelming, and you're not sure what to do about it. If you're unhappy with your job, you might get caught up in thinking about every aspect about it that you hate. That's not going to help you in the long run, though. [2] X Research source Instead, figure out the first step you can take—like taking an online class in your free time, or starting up a side hustle that you might eventually be able to expand into a full-time career."

      "content": "Practice mindfulness to develop this habit. When you're overthinking, you're usually either caught up in replaying something from the past or trying to figure out all the possible outcomes of something in the future. If you can learn to bring your attention back to what's actually happening around you, it can help you be more deliberate with your thoughts. [3] X Research source One good exercise for practicing mindfulness is to use all of your senses to experience what's happening in the moment—try to find at least one thing you can see, hear, smell, taste, and feel around you.

      "content": "Do something that you find fun and engaging. When your thoughts are running away from you, sometimes you just need to go do something else for a while. Anything will work, as long as it gets your mind off whatever is bothering you—some people enjoy coloring or doing puzzles, while others enjoy going for a walk or getting some exercise. Just choose something that makes you feel good. [5] X Research source If you love gardening, go outside and pull up some weeds, or repot a plant that's getting a little crowded. If you like getting active, go for a jog, do some laps in the pool, or practice your basketball free-throws."

      "content": "Try spending 10 minutes a day writing down your thoughts. Journaling can be a really powerful way to calm overthinking. When you write, it helps you organize your thoughts, so they don't feel so jumbled and overwhelming in your mind. Writing can also help you get to the root of what's going on—so you might feel like it's easier to see a solution, or even just realize it's time to let go of whatever you're feeling. [6] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source After you've been journaling for a while, read back through your writing and look for patterns in your thinking. Ask yourself how these patterns influence how you see yourself, your relationships, and the world around you. [7] X Expert Source Chloe Carmichael, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 14 July 2020. If you're struggling with critical thoughts, try writing them as \"you\" statements instead of \"I\" statements. If you see something like \"You're really bad at school,\" for instance, it might help you see how hurtful your critical inner voice can be. Try to think of a counter for each of those \"You\" statements, as well—like \"You always try really hard.\" [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Tell yourself you can't worry outside of this time. Create a block on your schedule for your specified worry time—maybe 15-20 minutes where you can think through whatever's on your mind. Then, throughout the day, keep a list where you can jot down anything that you start to worry about. Tell yourself you're not allowed to think about it until that designated worry period. That way, you won't end up overthinking all day long about one issue, especially if it's something that could be solved in those few minutes.

If you notice that you're just thinking about every little detail of a decision you're facing, or ruminating on all the ways a situation go wrong, try to reframe your thoughts. Focus on how you can be proactive—how can you solve the problem, or what can you learn from it that will help you in the future? [11] X Research source This simple shift can help you feel empowered instead of overwhelmed. It can also help to separate how you're feeling about a situation from the things you can do to solve that situation.

      "content": "Identifying a pattern can help you interrupt it. Next time you get caught up in overthinking, stop and track your thoughts backward to figure out what started the cycle. Over time, as you practice this, you'll probably start noticing that there are some similarities to what makes you overthink. Once you can identify those triggers, you'll be able to recognize when you're more vulnerable to overthinking, and it will be easier to stop it before it starts. [13] X Research source You might notice that you tend to overthink when you're anxious about a difficult conversation, for instance. In that case, you might find that it helps when you write down what you want to talk about, then set a deadline for when to have that conversation."

Maybe your thoughts have even taken on the voice of someone from your past who was really critical of you. Instead of replaying your mistakes over and over, get in the habit of replacing that negative self-talk with something positive about yourself. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you make a mistake at work, for instance, you might catch yourself thinking something like, \"I'm always getting things wrong; I don't even deserve that job.\" Instead, replace that with something like, \"I might not be perfect, but they hired me because they saw potential.

Or maybe you don't want to try something new because you don't want to end up being disappointed in your decision. If you're not willing to make a leap, though, you're not giving yourself a chance to succeed. [15] X Research source If you're trying to decide whether to go to a party, for instance, try asking yourself questions like, \"What's really the worst that could happen?\" or \"What do I have to lose?\" Then, ask yourself, \"What if I have a great time?\" Even if things don't turn out exactly how you hoped, you're more likely to regret it never taking a risk in the first place."

Fortunately, if you can learn to recognize these when they happen, it will be easier to overcome them. [16] X Research source Some of the most common cognitive distortions include: [17] X Research source All or nothing thinking: Believing things are either all good or all bad. Overgeneralization: Seeing negative events as part of a bigger cycle instead of taking them one at a time. Mental filtering: Only seeing the negative parts of a situation while ignoring the positive. Magnification or minimization: Feeling like bad things are really important while good things aren't that important Catastrophizing: Automatically assuming a situation will turn out badly."
