      "content": "Orbs are balls of light that indicate the presence of a spirit. Known as spirit orbs or ghost orbs, these paranormal phenomena often appear as light anomalies in photographs or video. They’re typically associated with hauntings and are believed to represent the presence of a ghost. Orbs can vary in size, shape, and color, though they’re generally small and circular. Some believe orbs are the manifestation of a spirit’s energy and that the color of the orb indicates different types of spirits or messages from the spirit world. Orbs are frequently reported at historical sites and old homes. Some people believe these locations retain energy from past events and the people who lived there, and this energy allows orbs to appear. Some believers think orbs represent guardian angels, ancestors, or supernatural entities. Note that there isn’t scientific evidence for orbs, and many orbs may be dust particles or reflections. However, many people who believe in ghosts and spirits also believe in orbs."
