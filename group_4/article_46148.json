      "content": "Find a flat, level surface to park your vehicle . Work on a clean, paved area so your vehicle is on even ground. Avoid jacking your vehicle in a place that's bumpy, near heavy traffic, or covered in gravel. Make sure each side of your vehicle is level so the jack or jack stands can't slip out from underneath it. Working in a garage or a flat driveway is the best place to lift your vehicle."

      "title": "Activate your vehicle's parking brake.",
      "content": "Activate your vehicle's parking brake. Find the lever in your vehicle that controls your parking brake and pull it until it's activated. The parking brake will ensure your vehicle doesn't lurch forwards or backwards while you jack it. Place chocks, or tire wedges, around each of your wheels if you're lifting up the back end of your car. If you don't have tire wedges, you can use 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) boards in front of and behind your wheels."

      "title": "Adjust the height of the jack stand if you need to.",
      "content": "Adjust the height of the jack stand if you need to. If you have an adjustable jack stand, lift the top of the jack stand up until it's touching the pinch point on your vehicle. Once you've changed the height of the stand, put the safety pin attached to the stand through the hole at the base to secure it place. That way, it won't fall down when the weight of your vehicle is placed on it. [7] X Research source Always place the safety pin in your jack stand, or else the vehicle could fall on top of you while you're underneath it. Some jack stands cannot be adjusted. If yours doesn't change height, you can skip this step."
