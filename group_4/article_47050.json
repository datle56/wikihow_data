      "content": "Change the PCIe slot (MSI Z790 Motherboard). This motherboard's top PCIe slot does not work with a certain BIOS. Fix this by installing your GPU into the second PCIe slot so you can update the BIOS effectively. Update the BIOS by downloading the file appropriate to your motherboard, extracting and moving the file to a USB drive, entering the BIOS , and selecting to update it from a USB drive. Note that the top NVME slot also doesn't work. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Update your graphics card drivers. Outdated firmware can cause many issues, like triggering the light on your motherboard. You want to keep your drivers updated to avoid any future issues. In most modern computers, running a system update will also update any outdated drivers. You can also update the drivers manually in Device Manager ."

      "title": "Check your power supply.",
      "content": "Check your power supply. Make sure there aren't loose or damaged cables that could be the cause of power loss. According to Meshesha, if you've installed a GPU, you'll need to make sure your power supply is powerful enough to support it. If you're not sure, check your GPU manufacturer's website."

      "title": "Reseat the graphics card.",
      "content": "Reseat the graphics card. Even if the GPU works fine, something could be wrong with that PCIe slot in the motherboard. Turn off your computer and remove the graphics card from the motherboard, then clean the ports on the motherboard and GPU to ensure there isn't any dust or debris preventing a connection between the two. Once you reinsert the graphics card, turn on your computer to see if the VGA light is still on."

      "title": "Check for hardware compatibility and conflicts.",
      "content": "Check for hardware compatibility and conflicts. Some CPUs that end with \"-f\" often have integrated graphics that are incompatible with external ones. In that case, enter BIOS and find the \"Device\" or \"Peripherals\" section. If your desktop computer or laptop has both internal and external graphics cards, look for a \"Graphics\" option instead. Turn off the integrated graphics and restart your computer. [2] X Research source Your computer will now use the graphics card detected in the PCIe slots instead of any internal software. When shopping for a new GPU, Meshesha advises researching its hardware requirements before purchase. Graphics cards all have different specs and different requirements in regards to RAM and other hardware."

Better fans and ventilation will also help prevent your computer from getting too hot. If your entire computer, including the CPU, is overheating, you'll most likely see a \"Your Device Ran Into a Problem\" error on a blue screen. [3] X Research source"
