      "content": "Make an overhand knot. Cross the end of the thread back over itself. Leave about 4 inches (10 cm) of thread toward the end of the line. Wrap it around the other side, and then pull the end back towards you through the middle of the loop. Tighten it up until the loop is a bit smaller than a dime. [2] X Expert Source Britt Edelen Boy Scout Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. This knot is also called the non-slip knot. It's a tight knot, and it doesn't snag on weeds when fishing because the tag end of the line faces down towards the hook."

      "content": "Thread the hook on if you're using one. If you're using the knot for fishing, push the end of the string through the eye hole in the top of the hook. Pull the hook toward the knot you made earlier. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Push the end of the thread back through the loop.",
      "content": "Push the end of the thread back through the loop. Keep the hook between the end of the line and the loop. Thread the end of the line back through the loop and up toward the main, longer part of the line. [4] X Research source When choosing where to push the thread through, pick the side that's facing slightly downward toward the end of the thread."

      "title": "Wrap the thread around itself.",
      "content": "Wrap the thread around itself. Moving up the line toward the main part of the thread, take the tail end of the line and wrap it up and around the main part of the line 3-5 times. Turn the end back toward the bottom, and slip it through the loop again. [5] X Expert Source Britt Edelen Boy Scout Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. This time, push it through the side of the loop that's facing slightly upward toward the rest of the thread."

      "title": "Tighten and adjust the loop.",
      "content": "Tighten and adjust the loop. Pull on the end of the line slightly to tighten it and then add a little bit of water on the main part of the knot so you don't burn the line against itself. Pull on it until the knot tightens up completely, and chop off the end, leaving less than 0.5 inches (1.3 cm). [6] X Expert Source Britt Edelen Boy Scout Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. To adjust the loop, pull on the end of the thread to make the loop smaller. Pull on the main part of the line to make the loop bigger."

      "content": "Create a simple loop by passing the line behind itself. It's easier to do this loop on a table the first time. Lay the line out, and bring the end of the thread up toward the main part of the line. Pass it underneath the main line, creating a loop. [7] X Expert Source Britt Edelen Boy Scout Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. You'll need to leave enough room at the end of the line to make another loop, so leave at least 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm)."

Create a second loop by tucking the end underneath the main line. The second loop will overlap the top of the first loop, like scales. [8] X Research source If you want to add a hook, thread it onto the second loop before you pass the end of the line underneath the main line."

Therefore, tug the end of the line back toward the main part of the line. [12] X Research source Add the hook to the line now, keeping it at the bottom of the loop you just made.
