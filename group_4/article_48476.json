      "content": "Crack a joke to make the bride smile. Wedding showers are the perfect time to lighten the mood with a one-liner about the fact that you’re still single or that they’re joining the club of married people. Whether it’s going to their wedding for a free meal or lamenting about buying them a gift, there’s plenty to giggle about. Your humorous words can help an already nervous bride relax. Does your fiancée have any hot friends? Or even just nice ones??? If you change your mind, I know a great escape route! So you’re just going to leave me out here on the dating apps alone? To fend for myself?? I have truly never been happier to buy someone an air fryer. I bet your high school boyfriend is really kicking himself now. You're the one that got away and then some! [4] X Research source There’s still time to back out. Oh wait, it’s too late. You’ve already ordered my favorite cake! Just kidding. Congratulations! Happy wedding shower! Please take this four-slice toaster as a symbol of your undying love for each other. Totally happy for and kinda jealous of you right now. Better you than me! You better throw me that bouquet. On second thought, forget the bouquet. Throw me a groomsman."
