      "content": "Keep a diary to reflect your thoughts. Recording your thoughts can enable you to step back and evaluate patterns in your thinking. Write down your thoughts and feelings and try to spot any triggers that lead to either positive or negative thoughts. Taking just twenty minutes to follow your pattern of thinking at the end of every day can be a valuable way to identify your negative thoughts and make a plan to change them to positive thoughts. Your journal can take on any form that you like. If you don’t care to write long-winded reflective paragraphs, you can just make a list of the five most prevalent negative thoughts and positive thoughts you had that day. Be sure to give yourself the time and opportunity to evaluate and reflect on the information in the journal. If you write every day, you may want to reflect at the end of every week."

      "content": "Identify your automatic negative thoughts. In order to shift away from the negative thinking that is holding you back from having a positive outlook, you'll need to become more aware of your \"automatic negative thoughts\". When you recognize them, you're in a position to challenge them and give them their marching orders to move right out of your head. [3] X Research source An example of an automatic negative thought is, upon hearing that you have an upcoming test, you think, “I’ll probably fail it.” The thought is automatic because it’s your initial reaction to hearing about the test."

      "title": "Challenge your negative thoughts.",
      "content": "Challenge your negative thoughts. Even if you have spent most of your life thinking negatively, you don’t have to continue being negative. Whenever you have a negative thought, particularly an automatic negative thought, stop and evaluate whether the thought is true or accurate. One way to challenge negative thoughts is to be objective. Write down the negative thought and think about how you would respond if someone else said the thought to you. It’s likely that you could offer an objective rebuttal to someone else’s negativity, even if you find it difficult to do for yourself. [4] X Research source For example, you may have the negative thought, “I always fail tests.” It is unlikely that you would still be in school if you always fail tests. Go back through your files or grades and find tests that you received a passing grade on; these challenge the negative thought. You may even find that you have tests that you passed with As and Bs, which would further confirm that your negativity is exaggerated."

      "title": "Replace the negative thoughts with positive thoughts.",
      "content": "Replace the negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Once you're feeling confident that you can spot and challenge negative thoughts, you're ready to make active choices about replacing negative thoughts with positive ones. This doesn't mean that everything in your life will always be positive; it’s normal to have a variety of emotions. However, you can work to replacing the daily unhelpful thinking patterns with thoughts that help you to flourish. For example, if you have the thought, “I will probably fail the test,” stop yourself. You’ve already identified the thought as negative and evaluated its accuracy. Now try replacing it with a positive thought. A positive thought doesn’t have to be blindly optimistic, such as “I will definitely get a 100 on the test, even if I don’t study.” It can be something as simple as, “I am going to take time to study and prepare so I do as well on the test as I can.” Use the power of questions. When you ask your brain a question, it tends to find the answer for you. If you ask yourself, \"Why is life so terrible?\" your brain will try to answer your question. The same is true if you ask yourself, \"How did I get to be so lucky?\". Ask yourself questions which draw your focus onto positive thoughts."

      "content": "Avoid \"black-and-white thinking.\" In this type of thinking, also known as “polarizing,” everything you encounter either is or it isn't ; there are no shades of gray. This can lead people to feel as though they have to do something perfectly or not at all. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To avoid this type of thinking, embrace the shades of gray in life. Instead of thinking in terms of two outcomes (one positive and one negative), make a list of all of the outcomes in between to see that things aren't as dire as they seem. For example, if you have a test coming up and don’t feel comfortable with the subject matter, you may be tempted to not take the test or to not study for it at all, so if you fail, it’s because you didn’t even try. However, this is ignoring the fact that you’re likely to do better if you spend more time preparing for the test. You should also avoid thinking that the only outcomes of your test-taking are an A or an F. There is a lot of “gray area” between the A and the F."

      "content": "Avoid \"personalizing\". Personalizing is making the assumption that you are personally to blame for anything that goes wrong. If you take this type of thinking too far, you can get paranoid and think that no one likes you or wants to hang out with you, and that every little move you make is going to disappoint someone. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Someone who is personalizing may think, \"Betty didn't smile at me this morning. I must have done something to upset her.\" However, it's more likely that Betty was just having a bad day, and her mood had nothing to do with you."

      "content": "Avoid \"filter thinking.\" This is when you choose to only hear the negative side of a situation. Most situations have elements that are both good and bad, and it helps to recognize both. If you think this way, then you'll never see the positive in any situation. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, you may take a test and receive a C, along with feedback from your teacher saying that your performance improved greatly from the last test. Filtering can cause you to only think negatively about the C and ignore the fact that you have shown improvement and growth."

      "content": "Avoid \"catastrophizing.\" This is when you assume that the worst possible outcome is going to happen. [9] X Research source Catastrophizing is usually related to anxiety about performing poorly. You can combat catastrophizing with being realistic about possible outcomes of a situation. For example, you might think that you’re going to fail an exam you’ve been studying for. A catastrophizer will then extend that insecurity to assume that you’ll then fail the class and have to drop out of college, then end up unemployed and on welfare. If you’re realistic about negative outcomes, you’ll realize that even if you were to fail a test, it’s unlikely that you would necessarily fail the course, and you would not have to drop out of college."

By meditating every day for 10 to 20 minutes at a time that's convenient for you, you can increase your awareness of self and the present, helping you to corral the stinking thinking with greater consciousness. [17] X Research source Try taking a yoga class. Yoga can also help you become more aware of the world as you get in touch with your breathing.

Craft stores and online tutorials are great resources for beginners who do not want to take a class. Doodle or draw in a sketchbook every day. Try revisiting older drawings and turning them into something new. Be a creative writer. Try penning a poem, short story, or even try your hand at a novel. You can even perform your poetry at an open mic night. Try role-playing, dressing as your favorite TV or comic book character, or trying out for a part at a community theatre. [22] X Research source"

If you can't avoid them, or don't want to, learn how not to let them get you down and keep your connection with them brief. Avoid dating anyone with a negative outlook.
