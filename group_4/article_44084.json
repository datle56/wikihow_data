      "content": "Spread up to 1 cup (240 mL) of sliced almonds on a baking sheet. Make sure the sliced almonds are arranged evenly in a single layer. You can use anywhere between 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) and 1 cup (240 mL) of sliced almonds. Spread them across an ungreased, rimmed baking sheet. [2] X Research source A rimmed baking sheet prevents the sliced almonds from spilling over the edges and burning in the oven. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the almonds in the oven and bake for 8 minutes.",
      "content": "Place the almonds in the oven and bake for 8 minutes. Put the baking sheet on the middle rack so the nuts aren’t too close the heating elements, which could cause them to burn. After about 8 minutes, the almonds should begin to smell nutty and fragrant. Try not to get distracted by something else or leave the nuts unattended—almond slices burn easily, so you should stir them right at the 8-minute mark."

      "title": "Take the almonds out of the oven, stir, then put them back.",
      "content": "Take the almonds out of the oven, stir, then put them back. Using pot holders to protect your hands from the heat, pull the baking sheet out of the oven. Stir and flip the almond slices with a spatula or wooden spoon. Return the baking sheet to the oven and close the door. You can also shake the baking sheet to help redistribute the nuts."

      "content": "Cook the almonds for another 5-8 minutes or until they are golden-brown. The almonds will take 10-15 minutes to toast completely, but pay careful attention to avoid burning them. You'll know the almonds are done when they're fragrant and golden brown around the edges. Take the almonds out before they turn dark brown since they'll continue to cook for a bit after you take them out of the oven."

      "title": "Cool and then store the sliced almonds.",
      "content": "Cool and then store the sliced almonds. Allow the nuts to cool completely before using. This will make them extra crunchy. If you left the almonds in the oven for slightly too long, transfer them immediately to a cool tray or bowl to prevent further toasting from the hot baking sheet. If you're not using the almonds right away, store them in a sealable plastic bag to preserve their flavor and texture. They will retain their texture and flavor for up to 2 weeks."

      "content": "Use the sliced almonds as a topping or eat them alone. Toasted sliced almonds are very tasty and versatile and can be used in a wide variety of dishes. They can add color, texture, and flavor when sprinkled on top of salads, desserts and even pizza. [4] X Research source Eat them on their own as a quick and healthy snack. Drizzle them in a little olive oil and sprinkle them with salt first, if you like. Mix them into cake, bread, and muffin batters. Toasted almonds are less likely to sink to the bottom than regular almonds."

If you plan to store the almond slices immediately after toasting them, make sure you’ve allowed them to cool completely before storing. [5] X Research source You can also freeze the nuts, which will keep them fresh for up to 3 months."

Make sure the nuts are spread evenly with minimal overlap, to ensure that they toast evenly. [6] X Research source Consider lining your tray in foil for easier cleanup. However, make sure to check the instructions for your specific toaster model first, to confirm that it’s equipped to handle aluminum foil. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Set the toaster oven to 350 °F (177 °C) and place the tray inside. The process for toasting almonds in a toaster oven is very similar to toasting in a regular oven. The major difference is that the heating elements are much closer to the almonds in a toaster oven, meaning that they can burn more easily.

      "content": "Pour 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of almonds into the preheated pan. Once the pan heats up, sprinkle the almonds across the pan in an even layer. This method works best for smaller amounts of nuts. Try to keep the slices from bunching up in one section of the pan, which will prevent them from toasting evenly."

      "content": "Stir or shake the pan every 30 seconds. Use a wooden spoon to stir, or simply shake the pan using the handle. This will prevent the nuts from burning. As they start to cook, you will see a small amount of moisture forming on top of the almonds. This is the oil being released from the nuts by heat, which will create a rich, nutty flavor. [14] X Research source Although the stovetop method is quick and easy, the almond slices tend to roast a little unevenly. It's important to keep the almonds moving. If the pan you are using has a metal handle, make sure to use an oven mitt when shaking to avoid burning your hand."

This should take 3-5 minutes, depending on your microwave's power. [17] X Research source All microwaves cook differently, so keep a close eye on your nuts as they cook. If you have an older model, it may take longer to toast the almonds. Make sure to stir the almonds at each 1-minute interval to make sure they toast evenly."
