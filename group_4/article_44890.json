Choose a product that contains natural ingredients like cocoa butter, vitamins A and E, beeswax, petroleum jelly, or dimethicone. Apply it several times a day, especially any time before you go outside. Carry the balm with you during the day and continue to moisturize throughout the day. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Try applying balm after you brush your teeth or wash your face. Toothpastes, mouthwashes, and facial cleansers alter your mouth’s PH and can cause chapping. Another good time to apply balm is right before you go to bed, to keep your lips moist during the night."

      "content": "This is an alternative to lip balms and ointments. Although it does not work as well as balms and moisturizers, it does provide a limited amount of protection from the sun and wind. Avoid light lipsticks that will intensify the effects of the sun and, instead, choose tinted lipsticks that reflect more sunburn-causing UV rays. [3] X Research source Look for lipstick that has an SPF rating of 15 or higher for added protection from the sun. Matte lipstick can dry out your lips so it’s important to apply moisturizer in the night and in the morning before you apply lipstick. This helps your lips hold their moisture. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Removing the dead skin cells lets your lips absorb moisturizers better. Once a week, rub a lip scrub all over your lips to exfoliate them and get rid of dry flakes of skin. After you exfoliate, immediately apply some moisturizing lip balm or a natural moisturizer like coconut oil to your lips to hydrate them. You can make your own moisturizing and exfoliating sugar scrub by mixing brown sugar crystals with olive oil or coconut oil. Avoid using any kind of abrasive exfoliating scrubs on your lips if you have a history of cold sores, as they can make your condition worse."

This can lead to a vicious cycle in which you apply this kind of balm to your dry lips, drying them out even more, leading you to use more balm. Make sure any lip balms or ointments you use don’t contain any of these additives. Instead, use products that contain natural oils like castor seed oil, hemp seed oil, and mineral oil."

Use some sort of face covering like a scarf, bandana, or face mask to cover your mouth when you go outside when it’s cold or windy. You wouldn’t go outside in the cold without a jacket and other protective clothing, but it’s really easy to forget about your lips! This is especially important if you’re doing some type of winter sport like skiing or snowboarding."

      "content": "Mouth breathing can dry out your lips because of the constant airflow. Make a conscious effort to breathe in and out of your nose whenever possible. This limits the amount of air flowing back and forth over your lips so they stay more moist. If you have a stuffy nose and difficulty breathing through it, try some nasal decongestants to clear it up so you don’t have to keep breathing through your mouth so much."
