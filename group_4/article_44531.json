Part of comforting your dog is making sure it cannot injure itself. Dogs with twitching eyes often have balance issues, so make sure it is in a comfortable laying position where it cannot fall and hurt itself."

In order for your veterinarian to get to the bottom of the problem, and in order to give a proper diagnosis, they will need to do a variety of tests on your dog. Your veterinarian is likely to start their examination by having you describe the dog's symptoms. Then they will do a physical examination and determine what additional testing needs to occur. In many cases of twitching eyes, your veterinarian will take a close look at your dog's ears. Certain types of ear infections can cause the eyes to twitch. Testing may include laboratory testing of your dog's blood and imaging of the dog's head."

      "content": "Determine if eye twitching is a side effect of any medications your dog is taking. Eye twitching can be caused by a bad reaction to medications that are prescribed for your dog. For example, a medication for colitis, called Metronidazole, can have a side effect of uncontrolled eye twitching. Discuss the possibility that the twitching is a side effect of medication with your veterinarian. They will be able to research the medication and determine if that is indeed a possibility. If the twitching is related to a medication, it should be replaced by a different medication, if possible."
