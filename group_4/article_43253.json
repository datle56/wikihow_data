      "content": "Think about whether your dog has become withdrawn. Most healthy, happy dogs are highly sociable creatures. If your dog is not greeting you as excitedly when you come home – less of a tail wag, less energy and movement – or loses interest in activities they once enjoyed, they may be depressed. Instead of running to the door to greet visitors, a depressed dog may slink away and find an out-of-the-way corner to curl up and go to sleep. Be particularly concerned if your dog hides from you. Dogs that hide are usually injured, sick, or depressed. [1] X Research source On the other hand, depressed dogs sometimes follow their owners around everywhere they go, yet show no desire to interact."

      "content": "Look for a change from active to inactive. Happy dogs have seemingly endless energy. For every mile you walk, he goes four – out-and-back, and out-and-back again. They nag you to throw the ball repeatedly, and your arm grows tired before their enthusiasm runs out. However, when depressed, your dog no longer pricks their ears up when you get their lead, and instead of charging off across the park, they trudge head-down at your heel. When you stop to talk to friends, they may sit, or even lie down. This change from active and energetic to inactive and lethargic may indicate depression. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Observe any changes in your dog's sleeping patterns. All dogs sleep a lot, particularly when their owners are gone. However, you should be concerned if your dog continues sleeping when you get home, or if they stay curled up instead of coming to the window or door for things that once attracted them, like the mail carrier or a passing dog.

      "content": "Consider whether destructive behavior or accidents in the house might be due to depression. Tearing up shoes or chewing on walls, books, furniture, or pillows are often signs of lack of exercise, which may lead to depression. Depressed dogs may also be more prone to have accidents in the house. Try not to be angry. Take them out more to ensure they have plenty of time to pee or poop outdoors."

Of course, some dogs have \"sad\" eyes at the best of times, due to naturally droopy eyelids rather than depression, so exercise a little common sense when interpreting sad eyes as a sign of depression."

      "content": "Observe your dog for droopy or pulled back ears. Depressed dogs tend to display a lack of responsive ear movements to noises going on around them. For example, your dog may fail to prick up their ears at the sound of things that normally interest them, such as you calling their name, or their collar and lead being fetched prior to a walk."

A healthy dog is unlikely to become depressed for no reason, therefore it is helpful to know if a recent event has impacted your dog's mental well-being. Dogs are routine driven, so the most common trigger for canine depression is a change of routine. Changes in routine that can trigger depression may include: Stress: In doggy terms stress includes anything that stops him from getting the attention he is used to. A stay-at-home owner who now goes out to work. A new baby, or puppy, in the household. The sudden loss of a companion (human or canine). Moving house. Being re-homed. Major building work or renovations in the home."

Spending enjoyable time with you is the best way to help your dog overcome his depression. Dogs that don't get enough exercise and playtime are more prone to getting excited and anxious.

      "content": "Reward your dog's positive behaviors. [12] X Expert Source Jaimie Scott Dog Owner Trainer Expert Interview. 16 June 2020. The mistake many owners make when dealing with a depressed dog is that they fuss over them when the dog is behaving abnormally. For example, if you make a fuss out of your dog when they don't eat, you inadvertently send them the message that they are doing a clever thing by not eating. A much better way of handling the situation is to put the food bowl down and ignore the dog until they decide to eat. Then once they take a mouthful, heap them with praise. This reinforces positive rather than negative behaviors and will help to lift your dog from their depression."
