      "content": "Put the litter box in a quiet location. Cats prefer to relieve themselves in a peaceful location without a lot of action or loud noises in the background. However, cats also do not like having a litter box that is too far out of the way. Make sure your cat can physically access his litter box. Do not put the box on a high shelf or an otherwise difficult to reach area if your cat is old and has trouble jumping or climbing. Avoid noisy or high-traffic areas. Do not place a litter box next to a washing machine, for example, or in a crowded hallway that gets a lot of foot traffic. Cats want peace and privacy, but they also want convenience.

This may discourage your cat from using the litter box.

For example, if you have 1 cat, you should have 2 litter boxes. [4] X Expert Source Brian Bourquin, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 20 December 2019."

You may also want to place your cat in his box shortly after he wakes up and after playing, as all of these are times most cats will want to excrete wastes. Putting your cat into the litter box during times he will likely need to relieve himself, such as after eating a meal or when he's just woken up, may help remind him to use the litter box every time he needs to go.

[8] X Research source Do a thorough cleaning once a week. This entails dumping out old litter, washing the litter box with a mild detergent, thoroughly rinsing the soap away, drying the box completely, and pouring in a fresh layer of litter. You should only add about two to three inches (five to seven centimeters) of litter when refilling the box. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a litter your cat will enjoy. There are many different types of cat litter, made from a variety of different materials. The most important factor is finding a litter that your cat will want to use. Most cats prefer clumping, unscented litter. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source However, your cat may prefer something different, especially if he was adopted and grew accustomed to something in his former home. See what your cat responds to and adjust accordingly. The most common types of cat litter are clay litter, clumping litter, crystal/silica gel litter, and bio-degradable litter. [11] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Switch litters gradually, rather than abruptly, to minimize the shock and confusion to your cat. Mix a small amount of the new litter in with your cat's existing litter every day over the course of three to five days. If you change litters gradually, your cat shouldn't notice a difference. [12] X Research source If your cat continuously relieves himself in a potted plant, he may prefer using soil instead of litter. This can be especially problematic in cats that used to live outdoors. Try lining your cat's litter box with potting soil, and see if he uses it.

[16] X Research source If your cat eliminates his waste outside the litter box, it's important to immediately wash that surface with an odor-neutralizing enzymatic cleaner. [17] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If your cat can smell his urine on the carpet, he might begin to associate that spot or that texture with going to the bathroom. If your cat passes solid waste outside the litter box, pick it up (with a paper towel or gloves) and place it in the litter box. This will give your cat scent-based cues to use the litter box next time. [18] X Research source Try making unwanted elimination areas less desirable to your cat. If he has a part of the house that he tends to relieve himself in instead of using his litter box, leave tin foil or double-sided tape on the floor in that spot to discourage him from going there.

If your cat has a strong aversion to using his litter box and nothing else has worked, temporarily confining him in a single room with the litter box could instill an understanding in him to use the litter box. [20] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source This should only be used as a last resort, when nothing else has worked. Do not confine your cat to a small room for extended periods of time. It is cruel to lock your cat up over long periods of time. Make sure your cat has food, water, and his bed in the room with the litter box. Keep the litter box on the opposite side of the room as the food, water, and bed. If he poops on the floor, scoop it up and put it in the tray to give him a scent mark to return to. If you cat is absolutely sold on a substrate, such as soil or carpet, and refuses to use the tray, then put that substrate in the tray. If necessary, purchase multiple pieces of carpet off cut and put it in the tray. Once the cat uses the tray with carpet in it, start to sprinkle cat litter over the carpet in the tray, to give the cat the idea. Replace sodden carpet with fresh in the tray."

If your cat gets too aggressive while playing and uses his teeth or nails, respond by immediately disengaging from the play activity, standing or sitting still, and ignoring him. Your cat will want to play, and when you deprive him of movement and interaction, he will quickly learn that he does not want that outcome. [21] X Research source Never hit your cat. Likewise, do not yell at him or squirt him with water if he has bitten you. Over time, these negative responses can cause your cat to become fearful of you. [22] X Research source Try changing the nature of your play if your cat becomes too aggressive. It's possible that he has slipped into hunting mode.

      "content": "Give your cat a hunting outlet. Your cat may not be getting enough exercise or enough outlets for his predatory instincts. Try giving him toys that he can flick, like a ball or a stuffed mouse. This will make him feel like he is hunting and catching. Better yet, use a toy with a string or pole, like a \"fishing\" toy, so that you and your cat can play together. [26] X Research source Try using catnip. Many stuffed cat toys come with a hook-and-loop fastener pouch to insert catnip, or you can simply sprinkle some catnip on the floor and let your cat roll around in it. About half of all cats won't find catnip desirable, but those that do will enjoy a short, safe burst of play time, followed by a period of ecstatic inactivity."

      "content": "Give your cat a scratching post. If your cat is constantly scratching you or pieces of furniture, there's a chance that he's doing it because he needs to scratch. A cat scratches household items to mark his scent on that item (using glands in his paws), and to remove the sheath that naturally grows over his claws. [27] X Expert Source Brian Bourquin, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. Giving him an outlet, like a scratching post, to satisfy his scratching needs should alleviate some of this problem behavior. If you catch your cat scratching furniture, a carpet, or any other place he's not supposed to scratch, interrupt him with a sharp noise. Try clapping your hands or shaking a jar full of coins to startle your cat out of his scratching. Immediately direct your cat to his scratching post. By interrupting his scratching of furniture and moving him to an acceptable object like a scratching post, you are reinforcing for your cat the notion that some objects are okay to scratch, but not others."

      "content": "Use citrus or menthol. Cats tend to dislike the smells of citrus and menthol. Rubbing a little bit of oil on the furniture your cat scratches the most could help prevent him from scratching there in the future. Soak several cotton balls in either citrus oil or a menthol-based muscle rub. Try dabbing the cotton ball on the legs and armrests of furniture your cat tends to target. Note that this will leave your furniture with a slight odor and may cause staining. Citrus oil may be less likely to stain. If you're concerned about the oils soaking through to your furniture, you may want to try simply taping the cotton balls onto the legs of couches and tables your cat tends to scratch."

Fill a spray bottle with clean, cold water. When the cat pounces, give him or her a quick squirt. Cats don't appreciate being sprayed with water, and they'll soon learn to associate this uncomfortable sensation with biting or scratching you. Be advised, however, that your cat will come to associate you with the unpleasant sensation of being sprayed with water. He may even come to fear you. [28] X Research source"
