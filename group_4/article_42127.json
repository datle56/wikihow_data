      "content": "Consider seeing a professional beautician. Many people have specific ideas about how they want their hair, nails, or makeup to look but they don’t know how to do it themselves. A professional beautician will be able to help you achieve your perfect look while taking away the stress of doing it yourself. Make sure you budget enough time to get dressed afterwards! Look for beauty salons that offer all of the services you need. There are many salons that offer hair, nail, and makeup packages. Make an appointment in advance. Otherwise, you may not get an appointment in time."

      "content": "Get ready with friends. Invite a group of friends over to get ready for prom together. Even if your friends have dates, it’s more fun to get ready with a group than alone. While you get ready, you can listen to your favorite songs, eat snacks, and reminisce about high school together. [1] X Research source Make sure you give yourselves enough time to get ready. It’s better to have too much time than too little. Some parents like to take photographs of their children before prom. If so, invite your friends' parents over to take photos when everyone is ready."

      "title": "Look your best",
      "content": "Look your best . Wear something that makes you feel comfortable and confident. Women should find a dress or outfit that flatters their body type. Pair the outfit with comfortable shoes that make you feel amazing. Men can pair a fitted suit or other attractive ensemble with stylish and comfortable shoes. Consider coordinating your outfits if you’re going with a group of friends. For example, you could all wear black dresses. Avoid wearing uncomfortable clothing. If it hurts while you’re trying it on, it will hurt even worse throughout the night."

      "title": "Organize a ride.",
      "content": "Organize a ride. If possible, arrange for a car or limousine to take you and your friends to prom. [2] X Research source Instead of arriving at prom alone, you will arrive with several of your closest friends. Additionally, if you are in charge of organizing the ride, you can decide who to include. If a limousine is out of your budget, consider: Calling a nicer rideshare Asking friends to contribute money towards the limousine Asking a parent with a luxury car to drive you and your friends to prom"

      "content": "Hang out with a large group. Encourage your friends to hang out together, even if they have dates. This will help your awkward friends feel more comfortable with their dates and give you plenty of people to talk to. [3] X Research source For example: Encourage everyone to sit around the same table. Guide your friend group towards the buffet so you can eat while you talk. Drag your friends and their dates onto the dance floor when “your song” starts playing. Be open to talking to new people! That's part of the fun of going to a dance.

      "content": "Hang out with your single friends. This is the perfect opportunity to get to know your single friends better. You’ll have much more fun laughing, eating, and dancing with friends than you would with a date you barely know. [5] X Research source Additionally, you won’t have to suffer through any awkward slow dances. If your prom has a photo booth, consider taking date-style pictures with your single friends. These hilarious photos will be treasured mementos when you’re older."

      "title": "Dance",
      "content": "Dance . Even if you don’t have a date, you can have a great time dancing. Dance with your friends, with your best friend and their date, or alone. If you know how to dance well, show off your moves! If not, you can still have fun by trying your best or dancing badly on purpose. Remember that everyone feels self-conscious while dancing. They’ll be too busy thinking about themselves to pay attention to any dancing mistakes you make."

      "content": "Interact with couples. You don’t need to avoid your close friends just because they have a date. In fact, they may appreciate having a familiar face around while they’re making awkward conversation with their date. To help you relax, think of the event as a large group of people instead of a lot of different couples. Make an effort to talk to your friends' dates. This will help you get to know them better."

      "title": "Recognize when to give a couple some space.",
      "content": "Recognize when to give a couple some space. Some of your friends may have come with boyfriends or longtime crushes. Throughout the night, there may be several moments when they’ll want alone time. Make an effort to recognize these moments and give them space to avoid wearing out your welcome. For example: Avoid interrupting couples that are kissing. If you see a couple arguing, don’t get involved. If your friend is slow dancing with their date, give them some space."

      "content": "Have a positive attitude. If you approach the night with a negative attitude, you will probably have a lot of negative experiences. However, if you start your evening with a positive attitude, you will be more likely to have a fun, memorable night. To have a positive attitude: Think positive thoughts. Instead of dwelling on negative thoughts, think about how exciting prom will be. Smile. Studies show that smiling can instantly improve your mood. Focus on the good aspects of your evening instead of dwelling on any negative expectations. [6] X Research source Don't get too down on yourself if you feel a little nervous—that's totally normal when you do something out of your comfort zone!"

      "content": "Be realistic about having a date. Many people feel that they have to find a date for prom. However, prom isn’t going to be magically amazing just because you have a date. [7] X Research source In fact, some people choose not to bring a date to avoid any drama or heartbreak. For example: If you don’t know your date very well, your evening may be filled with awkward silences. If you fight with your date or if they leave with someone else, it will negatively affect your night. Hanging out with close friends and reminiscing about high school is usually more fun than going on a date."

      "content": "Avoid the prom hype. Most people make prom into a big deal, thinking of it as a life-changing experience. However, prom is just one night out of your life. Once you graduate, you’ll go to college or enter the work force. You’ll create new memories, make new friends, and experience amazing things. You probably won’t think about prom again until your high school reunion. [8] X Research source Instead of focusing on having the “perfect” prom, focus on spending time with your friends and having a great time."

      "content": "Let go of your expectations. This is important whether or not you have a date. If you go to prom with strict ideas about how the evening should go you will probably be disappointed. [9] X Research source Additionally, you may miss out on exciting new experiences because you’re trying to create the “perfect” night. Instead, go with the flow and try to have fun. For example: If you and your friends are too late to make your dinner reservations, go through a burger drive-through instead. You will create hilarious memories and have time to relax. If a friend changes plans, see what your other friends are doing and tag along. Don’t be afraid to leave your comfort zone."
