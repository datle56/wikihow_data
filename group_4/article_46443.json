      "content": "Calculate how much protein you need, based on your weight. It is recommended that both male and female adults (19–50) consume 8 grams (0.28 oz) of protein for every 20 pounds of body weight (0.8 g of protein per kg) per day. For example, a person weighing 155 pounds (70 kg) should get 56 g of protein per day. [2] X Research source In general, speed and strength training athletes should get 1.2–1.7 g of protein per kg of body weight, while an endurance athlete may need more like 1.2–1.4 g of protein per kg of body weight. (To find your weight in kg, divide your weight in pounds by 2.2). So an athlete weighing 175 lbs. (79 kg) would consume 94.8 g of protein daily to meet the minimum of 1.2 g/kg."

If the amount of protein you should have according to your protein requirement chart is more than you are getting from diet alone, you can make up the difference with whey protein. After figuring out your protein intake with a nutritional calculator, subtract the amount of protein you are getting in your diet from the required amount found on your protein requirement chart. The amount of protein left over is what you can get in supplement form from whey protein. Additionally, if you are a male who exercises regularly, you may benefit from whey protein supplementation to help you recover from exercise more quickly."

You can achieve the inclusion of fiber with low sugar by incorporating some fruits and vegetables into your shakes. The following suggestions should help: Add blueberries or raspberries. Both fruits are high in fiber and low in sugar. Alternatively, add spinach or cucumber. Both vegetables are high in fiber, and don't taste as strong as some other vegetables, so you can mix them into your shake without making it taste strange. Avoid using honey, maple syrup, or sugar. These contain high amounts of sugar and will be detrimental to a diet plan. The fruit you add to a smoothie will sweeten it naturally. [13] X Research source"
