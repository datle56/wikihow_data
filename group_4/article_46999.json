In 2015, Ringo Starr sold his personal copy of The Beatles for $790,000—it was the first pressing, featuring the serial number 0000001. [2] X Research source Even without that kind of history, early pressings in good condition can fetch $1,000 or more—especially if there's a serial number on the cover or you find the UK version with a misprint that omitted “E.M.I.” on the label.

Pay attention to all of the things that affect the value—the edition, condition, special markings, and any additional media that would have been included in the original album, like posters or stickers. Then, look up the album online. Check what the same version in similar condition is selling for (not just what it’s listed for) to get an idea of what someone might pay for yours. [41] X Research source Look near the center of your album to find the matrix numbers and pressing stamps—these are unique identifiers, and sometimes they’re the only way to tell the difference between an original album and a re-issue. [42] X Research source Check popular record trading websites like Discogs , Vinted, and Moose Vinyl ."

      "title": "Collectibility",
      "content": "Collectibility The value of an album is based entirely off what someone is willing to pay for it, so for an album to be valuable, it has to appeal to collectors. To check how collectible an item is, check online listings—if there are a lot of unsold listings, the market for that record might not be strong right now. Sometimes, collectible records are albums that were popular on their release, like much of the Beatles’ work—but often, it’s albums that became cult favorites and are now hard to find."

      "title": "Rarity",
      "content": "Rarity Hunting for rare albums is part of the fun of collecting. If a record was only released in limited quantities or there are only a few surviving copies, chances are, it will be more valuable than a record that was produced in mass quantities. [43] X Research source Sometimes this will mean that only a certain version of an album is valuable—like a mono vs. stereo pressing or those featuring unique errors, redacted images, or unique songs, for instance."

      "title": "Cover art",
      "content": "Cover art Unique, interesting, or controversial cover art can often make an album more valuable. This is especially true if the cover art is rare, like if it was replaced later with another version. The Beatles’ Butcher cover is a great example of this, but even less controversial album covers can boost the value, like the rare picture sleeve on “All Tomorrow’s Parties” by The Velvet Underground & Nico."

    {
      "title": "Condition",
      "content": "Condition Just like in most collecting, condition is extremely important in record collecting. Any signs of wear and tear can decrease the value, including worn corners, split seams, writing on the cover, and missing elements. The condition of the record itself is important, too—warps, scratches, or gouges will all impact the value. [44] X Research source One common sign of wear on albums is ring-shaped fading on the cover caused by the record itself. If your album is missing posters, stickers, or other inserts, it will typically be worth less than a complete version."

No matter how you plan to sell your album, be sure to have a good idea of the value so you’ll know whether an offer is a good deal or not."
