      "title": "Yh is short for “yeah” or “yuh-huh.”",
      "content": "Yh is short for “yeah” or “yuh-huh.” It’s basically a shortened “yeah” with the “ea” removed to make texting even easier (and faster)—although some say it may also be an abbreviated version of “yuh huh.” Either way, it can go in place of any casual affirmative, from “yes” to “yep” and “yeah.” [1] X Research source “Yh, I’m going on the trip too!” “Yh, I’m hungry too. Want to get lunch?”"

    {
      "title": "Say \"yh\" to agree with someone else’s statement.",
      "content": "Say \"yh\" to agree with someone else’s statement. When someone expresses an opinion or makes a statement you agree with, a simple “Yh” is all you need to acknowledge that agreement. For example: [2] X Research source Them : “I think that concert was the best I’ve been to!” You : “Yh, same!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use \"yh\" to answer a question in the affirmative.",
      "content": "Use \"yh\" to answer a question in the affirmative. If you’re asked a question that can easily be confirmed or validated with a “yes,” you can send “Yh” instead. For example: Them : “Is the game at noon tomorrow? I forgot to write it down.” You : “Yh, it is! I think we’re meeting up at 11:30, tho.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use \"yh\" to offer a casual, mild response.",
      "content": "Use \"yh\" to offer a casual, mild response. Anytime you want to give an affirmation without sounding too formal (or over-the-top excited), you can use “Yh” to respond. Yh can sound neutral or mildly enthusiastic over text depending on how you use it (with or without punctuation, for example). [3] X Research source Them : “Are you excited about the party tomorrow?” Neutral : “Yh it’ll be nice to see people.” Mild enthusiasm : “Yh, it’ll be a fun time!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "She might be waiting for something else to talk about.",
      "content": "She might be waiting for something else to talk about. Generally, you shouldn’t assume too much from a single “yh” from a girl, especially if she uses text acronyms a lot; it might just be how she texts! However, if you get a lot of one-word responses where she texts “yh” without adding anything else, you might want to strike up a more engaging conversation. [4] X Research source Try asking her about something you know she’s especially interested in. That can show her you want to get to know her! For example, if she’s a big reader, you might ask, “What’s the best book you’ve read lately?” Or, if she travels a lot, you could ask, “If you could go back to one place you’ve visited for a month, where would you go?” You could even strike up a more in-depth conversation about how her day went or anything special that happened. Showing genuine interest is key!"

    {
      "title": "She might be busy.",
      "content": "She might be busy. Then again, it’s also totally normal to use abbreviations like “yh” when you’re on the go and don’t have time to type out something longer—so don’t panic or assume she’s uninterested right away. If you send a reply quickly, don’t text her a bunch of times in a row until she responds; just put the ball in her court and let her get back to you when she can. There’s nothing wrong with replying to a girl quickly, but it’s also okay to leave a little space between your reply messages. She has a life—you should, too! When you leave space between responses and don’t always text back immediately (but have engaging questions and conversation-starters when you do), you’re demonstrating confidence and independence."

    {
      "title": "She might be uninterested in talking.",
      "content": "She might be uninterested in talking. It's unfortunate, but it happens to everyone! If you keep getting one-word, conversation-killing replies (even after trying the above tips), it might be a sign that she's not feeling it and doesn't really want to keep talking. In that case, it's okay to let the conversation go and find someone excited by the prospect of talking to you."

    {
      "title": "He might be in a hurry or just a casual texter.",
      "content": "He might be in a hurry or just a casual texter. Just like getting “yh” from a girl, it probably doesn’t mean much if you get one or two “yh” texts from a guy, especially if you know he’s got things going on or uses abbreviations a lot. As long as he replies to you consistently (and especially pretty soon after you text him), that means he’s definitely into texting you. On the other hand, if you’re getting a lot of short, one-word (or acronym) responses from a guy, you might want to try starting conversations with more depth. Ask him about his passions, what he’s been up to lately, and any hobbies or interests the two of you might share. Plus, you don’t have to text him back right away every time. Once you start asking those in-depth questions, leave a little space between responses to show him you’re a self-sufficient and busy person, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "He might not want to keep talking.",
      "content": "He might not want to keep talking. As mentioned above, continued one-word \"YH\" (and similar) responses could indicate that his heart isn't really into it. That's okay! You put your best foot forward, but sometimes it just doesn't work out. If he isn't responding to your attempts at more in-depth conversations, it might be time to move on and find someone who'll respond enthusiastically."

      "title": "The origins of the shorthand “y”h are unclear.",
      "content": "The origins of the shorthand “y”h are unclear. There are a lot of different texting abbreviations, so many that it’s impossible to keep track of where they all come from! So, while we can’t pinpoint exactly where “yh” comes from, the idea behind it is probably similar to abbreviating “Mister” to “Mr.” or “doctor” to “Dr.” It’s just a simple way of speeding up the typing process."
    },
    {
      "title": "“You here?” or “You home?”",
      "content": "“You here?” or “You home?” Although “yeah” is the main meaning behind “yh,” you might see someone use it to say “You here?” (or “You home?”) instead. You can usually tell if this is what someone means based on whether there’s a question mark—and whether you’re supposed to meet up with them. Them : “Yh? I’m by the entrance.” You : “Almost! Bus was running a little late.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Yahoo”",
      "content": "“Yahoo” This usage is rare, but “yh” can also be an abbreviation for “Yahoo,” either as an expression of excitement (genuinely or sarcastically), or as a reference to the website Yahoo.com . “Got another test to look forward to today, yh.” “Just scrolling around through news stories on Yh.”"
