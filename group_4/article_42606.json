      "content": "Read the bike's instruction manual if it came with one. If your bike came with an instruction or maintenance manual, it will usually have pedal removal and installation instructions. Read these thoroughly to see if there is anything particular that you need to do with your specific bike. The instructions will also detail whether you need a 15mm wrench or a hex key to remove the pedals. [1] X Research source Check to see if the manual has a table of contents so that you can skip to the pedal or crank section. If your bike didn't come with a manual, you can still determine what kind of tools you'll need to remove them."

      "title": "Look for a hex fitting on the pedal if you don't have a manual.",
      "content": "Look for a hex fitting on the pedal if you don't have a manual. The pedal is attached to the crank by the crank arm. The hex fitting will be located on the end of the crank arm and looks like a hexagonal impression. Most bike pedals require either a 6mm or 8mm hex key to install and remove the pedals. [2] X Research source Popular crank brands that require a hex key include Shimano, Look, and Speedplay."

      "content": "Get a 15mm wrench if the pedals don't have a hex fitting. Most basic or flat pedals require a 15mm wrench rather than a hex key. You can purchase a 15mm pedal spanner, which is specifically used for bike repairs, or you can use a standard 15mm wrench to remove your pedals. [3] X Research source"

If you're unsure of which sized hex key you need, figure it out by inserting both a 6mm and 8mm hex key into the hex fitting on the end of the crank arm. The hex key should fit snugly in the fitting and allow you to rotate the bolt that holds the pedal in place."

Rotate the hex key clockwise while holding the pedal in place to loosen it. Continue rotating the hex key until the pedal comes loose. [4] X Research source The left pedal is sometimes marked with an “L.” Rotating the crank so that the pedal is in a downward position may make it easier to remove it."

Usually, the right pedal is on the same side as your chainrings. Turn the key counterclockwise to loosen the pedal. Then, continue turning the hex key until the pedal comes loose enough to take off the crank. [5] X Research source The right pedal will be on the same side as the chainring and is sometimes marked with an “R.”"

Lifting up the back wheel as you work will keep the bike still even if you pedal the bike forward or rotate the crank. This will make removing the pedals with a wrench much easier.

The pedal is attached to the bike's crank with a 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) crank arm. Fit the 15mm wrench around the fitting where the pedal and crank arm are connected.

Kids should learn how to balance, master handlebars, steering, and balancing on two wheels before learning how to pedal. [11] X Research source If the kid's a little older, you can take the pedals off their bike and let them walk around with it. [12] X Research source Let them run around with it until they learn to balance, then put the pedals back on. [13] X Research source"
