Purchasing light-blocking curtains and getting a white-noise device are only a few of the ways you can create a better environment for deep sleep and happy waking. Install a ceiling fan. These can create white noise and also circulate air in a stuffy room. Decorate with soothing colors. Repaint if necessary. Use ambient lighting, as opposed to overhead lighting, when possible. Lamps are a good source for this, but recessed lighting inside wall molding is also an option. Dimmer switches can also create the right light level. Choose the right alarm clock. To ensure waking without shock or grogginess, consider an alarm specially designed to wake you gradually. Install an air purifier. For allergy sufferers, this is essential and will result in vastly improved sleep quality. Consider a foam mattress. Especially if you sleep with another person, foam mattresses are great at isolating movement so it doesn't wake the other person."

[7] X Research source Keep a notepad by your bed to record intrusive thoughts that wake you up during the night. Take stock of accomplishments. One way of helping gain closure and foster reassurance is to write down what you've accomplished during the day. Create a to-do list for the next day. Instead of lying awake, trying to remember what needs to happen tomorrow, create a list before going to bed. This helps you get closure on the current day while dialing back on the pressure to remember everything at once. Try preparing for the next day before you go to bed. Lay out your clothes, pack a lunch, and assemble everything you'll need for work or school the next morning. This can help ease stress in the morning, and you'll feel better getting into bed know it's already been done."

Don't gossip or put other people down. Use praise whenever possible for others and yourself. Don't expect perfection . When we make the perfect the enemy of the good, we are never satisfied.
