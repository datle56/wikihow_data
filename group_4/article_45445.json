Another way of stating this postulate is to say if two lines intersect with a third line so that the sum of the inner angles of one side is less than two right angles, the two lines will eventually intersect. Those two lines are not parallel to each other. [5] X Research source This last postulate cannot be proven as a theorem. In non-Euclidean geometry, this “parallel” postulate does not hold true."

A line segment is finite and only exists between two points. A ray is a hybrid between a line and a line segment: it extends infinitely in one direction from a defined point. [6] X Research source A single line always has a measure of 180°. Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope and never intersect. Perpendicular lines are two lines that come together to form a 90° angle. Intersecting lines are any two lines that cross each other at any point. Parallel lines can never intersect, but perpendicular lines can."

An obtuse angle is a wide angle and is defined as any angle that measures greater than 90°. A right angle measures exactly 90°. [7] X Research source Being able to identify the various types of angles is an essential part to understanding geometry. Two lines that make a right angle are also perpendicular to each other. They form a perfect corner. You may also see a straight angle which is simply a line. The measure of this angle is 180°. For example: A square or rectangle has four 90° angles while a circle has no angles."

In an acute triangle, all angles have a measure less than 90°; obtuse triangles have one angle that is greater than 90°; and a right triangle has one 90° angle. [8] X Research source Equilateral triangles have three equal sides and three angles that all measure exactly 60°. Isosceles triangles have two equal sides and two equal angles. Scalene triangles have no equal sides and no equal angles."

Squares, rectangles, circles, triangles, etc. are all shapes that you will need to know how to calculate perimeter and area for. The perimeter of an object is the measure of all of the sides of the object while the area is the measure of the amount of space the object takes up. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source The equations for perimeter and area for the most common shapes are: [11] X Research source The perimeter of a circle is called the circumference and is equal to 2πr where “r” is the radius. The area of a circle is πr 2 where “r” is the radius. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2l + 2w where “l” is the length and “w” is the width. The area of a rectangle is l x w where “l” is the length and “w” is the width. The perimeter of a triangle is a + b + c where each variable denotes one side of the triangle. The area of a triangle is ½bh where “b” is the base of the triangle and “h” is the vertical height."

Objects such as spheres, rectangular prisms, pyramids, and cylinders all have special equations to do this. The surface area is the total area of every surface of the object while the volume is the total amount of space that object occupies. [12] X Research source [13] X Research source The surface area of a sphere is equal to 4πr 2 , where “r” is the radius of the sphere. The volume of a sphere is equal to (4/3)πr 3 , where “r” is the radius of the sphere. The surface area of a rectangular prism is 2lw + 2lh + 2hw, where “l” is the length, “w” is the width, and “h” is the height. [14] X Research source The volume of the rectangular prism is l x w x h, where “l” is the length, “w” is the width, and “h” is the height. [15] X Research source"

[17] X Research source Alternate interior angles are the two angles that are inside the two lines but on opposite sides of the transversal. [18] X Research source Alternate exterior angles are the two angles that are outside of the two lines, but on opposite sides of the transversal. [19] X Research source Angle pairs are equal to each other if two of the lines are parallel. [20] X Research source There is a fourth angle pair: consecutive interior angles. These are the two angles on the inside of the lines and on the same side of the transversal. When the two lines are parallel, the consecutive interior angles always add up to 180°.

It is defined as a 2 + b 2 = c 2 , where “a” and “b” are the length and height (straight lines) of the triangle and “c” is the hypotenuse (angled line). If you know any two sides of a triangle, you can calculate the third side with this equation. [22] X Research source For example: If you have a right triangle with side a = 3 and b = 4, you can find the hypotenuse: a 2 + b 2 = c 2 3 2 + 4 2 = c 2 9 + 16 = c 2 25 = c 2 c = √25 c = 25; the hypotenuse of the triangle is 5."

If you are given a line segment, but there are angles coming out of the line segment, you know that the measure of all the angles must sum to 180°. Write this information on the diagram or in the margins. This a good way to think about what the question is asking. For example: Angle ABC and angle DBE make a line, ABE. Angle ABC = 120°. What is the measure of angle DBE? Since the sum of angle ABC and DBE must equal 180°, then angle DBE = 180° - angle ABC. Angle DBE = 180° - 120° = 60°."

There are many individual theorems that describe the properties of triangles, intersecting and parallel lines, and circles that can be used to solve a problem. Identify the geometric shapes in the problem and find the theorems that apply. Use old proofs and problems as a guide to see if there are similarities between them. Here are some of the general geometric theorems you will need: The reflexive property: A variable is equal to itself. x = x. The addition postulate: When equal variables are added to equal variables, all of the sums are equal. A + B + C = A + C + B. The subtraction postulate: This is similar to the addition postulate, all variables subtracted from equal variables have equal differences. A – B – C = A – C – B. The substitution postulate: If two quantities are equal, you may substitute one for the other in any expression. The partition postulate: any whole is equal to the sum of all of its parts. Line ABC = AB + BC."
