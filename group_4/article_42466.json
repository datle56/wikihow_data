      "content": "Put on the right undergarments and a thin layer of clothing. While you can take measurements against bare skin, you can choose to slip on a thin layer of clothing. A lightweight t-shirt or tank top are fine, as are leggings or even skinny jeans. Beneath your clothes, different undergarments will result in different body measurements. Remember to put on the specific bra you plan to wear with the garment that’s being tailored or custom-made. For general measurements, try something simple like a non-padded t-shirt bra. [1] X Research source To get the correct waist and hip measurements, make sure your undergarments aren’t cinching in your waist. Only wear shapewear if you intend to wear it under your clothes. If you’re taking general measurements, choose undergarments that accurately represent your go-to, everyday undergarments. For instance, if you always wear push-up bras or wear nothing but sports bras, put one of those on instead. Don’t wear anything too thick like a sweatshirt since this will increase your measurements."

      "content": "Wear shoes with the correct heel height for hemline or inseam measurements. This is especially important when taking measurements for a dress or pair of trousers. Slip on the shoes you’re planning to wear with your altered clothes, or a similar pair with the same heel height, to avoid too short a hemline. [2] X Research source If you’re taking measurements for a bridesmaid dress and you’ve ordered a pair of 4 in (10 cm) high heels to wear for the occasion, put a similar pair of shoes with 4 in (10 cm) high heels. It can be useful to wear the right shoes even if you’re not looking to hem your clothes. Wearing heels changes your posture so it’s best to take measurements of your body as it will be in your clothes."

      "title": "Stand straight up with your feet hip-width apart and your head lifted up.",
      "content": "Stand straight up with your feet hip-width apart and your head lifted up. Good posture is the key to accurate measurements. Distribute your weight evenly on both feet, with your feet at least 6 in (15 cm) apart. Don’t shift your weight to one side, or bend your knees since this will throw off your measurements. [3] X Research source Focus on looking straight ahead rather than glancing down and bending over your head. If you need to take a break from standing ramrod-straight, that’s ok! Just pause for a moment to relax your body or sit down before resuming. It can be really tempting to bend over and look down to see the tape measure or watch your friend as they help with your inseam measurement. Resist this urge! To help you stay focused, pick a point on the wall to stare at or pretend you’re balancing a book on your head. If you’re standing in front of a mirror, maintain eye contact with yourself."

      "content": "Use a soft measuring tape. Soft fabric and plastic tape measures can be easily found at craft stores and online for a few USD. Some tape measures hang loose while others come on retractable spools. Make sure yours is soft and flexible like a ribbon. A ruler or a metal tape measure (the type used for home improvement projects) aren’t suitable for taking body measurements since they’re not flexible. Don’t use a very old measuring tape. The material might have warped and the notches may be inaccurate. [4] X Research source"

When taking bust, waist, and hip measurements, as well as any other horizontal measurement, it's important to keep the tape measure level on all sides as you wrap it around your body. [5] X Research source Double-check that the tape measure is level all the way around before confirming the measurement. Looking in a full-length mirror will help you determine if your tape measure is parallel to the ground, or if it’s sagging on one side. Rotate your body while looking in the mirror to make sure the tape measure is completely level. [6] X Research source To fix an uneven circumference, slide your fingers beneath the tape measure to correct its position against your body."

      "content": "Start at the 0 in (0 cm) end when taking a measurement. If you’re taking a horizontal measurement, such as your waist measurement, position this end at the center of your body and bring the rest of the tape around to meet it. Or, if you’re taking a length measurement such as inseam, hold the end of the tape measure at the starting point and draw the rest of the tape along your body until you reach the stopping point. [7] X Research source Where the tape meets the end, or when you reach the stopping point, this will be the number you use for the measurement. If you’re not paying attention, you might start at the 60 in (150 cm) end. This might actually give you believable measurements but they’ll be incorrect."

      "content": "Pinch the tape measure at the correct spot and bring it up to your eye level. If you’re supposed to be staring straight ahead, you might wonder how you’re supposed to see the tape measure. There’s a simple trick to this! While maintaining good posture and looking straight ahead, pinch your finger and thumbnail around the tape measure at the correct spot on the measuring tape. Then bring the tape measure up to your eye level to see where you’ve pinched it. With a secure grip on the tape measure, release the tape from around your body and lift it up to take a closer look. Check to see which line on the tape your thumbnail is sitting at, and use this as your measurement. If your thumbnail is pointing to 31.25 in (79.4 cm) on the measuring tape, write this down as your measurement."

In column 1, write down the type of measurements. Column 2 should start with blank spaces and in which you’ll write each measurement down as you go. [8] X Research source Even if your first column is as simple as “Bust, Hips, Waist” it’s still helpful to write them down. It’s easy to forget these numbers, especially the ones with fractions! If you’re taking a lot of measurements, it can help to have a friend write down the numbers for you. They can also call out the next measurement from the list. If you prefer, print off a measurements diagram so you remember which numbers correspond to each part of your body."

For the underbust measurement, align the tape measure with the part of your chest that sits directly under your breasts, where the bottom of your bra sits. Use the same technique of placing the tape measure at the center front, wrapping it around your back, under your arms, and pinching the tape where it meets the end in the front.

Once you’ve taken your bust and underbust measurements, you’ll use the underbust number as your bra band measurement (e.g., 32, 34, 36, and so forth). To figure out your cup measurement, round up your bust measurement to the nearest whole number, in inches. Then subtract the underbust number from your rounded-up bust number. Use the difference to gauge your cup size. A difference of 0 indicates an AA cup, 1 indicates an A cup, 2 indicates a B cup, 3 indicates a C cup, 4 indicates a D cup, 5 indicates a DD cup, 6 indicates a DDD or F cup, and 7 indicates a G cup. [13] X Research source For instance, if you have a 36 in (91 cm) bust, and a 34 in (86 cm) underbust, that leaves you with a difference of 2. Therefore your bra size is 34B. Add one cup size for each additional inch of difference."

Have them extend the tape measure to your outer shoulder, down over your elbow, and down to your wrist. They can stop at your wrist bone. Record this number as your sleeve length. [14] X Research source This should be one full measurement; don’t break it up into pieces. The sleeve length measurement is used for certain types of formal and custom-made shirts or blouses. You can also extend your bent arm out in front like a doll for this measurement. It just needs to be positioned at 90 degrees."

Then instruct them to pass the tape across your lower shoulder blades at the back, bringing to the armscye at the other side. They should hold it parallel to the ground. Record the distance as your low shoulder or low chest measurement. [17] X Research source This measurement may be used for custom-made tops, blazers, and dresses. Think of the armscye as the armhole on a t-shirt. This measurement is sometimes called armscye-to-armscye measurement, and can be taken at the front and back of your torso. Stand in front of a full-length mirror with your back straight and your shoulders relaxed. Extend the tape measure from the middle of the shoulder blades, at the base of one arm to the other.
