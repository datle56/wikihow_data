      "content": "Listen for the pump while turning it on to rule out an electrical issue. Turn on just your vehicle’s battery and locate the button that activates the pump, which is usually on the steering column. Press the button and listen for a humming sound from the pump under your vehicle’s hood. If you don’t hear a sound, there’s either a problem with the fuse, your vehicle’s wiring, or the pump’s internal electronics. [1] X Expert Source Hovig Manouchekian Auto Repair & Design Specialist Expert Interview. 23 February 2021. [2] X Research source Try popping your vehicle’s hood if you have trouble hearing the pump. If you hear your pump humming but you don’t see any fluid coming out from the nozzles, the fluid tank may be empty or there may be a clog. The tubes that are connected to the nozzles may have been disconnected, as well. [3] X Expert Source Hovig Manouchekian Auto Repair & Design Specialist Expert Interview. 23 February 2021. If the pump doesn’t work at all, you’ll have to check the pump’s electrical system to see if the pump is faulty."

      "content": "Inspect the washer tank to see if it’s empty. Open your vehicle’s hood and look for the circular tank cap that has a picture of windshield wipers on it. Unscrew the cap and look inside the tank to check the fluid levels. Typically, you’ll see a blue or purple fluid inside of the tank. If you don’t see anything or the levels are close to the bottom, then it’s time to refill the tank. [4] X Research source Shine a flashlight into the tank if you have trouble seeing into it. If you see dit or other contaminants inside of the tank, they may also cause a clog and should be flushed out."

      "title": "Look for cracks and leaks in the hoses or tank.",
      "content": "Look for cracks and leaks in the hoses or tank. Open your vehicle’s hood and prop it up so it doesn’t fall down. Locate where the hoses connect to the plastic nozzles on your hood and run your fingers along its length. Visually inspect the hose for any damage or cracks to ensure it’s not leaking. Trace the hoses back from the other nozzles as well. If you see any damage, you’ll need to have the parts replaced. [6] X Research source If you have trouble locating the hoses, check the manual or take your vehicle in to a mechanic for your repairs. Replacing hoses and washer tanks usually require you to remove parts, so it may be difficult to do at home if you don’t have experience working on vehicles."

      "title": "Pour windshield washer fluid up to the tank’s fill line.",
      "content": "Pour windshield washer fluid up to the tank’s fill line. Windshield washer fluid is usually a mixture of water and alcohol that cleans off dirt and dries off quickly. Open the bottle and pour it directly into the tank’s spout. If you’re worried about spilling the fluid, put a funnel in the spout. Keep pouring the fluid into the tank until it reaches the horizontal fill line on the side. [8] X Research source You can buy windshield wiper fluid from convenience or auto supply stores. Typically, washer tanks are clear so you can easily see the fluid level from the outside. It’s okay if you don’t fill the wiper fluid up to the fill line since the pump attaches to the bottom of the tank."
