      "content": "Learn about kitten development. Kittens go through specific phases of development. Learning about these may help you figure out why your kitten is crying and the best way to console it. The stages of a kitten’s development are: Birth to 2 weeks: the kitten orients towards sound and its eyes open, separation from its mother or littermates may lead to behavioral issues. 2 to 7 weeks: your kitten begins socializing and playing and may wean at around 6 to 7 weeks, though it may continue to suckle for comfort. 7 to 14 weeks: your kitten increasingly socializes and increases its physical coordination. Kittens shouldn’t be separated from their mothers or littermates before 12 weeks to minimize the risk of developing problematic behaviors. In addition, kittens who are gently handled for 15 to 40 minutes daily for their first 7 weeks are more likely to develop larger brains."
