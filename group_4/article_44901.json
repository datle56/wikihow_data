[1] X Research source One way to find comfort for yourself is to honor your friend’s memory with a heartfelt tribute message. Use one of the messages below or let them inspire you to write your own. A friend's death is a great sorrow for all who loved them. Friendship transcends death. The memories we made will never be forgotten. I am a better person for having such a wonderful friend. Dear friends are the ones who know the good and bad about us and choose us anyway. Even when they have passed to the next life, we still feel them encouraging us to be our best selves. They say friends are the family we choose. Being chosen was the greatest moment of my life, and when they passed away, it was the worst moment of my life. Honoring a friend's death is truly about honoring their life. You may feel despair over what may have been, but try to hold onto the wonderful times you shared. A friend in spirit, indeed. Let us take joy in remembering you as you were in life. A true friend is never truly gone. Their spirit lives on in the memories of those who loved them. Their beaming personality taught us to live, laugh, and love. That’s something we’ll never lose. Loss of a friendship through death is cruel and cold. Warmth is found through fond memories, so curl up with them whenever you need to. Cheers to the person who made everything more exciting. Heaven gained quite the angel when you left us. Losing a friend is like losing the sibling you chose. A devastating moment that will change you forever. The memories we shared are the ones I hold onto tightly, for they bring you back to me, if only for a moment. Our best friends know that they were loved for who they were in life and will be remembered for their hearts in their deaths. The hardest part of losing someone isn’t having to say goodbye but rather learning to live without them. My friend was ridiculously happy in life, so let us celebrate their amazing impact rather than weep over our loss. Good friends are like stars. You don’t always see them, but you know they’re always there. A great friend is something to be cherished, whether they remain by my side in this life or wait for me in the next."

[17] X Research source It’s completely normal to feel like your friend can hear you even after they’re gone. Use one of the messages below to tell them how much you miss them. Your life was a blessing, your memory a treasure. You are loved beyond words and missed beyond measure. Not a day goes by where I don't think of you and miss your smile. I miss you, dear friend. The world feels a little less bright without you. I miss you so much. My life will never be the same. I miss you so much and I wish I could hear your voice again. Right now, I miss you so much, but this is better than never being able to know you. I miss our conversations, our jokes, and just hanging out together. Your laughter still echoes in my heart, but I really miss hearing it in person. I miss you even more because I never got to say goodbye. That hurts more than anything. Death ends a life, not a relationship, but I’ll never stop missing you. The pain may lessen, but the love never fades. I’m going to miss you forever. I am a better person because I knew you, better for loving you, and better for having met you. But I still miss you so much. I miss you, my friend.

I keep waiting for them to walk through the door like this is all a bad dream. I wish I could turn back time and tell them how much they meant to me. I never thought I'd have to go through life without them by my side. How can someone be here one day and just... gone the next? It's hard to imagine a future without them in it. The silence is deafening, and the emptiness is overwhelming. I know they'd want me to keep going, but right now, it's just so hard. It's impossible to wrap my head around the fact that I'll never see them again. True friendship continues to grow, even over the longest distance. I didn't realize how much I relied on them until they were gone. It's like the world just stopped spinning when I heard. Gone from my sight, but never from my heart. The world seems so much dimmer without their light in it. A friend's love doesn't end with death. It echoes through eternity. The pain is so sharp it feels like a physical blow. In the garden of friendship, some flowers bloom eternally. It's the little things that hurt the most, the reminders of what's lost."

The most common way to start a sympathy message is by writing “Dear” and addressing it to the person by their first name. However, if you normally address that person with a title, use that instead.

If your friend had faults, don’t try to pretend they were a saint. You don’t even have to mention any negative traits. It’s sometimes okay to mention shortcomings by using a little affectionate humor or by keeping it brief. Say something like, “We all know Kendra could be a little stubborn.
