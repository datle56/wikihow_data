      "content": "Elevate your knee with a rolled towel or similar item (optional). This should put your knee at a 30 degree angle. Although you don't have to do this, it makes it easier to hold your knee in place during the wrapping. Without the support of a towel or similar object, you may find it too tiring or painful to hold your knee in place. If you don't want to use a towel, you could try a water bottle or a round foam massaging roller."

      "content": "Apply a hypo-allergenic base, if you're allergic to sports tape. The base layer, which goes under your tape, will protect you from an allergic reaction. Make sure that your entire knee is covered in a base layer before you start wrapping your knee. It's best to wrap your knee with the base layer using the same method as you're using for your actual sports tape. Simply follow the procedure for wrapping your knee, but use the base layer instead of your sports tape. Once your base layer is in place, apply your sports tape."

Then, slowly smooth it down along the outside of your leg, crossing over the side of your knee. [2] X Research source The strip should finish in the center of the calf, below the back of the knee. All strips should be placed so that circulation will not be cut off. It is best to always have a little tension when placing each strip. Do not pull hard or let the strip hang loose."
