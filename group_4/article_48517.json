      "content": "Doubling down is when you double your bet and get dealt one more card. After you’re dealt your first 2 cards, you can choose to double your bet if you’re confident that your hand will beat the dealer. After you choose to double down, you’ll only get dealt one more card and won’t be able to hit. You can’t double down if you’re dealt a 10 and an ace since it’s a blackjack equalling 21 and already a winning hand. While most casinos only let you double down after you’re dealt your first 2 cards, some casinos may let you place a double down bet after you split a pair into 2 separate hands. Check the table rules to know when you’re allowed to make a bet."

Since there are more chances of drawing a high number than a lower number, you have a pretty good chance of getting a high value. [2] X Research source Doubling down with a hard 9 or 10 works best if the dealer has a total of 2–6 in their hand since there are more chances that they’ll get a lower total or bust.

If you’re dealt a card with a lower value, you have the chance to get a blackjack or even closer to 21. Getting dealt a card with a higher value still puts you close to 21 so there’s a shot you could win the hand.

Rather than risking chips by doubling down, stick with your initial bet and play out your hand. You can still hit to get more cards if you want, but don’t make any additional bets on your hand.

The dealer will know that you’re doubling down on your hand and they’ll deal your next card horizontally to show that you can’t hit for any more cards.
