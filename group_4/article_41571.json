      "content": "Let the pasta dry out on a wire rack for 2 hours. Spread out your homemade pasta on a wire cooling rack so there’s space between each piece. Leave the rack in a cool, dry place for at least 2 hours so your pasta firms up and is less likely to clump together when you put it away. [2] X Research source If you’re drying out long noodles, portion them out into single servings and form them into nests or baskets to dry. That way, they take up less room. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Transfer the pasta to an airtight container or bag. Find a plastic container with a tight lid or a resealable plastic bag that will fit all of your pasta. Since your pasta is floured and dried, you can put all of the pieces into the same container without the risk of them getting stuck together. [4] X Research source Split your pasta into portions and put them in separate containers so you can grab out a single serving at a time. Label the bag or container with the date you made the pasta so you don’t forget to use it before it goes bad."

Otherwise, the pasta is safe to eat for up to 3 days. When it’s time to cook the pasta , take out as much as you want to make and prepare it in boiling water. [5] X Research source Since you labeled your pasta, it will be easier to track how long you’ve been keeping it in your fridge."

Space out the pieces of your pasta on the baking sheet so air can flow around them. Keep the tray of pasta on your countertop to dry so the pieces are less likely to clump up or stick to each other.
