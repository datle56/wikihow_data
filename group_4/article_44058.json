      "title": "Find your honey.",
      "content": "Find your honey. This dating app was created by an ex-employee of Tinder with the intent of building a safer and friendlier dating environment for women. For example, women aren't bombarded with message upon message after they've matched. Instead, only women can make the first contact on Bumble after matching. You can also have video and voice calls within the app, so Bumble users can meet each other virtually before meeting in real life!

      "content": "The dating app designed to be deleted. By asking new users lots of questions and providing new profile prompts each month, Hinge is getting to know its users better to be able to match them better. You can comment on a section of someone's profile instead of the whole thing, so the app offers more ways of interacting with other users!

      "title": "Dating for every single person.",
      "content": "Dating for every single person. This dating service matches you to others based on your shared interests, so you'll find other people who like dogs or gardening. So even though the questionnaires seem endless, answering honestly about yourself will get you more possible matches! So make sure you click or tap the right answers when you're setting up your profile on OkCupid to prevent someone with interests that you dislike (like vaping) to appear in your matches! [4] X Research source OkCupid is free, but many advanced features require a premium membership."

      "title": "Date honestly.",
      "content": "Date honestly. This app acts more like Tinder, so you can swipe to your heart's content. Unlike Tinder, however, you can chat via text or video to make sure you're really chatting with the person in the profile picture you swiped on. There's also an added feature that censors explicit content and warns you about it before you view it! Badoo is pretty bare-bones and doesn't feature a lot of profile questions, so you can just browse profiles to see if you find someone you like.

This app is an MMOC (massively multiplayer online community) that allows people who love video games, pop culture, music, and fashion to get together in a virtual world. While Kippo doesn't exclusively consider itself a dating service, you can browse the profiles of other users in hopes of matching. You also fill out a form detailing which games you like as well as some other info about your dating preferences. This isn't a 2-D experience of other dating apps where you just swipe and look at profiles. Instead, you create an avatar that you can move around the virtual world in, just like an old Game Boy game. You can chill out, play games, audio-chat with people, hang out, and meet new friends or dates. [15] X Research source Kippo is free to use, but there is an upgrade available."
