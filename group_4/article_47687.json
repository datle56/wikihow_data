      "content": "Add anti-frizz products to your hair and blow dry it so it's straight. If your hair tends to frizz easily, apply a dollop of styling cream or a smoothing product to your hands and spread it through your hair, focusing on the top section where your headband will be. It's also a good idea to blow dry the top section of your hair straight back so that it'll be smooth for the headband. [1] X Research source Dampen your hair slightly with water before you add the styling anti-frizz product and blow dry your hair. Use a round brush to blow dry the top section of your hair for the best results."

      "content": "Comb your hair back so it’s untangled and slicked back slightly. Use a regular brush or a comb to brush your hair back from your face. Move the brush from the top of your forehead to the back of your head, untangling the hair that will be slicked back by the headband. [2] X Research source Try to comb your hair back so your part is no longer visible."

      "title": "Put your hair up in a ponytail to keep it out of your face.",
      "content": "Put your hair up in a ponytail to keep it out of your face. Once your hair is combed back, pull it into a ponytail at the back of your head. This is to keep your hair slicked straight back and make it easier to put the headband in without having to move the hair around your face. [3] X Research source Avoid making the ponytail super tight so your hair is able to move when you put the headband in."

      "content": "Unlatch a bendy zig zag headband and stretch it around your head. Situate the headband so that the spiked side is facing you. Slide the headband into your hair starting at the front of your head and continue positioning it along both sides of your head so it goes all the way around. Fasten the zig zag headband at the nape of your neck once it’s on. [4] X Research source Since the zig zag headband is stretchy, it’ll be easy to pull it around your entire head."

      "title": "Push the headband as far back on your head as you’d like.",
      "content": "Push the headband as far back on your head as you’d like. As you push the headband back into your hair, the teeth will create lines, giving your hair a unique look. Choose to keep the zig zag headband near the front of your head to just keep stray hairs out of your face, or opt to push it farther back for a slicked back look. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a rigid zig zag headband if you want a quick fix. While most people think of the stretchy zig zag headband as being the most popular, there are also rigid plastic zig zag headbands. These have the same zig zag shape to them but you put them on just like you would a normal plastic headband. Slide the rigid zig zag headband into place so that each end is behind your ears. [6] X Research source These headbands don't need to be fastened at the nape of your neck."

      "content": "Curl your hair and slide the headband into place for a classic look. For a simple style, use a curling iron to add soft curls to your hair. Comb back the front of your hair so it’s out of your face and position your headband on your head. Slide the zig zag headband back into place how you’d like it in your hair and leave the rest of your curls down to frame your face.

Put the zig zag headband in your hair and push the headband back. The gel will define the lines made by the headband and ensure that your hairstyle stays in place. [8] X Research source This works with both a rigid zig zag headband and a flexible one."

      "content": "Wear a zig zag headband with your hair in a bun for an elegant look. Create the bun first by combing your hair back into a ponytail, twisting the ponytail to form the bun, and securing the bun with a hair elastic and bobby pins. Then place the zig zag headband around your head near your hairline and slide it back to form the distinct lines in your hair. [9] X Research source Create a high bun on top of your head or opt for a low bun near the nape of your neck."

      "content": "Create a pouf with the headband to give your hair some volume. Position the zig zag headband in your hair and slide it back about 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) from your hairline. To form the pouf, pull the headband back gently in the opposite direction (towards your forehead) so that volume is added to the front of your hair. [10] X Research source The pouf is easiest to create with a rigid zig zag headband. The closer you pull your headband back to your hairline, the larger the pouf you’ll create."
