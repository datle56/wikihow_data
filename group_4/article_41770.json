      "content": "Do this dynamic bicep stretch to warm up before a workout. Stand up straight and lift your arms up straight out at your sides. Move your arms in vertical and circular motions at the same time to do arm rotations. [1] X Research source Or, hold your arms out straight in front of you at shoulder height with your palms facing down. Swing your arms back behind you then back to the front to do arm swings. Dynamic stretches use controlled motions to improve your flexibility and range of motion. Dynamic stretches are better for your muscles when they’re cold, or when you haven't done any exercises yet. Other types of stretches are better for when your muscles are warmed up, such as after lifting weights."

As an alternative to the half-kneeling position, squat down until you feel a stretch in your biceps. Variation: Start on your knees and place your hands on a chair or desk behind you. Lean forward without sliding your hands to get a similar stretch. [10] X Research source"

[13] X Research source Whalen adds that “grabbing a surface and then rotating outward stretches mainly the chest, but you also get the bicep, too.” [14] X Expert Source Jason Whalen Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 26 January 2021."
