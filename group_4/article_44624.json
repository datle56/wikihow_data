Generally, dosing is one clove of garlic per day (equivalent to 4,000 to 5,000 mcg of allicin). Garlic can interact with medication, increasing the risk of bleeding, and is known to interact with blood thinners, such as clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (coumadin), or aspirin. HIV medications can also be affected by garlic. Echinacea- Echinacea derived juice has been demonstrated to confer resistance against vaginal yeast infections that occur frequently. Taking between 2ml to 4ml each day can help to fight against this. Again, echinacea can interact with medications and it is important to discuss potential complications with your doctor prior to beginning a regimen. Tea Tree oil - Tea tree oil has been shown in various studies to have antifungal properties when used as a mouthwash, effectively treating oral thrush. Tea tree oil can be toxic when ingested orally, so be sure to only use this as a mouthwash (after discussing with your physician). Pomegranate - Yes, pomegranate gel has been demonstrated to help fight oral thrush almost as effectively as miconazole gel in one study that associated with denture stomatitis."
