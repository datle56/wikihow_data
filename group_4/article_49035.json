      "content": "Look up the next date of a meteor shower. Shooting stars are not, in fact, stars at all. They are meteors, which are made up of pieces of interplanetary rocks or debris. When they break into earth’s surface, they light up the night sky. Find a calendar of the next meteor shower and drive out to a dark, secluded place. Though it’s possible to see a shooting star on any given night, you’re likely to see more during a meteor shower. Check out http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/earthskys-meteor-shower-guide for listings of this year’s meteor showers."

      "title": "Get out of the city.",
      "content": "Get out of the city. In order to wish on a star, you have to be able to see the stars. Because of light pollution, it’s nearly impossible to see stars in cities or even large towns or suburbs at night. [1] X Research source Take a ride out to one of your favorite scenic spots, such as a mountain, field, or lake outside of the city. It’ll be easier to see the stars out in nature."

      "title": "Choose an observation spot.",
      "content": "Choose an observation spot. Once you’ve gotten out into nature, choose an area that seems dark and comfortable and set up camp. Lie on your back or sit so that the stars and night sky are filling your field of vision. [2] X Research source Pack as if you’re going on a picnic. Bring a camping chair, layers of clothes, water, and plenty of snacks."

    {
      "title": "Think of all the things that you want to wish for.",
      "content": "Think of all the things that you want to wish for. You probably won’t see a lot of shooting stars in one night, so you have to be discerning in what you wish for. Think of things that you’ve always wanted: a million dollars, a house, a jumbo-sized vanilla shake. It could be anything! Let your imagination run wild. Just know, the simpler the wish, the easier it normally is to make it come true."

    {
      "title": "Write down your wish on paper.",
      "content": "Write down your wish on paper. If you’re having trouble deciding between wishes, write down a list of all of them and then choose a few through a process of elimination. Some believe that writing down your wishes on a post-it note helps it come true. Creative visualization helps you to better understand your wishes and goals. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Write or say your wish as if it has already happened.",
      "content": "Write or say your wish as if it has already happened. This is a manifestation technique that some think helps wishes to gain potency. If you believe in yourself and your dreams, they are more likely to come true. [4] X Research source Instead of saying: “I wish I had a better job,” try phrasing it this way: “I am hardworking and intelligent and capable of getting a better job.” This language is positive, affirmative, and helps give your wish more weight. The less resistance you have to the wish coming true, the more likely this is to work."

      "title": "Don’t wish to change another person.",
      "content": "Don’t wish to change another person. It’s impossible to control or change someone else. Imagine if someone else made a wish and asked for you to fall in love with them, or for you to be more beautiful or successful. These are elements that only you can control. [5] X Research source You can wish for things on other people’s behalf. For example, you can say, “I wish that Todd gets his second interview this next week.” It’s not useful to say something like: “I wish Todd had a nicer smile and also didn’t like watching football so much.”"

      "title": "Look for a shooting star.",
      "content": "Look for a shooting star. Once you’re situated in a good place for stargazing with your wish on your mind, you’ve got to keep an eye out for a shooting star. Lay or sit comfortably and keep your eyes on the sky and think about your wish. Don’t stare at the sky for too long. Take a few breaks every half hour to let your eyes readjust to the dark."

    {
      "title": "Close your eyes while wishing.",
      "content": "Close your eyes while wishing. If you get lucky enough to see a shooting star, close your eyes before wishing. Then say, “Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight: I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight.” This old rhyme is rumored to make your wish come true.

      "title": "Don’t tell anyone your wish.",
      "content": "Don’t tell anyone your wish. If you tell someone your wish it’s less likely to come true. If you’re stargazing with a friend, say the wish in your head so that they won’t hear it. If you’re alone, you can say it aloud, but make sure that nobody else is around. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for a bright star if you can’t find a shooting star.",
      "content": "Look for a bright star if you can’t find a shooting star. If you get unlucky and can’t find a shooting star, look for the brightest star you can find and wish on that instead. While bright stars aren’t as legendary as shooting stars in granting wishes, it’s worth a shot."

    {
      "title": "Believe in your wish.",
      "content": "Believe in your wish. Wishes only come true if you believe in them! After you make your wish, keep thinking about it when you get home. The more positive energy you put into your wish, the more likely it is to come true."
