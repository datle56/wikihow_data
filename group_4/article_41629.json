Use your kitchen pantry, cabinet, or a bread box to keep the stollen fresh. Leave the stollen in the plastic wrap until you’re ready to eat it. [3] X Research source If you want to eat a little bit of your stollen at a time, unwrap it to cut off a few slices, then wrap it back up again."

Freezing a warm loaf of stollen can add too much moisture to the loaf, causing it to get soggy. [5] X Research source Leave your loaf intact to avoid drying out individual pieces."
