      "content": "Walk away. One of the most effective ways to survive an encounter with a snake is to not engage. If you come across a snake in your path, walk away. If you can't turn and go the other direction, make sure to give the snake a wide berth as you circle around it. [2] X Research source Remember that most snakes have no desire to be around people. That is why you rarely see them. If you see a snake in your yard or garden, just stay away from it. It is likely that the snake will flee when it sees you. Sometimes you might encounter an aggressive snake or one that is cornered. The same advice applies. Do not try to capture the snake. Just head the other direction. If you encounter a snake at home, call a professional for help. Avoid trying to remove a snake yourself. [3] X Expert Source Kevin Carrillo Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 22 October 2019."

      "content": "Make loud noises. Loud sounds can help you to drive a snake from your path. Snakes don't have ears, but they are very sensitive to vibrations.

You can also try banging some sticks together. If you have a snake visiting your yard or garden, noise should help you get rid of him. Turn on the lawn mower nearby as a way to make some noise."

[5] X Research source When you are hiking, stay on the trail as much as possible. You might still encounter a snake, but it is less likely than if you wander off of the trail. Avoid tall grass. These areas are very appealing to many types of snakes. Snakes like to hide under rocks and logs. Be careful when walking near these areas. Keep your eyes open and be on the lookout for snakes. You should also use caution when rock climbing. Snakes like to hide in nooks and crannies. Look before placing your hand somewhere on the rock."

If you can't immediately get the victim to a treatment facility, you can use basic first aid. Remove any rings, jewelry, or clothing around the area. This will help prevent swelling. Gently clean the wound with water and a clean cloth. Do not flush the wound with water. Wrap the wounded limb with compression bandages. Apply these bandages as you would to a sprained ankle, wrapping firmly but not too tight. Keep wrapping the bandages about 4 inches above the wound. Do not apply a tourniquet. Do not try to suck the venom out by mouth."

      "content": "Observe the snake's posture. Not all snakes are dangerous. However, it is a good rule of thumb to avoid any snakes you encounter in the wild. Certain signals can tell you whether the snake in question is particularly dangerous. [10] X Research source Pay attention to the snake's position. A coiled snake is likely getting ready to strike. If you encounter a rattlesnake, back away slowly. If the snake is coiled and audibly rattling, it is getting ready to strike. Be aware that a snake can strike from any position. It can strike the furthest distance from a coiled position, but it can also attack from a stretched out position."

      "content": "Recognize poisonous snakes. There is no foolproof way to tell if the snake you encounter is venomous. It's a good idea to assume that it is and move along. Venomous snakes do carry some common traits that are good indicators that they are poisonous. [11] X Research source Poisonous snakes in the United States are almost all pit vipers. Pit vipers have heat-seeking pits on their snouts that help them to locate prey. Many poisonous snakes have triangular heads. The water moccasin, rattlesnake, and copperhead all have pointed heads and are venomous. The water moccasin is also known as a cottonmouth and is found in many southern waterways. Its venom can cause muscle and tissue damage. The coral snake is the exception to many rules and is the most venomous snake in the US. It has a rounded head, rounded pupils, and is more brightly colored than other snakes."

The rattlesnake has hollow, retractable fangs. These fangs appear when the snake strikes and can inject large amounts of venom in their victim."
