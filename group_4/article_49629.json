  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Research the product.",
      "content": "Research the product. In order to demonstrate to your readers that your review is reliable, make sure to conduct as much research as possible before you begin writing. A thorough knowledge of the product, its evolution and its competition will allow you to write something approaching an expert review. Read the manufacturer's website, as well as any manufacturer information included with the product you are reviewing. Beware of publicity material released by manufacturers and retailers - readers will often stop reading if they sense that publicity material is being used rather than observations drawn from real-life experience. Look into the competition and research the benefits and flaws of products that consumers consider alternatives. This will allow you to compare and contrast the reviewed product with the often numerous alternative products on the market. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Obtain the product.",
      "content": "Obtain the product. Buying or renting a product for review is the easiest way to get prepared for a review. However, you may be able to obtain a product directly from the manufacturer or retailer for free if you are persistent. If you have a blog and wish to post reviews, contact companies through e-mail, a phone call, or even traditional mail. Make sure to be upfront about the type of blog you write and the traffic it receives, and keep your message short and to the point. Larger companies may employ a marketing or sales representative. If this is the case, contact the appropriate representative and pitch your review directly to them. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use the product.",
      "content": "Use the product. Using and getting to know the product you are reviewing are perhaps the most important aspects of writing a product review. Readers will be looking for genuine knowledge of and experience with a product when they read your review. Fake reviews that are full of exaggerated praise or criticism are widespread on the internet, and most people will stop reading a review if they suspect it is written with ulterior motives. A genuine appraisal of a product is the best way to draw a reader's attention.

      "title": "Know what readers are looking for.",
      "content": "Know what readers are looking for. There are several reasons why potential buyers read product reviews, and you should think about these as you research and use the product before writing your review. Common questions readers would like answered include: Is the product easy to use? Is it of high quality? Is it geared towards somebody like me? Have others had a good experience with the product? What are the pros and cons of the product? What alternatives are available, and how do they measure up? Is the product worth my money? [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Write the introduction.",
      "content": "Write the introduction. A good review introduction will not only hook the reader but also provide a clear picture of the product under review and the product's advertised benefits. For first-time users, dedicate some space to explaining the functionality of the product in some detail, treating the product as if all the features are new. Teaching new customers about a product is an important aspect of a product review. For experienced consumers, focus on the evolution of a product from one model to the next, as well as any common defects or problems users may have encountered in the past. Long-time users of a product will often read reviews for solutions to problems, giving you a chance to demonstrate your knowledge of a product. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Describe the product under review.",
      "content": "Describe the product under review. Provide the reader with the basic information a consumer likes to know before buying a product. This may include a brand name, model number, measurements, target demographic, price, and so on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be balanced.",
      "content": "Be balanced. Talk about what you liked AND what you didn't like about the product. The most helpful reviews are those that outline both the pros and cons of a product, while readers will most likely skip reviews full of effusive praise or bitter criticism. Make sure to clearly explain how you arrived at your judgments, and specifically address why you believe certain features are beneficial and why you consider other's flaws. Most people will be looking for an unbiased review of a product, and thus a clearly explained, balanced review is more likely to be read than a review that focuses too much on the positive or negative aspects of a product (unless warranted, of course)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Compare and contrast products.",
      "content": "Compare and contrast products. Discuss the product under review in light of similar products available to buyers, comparing the pros and cons of each. This will both demonstrate your research and knowledge, and provide the reader with a point of reference when making their next purchase. This is particularly important for first-time buyers who may require a point of reference before deciding to purchase."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pinpoint the target audience.",
      "content": "Pinpoint the target audience. Describe for the reader who you believe would benefit the most from the product, which will help them to decide whether the product is right for them. Points of interest may include how easy or difficult the product is to use, specific features that will appeal to particular audiences, as well as how the product relates to other products readers may have used in the past."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the conclusion.",
      "content": "Write the conclusion. A good conclusion will summarize the benefits and flaws of the product, evaluate whether the product lives up to the company's marketing, and communicate your opinion on whether the product offers good value."
    },
    {
      "title": "Publish the review.",
      "content": "Publish the review. Choose the most appropriate forum for your review and post it online. There are countless online venues for product reviews; some of the most popular include blogs, dedicated product review sites, and product retailers. Allow some time to pass between the release of a product and the publishing of your review. This will allow you time to properly test the product and arrive at an honest evaluation. Readers will more often trust a reviewer who can demonstrate that they have spent some time with a product before offering a review."
