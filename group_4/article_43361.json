The spots feel squishy or spongy when you press them and are usually dark yellow, brown, or even black.

      "title": "Hard, shriveled texture or soft and slimy texture",
      "content": "Hard, shriveled texture or soft and slimy texture As a lemon starts to dry out and go bad, it often hardens like a rock and the rind gets wrinkled and bumpy. The lemon can also start to feel mushy as it rots and develop a slimy film. Either way, it no longer feels plump and slightly firm when you press it. [3] X Research source Whether they’re very hard or soft, bad lemons usually feel lighter than fresh, ripe ones."

      "title": "Dry, rubbery flesh",
      "content": "Dry, rubbery flesh The inside of a bad lemon is usually dry and shriveled-looking. As the lemon rots, the flesh peels away from the rind and looks pale or discolored. The flesh is no longer juicy and firm, and instead feels rubbery or gummy. You might also notice brown spots on the flesh, too. This is another sign the lemon is bad."

      "content": "Yes, the juice inside the lemon goes bad when the flesh and rind rots. If a lemon looks, feels, or smells rotten, the juice inside is bad, too. When a lemon starts to spoil, every part rots—including the juice, flesh, zest, and rind. So, throw out the lemon instead of trying to squeeze out the juice."

Lemon juice is acidic, which gives it anti-bacterial properties, so it’s a great, natural way to clean around the house.

      "title": "Ripe lemons are firm, heavy, and have bright, shiny skin.",
      "content": "Ripe lemons are firm, heavy, and have bright, shiny skin. Whether you’re buying lemons from the store or harvesting them from your lemon tree, choose a fruit that is firm and has a slight give when you squeeze it. Make sure it feels heavy, too, which means it’s full of juice. Ensure there are no discolored spots or signs of damage, either. A ripe lemon is a bright, solid yellow and has shiny, smooth skin. [7] X Research source Select a lemon that has a thinner rind, too. This usually means that it’s super juicy. The lemon should feel firm and plump, not rock hard or soft and mushy. These are signs that the lemon is overripe and going bad. Solid green or green-tinged lemons mean the fruit is unripe. Lemons don’t ripen once they’re picked from the tree, so avoid buying or harvesting them if they’re not solid yellow."

      "content": "Keep lemons in the fridge for up to 1 month. The best way to preserve lemons is to stick them in the fridge. Simply place the fruits in an airtight plastic bag or storage container and set them in your fridge’s crisper or produce drawer. They usually keep well for 1 month, but can last up to 6 weeks. [8] X Research source Feel free to keep the lemons loose in the produce drawer, if you prefer. Placing them in an airtight bag helps to seal in moisture so they don’t dry out as quickly, but it typically only keeps them fresher for a few more days. [9] X Research source Keep the lemons away from fruits that ripen, like pears, peaches, and avocados, if possible. [10] X Research source These fruits produce ethylene gas as they ripen, which can cause your lemons to spoil faster. Thinking about storing your lemons in water? While this viral hack claims to keep lemons fresh for longer, there’s actually not much evidence that it does. In fact, it can potentially cause bacteria and mold to grow faster.

Simply leave them on your counter or in a fruit bowl and keep them in a cool, dry spot. Just know that room-temperature lemons usually only last for 1 to 2 weeks before they start to dry out and spoil. [12] X Research source Keep the lemons uncovered—don’t place them in a plastic bag or container. This can trap humidity and cause them to spoil faster. Like in the fridge, keep lemons away from fruits that produce ethylene gas, like bananas and avocados, so they don’t spoil quickly."

Simply wash the lemons with cool water and dry them off with a clean towel. Then, place them in a freezer-safe storage bag or container . Write the date on the container and stick the lemons in your freezer. [13] X Research source Note : Lemons can develop a mushy texture when frozen. While the juice and zest stay fresh, you might not want to use them as a garnish. When you’re ready to use your lemons, thaw them in a bowl of warm water for 15 to 20 minutes. Or, stick them in the microwave in 15-second increments. [14] X Research source"

Then, place them in your refrigerator’s crisper or produce drawer. Just use them within 5 to 7 days—cut lemons tend to dry out and spoil after 1 week.

Place the slices on a lined baking sheet and set it in the freezer for 1 to 2 hours. Once they’re frozen, place the lemon slices in a freezer bag or container. [16] X Research source Write the date on the bag or container so you know when you froze the lemons. Frozen lemon slices typically hold up better than frozen whole lemons. So, they’re great to use in dishes or as garnishes. To thaw the frozen slices, place them in the fridge for a few hours or zap them in the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds."

Simply squeeze your lemons and pour the juice into a clean ice cube tray. Set the tray in your freezer and leave the lemon juice to freeze for 1 to 2 hours. Then, pop out the juice cubes and place them in a freezer bag or container. [19] X Research source Date the bag of frozen lemon juice so you know when the cubes are no longer fresh.

Because lemons (and other fruits) are soft, the mold travels easily through the fruit and is likely all over it, even if you can’t see it. So, if you see any mold on a lemon, it’s best to compost or toss it. [22] X Research source You can cut off mold from firm produce, like carrots, and hard foods like cheese and ham, because mold can’t travel as easily through them."
