      "content": "Your water has a high amount of mineral content. An excess of minerals like calcium and iron can cause a sweet taste to your tap water. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While these minerals don’t pose a significant health hazard, they can clog water appliances, encourage bacterial growth, and contribute to hard water—which in turn causes stiff laundry, dry skin and hair, and mineral buildup on your appliances. What to Do: If mineral build-up is a recurring issue in your household water, consider investing in a water softener that you or a plumber can hook up to your plumbing system."

      "title": "Your water has a high amount of chlorine.",
      "content": "Your water has a high amount of chlorine. Many cities and municipalities treat their water supply with chlorine to kill germs and bacteria. If you’re particularly sensitive to chlorine, however, you may perceive a sweet or swimming-pool-like taste to your water. Chlorine in your water isn’t linked to any health issues or contaminants, so it may just be something you have to get used to if it’s used by the city you live in. [2] X Research source If you have pet fish or other aquatic animals (e.g., reptiles, amphibians), be aware that chlorinated water may be harmful or toxic to them. If you have chlorine in your tap water, avoid using it to fill the tank of any aquatic pets in your household. [3] X Research source What to Do: If you think you have chlorine in your water, letting it sit in a container for 8-12 hours or boiling it for 15 minutes might temporarily resolve the issue. In the long-run, installing a water filter should get rid of the taste. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Your pipes have accumulated biofilm and need to be cleaned out. Biofilms are layers of bacteria, fungi, algae, and other microorganisms that form in pipes and other plumbing components. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Occasionally, that biofilm may dislodge from your pipes and travel through the water to your faucets. Certain types of bacteria in biofilm may activate the sweet taste receptors in your sinuses and lead you to perceive your water as sweet. [6] X Research source What to Do: If you think biofilm might be the culprit of your sweet-tasting water, flush your plumbing system by running your taps for at least 30 minutes. If this doesn’t work, contact a plumber to take a look at your pipes and implement more serious solutions like shock chlorination."

      "title": "Your pipes are corroded.",
      "content": "Your pipes are corroded. If your pipes are old and beginning to corrode, they may be leaching contaminants into your water and impacting the flavor. Pipe corrosion can happen for a number of reasons, including acidic water that has a low pH level. If your pipes are corroded, you may also notice issues like water pressure problems, unpleasant smells, and discolored tap water. What to Do: In this situation, it’s best to call in the pros —reach out to your plumber to schedule a house call."

      "title": "You ate something right before drinking the water.",
      "content": "You ate something right before drinking the water. Certain foods can temporarily impact how you perceive the taste of water, especially if they’re acidic or contain ingredients like sugar, citric acid, ascorbic acid, salt, or artificial sweeteners. These ingredients can desensitize your taste buds for up to an hour after consuming food or drink, causing plain water to taste unpleasantly sweet. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Even more neutral items like tea, coffee, vegetables, and bread may cause this reaction on your palate. Minty dental products like mouthwash and gum can also make water taste sweet if drunk immediately afterwards. What to Do: If you recently ate or drank something that may be causing this issue, wait a few hours and try the water again—if it no longer tastes sweet, then consider this problem solved!"

      "content": "Your body is confusing taste with smell. If something is impacting your sense of smell, it may be erroneously influencing how things taste in your mouth. If you’re sick or in a room with a strong smell, for example, the sweet taste in your water may just be a confusion between your senses. However, there are a few situations in which malodorous water could be a sign of bigger issues: Rotten egg smell : A sewage-like smell common in well water, indicates an excess amount of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur bacteria. [8] X Research source Swimming pool smell : Due to chlorine in your water supply, often used by the city or municipality for disinfection purposes. Metallic smell : Water that smells like pennies may be a sign of plumbing corrosion or high iron levels. [9] X Research source Fish smell : A fishy odor may be due to bacterial growth or issues in your water system. [10] X Research source Musty smell : Musty water can be caused by a variety of factors, including temperature change and biological growth. What to Do: If your water smells bad and there are no other factors that could be affecting your sense of smell, cease use of your tap water and contact your local utility company. They may want to come and test your water for any bacterial growth or other issue."

      "content": "A medical condition or medication is affecting your sense of taste. Certain medical conditions can cause you to have a sweet taste in your mouth that has nothing to do with the actual water. Diabetes and acid reflux, for instance, can both create a sweet taste in your mouth—since water has a neutral flavor, you think the taste is coming from the water when it’s really already present on your tastebuds. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Other medical conditions such as hyperglycemia or even a simple cold, flu, or sinus infection can influence how you perceive the taste of water. Similarly, certain medications like infection-treatment antibiotics, allergy pills, and blood pressure medication can alter your sense of taste.

      "content": "Your water is polluted with contaminants. Very rarely, certain contaminants may enter your water supply and cause a sweet taste. In this case, the most likely contaminant is ethanol, which is described as a sweet taste by some people. If ethanol is in your household water, that means that an ethanol spill or other contamination issue must have occurred in your area. What to Do: Contact your local water utility department and have a professional water test performed as soon as possible—if your water is contaminated with ethanol, you may get guidance from the city and have to switch to bottled water temporarily."

      "content": "It’s fine to drink sweet-tasting water, but it may indicate larger issues in your water system. Drinking water that tastes sweet will very rarely be harmful to you, and the problems around it have more to do with taste preference than actual health issues. However, your sweet-tasting water could mean that your pipes are corroded or that your water is contaminated, which may lead to issues with your water quality and plumbing system. So, while you may not mind a sweet taste in your water, it is important to pay attention to any color, taste, or odor changes in your drinking water."

      "content": "Flush out your pipes. Run water through your pipes and taps for at least 30 minutes to clear some things out of your plumbing system. This step won’t necessarily solve the problem permanently, but it can reduce the taste of sweetness in your water while you work on a more long-term solution. To do a more thorough cleaning of your plumbing system, follow these steps: [15] X Trustworthy Source State of Michigan Official website for the State of Michigan Go to source Shut off the water supply to your home. Open every faucet inside and outside your house and let the water drain out. Shut off your water heater (if you have one) and attach a hose to the bottom drain valve. Open the valve and wait for all the water to empty. Go to your highest faucet, like one in an upstairs room. Turn it on and let the water run until it feels cold, which is a sign that there’s no remaining hot waiter. Repeat for all faucets, moving from highest to lowest. Remove and clean the aerator screens on all of your faucets. Replace the filters in your water filtration system (if you have one). Turn the main valve back on and let water move back through your plumbing system."

Leave your water in a covered container or pitcher so that nothing else gets into it or affects its taste. [16] X Research source Although this temporary solution won’t actually change what’s happening in your water source, it can help you identify what the issue is (or at least rule out more serious issues). If you’re someone who’s really sensitive to the taste of water, then you can just make a habit of setting water in the fridge ahead of time for you to drink later on when it’s lost its sweet taste."

      "content": "Observe the impact of temperature on your water. As a temporary solution, experiment with your sweet water to see if temperature changes affect its taste. Is the sweetness stronger when the water is hot, lukewarm, or iced? Does the flavor go away when you’ve boiled the water? While you might still want to contact a professional to get your water tested, this solution may allow you to have drinkable water (without the sweet taste) in the meantime."

      "content": "Get an at-home or professional water test. Sweet-tasting water doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s an issue with your water, but it’s worth checking out if the taste doesn’t go away on its own or with temporary solutions. Purchase a water testing kit online or contact a local water lab or professional to test your water . [17] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source The EPA requires that your local water utility service (if your water comes from a municipality) publishes water test results periodically. Contact your local water or health department to ask for the test results. However, keep in mind that these tests only test the water at the treatment plant. The quality of or contaminants in the water may change as it moves through the pipes through your water, so it may still be worth testing the water straight from your tap."
