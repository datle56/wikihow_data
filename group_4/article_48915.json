      "content": "Just start saying hello. Got your eye on someone? Winning someone over doesn't need to be super-complicated. If you want a girl to start noticing that you exist, just start saying hello. When you pass in the hallway between classes, make eye contact and say, \"Hey!\" Smile and give a little wave. She'll get the hint. You don't even have to say anything. Just start smiling when you see her coming. This will always be appreciated. Use her name. Hearing your own name called helps people feel validated and secure. It's like a little compliment every time. When you see her, say her name often.

      "content": "Start striking up conversations. After she's aware of your presence, strike up a conversation. Lead with something interesting and specific, or talk about something you know you've got in common. Be funny. Lead with something that will break the ice: \"I'm thinking of cutting gym and renting a Cadillac to drive to Mexico. What do you say? I need an accomplice.\" Talk about something you've got in common. If you see a girl out at a bar or restaurant, say, \"Isn't this place great? What do you think? Have you been here before?\" If you have a class together, ask her about how she did on the last test, or how she feels about the readings. Avoid \"closed\" questions that won't give you anything to talk about. If you say, \"What's up?\" or \"How's it going?\" that conversation is going nowhere."

If you want to get to know her better, try to find an excuse to talk, just the two of you. Make it a regular thing. If you start talking to a girl while you're out somewhere, ask if she wants to move into a booth, or stand outside and talk for a while. \"Want to talk outside so we can hear each other? I want to hear what you have to say.\" Sit next to her at lunch, or on the bus, or chat her up in the hallway while she's walking to class. If you both walk home from school together, walk together."

      "content": "Reach out via Facebook or text . Sometimes, it can be a lot easier to get to know a girl online, or via text. Girls might open up a little more and be a little more talkative in writing, than in person. It's always better to talk in person and find a little connection. But after you get a girl's number , text her when you have something interesting or specific to talk about . Text or message about something timely. If you're working on the homework for a class you've got together, text her: \"This English reading is killing me. Distract me?\" Never waste a girl's time by texting, \"Hey\" or \"What up\" or some kind of emoticon. If you want to attract her, say something that she can respond to. Reader Poll: We asked 186 wikiHow readers, and 56% of them agreed that they know a girl is interested in them on Facebook if she responds quickly and seems engaged in the conversation . [Take Poll]"

Look for open doors in things that she talks about. If she mentions off-hand that she hated watching the new Avengers movie, ask her what kind of movies she likes. If she says, \"Horror\" ask, \"What do you like about those movies?\" Keep her talking, and keep it positive. Ask open-ended questions always.

But if you start doing nothing but compliment a girl's appearance every time you see her, it's going to grow tiresome quickly. Just as tiresome as the \"Hey-what's-up-not-much\" conversation. Compliment her appearance, sparingly. Focus on choices that she makes, not physical attributes. Say, \"That dress looks really good on you\" instead of saying, \"Your body is really sexy.\" The attraction is nice, but if she thinks that all you care about is how beautiful she is then she'll begin to think you're shallow."

If a woman shows signs of disinterest, don't persist. If a woman shows signs of being uncomfortable, stop being a creep. If a woman says she's not into something now or never, respect that and don't try to persuade her into doing anything she doesn't want to. Respect her decisions. Does she wear lots of makeup? Fine. Let her know if it makes her happy then she can go all for it, she looks incredible with or without. Does she want to wear wacky clothes that show lots of skin? Okay.
