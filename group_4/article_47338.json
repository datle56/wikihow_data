      "content": "Remove your makeup with micellar water or cleanser. Pour a small amount of micellar water onto the surface of a cotton square. Don’t oversaturate the cotton; instead, lightly soak the surface. Dab the square all over your face, focusing on the eyes, cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin. Make sure that all of your makeup is removed before continuing. [1] X Research source You can also use a cleanser designed specifically for makeup removal."

      "content": "Add distilled water to a reusable glass bottle. Pour 2 cups (470 mL) of distilled water into an airtight glass storage bottle. You’re making a large amount of ACV toner, make sure to have a container ready to store the excess mixture. Since ACV is naturally acidic, you don’t want it eating through any plastic bottles over time. It's important to use distilled water for this; since you’re applying this mixture to your skin, you want the water to be as gentle and refined as possible. Include an extra 1 cup (240 mL) of distilled water if you have sensitive skin. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour in 3 drops of tea tree oil and 1 cup (240 mL) of ACV into the water. Using a long stirring utensil, mix the ingredients together thoroughly. Keep in mind that this ratio works best for dry or normal skin types. [3] X Research source Tea tree oil is a useful ingredient, as it has anti-inflammatory qualities."

      "content": "Dip a cotton ball or pad into the ACV toner. Take a cotton ball or flat pad and soak the surface with the ACV mixture. Don’t saturate the cotton—when it comes to any type of vinegar, a little goes a long way. If you don’t have any cotton products on hand, feel free to use a soft, clean washcloth instead."

      "title": "Use the cotton ball to pat the product on your face.",
      "content": "Use the cotton ball to pat the product on your face. Focus on gently applying the toner across your cheeks, forehead, chin, and nose area. Pat on the mixture in soft, delicate motions, instead of just rubbing it onto your skin. Aim for your skin to be damp, but not soaking wet. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the toner sit on your skin for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the toner sit on your skin for 5 minutes. Wait for the toner to soak into your pores, so you can benefit from its cleansing properties. [5] X Research source Don’t worry if your pores look smaller after you rub on the ACV mixture, as toning products shrink your pores naturally. [6] X Research source Since your skin’s pH is naturally acidic, it’s important to use a toner with slightly acidic ingredients. ACV shouldn’t sting when applied to the skin. Don’t apply the toner to any open cuts, as this will create a burning sensation. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse off the toner with warm running water.",
      "content": "Rinse off the toner with warm running water. Cup both hands beneath your faucet and fill them with cool water. Close your eyes and gently splash the water onto your freshly toned skin. Repeat this process as necessary, until all of the ACV is rinsed off. Finally, take a moment to pat your face dry with a clean towel or washcloth. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Moisturize your skin to keep it from drying out. Take a coin-sized amount of your usual moisturizer and apply it in the same places as your toner. Focus on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin as you rub in the moisturizer with small, circular motions. [9] X Research source If you’d prefer, you can also use a specialized skin serum instead of a moisturizer."

      "title": "Use this treatment 2-3 times per week.",
      "content": "Use this treatment 2-3 times per week. Start by using ACV toner on a trial basis, so your skin can adjust to the acidic content. Don’t use this product every day, as ACV is too acidic to use on your face regularly. Keep an eye on your skin to ensure that it’s in tip-top shape. [10] X Research source Since you can’t use ACV every day, make sure that you have another cleanser on hand. If your skin feels irritated or inflamed at any point, stop using this product. Contact your dermatologist to discuss different alternatives that can work for your skin."

      "content": "Store the glass bottle of leftover toner at room temperature. Keep track of where your homemade toner is by placing it in your closet or a similar storage area. While this product has no official expiration date, monitor the appearance and smell of the toner. If it looks or smells moldy, dump it out and prepare a new batch. [11] X Research source Be sure to seal the bottle tightly whenever you’re finished using the toner."
