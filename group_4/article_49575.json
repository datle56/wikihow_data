  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Decide what real-world event or idea your myth explains.",
      "content": "Decide what real-world event or idea your myth explains. Many myths explain why an event occurs, how something was first created, or why people should act a certain way. [1] X Research source Before you can truly begin writing your myth, figure out what you want it to explain, like the weather, why animals make certain sounds, or other natural phenomena. Here are some examples from real myths: Why does the moon wax and wane? Why do vultures have bald heads? Why do people prepare and eat foods in certain ways or on certain holidays?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Come up with a fantastical explanation for your real-life event or idea.",
      "content": "Come up with a fantastical explanation for your real-life event or idea. Your myth can be silly or serious, but it should involve something that doesn't happen in the real world. Think about magical or outrageous events that could explain something normal. For example, a volcano might erupt because giants underground left the barbecue on. A hero might be forced to learn to care about people after an evil serpent turns his family into trees. [2] X Research source If you're having trouble coming up with a mythological explanation for the topic you chose, write down a list of words that remind you of the topic. For example, if you want to explain how snowstorms happen, write down \"cold, wet, white, snowman, ice cream, clouds.\" Maybe snowmen live in the sky and sneeze snow down to earth, or maybe the clouds try to give us ice cream that melts on the way down."

    {
      "title": "Come up with a moral for your story to convey.",
      "content": "Come up with a moral for your story to convey. Some myths explain why people should or shouldn't behave in certain ways. The explanation can come in the form of a straightforward lesson with a moral at the end. More often, however, the reader picks up on the lesson by seeing good actions rewarded and evil or foolish actions punished. Here are a few ideas that you could use as the main focus of your work if you like this approach: [3] X Research source The hero succeeds only when he follows the advice of elders or gods—or only when he is self-reliant. The hero must be clever to succeed, solving problems in creative ways. Some myths even teach that luck can be more important than skill. It can be fun to hear about an \"ordinary\" person who gets rewarded or entertaining to hear about a complete fool who somehow becomes king."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a hero with special abilities and flaws.",
      "content": "Create a hero with special abilities and flaws. The hero of a myth is usually someone impressive and admirable with unique or supernatural abilities, although, as mentioned above, you can write about an ordinary person, as well. Consider what kind of hero would work best for your idea, then give them some flaws to create a good story. Think of personality traits that could cause certain events to occur in your myth and how the hero can overcome them. [4] X Research source Is the hero super-strong, super-intelligent, or incredibly talented in one area? Some heroes have “superpowers,” such as shooting a bow with perfect aim or the ability to knock people over with the wind from their breath. Why does your hero have these special talents, if any? Did the gods bless the hero, did the hero train hard, or was the hero just born that way? Which kind of person would you admire, or which do you think matches the real world best? Some flaws you could give your hero include being overconfident and ignoring advice and help, being greedy and trying to take something that doesn’t belong to them, or being arrogant and thinking they’re better than everyone else."

      "title": "Invent magical settings and supporting characters.",
      "content": "Invent magical settings and supporting characters. Witches, gods, monsters, magical items, and imaginary places all make a myth entertaining and larger than life. Think of where you want your story to take place and what magical creatures live there. For example, set your myth in ancient Greece and use characters like Hades or the Chimera, or invent your own world , creatures , and magic system. [5] X Research source If you're out of ideas, try reading collections of actual myths or modern books that use mythological characters. Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a good example."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start by introducing the setting and main character.",
      "content": "Start by introducing the setting and main character. People usually know they're reading or listening to a myth even before the first couple sentences are finished, as most myths take place long ago and far away, especially if they’re creation myths. Try to let your readers or listeners know when and where your story takes place and who it’s about within a few opening sentences. Here are some ways you can accomplish this: [6] X Research source Set the myth in the distant past or in a distant land. Think of all the stories you know that begin with \"Once upon a time,\" \"Far, far away,\" or even \"A long, long time ago.\" These openings quickly let people know what kind of story they’re about to read. Describe the kind of hero people expect in myths. For instance, a youngest brother, a king, or a woodcutter are all common heroes in folktales. For more epic myths, start with a famous hero or a goddess instead. Remember to include the epithets you came up with earlier to let your readers know who your hero is."

    {
      "title": "Introduce a reason for your main character to take action.",
      "content": "Introduce a reason for your main character to take action. You could start out by describing the point of your story, explaining, for instance, that Coyote decided to steal fire to give to people. However, it's a more interesting story if the character has a reason for behaving the way they do, like a complication or quest. Here are a few examples: [7] X Research source Coyote notices people shivering in winter, and the people plead for a way to warm themselves. A queen ignores her suffering subjects. The gods send a plague to her daughter, and the queen must learn to help people in exchange for their assistance to cure her daughter."

    {
      "title": "Develop your plot with a rising action and climax.",
      "content": "Develop your plot with a rising action and climax. The plot for the middle of your myth is up to you, and there are no rules you have to follow! As you continue writing your story, keep in mind the phenomenon or moral lesson you're trying to explain—make sure the plot is relevant and that the story has an interesting climax. [8] X Research source If you get stuck, move the story along with one of the following ways: Introduce a new character to support your plot and move along the rising action. This character can be a god, a spirit, a talking animal, an elder, or any other character you’d like. The character might describe the next challenge and how to overcome it or give the hero a magical item that they can use later. Create a new challenge to spur your character on. Just when everything is looking good again, have the hero make a mistake or send a monster to undo the hero's good work. This approach is useful if you want the story to go on longer. Write your myth in an episodic structure , in which different stories follow the adventures of the same hero. For example, “The Labors of Hercules” follows Hercules through different adventures that are all connected by his journey of redemption."

    {
      "title": "Finish the myth with your moral or explanation.",
      "content": "Finish the myth with your moral or explanation. Recall what real-world event or idea you wanted your myth to explain. Continue writing until you’ve finished your explanation or until the hero has defeated all the challenges and learned their lesson. Often, a myth ends with a sentence explaining why the story is related to the present day. Here are some invented examples: [9] X Research source \"And that's why the sun gets hotter and brighter every summer.\" \"And ever since then, people brush their teeth to a shine every night, so the tooth-stealing goblins are scared by their own hideous reflection.\""

    {
      "title": "Write in simple, straightforward language.",
      "content": "Write in simple, straightforward language. Myths tell a story directly, as if the events that take place are fact rather than fiction. Generally, myths are relatively short, as they’re often passed down orally. [10] X Research source Avoid long, wandering sentences, detailed descriptions, or personal bias. This tends to make the plot move pretty quickly. For example, in one version of the Herakles myth, the hydra is introduced, tracked down, and killed in just eight sentences. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Add mythological descriptions and imagery to your writing.",
      "content": "Add mythological descriptions and imagery to your writing. It may be helpful to read some real myths and see what kind of details they include about characters, places, and events. Then, try to imitate this style in your own writing. If you need some help, use the following writing tricks to make your myth sound traditional: [12] X Research source Use iconic symbols. Symbols vary between cultures but often include numbers like 3 and 7, animals like the raven or the seal, or characters like the prince or the trapped faerie. Use the same structure for several sentences in a row. For example: \"Three days he went up into the heavens, and three days he went down to the Underworld; three days he was transformed into a wolf, and three days he was transformed into a snake.\" Give people a short, descriptive epithet. Epithets are especially popular in Greek epics, which often use epithets that refer to other stories, such as \"Dionysus the wolf-repeller\" or \"Apollo, carrier of the bay branches.\""

      "title": "Read your myth aloud while editing.",
      "content": "Read your myth aloud while editing. Once you think your myth is almost finished, read it aloud to yourself or a friend. Some phrases might sound better on paper than they do out loud, and myths are usually written to be shared as a spoken story. Go through it and correct spelling and grammar mistakes, as well, then have a friend take a second look in case you missed something.

      "title": "Most myths follow a specific formula that includes certain key elements.",
      "content": "Most myths follow a specific formula that includes certain key elements. The common elements of a myth include: distant origins, a moral or lesson, an explanation of the unexplainable, fantastical elements, a hero, gods or goddesses, and an episodic structure. While your myth isn’t required to include these key features, they may help you understand what a myth is and what you might want to include in yours. [14] X Research source Distant origins : A setting in a far-off time and place filled with magic and wonder. E.g., Westeros in George R. R. Martin’s Game of Thrones . Moral or lesson : A final resolution showcasing societal values, cultural values, or a demonstration of right vs. wrong. E.g., the Greek myth of Icarus warning against arrogance and disobedience. Explanation of the unexplainable : A non-scientific, fantastical explanation of natural phenomena or why people act the way they do. [15] X Research source E.g., Rūaumoko, a Māori god, being responsible for earthquakes and volcanoes. Fantastical elements : Characters with supernatural abilities, magical creatures, mythic settings, etc. E.g., magical creatures like elves, orcs, and trolls in J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings . Hero : An ordinary person, demi-god, or other person destined for greatness who follows a “hero’s journey” where they start out in the real world and enter a world of magic, facing many challenges but coming out victorious. [16] X Research source E.g., Harry Potter going from a normal life to being “the chosen one,” facing challenges along the way. Gods and goddesses : Gods are used to personify natural forces, elements, and human emotions. They may thwart or help the hero. [17] X Research source Episodic events : Events of the story follow the same hero across multiple adventures and quests, allowing for new stories and varying interpretations to be added over time. E.g., Odysseus’ many successive trials in Homer’s The Odyssey ."

      "title": "Legends, folktales, and fairytales are similar to but distinct from myths.",
      "content": "Legends, folktales, and fairytales are similar to but distinct from myths. The boundaries between myths and other storytelling techniques (like legends, folktales, fairy tales, and fables) often need to be clarified, as they have many overlapping elements. Scholars often debate the exact definition of each. In general, though, there are a few differences between each, which you can read below: [18] X Research source Myths: Myths are ancient stories that explain why certain things are the way they are, like nature and humanity. They often involve gods or heroes with supernatural powers, and they show the worldview and values of a culture. Legends: Legends are stories that are rooted in historical events or based on real people that have become exaggerated and embellished over generations of storytelling. They blur fact and fiction. Legends are sometimes considered historical myths. Folktales: A folktale is a fictional story that has been passed down orally for generations. They’re typically passed down by the common people of a certain group or culture, and they sometimes use fantasy elements to teach a lesson. Fables : Fables are short, fictional stories that teach a moral lesson. They typically feature animals with human traits as characters rather than people. Fairy tales: A fairy tale is a children’s story about magical people, creatures, and places. Fairy tales are written down and authored by a specific person, though they often adapt oral stories into the written form."

      "content": "What does good myth writing include? Good myths include interesting characters, vivid descriptions of the events and setting, and creative plot points and twists that keep the reader interested. They typically have meaningful themes or morals and a structure that is both entertaining and logical. [19] X Research source"

      "title": "Why are myths important?",
      "content": "Why are myths important? Myths are important because they tell us a lot about the cultures they come from, including what their values are and how they view the world. They’re also a creative and entertaining way to teach good morals and life lessons, and they’re a great way for people to express themselves. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "What are some myth examples?",
      "content": "What are some myth examples? Myths come from all over the world, so there are a ton of examples. Some popular ones include The Labors of Herakles , King Midas, Orpheus and Eurydice, and Homer’s The Iliad and The Odyssey . Greek and Roman myths are well-known because they’ve been passed down for centuries and are frequently adapted into movies, TV shows, books, and other retellings. [21] X Research source Of course, there are many popular myths from other parts of the world, as well. For example, research Chinese or Native American myths to learn stories you might not have heard before."

    {
      "title": "Are there different types of myths?",
      "content": "Are there different types of myths? Yes, there are three main types of myths: Aetiological myths, historical myths, and psychological myths. Aetiological myths are the most common, and they fantastically (not scientifically) explain why something is the way it is today—like why lightning strikes, the name of a certain constellation, the origins of a religious ritual, or how the Earth was created. [22] X Research source Historical myths are fictionalized versions of true historical events that aim to keep the memory of the event alive, even if it isn’t entirely accurate. Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey , for example, are based on the Trojan War but include famous heroes that likely never existed. Psychological myths aim to explain why we feel and act the way we do—not by way of something else (e.g., lightning being caused by Zeus’ anger), but because of a divine external force. For example, Aphrodite’s power may be used as an explanation for falling in love, since she’s the goddess of love in mythology."
