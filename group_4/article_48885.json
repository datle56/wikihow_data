      "title": "Practice your approach with approach drills.",
      "content": "Practice your approach with approach drills. Your approach (your sprint down the runway) will make a big difference in how far you end up jumping. You want to get up to speed in your first few sprints and then maintain your speed until you jump. Practice this by doing approach runs on a track. Don’t actually go through with the jump, just focus on getting up to speed and maintaining your velocity. Designate a take off spot on the track and then stop when you reach it. Go back to where you started after you finish and try again. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Do jumping drills.",
      "content": "Do jumping drills. Practice doing jumps without the approach. Stand in place and bend your knees, placing one foot in front of the other. Bend your body so your upper torso is parallel with the floor. Hold your arms at your sides and extend them straight back so they’re also parallel with the floor. When you’re ready, lift your body and propel yourself into a jump. Raise both of your arms up and over your head. Land with both feet flat on the floor. [2] X Research source Each time you do the drill, mark where you landed. On your next attempt, try to beat your last mark."

      "title": "Work on your landings.",
      "content": "Work on your landings. Find a long jump pit to practice in. Do a short 2-3 step approach down the runway and jump when you reach the takeoff board. Work on getting your legs up and out in front of you. You want your heels to be the first part of your body to make contact with the pit. Repeat the drill until you feel comfortable with your landings. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use your forward foot to push off at the start of the runway.",
      "content": "Use your forward foot to push off at the start of the runway. Usually, this foot will be your non-dominant foot, but go with whatever is most comfortable for you. Lean forward at about a 45-degree angle as you start your approach."

      "title": "Don’t freeze on the last step.",
      "content": "Don’t freeze on the last step. You want to continue accelerating as you go into the takeoff. Slowing down on the last step will ruin your momentum and shorten the distance you jump. As you take your last step before takeoff, briefly place your foot flat on the takeoff board."

      "title": "Push yourself into the air using your foot on the ground.",
      "content": "Push yourself into the air using your foot on the ground. This will be the foot you planted on the takeoff board. Remain upright as you jump. Swing your leading knee and the opposite arm into the air to increase your lift. Keep looking straight ahead. Make sure your foot is flat on the ground as you jump. You’ll jump further off a flat foot as opposed to your toes or heel. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use your arms to steady yourself when you hit the sand. Your feet should be the first thing to come into contact with the sand at the end of the runway. As the rest of your body comes into contact with the sand, place your arms down in the pit and hold yourself up so you don’t fall back."

      "title": "Avoid looking at the takeoff board.",
      "content": "Avoid looking at the takeoff board. As you approach the board, keep your head up and look straight ahead. If you're busy looking at the takeoff board during your approach, you'll naturally readjust your body, which will cause you to slow down and jump a shorter distance."

      "title": "Maintain your speed into the takeoff.",
      "content": "Maintain your speed into the takeoff. Don't hesitate or slow down when you reach the takeoff board. Keep accelerating until you're off the ground. You can avoid losing speed at the takeoff board by making your last two steps as short and fast as possible."

      "title": "Try the hitch-kick technique.",
      "content": "Try the hitch-kick technique. Once you take off from the takeoff board and you’re in the air, start moving your legs like you’re pedaling a bicycle. Bring both of your arms up in the air behind you so they’re fully outstretched. Your chest should be sticking out and your back should be arched. [5] X Research source As you prepare for the landing, stop pedaling your legs and begin to bring your knees up to your chest. Bring your outstretched arms forward and down toward your legs so you’re ready to brace yourself when you land."

      "content": "Use the hang technique. Right after the takeoff, raise both your arms in the air and stick out your chest. Stretch your arms as far above you as you can, keeping them behind the rest of your body. At the same time, bend your knees and bring your legs back so they’re behind your body like your arms. Your chest should be leading you as you soar through the air. [6] X Research source As you approach your landing, bring your legs and arms forward, stretching your legs out as far in front of you as you can."

      "content": "Try using the sail technique. After you take off, bring your legs up so they’re almost parallel with the ground and touch your toes together. Bring your arms down to your sides and hold them so they’re sticking out straight behind you. You want to keep your body as long and narrow as possible so it sails through the air.
