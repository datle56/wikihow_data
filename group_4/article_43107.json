      "title": "The texture is thick and chunky instead of smooth.",
      "content": "The texture is thick and chunky instead of smooth. Buttermilk tends to be a little thicker than milk and it naturally has tiny lumps in it, so it's good to shake it well. Pour some into a cup and look at its consistency. It should be smooth, but if it's really thick and has clumps or chunks, the buttermilk has gone bad. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "The buttermilk smells strong and sour.",
      "content": "The buttermilk smells strong and sour. Shake the buttermilk really well and pour some into a cup. Be brave and give it a sniff! Buttermilk should smell tangy, but pleasant if it's good. If you notice a really strong, gross, or terrible sour smell, the buttermilk has gone bad. [2] X Research source If you're not sure if the tangy smell is normal, check for other signs of spoilage before you toss or use the buttermilk."

    {
      "title": "You see mold on the buttermilk or it looks discolored.",
      "content": "You see mold on the buttermilk or it looks discolored. Buttermilk should be a pale creamy color, so if you pour it into a cup and notice funky mold or strange colors, throw it out. [3] X Research source For instance, buttermilk might develop pink, gray, or fuzzy patches if it's bad."

    {
      "title": "The buttermilk has been at room temperature for over 2 hours.",
      "content": "The buttermilk has been at room temperature for over 2 hours. In general, dairy products like buttermilk can't be left out or they'll spoil. If you've accidentally left your buttermilk out, but it's been less than 2 hours, just get it in the fridge immediately and plan on using it as soon as possible. [4] X Research source If it's really warm where you live (over 90 °F (32 °C), play it safe and throw away buttermilk that's been left out for 1 hour or more since bacteria grows faster at warmer temperatures. If the buttermilk's been out over 2 hours, it's best to toss it—you don't want to risk dangerous bacteria that can cause severe illness."

      "title": "Opened buttermilk will stay good for 2 to 3 weeks in the fridge.",
      "content": "Opened buttermilk will stay good for 2 to 3 weeks in the fridge. Store the buttermilk in a sealed container, so it stays fresher longer. It's also a good idea to label the container with the date you opened it. Plan on using the buttermilk within a few weeks—it continues to lose its rich flavor the longer it's stored. [5] X Research source Keep the buttermilk in the main body of the fridge, not the shelf door since it's too warm there. Ensure that your fridge is set to 40 °F (4 °C) or below to extend the shelf life of the buttermilk. For longer storage, freeze buttermilk for up to 3 months. [6] X Research source Then, thaw it in the fridge overnight before you bake with it."

      "title": "It's safe to use unopened buttermilk within 1 week of the expiration date.",
      "content": "It's safe to use unopened buttermilk within 1 week of the expiration date. Some packages of buttermilk will even tell you that it's good to use a certain number of days after the sell-by or use-by date, so check the side of the container. As long as the buttermilk doesn't show signs of spoilage, it's safe to use. [7] X Research source If you're a little concerned about using the buttermilk, use it in a baking recipe so it will be cooked at a high temperature."

      "content": "You might get food poisoning symptoms. If you get a mild case of food poisoning from bad buttermilk, you may experience cramps, nausea, or vomiting—these usually develop within a few hours of eating the food. Usually, the symptoms clear up on their own within a few hours.
