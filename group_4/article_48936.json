You know the person: the one that looks like they just stepped out from doing their test shots with a cheesy modeling agency, the one who gives The Look to every hot girl that walks by. Don't be that person. Yes, some women are initially attracted to this, but eventually they think that you're more interested in attracting women, in general, instead of attracting them . Don't dress overly flashy and try to focus on wearing things that you know she likes, rather than trying to think about looking how you think women like. You should similarly save the flirting and close conversations for her and not use them with other women."
