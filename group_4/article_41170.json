Although collection agencies are required by law to send you a letter within 5 days of their first contact with you, not all of them comply. Looking up the phone number can serve as an alternate way of obtaining a mailing address so that you can contact them in writing."

      "content": "Set boundaries. Remember, debt collectors cannot legally call you at work or call a relative or other third party if you tell them not to. Be sure to state this in your very first conversation with them. Follow up with a letter confirming what you told them on the phone. Include the day and date and send it via a service that provides tracking and proof of delivery. If you have an attorney representing you, provide the attorney's contact information.

Once the creditors receive the letter, they cannot continue to call you to collect the debt unless they can prove that you owe the money. If you do owe money to the creditors, offer to work out a payment plan in writing, and ask that they not contact you by phone anymore. After receiving your letter they may contact you for three reasons: [4] X Research source To acknowledge receipt of your letter. To tell you their efforts have ended. To tell you they are suing you."

The third-party may settle for a smaller lump-sum payment to avoid the cost of suing you to recover the money. Even if the debt is still held by the original creditors, you might be able to negotiate a similar settlement."

Attorneys can get expensive so be very sure you want to do this. Usually merely sending the letter will suffice.

If you are being pursued by a debt collector and you have exhausted all other remedies (e.g., offered a settlement, filed an administrative complaint, or declared for bankruptcy), you might want to consider filing a lawsuit against the person or company trying to improperly collect from you. Before you can file a lawsuit, the debt collector must have violated some law. Generally speaking, harassing debt collectors will either be violating the federal FDCPA or a similar state law. For example, California has a law regarding debt collection practices called the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (RFDCPA). The FDCPA is violated when a debt collector calls you with the intent to harass, annoy, or abuse you. Furthermore, a debt collector can violate the FDCPA by simply calling and not disclosing their identity. [9] X Trustworthy Source Federal Trade Commission Independent U.S. government agency focused on consumer protection Go to source The RFDCPA may be even more protective of your rights and may be violated when a debt collector does not correctly identify themselves, causes you to incur long distance charges, causes the phone to ring repeatedly for the purpose of annoying you, or when they call you so often that it becomes harassment.
