      "title": "To protect their nails",
      "content": "To protect their nails Adding a few layers of nail polish can thicken and strengthen your nails, as well help protect them from fungi and bacteria (this is especially helpful if you’re stuck wearing sweaty or wet shoes or gloves for long periods of time). This is why notable athletes, including soccer players and MMA fighters, have been spotted with black nails on their hands or feet. [1] X Research source Guitarists may also paint their nails to protect them from damage while they play and to produce a richer tone on the instrument."

      "title": "To cover imperfections on their nails",
      "content": "To cover imperfections on their nails Nail polish is great for covering discolored nails, bruises underneath the nails from injuries (or maybe too much guitar playing), or bumps and grooves that affect the texture of the nails. If a man’s rocking a black manicure, he might just want to make sure you notice his fingers for the polish (and not a gnarly bruise underneath)."

      "title": "To fight toxic masculinity",
      "content": "To fight toxic masculinity It’s no secret that some men have rigid ideas about what it means to “be a man” and look down on guys who do traditionally feminine things. A man painting his nails is a big middle finger to this ideology (sometimes literally) and redefines what it means to be masculine. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "To show their status as a nonconformist rebel or a “bad boy” If a guy doesn’t care what anybody thinks (but wants you to know about it), he might paint his nails black to stand out from the crowd and show he plays by his own rules. Since society generally sees painted nails as a feminine accessory, a man with a manicure definitely goes against the grain and makes a nonconformist statement. [3] X Research source Black represents strength, confidence, and power—a perfect color for a man who wants to project his status as “outside of the rules.”"

      "title": "To express grief or depression",
      "content": "To express grief or depression Black is a common color to show sadness, mourning, or death. If a guy is in his feelings or grieving the loss of someone he cared about, he might paint his nails black (and wear black clothing or accessories) to show his melancholy emotions. He might also be goth or into the emo scene, which both emphasize dark clothing and accessories and view the color black as a symbol of sadness and resistance. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "To show they're in a rock, punk, goth, or emo band Musicians were some of the first celebs to rock black nail polish back in the 1980s. Rockers and punk band members often paint their nails to be edgy, and the goth and emo music that emerged in the post-punk era is all about black clothes, nails, accessories, and pretty much everything else.

      "title": "For fashion or style",
      "content": "For fashion or style As male celebrities and influencers rock painted nails more frequently, some guys that watch them try to get their look by painting their own nails , too. [6] X Research source Since black goes with lots of different looks and outfits, it’s a natural and popular choice for men who are trying out nail art for the first time. Of course, some guys do it just to play around and figure out their own personal style, too. Some fashion designers have begun incorporating painted nails into their men’s looks, which has made nail polish trendier among fashion connoisseurs."

      "content": "To support the Polished Man initiative The Polished Man project asks men to paint their nails to raise awareness and money to fight domestic violence against women and children. Men can paint just one nail or all of them to participate, so if you see a guy with one black nail (or even a whole manicure), he may be promoting this good cause. The signature nail polish color for this campaign is blue, but participants can choose any color they like."

      "title": "To express their gender identity or sexual orientation",
      "content": "To express their gender identity or sexual orientation Some men in the LGBTQ+ community—whether they be gay, bisexual, transgender, or cisgender—are no strangers to painting their nails and have been doing it for a long time. Black nails are a strong statement of individual style that go against traditional gender norms and a symbol of solidarity, pride, and empowerment. Painted nails on men challenge traditional, gendered beauty standards as well as societal norms that discourage expressions of non-straight or non-cisgender identities. Black nails do not automatically mean a guy is gay, bi, trans, or questioning. There are plenty of other reasons a man would want to paint his nails or change his look!"

      "title": "Just because they like it",
      "content": "Just because they like it Fingernails and nail polish aren’t inherently gendered, and a man might experiment with painting them black (or any color) just because he wants to try it out. Some guys tried it out during the Covid-19 pandemic out of boredom or curiosity, while others use it as a way to bond and play with their children (or even their girlfriends). Whatever the inspiration, it’s becoming more and more common for guys to experiment with nail art simply because they want to."

      "content": "Black is “masculine” and symbolizes power, strength, and sophistication. [7] X Research source Of course, colors are not inherently gendered (pink wasn’t even considered “feminine” until the 1950s), but black is considered a classic color for men’s formalwear and accessories, and dark colors in general are seen as more masculine. [8] X Research source Since nail painting is generally seen as a women’s activity, men who dabble in nail art may be more likely to use black when they start out to make a bold but “masculine” statement. Dark, subdued colors may also be more acceptable for certain work environments than something like a fire engine red manicure. Other popular colors for men’s nails include gray, silver, and metallic colors, as well as dark shades of blue or green."

      "title": "Younger, Gen Z women are more likely to accept nail polish on men.",
      "content": "Younger, Gen Z women are more likely to accept nail polish on men. Gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012) has been a force for gender neutrality and greater freedom of gender expression over the past several years. [9] X Research source Gen Z men are more likely to experiment with nail art than men of older generations, and it follows that Gen Z women are more likely to appreciate or enjoy men who paint their nails without judgment. This doesn’t mean that all young women think painted nails look good on men or that all older women don’t. Everybody’s got their own tastes and preferences."

      "content": "Ancient men painted their nails to show they were elite or a warrior. Nail polish has been around since about 3200 BC and was used by both men and women. For example, ancient Babylonian warriors would paint their nails with kohl, a dark mineral, to intimidate their enemies. In ancient China, nail color symbolized your social class—bold shades, like black or red, were used to denote nobility, while lower class people wore lighter colors. [10] X Research source"

Artists like David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, Prince, Iggy Pop, and more popularized nail art, and Kurt Cobain featured a red manicure in the 90s. In the 2000s, painted nails spread into the rap and hip-hop scene too, with musicians like Lil Yachty and Tyler the Creator sporting trendy manicures. Machine Gun Kelly even has his own line of nail polish! [11] X Research source Musicians were some of the first and most famous men to rock black nails (and other colors), which explains why some men in rock bands and other groups paint their nails today."
