      "content": "Buy a box of pH test strips. These are available on the internet or at pharmacies. Pool supply stores should also carry this equipment. [2] X Research source Look on the box to make sure these test strips cover the whole pH range. Some test strips only cover a portion of the pH scale. You need the color code on the box to accurately measure pH, so save the packaging after you open the box."

      "content": "Read the instructions on the test strip box. All pH strips work similarly, but might have slightly different instructions. For example, some need to be held in the liquid for several seconds to get an accurate reading, and some produce a reading instantly. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour the liquid you want to test into a cup.",
      "content": "Pour the liquid you want to test into a cup. You only need a small amount to test a liquid’s pH, so no need to fill the whole cup. Pour just enough to cover the bottom of the cup. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Chemical Society Scientific society for those involved with chemistry and publisher of several leading peer-reviewed scientific journals Go to source Rinse the cup with distilled water before filling it to make sure there are no contaminants that will throw off your results. Wear gloves and goggles if you don’t know what this liquid is. Acidic or alkaline liquids can burn your skin or eyes and require medical attention."

      "title": "Spit into a spoon if you're testing your body pH.",
      "content": "Spit into a spoon if you're testing your body pH. You can also use test strips to measure your body pH level. Don't put the strips in your mouth because this can spread bacteria into your body. Instead, spit into a spoon and follow the directions for dipping in a test strip. [5] X Research source Don't eat, drink, or brush your teeth for 30 minutes before doing this. These activities can affect your mouth pH."

      "title": "Dip the test strip into the liquid.",
      "content": "Dip the test strip into the liquid. Only insert the tip into the liquid. Leave the strip in the liquid for as long as the box instructs. Within a few seconds, you’ll notice that the test strip is reacting to the liquid and changing color. [6] X Research source When you pull the strip out, hold it above the cup for a few seconds so any excess liquid drips back in. Also wipe any remaining liquid on the inside of the cup. If the test strip doesn’t react at all, you may have a faulty batch. Try several and if you get no reaction, return them to the store."

      "title": "Match the color",
      "content": "Match the color of the reaction to the color code on the box. When the test strip reacts with the liquid, the new color pattern indicates the pH of the liquid. The color pattern will correspond with one of the color patterns on the box. Each pH level from 0 to 14 has a unique pattern. Hold your test strip up to the box and see which color pattern has appeared on the strip. The corresponding number indicates what pH this liquid is.

      "content": "Get a container of distilled water. Distilled water is purified, so you know its pH is exactly 7.0. Only use distilled water for this step. Water from the tap is usually slightly acidic, so it will make anything you measure more acidic and prevent you from getting an accurate pH measurement. [8] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Geological Survey U.S. government agency responsible for conducting scientific research on the nation's land, natural resources, and natural disasters Go to source Most pharmacies carry containers of distilled water. There are also water companies that will deliver containers of purified water to your home."

      "content": "Blend any food items you're testing into a paste. Soil or powder will easily mix into water, but food items need to be broken down for an accurate pH reading. Scoop the food into a blender or processor and blend until it’s reduced to a paste. Add distilled water if the item is dry or doesn’t reduce into a paste consistency. [9] X Research source Be careful when scooping food out of the processor. Avoid the blades so you don’t get cut."

      "content": "Mix the sample into a small amount of distilled water. The distilled water should only be a maximum of 25% of the sample volume so it doesn't dilute the pH. So if your sample is 100 millilitres (3.5 imp fl oz; 3.4 fl oz), only add 25 millilitres (0.88 imp fl oz; 0.85 fl oz) of water. Use a measuring cup to check the volume. Mix the sample together. [10] X Research source If you’re testing a food item that came in liquid, also mix in some of that liquid. This gives you a comprehensive reading of the pH of the item."
