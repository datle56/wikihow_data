      "content": "Decide what type of partner you’re looking for. Are you looking for someone who’s going to challenge you? Someone who’s family-oriented? Health-conscious? Before you craft the perfect profile, be sure to identify what you want. If you’re not sure where to start, figure out your priorities by writing down a list of values and ranking them by importance. [1] X Research source To tailor your profile to your desired partner, include 2-4 qualities that you’re looking for in a man. While you shouldn’t lower your standards to get more matches, be flexible with your expectations. [2] X Research source Even if someone doesn’t check every box off your list, give them a chance. Online dating is full of surprises, and it’s exciting to learn new things about someone as your relationship progresses."

      "title": "Create a brief and engaging narrative.",
      "content": "Create a brief and engaging narrative. Think of your dating profile as an opportunity to tell your story. Instead of just listing your interests and hobbies, share an interesting experience or accomplishment that you can discuss in greater detail. This is the time to highlight anything that makes you unique, so don’t be afraid to reveal your true personality. [3] X Research source At the end of the day, most people aren’t going to read through a lengthy profile. Don’t reveal every detail about yourself, but include enough information to convey your story. While it’s easier said than done, don’t overthink your profile. When writing your profile, think about compliments that other people have said to you and ask yourself, “What are my best qualities?” If you’re unsure whether your profile paints an authentic and positive image of yourself, ask a trusted friend for their opinion.

      "title": "Be honest about your intentions.",
      "content": "Be honest about your intentions. Whether you’re seeking love or companionship, clearly state the type of relationship you want in your profile. This saves you time and energy, and it narrows down your matches to give you the most compatible results. [5] X Research source Before writing your romantic goals, consider your lifestyle and commitment level. Are you looking for a travel partner? Do you want someone to take care of you? Do you prefer friendship or romance? Be as specific as possible to avoid any confusion about relationship expectations. If you’re looking for a long-term relationship, you could say, “I want a romantic, passionate, and meaningful relationship with someone who will be there for me in the long run.” If you don’t know what you want, that’s okay (and perfectly normal), but be sure to state that. You could say, “While I’m not 100% what I’m looking for, I want to share my best moments with someone by my side.”"

      "title": "Provide 3-4 clear, recent photos of yourself.",
      "content": "Provide 3-4 clear, recent photos of yourself. When choosing photos for your dating profile, provide a variety of options to reveal your personality. If you love gardening, include a photo of you in action. If your other half (at the moment) is your pet, include a photo cuddled up to them. Every picture tells a story, so remember to present yourself in an authentic way. Make sure your main profile picture is high-quality and your face is clearly visible. Taking your photo in Portrait mode is always a wonderful option, especially since it blurs the background and showcases your best features. To look confident , wear your favorite outfit and flash a big smile. Nothing’s more attractive than someone who looks like they’re enjoying life. While you may be tempted to use younger photos of yourself, avoid it. If you end up meeting your match in person, you don’t want him to be surprised by your appearance. Remember that you’re amazing as you are, and you deserve someone who loves you for the way you look today."

      "content": "Keep your profile positive. When creating your profile, focus on highlighting your best qualities, instead of including “I don’t like…” statements or complaints. Negativity turns people off, and you don’t want to lose a potential match because of a few phrases. If you present yourself in a positive manner, you’re more likely to attract the right partner. [6] X Research source Think of your profile as an advertisement. You want to draw attention to all of your fabulous, incredible features. If you've had negative past experiences, it's normal to want to keep your guard up; but do your best to avoiding letting those experiences effect the tone of your profile. You've got an amazing dating future ahead of you. If you can, try to let your profile express your excitement about your next great partner ( I'm so excited to meet someone I can give my heart to... )."
