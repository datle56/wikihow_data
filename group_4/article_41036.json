The single biggest thing most people who view themselves as losers can do to improve their social situation is to get a greater sense of self-confidence. This is related to having a good sense of self-worth. When you believe that social situations aren't scary and that you have what it takes to have a good time talking to people you don't know, it becomes so much easier to actually do it. There are many, many guides on the internet that can give you different instructions for improving your self-confidence (including wikiHow's How to Be Confident ). Below are just a few of the most common tips you'll find: Spend a few minutes imagining yourself having a great time in an upcoming social situation. Imagine what you're saying and what you're doing, then use this as a guide. View social failures as instances in which you learned a lesson. Listen to exciting or uplifting music to \"pump yourself up\" before social situations. Don't give yourself to dwell on what could go wrong. Just jump in to social situations that have you worries! Ask yourself, \"What's the worst that could happen?\" In most social situations, the answer is, \"Not much.\" Remember: confidence comes from learning that you can survive anything, even if you don't succeed right away.

Doing this shows that you're interested in what she has to say and keeps the conversation active and interesting. While you listen to your partner's response, you can chime in with short acknowledgements like, \"Oh?\", \"Uh-huh,\" \"Yeah?\", and so on to show that you're listening without interrupting. [2] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source Though it can be tempting to pry for personal details, try to limit your questions to pleasantries until you become somewhat familiar with someone. For instance, if you've just met a stranger at a party, you'll want to ask questions along the lines of, \"Where are you from?\", \"What did you study?\", and, \"Have you seen this movie that just came out?\" Try to avoid questions like, \"How much do you make, before taxes?\", \"Did you have a good relationship with your mother?\", and \"Do you kiss strangers at parties?\""

Try to keep your thoughts positive when you're about to be in a social situation you're dreading. Don't think about what could go wrong — instead, think about what could go right !

As long as you remain polite and friendly, you don't have to agree with everything the person you're talking with says. Having the confidence to politely disagree with someone shows that you respect them enough to be honest with them. Conversely, constantly agreeing with someone can make them think that you're trying to suck up to them. In fact, friendly debates and disagreements can make for spirited, engaging conversations. Just ensure that you keep things lighthearted. Don't ever resort to low-blows like insults and personal jabs to prove your point. Remember, if you can't prove that you're right with pure logic, you might not be right!"

This person has hopes, dreams, fears, flaws, and everything in between, so don't get caught up thinking that they're perfect. This is especially important to remember when it comes to the conversational abilities of the person you're talking to — they may or may not be a great conversationalist, so if your conversation gets awkward, you don't necessarily have to blame yourself. Remember: no matter how cool and collected someone seems when you're talking to them, at the end of the day, they still have to put on their pants in the morning one leg at a time. If someone seems intimidating to you, it can help to think about them in a less serious context (e.g., in their underwear, shopping for socks, watching TV with a bowl of chips on their stomach, etc.)"

Being relaxed makes almost everything about interacting with other people easier — you'll have a better sense of humor, conversation topics will arise naturally, it'll be less intimidating to approach people, and much more. If you have personal techniques or habits that you use to relax, applying these before a social situation that has you stressed out can be tremendously helpful. Everyone's different, but some common techniques can help most people relax. For instance, many people find that spending a few minutes in meditation can make it much easier to relax.

Start by thinking of all of the good, valuable things about yourself — things you're good at, ways you enjoy yourself, and so on.

The fun and self-satisfaction you get from indulging your hobbies and interests is great for building confidence and increasing your sense of self-worth. If you're not already doing so, try to spend a little time every day or week doing something positive and fun that you love. If you can do your hobbies with other people, even better — your friends can take the entertainment level of your hobbies from \"fun\" to \"let's do this again as soon as we can\". This advice is especially true if your work or school situation isn't ideal. It can be tricky to find a new job that you love or get a new group of friends at school, but it's not very hard, for instance, to spend a little time practicing piano every evening if you love music. Try to tend towards skill-based activities that you can improve at over time. While watching TV and playing video games can be fun, they don't usually offer any serious potential for self-improvement. If you don't have any go-to hobbies, try doing something creative, like painting or drawing. [6] X Expert Source Erin Conlon, PCC, JD Executive Life Coach Expert Interview. 31 August 2021."

Unless you're one of the fortunate few who can afford to live a life of leisure and luxury, odds are that you have some sort of professional obligations — for most people, this means work or school. Apply yourself when you tackle these responsibilities. Not only can this help you gain a better self image, but it can also lead to promotions, good grades, and so on, which in turn will increase your sense of self-worth. You don't have to kill yourself with effort to feel satisfied with yourself (for instance, don't miss the birth of your first child to squeeze in a few more hours at the desk), but you should make a habit of working hard and doing a great job at whatever you do. If you've recently lost your job, don't be ashamed — instead, work hard to find another, better one. Don't forget the old cliché: \"Finding a job is a job.\" Beware of people who encourage you to neglect your work or school in favor of short term fun. While a little recreational activity is always a great idea, someone who consistently abandons their responsibilities for cheap thrills is the very definition of a loser."

Spending just a single afternoon having a great time with people you're close to can completely re-orient your outlook on life. While it's almost always a great idea to spend time hanging out with friends, try not to dwell exclusively on negative thoughts and emotions when you're with them. Good friends should be more than happy to talk with you about any serious problems you have, but making a habit of \"dumping\" your emotional issues on your friends can be very fatiguing for them. Instead, try talking to family members, role models you trust, like teachers, bosses, or religious figures who know you, or professional counselors."

You don't have to do this on your own — if you can convince your friends to tag along, you'll have someone to talk to even if you don't meet anyone new. There are literally countless things you can do to meet people. Some of these are obvious (like going out to bars, social clubs, parties, and so on), while others aren't. For instance, hosting a book club or a rock-climbing outing and inviting your friends to bring their friends can be a great way to meet new people. Be creative! Anything you do that involves other people can be a way to meet someone. This really can't be stated enough — the only way to meet people is to go out and do things where you're likely to interact with other people.

Don't hang back and waste time worrying about how to approach perfectly. You may not always find success by approaching without hesitation, but you will have more successes than you would otherwise.

Simply saying something like, \"Hey, you should come with us the next time we go bowling,\" is a low-pressure way to extend the offer to hang out in the future.

Create an art project together (e.g. paint, make pottery, etc.) Pick fruit in the wilderness or in an orchard Go to the beach Play a competitive sport (if you're feeling risky, try something like paintball) Don't go to a traditional movie theater (these are great down the road, but for your first date, you want to do something where you can talk to the other person).
