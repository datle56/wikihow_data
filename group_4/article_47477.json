      "title": "Weapon Mastery is a feature that lets you specialize in various weapons.",
      "content": "Weapon Mastery is a feature that lets you specialize in various weapons. Certain classes have access to this feature, which essentially grants special “mastery properties” (unique effects added to attacks) based on the type of weapon you’re using. Weapon Mastery is designed to give you more strategic options in combat and help you turn battles to your advantage. [1] X Research source Weapon Mastery is a brand new system for 2024’s rules; unlike most rules in the Player’s Handbook, it’s not a revision of a previous rule!"

      "title": "Every weapon in the game comes with a specific mastery property.",
      "content": "Every weapon in the game comes with a specific mastery property. So long as the weapon you’re wielding meets the requirement in your class’s Weapon Mastery feature, you can opt to learn its associated mastery property. From there, you can use those mastery properties in battle as you see fit! You can also swap out weapon mastery properties during Long Rests. [2] X Research source For example, say you’re using a glaive and have its Graze property learned. If you find a longsword and want to learn is Sap property instead, you can change your weapon choice during a Long Rest by practicing weapon drills."
    },
    {
      "title": "Certain classes can learn different mastery properties.",
      "content": "Certain classes can learn different mastery properties. Some classes can learn more mastery properties than others, and only for specific types of weapons. Rogues, rangers, and paladins can learn 2 mastery properties at a time. Conversely, fighters begin the game with 3 and barbarians get 2, with both gaining more properties as they level up. The following classes have Weapon Mastery: [3] X Research source Barbarians (for Simple and Martial melee weapons) Fighters (for Simple and Martial weapons) Paladins (for Simple and Martial weapons, though it’s based on your weapon proficiencies) Rangers (for Simple and Martial weapons, but it’s based on your weapon proficiencies) Rogues (for Simple weapons and Martial weapons with the Finesse or Light property, but it’s based on your weapon proficiencies) Additionally, certain subclasses get extra mastery properties that don’t count against their regular limit. Check the rules in your chosen subclass to see if you get any free abilities!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your learned mastery properties every turn (if you choose to).",
      "content": "Use your learned mastery properties every turn (if you choose to). Weapon mastery properties don’t have limited uses, which means you can choose to use them on any turn in battle, so long as you’re using one of the weapons associated with that property. Beyond that, each mastery property has its own trigger (specified in the section below), so make sure you know the trigger for your property. [4] X Research source While some abilities can only be used a certain number of times per long or short rest, weapon mastery properties have no such restrictions. If you see an opportunity to use one, go for it!"

    {
      "title": "Switch weapons mid-combat to use different mastery properties.",
      "content": "Switch weapons mid-combat to use different mastery properties. Assuming you have multiple learned mastery properties, keep in mind that you don’t have to stick to one for an entire battle! In D&D’s 2024 rules, you can draw or stow a weapon each time you attack as part of the action, so if you want to draw a new weapon with a different mastery property, you can do it on your turn. [5] X Research source If you have the Extra Attack feature, you can also opt to make your first attack with one weapon, then draw a second and make another attack with that instead. You can use this to create “combos” with mastery properties—like using Slow on an enemy, then grabbing a different weapon to Push them so you can run away without being followed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cleave",
      "content": "Cleave Use Cleave to make an additional attack against a second target, which must be adjacent to the first one you attacked. On the second attack, you can roll damage for the weapon but can’t add your ability modifier unless it’s negative. [6] X Research source Weapons : Greataxe, halberd Tips on using it : Cleave is excellent for crowd control, especially anywhere the fighting is thickest, allowing you to bring the fight to multiple opponents in a single action. Since the halberd also has the Reach property, you can use it to Cleave enemies with a greater range than the average weapon."
    },
    {
      "title": "Graze",
      "content": "Graze When you miss an attack with your weapon, use Graze to deal damage equal to the ability modifier you used to make the roll (allowing you to deal a small amount of damage despite missing). This ability is an easy way to improve the consistency of your damage! [7] X Research source Weapons : Glaive, greatsword Tips on using it : Combine Graze with abilities that let you make multiple attacks per turn, like the Polearm Master or Sentinel feats (or the Extra Attacks some classes get, like fighters)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Nick",
      "content": "Nick Nick allows you to make the extra attack you get from wielding two Light weapons as part of the initial attack action. This plays into the 2024 rules on dual-wielding; dual-wielding weapons with the Light property allows you to make a bonus action attack with a different Light weapon than the one you initially attacked with. So, with Nick, that extra attack simply doesn’t cost a bonus action. [8] X Research source Weapons : Dagger, light hammer, sickle, scimitar Tips on using it : Plan your turns around finding other uses for your newly freed-up bonus action (like Cunning Action for rogues). You can also combine Nick with the Dual Wielder feat to add more damage to off-hand attacks. Note : You can’t make a third attack as a bonus action with Nick; you can simply use your bonus action for something else!"

    {
      "title": "Push",
      "content": "Push Shove a creature 10 feet straight away from you when you strike it. Best of all, the push is automatic; the creature can’t make a saving throw against it. However, you can only push enemies with a size rating of Large or smaller (meaning Large, Medium, Small, or Tiny). [9] X Research source Weapons : Greatclub, pike, warhammer, heavy crossbow Tips on using it : Use this handy ability to shove enemies into environmental hazards that’ll deal automatic damage (like lava pits or cliffs). You can also use it to avoid Opportunity Attacks by moving enemies out of your reach, or save cornered allies by pushing enemies away from them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sap",
      "content": "Sap Hit an enemy and use Sap to inflict disadvantage on that enemy’s next attack roll, so long as it occurs before the start of your next turn. This can weaken enemies temporarily and make their next attack less effective since disadvantage means rolling a d20 twice and taking the lower result. [10] X Research source Weapons : Mace, spear, flail, longsword, morningstar, war pick Tips on using it : Use Sap to distract enemies so your spellcaster allies have time to pull off devastating spells (and get those enemies out of the way permanently)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slow",
      "content": "Slow When you hit a creature and deal damage, use Slow to reduce its movement speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. That means the creature will move around the battlefield more slowly, which can help keep enemies from cornering you or running away. [11] X Research source Weapons : Club, javelin, light crossbow, sling, whip, longbow, musket Tips on using it : Pair Slow with ranged weapons like the light crossbow so you can take quick shots at enemies, then run outside their movement range (since their speed is reduced). Note : Speed reductions with Slow don’t stack—so you can’t hit an enemy twice and expect to reduce their speed by 20 feet, and so on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Topple",
      "content": "Topple After hitting a creature, use Topple to force it to make a Constitution saving throw. If the creature fails, it’s knocked Prone (meaning it’s knocked off its feet). The DC for the Constitution save is 8 + the ability modifier you use to make the attack + your Proficiency Bonus. However, keep in mind attacking Prone enemies from more than 5 feet away will impose disadvantage on your roll. [12] X Research source Weapons : Quarterstaff, battleaxe, lance, maul, trident Tips on using it : Use Topple with a melee weapon so you can knock enemies to the ground with your first attack, then roll with advantage on the rest of your attacks (since attacking Prone enemies within melee range grants advantage). As a fighter, you could get extra mileage out of Topple by knocking an enemy over and then using your Action Surge to make even more attacks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Vex",
      "content": "Vex After hitting a creature (and dealing damage), use Vex to get advantage on your next attack roll, so long as you do it before the end of your next turn. This ability allows you to focus on a single foe and keep wearing them down with attacks (or defeat tougher enemies on the battlefield). [13] X Research source Weapons : Handaxe, dart, shortbow, rapier, shortsword, blowgun, hand crossbow, pistol Tips on using it : As a rogue, use Vex to ensure you’ll get a Sneak Attack (which deals lots of additional damage) on your next turn since you need advantage to get Sneak Attacks."

      "title": "Pick weapons (and masteries) that enhance your character’s skills.",
      "content": "Pick weapons (and masteries) that enhance your character’s skills. Before choosing your weapon mastery properties, think about the role you want your character to fill in the party and how you like to fight during battles. Are there weapons and masteries that can make the tactics and abilities you already use more powerful? [14] X Research source For example, melee warriors who fight on the front lines could opt for masteries that give them greater control of the battlefield (like Cleave and Push) and add damage to their melee attacks (like Topple). A warrior using ranged weapons could use masteries that add effects to each arrow or bolt strike (like Slow, Push, and Vex). A warrior focused on protecting allies could combine Slow and Sap to make enemies less threatening and mobile on the battlefield. A duelist wielding two weapons could use Nick to deal more damage and take down single targets faster. A warrior specializing in taking down large, tough enemies could combine Topple and Vex to get advantage on both melee attacks and subsequent hits."

      "title": "Any class can take the Weapon Master feat to use Weapon Mastery.",
      "content": "Any class can take the Weapon Master feat to use Weapon Mastery. Do you wish you could play around with different Weapon Mastery options, but aren’t playing a class with that feature? There’s one workaround: at level 4 (or any level that allows you to pick a feat), take the Weapon Master feat, which lets you use the mastery property of a Simple or Martial weapon of your choice, as long as you’re proficient. [15] X Research source Just like the basic Weapon Mastery rules, you can change your learned mastery property after finishing a Long Rest when you have this feat. There’s also a Weapon Master feat from the 2014 rules, but it works much differently (granting proficiency with 4 weapons of your choice)."

      "title": "Overall, Weapon Mastery is a promising rule that adds intrigue to combat.",
      "content": "Overall, Weapon Mastery is a promising rule that adds intrigue to combat. For martial classes like fighters and barbarians, it offers new opportunities to strategize in battle. Since combat can get repetitive for those classes, Weapon Mastery represents a way to keep things interesting! Many players approve of the rule and consider 2024's Weapon Mastery well worth adopting for the value it adds to the game. Ultimately, it's up to each D&D group whether they want to use Weapon Mastery or stick with 5e's 2014 ruleset. Whatever you choose, make sure everyone is on the same page."
