Foldable screens let you position your temporary walls to be opened or closed throughout the day—bend them to create corners. [1] X Research source For a cost-effective option, look for a paneled fabric divider . Use a stylish bamboo screen to get privacy without blocking the light. Opt for an industrial look with a metal-and-glass divider. While this divider is on the more expensive side, it adds a modern, minimalist charm to any space. A frosted glass wall will add more privacy, while a clear glass wall will let light shine through."

That way, the kitchen area feels divided from the rest of the space but it’s still easy to walk through. [10] X Research source Fill the bookshelves with your favorite cookbooks.
