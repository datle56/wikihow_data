For example, if someone accidentally cut the \"quick\" (an area of the nail with a rich blood and nerve supply), he would have experienced pain and bleeding. [2] X Expert Source Ashleigh Lopez Professional Dog Groomer Expert Interview. 31 January 2025. Older dogs may have arthritis in their toes, and nail trimming may be uncomfortable. For dogs like this, it can be helpful to have them lie down while you carefully handle their nails. Have them lie on their side while you do your paw-handling training exercises. Another way is to trim the nails while the dog is standing without lifting up the paw. Only do this if you are experienced with trimming nails. [3] X Research source The Everything Dog Grooming Book.

[5] X Research source Handbook of Veterinary Procedures and Emergency Treatment. Ford and Mazzaferro. Elsevier, Inc. Trauma, infections, tumors, and immune diseases are the most common nail disorders in dogs. Trauma usually only occurs in one nail and is caused by running on rough surfaces, catching a nail on an object, or improper nail trimming. Trauma or health conditions like diabetes and low thyroid levels can lead to bacterial infection in the nail. Bacterial infections usually cause swelling, pain, and discharge around the nails. Fungal and parasitic infections are less common than bacterial infections but cause similar symptoms. Tumors can take different forms: lumps, bumps, swellings, redness, or discharge. Immune disease can also affect the nail and may make the nail brittle and prone to sloughing. Always bring these findings to the attention of your veterinarian as soon as possible for treatment."

Using human clippers can squish the nail, causing pain or injury. There are a few different types of dog nail trimmers, the most common being either the guillotine (U shaped) or the scissors type. Which type to use is generally a matter of preference for the user. The \"scissors\" might be easier to use, as you don't need to thread the nail through the cutting surface as with the guillotine."

      "content": "Secure the dog. If the dog's relaxed and used to having its paws and nails handled, just have your dog lie down for its nail trimming. If he gets antsy, restrain him gently in the lying position using the elbow and arm that's holding his paw. If you have a very wriggly dog, ask a second person to help you out. Have your friend hold the dog while you're free to focus on the trimming."

Locate or approximate the quick before trimming off the end of the nail. Carefully work your way back towards the quick and stop trimming 2-3 millimeters in front of it.

      "content": "Stop any bleeding if you cut into the quick. A cut quick usually bleeds a lot, and your dog may cry out in pain or nip at you if this happens. If you accidentally cause bleeding, hold a piece of tissue onto the nail for a few minutes. If that doesn't stop bleeding, apply cornstarch or a commercial stop-bleeding powder or pen. Either dip the nail into the powder or apply a large amount using your fingertip. If bleeding doesn’t stop after 10 minutes, call your vet."
