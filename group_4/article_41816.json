      "content": "Stand in between to blocks, and dig straight down. Yes, yes, I know, the number one rule of Minecraft is to NEVER DIG STRAIGHT DOWN. But if you stand on the edge of both blocks, you can dig on both, and unless both are gone, you won't potentially fall to your death in lava or something. Place ladders on every block so you can get back up. On the other side of your two block tunnel, place a torch every 3 blocks, Like this:Torch (place the next torch on the fourth block) Once you have reached level 12, dig a 1x1x1 hole on the same side as the torches, NOT THE SIDE WITH THE LADDERS. Fill this hole up with water, making for a quick trip down, and the ladders for back up."
