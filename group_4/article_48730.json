His constant hot and cold behavior could indicate that he’s not sure how he feels about the relationship. If he’s not totally certain that he wants to commit, he might be pulling away until he can figure things out for himself. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "He doesn’t know how to express himself. Because of societal expectations, men often have a harder time expressing their emotions. [2] X Research source If that’s the case for your partner, he may be pulling away because he doesn’t know how to tell you how he’s feeling. This is especially likely if he feels pressured to express his feelings to you. Humans aren't always great communicators. Sometimes, men need the space to try and figure out how they're going to communicate whatever they have going on."

      "content": "He’s stressed out. When a man is stressed, he tends to shut down and close everyone out. He could be stressed about your relationship, but it’s just as likely that he’s stressed about work, family issues, or other commitments. When someone is stressed, it tends to affect their whole life, and could cause them to pull away from their loved ones.

      "content": "He’s afraid of commitment.

      "content": "He’s insecure. Many men feel insecure about themselves or have self-doubts. If your guy is starting to wonder how he can handle a new relationship or whether or not he will mess this one up, he may be pulling away as a form of self-sabotage. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "He’s scared of losing his freedom.",
      "content": "He’s scared of losing his freedom. Similar to being scared to commit, some men are absolutely terrified at the idea of getting tied down.

      "content": "He’s worried about future conflicts or fights. Some men struggle with communicating their feelings, likely because of societal expectations (oftentimes, men are expected to be silent yet strong). This can make disagreements hard to handle.

It’s probably the opposite of what you want to do right now, but the best thing you can do for your relationship is to let your guy figure things out on his own.

To continue the relationship, reach out and let him know that you’re here whenever he’s ready. That way, he feels safe knowing he can come back and talk to you when he’s figured everything out. [12] X Research source “I can tell you want space, and I respect that. Let me know when you want to talk, and I’m here.” “I’m gonna give you your space for now. Reach out whenever you’re ready, okay?” If possible, schedule to have a conversation without distractions with him to figure out what is happening. During this conversation, ask if there's something that you need to help him and support him with whatever it is he may be dealing with. Having open communication with each other is extremely important. Whether you like what might come out of his mouth or not, it's important to be there and listen to view whatever is happening from his side."
