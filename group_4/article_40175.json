You can either click and drag to select the column that you want to sort, or you can click one of the cells in the column to make it active and let Excel select the data automatically.

If you are sorting text, you can sort in ascending alphanumeric order (\"AZ↓\") or descending alphanumeric order (\"AZ↑\"). If you are sorting dates or times, you can sort from earlier to later (\"AZ↓\") or later to earlier (\"AZ↑\"). If there is another column of data next to the one you are sorting, you will be asked if you want to include that data in the sort. The sort will still be the column you originally selected, but associated columns of data will be sorted along with it."

      "content": "Troubleshoot a column that won't sort. If you are running into errors when you try to sort, the most likely culprit is formatting problems with the data. If you are sorting numbers, make sure that all of the cells are formatted as numbers and not text. Numbers can be accidentally imported as text from certain accounting programs. If you are sorting text, errors can arise from leading spaces or bad formatting. If you are sorting dates or times, troubles usually stem from the formatting of your data. In order for Excel to sort successfully by date, you need to ensure that all of the data is stored as a date."
