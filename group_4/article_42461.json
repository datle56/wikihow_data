      "content": "Wipe off creamy lipsticks with a cotton pad and warm water. Saturate a cotton pad with warm water and use it to massage your lips in a circular motion. As the lip color transfers onto the cotton pad, wipe your lips with a clean portion until all of the lipstick has come off. [1] X Research source This works best on traditional lipstick formulas that are creamy when applied and sit on top of your lips rather than seeping in. They can be easily blotted and tend to wear off over the course of the day. Avoid trying this to remove lip stains, matte lip products, and long-lasting lipsticks. Water alone won’t take off the color, and too much rubbing will dry out your lips."

      "content": "Massage petroleum jelly into your lips to remove long-lasting lip products. Petroleum jelly will melt away even the most stubborn lip stains. Apply a dollop of petroleum jelly onto your lips using your fingertips. Massage the jelly into your lips and let it sit between 1 and 5 minutes. Wipe your lips clean using a cotton pad dampened with warm water. [2] X Research source You can repeat this process if some lipstick residue remains after the first attempt. Dab some fresh petroleum jelly onto your lips after removing the makeup to keep your lips hydrated."

      "title": "Apply untinted lip balm over dry lip color to loosen and remove it.",
      "content": "Apply untinted lip balm over dry lip color to loosen and remove it. Swipe untinted lip balm onto your lips, layering it over the lip color product, throughout the course of the day. This will loosen up the product for easier removal later on. When it’s time to take off the lip color, massage a generous amount of balm into your lips using your fingertips. Let it sit for 1 to 5 minutes before wiping your lips with a damp cotton pad. Lip stains and long-wear matte lipsticks can make your lips feel unnaturally dry. Applying lip balm during the day will restore some moisture to your lips. Carry lip balm with you for easy on-the-go removal. Choose a lip balm that does not contain salicylic acid, since this ingredient can make dryness worse."

      "content": "Cleanse and hydrate your lips naturally with almond, olive, or coconut oil. Massage 3 or 4 drops of liquid almond oil or olive oil onto your lips, or smear on a dollop of solid coconut oil. Let the oil sit for 2 minutes as it works to melt away the lip color. Then, wipe your lips in a circular motion with a dry cotton pad to pick up the oil and lip color. [3] X Expert Source Charina Redugerio Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 26 May 2020. Alternatively, you can transfer the oil to your lips using a cotton pad dampened with the oil. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Take off any lip color using a lipstick makeup remover product.",
      "content": "Take off any lip color using a lipstick makeup remover product. Lipstick removers come in a variety of styles, including cream, liquid, oil, balm, and gel formulas as well as saturated wipes. Each works in a slightly different way, but generally speaking, you can apply the product to your lips, let it soak in, and then wipe it away with a cotton pad. Makeup removing wipes can be used directly to rub off the lipstick in gentle circular motions. But for the most effective removal, follow the directions outlined on the product’s packaging. Some lip color removers also double as lip scrubs to exfoliate your lips. Other vitamin-infused formulas are intended to be left on overnight to hydrate. Consider picking a formula that provides an extra level of care to your lips, especially if they get dry or flaky. [5] X Research source Some long-lasting lip products are sold with specific remover products, either in a kit or separately. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Rub cold cream into your lips to remove all traces of lip product.",
      "content": "Rub cold cream into your lips to remove all traces of lip product. Dab a dollop of cold cream onto your lips and massage it in. You’ll start to see the lip color come up right away. Leave the cold cream on for 1 minute and then wipe away the murky tinted cream with a damp cotton pad or washcloth. Cold cream is a versatile makeup removal product that can take off everything from lip stain to foundation to waterproof mascara. For one-step total makeup removal, apply dollops of cold cream over your entire face and massage it in. It might feel a little gross at first, but cold cream is extremely effective as well as hydrating."

      "content": "Apply micellar water for touch-ups as well as total lip color removal. Micellar water, sometimes called cleansing water, is handy in that it can take off a variety of products but doesn’t need to be rinsed off with water. Saturate a cotton pad or cotton-tipped swab with micellar water and press it to your lips. Let the product sit on your lips for 1 minute and then blot it away with a dry cotton pad. [7] X Research source If you mistakenly applied lip color outside the lines, or want to clean up the edges, use a cotton-tipped swab soaked with micellar water to erase small amounts of products."

      "title": "Exfoliate with a lip scrub to remove stubborn stains.",
      "content": "Exfoliate with a lip scrub to remove stubborn stains. First, use another makeup removal method to get most of the lip color off. Follow up with a gentle lip scrub to get the stains out of the creases and corners of your lips. Dampen your fingertips and lips with water, then pick up a dollop of the scrub. Massage the scrub into your lips for 30 seconds, focusing on stained areas, then rinse it off with a damp washcloth. [8] X Research source Press your lips flat against your teeth to pull the skin taut as you apply the scrub. Finish off by applying a hydrating lip balm. You can use a store bought lip scrub or make a homemade one by mixing equal parts brown sugar and honey. [9] X Research source Do this no more than twice a week to avoid over-exfoliating and damaging your lips. If your lips are really chapped and flaky, you can also exfoliate with some petroleum jelly or coconut oil on a soft-bristled toothbrush. This method will hydrate your lips while also smoothing them and removing lipstick."

      "title": "Select cotton pads to use as disposable lipstick removal wipes.",
      "content": "Select cotton pads to use as disposable lipstick removal wipes. It doesn’t matter if you pick a square or round cotton pad, or one with smooth or quilted sides. But you should pick one with a smooth rather than fuzzy texture. You can use both sides of a cotton pad when taking off lip color with practically any removal product. A benefit is that cotton pads are disposable and won’t stain your towels with makeup. To apply a liquid removal product to the cotton pad, hold the pad securely over the top of the open bottle. Flip the bottle sideways or upside-down quickly to saturate the pad. Cotton balls aren’t a great choice for lip color removal. They are too fuzzy and will fall apart easily. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a terry or microfiber washcloth if you prefer a reusable wipe. Reusable washcloths can be used to apply a makeup removal product to your lips and can be dampened to quickly wipe the product and lip color away. The texture of microfiber and terry washcloths will gently exfoliate your lips. Reserve one washcloth for lip color removal to avoid staining others and launder it regularly. Consider picking out a cloth in a dark color, or a color that matches your lipsticks. [11] X Research source At some beauty stores, you may be able to purchase a small scrubber called a lip loofah. Slip this onto your fingertip, then rub it across your lips to remove dried-on lipstick. [12] X Expert Source Charina Redugerio Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 26 May 2020."

      "content": "Refrain from scrubbing your lips with paper products and tissues. Facial tissues, toilet paper, or paper towel are ok for blotting lip color immediately after application. However, they aren’t recommended for completely removing lip color. These paper products can’t be saturated with water or product and will tear easily. They will also dry out your lips.
