      "content": "Identify a cat to tame. If you see a stray cat in your neighborhood that seems friendly and not averse to humans, you may be able to tame it. Taming a stray cat can be a difficult process that lasts several months. A feral cat may never behave the same way a domesticated house cat would, but many reach a point where they make loving pets and are able to live indoors. Some stray cats are actually lost cats that were previously domesticated. Providing food, shelter and attention is often the only thing required to tame a lost cat. Try leaving some food out for them and then petting them when they come close. If they allow it, there is a good chance they are a lost cat. Try to track down the owner before claiming the cat as your own. Look around town for any posters or fliers that might have been put up for this lost cat. Talk with your local human society and veterinarians to ask if anyone is looking for the cat you have found. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source It’s much easier to tame feral kittens than feral adult cats. Kittens have yet to learn the behaviors of either indoor or outdoor life. Adult cats are set in their old ways and habits and it can be tough to retrain an older cat. Socialize a feral kitten before it is eight weeks old. Socializing early on will help them grow comfortable with behaviors expected from an indoor cat. You should also let kittens stay with their mother until they are four weeks old. Newborn kittens will still have an umbilical cord stump on their stomach. They will also no open their eyes until seven to fourteen days have passed. [2] X Research source If the kittens incisor teeth have grown in, it's likely about two weeks old. If you notice any teeth behind the canine and incisor teeth, where our molars are, the kitten is at least four weeks old. If the kitten has all of it's adult teeth, you can assume it to be around four months old. [3] X Research source If a cat seems aggressive or hostile towards you, leave it alone."

The best way to start the process of taming a feral cat is to set out a trap.

Do not use traps designed for other animals. You can get traps from your local trap-neuter-release organization. Set the trap in a place where the cat spends most of its time. You'll need to bait it with a little tuna or other food to lure the cat inside."

[7] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Use a carrier big enough for a litter box, bedding, and dishes for food and water. Keep the carrier in a room away from family members or other pets. Let the cat stay contained for two days before you touch it. Make sure it has enough food and water for two days. Put a full box of kitty litter in the cat's litter box. Make sure the cat won’t be able to escape as it may cause harm to the cat or your home.

      "content": "Gradually give the cat more room. Spend time near the carrier and speak in soothing tones until the cat seems calm when you're nearby. When the cat is used to your presence and no longer acting as wild, you can allow it more space to move around. Allow the cat to leave the carrier but stay in a small room that you have cat-proofed. [8] X Research source Don't force the cat to come out, let it willingly come to you. Provide a private hiding space where the cat can go to reduce stress levels. Make sure it's an accessible spot so you can reach the cat if necessary. Make sure there's no way the cat can escape through a door, window or crack. Smaller rooms make the best socialization rooms.
