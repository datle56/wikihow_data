      "content": "Write down your goals. It is helpful to create a list of concrete and realistic goals. You may even want to draft a mission statement for your organization.

Some examples of goals include: Create a safe space for the community to gather while providing a venue for the improvement of the community. Provide support and resources to unemployed members of the community through classes, workshops, and job fairs. Give legal aid to the local immigrant community."

This includes religious groups, sports teams, businesses, non-profit organizations, and clubs. What types of skills do the members of your community have?

      "content": "Think about location and other practical matters. While you do not need to decide on a specific location yet, you should begin brainstorming sites where you might potentially operate your community center. You will also want to think about what kind of facilities or positions you will need. Some questions you should consider: Will the community center require staff? If so, what positions might be required? What kind of building will it need? Will it need an outdoor area for a garden or sports? What kind of equipment will it need? How will the center support itself financially? Will it depend solely on donations? Will it charge for classes and events?"

      "title": "Create a budget.",
      "content": "Create a budget. You will need to have a rough estimate of how much the community center will cost. This includes start-up costs, building costs, the cost of services (such as classes), and running costs. To form your budget, contact other non-profits in your area to ask about how much their services cost per month. Compare that with what you want to offer to the community. Consider: What is the average property cost in your area? How much will it cost to buy or rent a building? How much will it cost to offer certain services, such as classes, to the public? How much will it cost to fundraise? This includes the cost of events, mailing campaigns, and advertising fees. What kind of equipment will you need? Is there any special type of technology that you will need to invest in?"
