      "content": "Educate yourself about the multiple types of bipolar disorder. There are four basic types of bipolar disorder that are regularly diagnosed: Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, and Cyclothymia. The type of bipolar disorder a person is diagnosed with is determined by its severity and duration, as well as how quickly the mood episodes cycle. A trained mental health professional must diagnose bipolar disorder; you cannot do it yourself and should not attempt to do so. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Bipolar I Disorder involves manic or mixed episodes that last for at least seven days. The person may also have severe manic episodes that put them in enough danger to require immediate medical attention. Depressive episodes also occur, usually lasting at least two weeks. [6] X Research source Bipolar II Disorder involves episodes of 'hypomania', which rarely escalates to full-blown mania, and more lasting episodes of depression. Hypomania is a milder manic state, in which the person feels very “on,” is extremely active, and appears to require little to no sleep; other symptoms of mania such as racing thoughts, rapid speech, and flights of ideas might also be present, but unlike those in manic states, people experiencing hypomania do not generally lose touch with reality or the ability to function. Untreated, this type of manic state may develop into severe mania. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems. Go to source The depressive episodes in Bipolar II are generally assumed to be more severe and lasting than the depressive episodes in Bipolar I. It is important to note that a wide range of symptoms might be associated with both types I and II, and the experiences of every individual sufferer are different, so while conventional wisdom dictates as much, this is often, but not always the case. Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (BP-NOS) is a diagnosis made when symptoms of bipolar disorder are present but don’t meet the rigid diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5 (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). These symptoms are still not typical for the person’s “normal” or baseline range. Cyclothymic disorder or cyclothymia is a mild form of bipolar disorder. Periods of hypomania alternate with shorter, milder episodes of depression. This must persist for at least two years to meet diagnostic criteria. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A person with bipolar disorder may also experience “rapid cycling,” in which they experience four or more mood episodes within a 12-month period. Rapid cycling appears to affect slightly more women than men, and it can come and go. [9] X Research source"

However, it will represent a dramatically more elevated or “revved up” mood from the person’s “normal” or baseline emotional state. Some symptoms of mania include: [10] X Trustworthy Source National Alliance on Mental Illness Grassroots mental health-focused organization providing resources, support, and education for those affected by mental illness Go to source Feelings of extreme joy, happiness, or excitement. A person having a manic episode may feel so “buzzed” or happy that even bad news cannot damage their mood. This feeling of extreme happiness persists even without apparent causes. Overconfidence, feelings of invulnerability, delusions of grandeur. A person having a manic episode may have an overinflated ego or higher sense of self-esteem than is typical for them. Thy may believe they can accomplish more than is feasible, as though absolutely nothing can get in their way. They may imagine that they have special connections to figures of importance or supernatural phenomena. Increased, sudden irritability and anger. A person having a manic episode may snap at others, even without provocation. They are likely to be more “touchy” or easily angered than is usual in their “typical” mood. Hyperactivity. The person may take on multiple projects at once, or schedule more things to do in a day than reasonably can be accomplished. They may choose to do activities, even seemingly purposeless ones, instead of sleeping or eating. Increased talkativeness, scattered speech, racing thoughts. The person having a manic episode will often have difficulty collecting their thoughts, even though they are extremely talkative. They may jump very quickly from one thought or activity to another. Feeling jittery or agitated. The person may feel agitated or restless. They may be easily distracted. Sudden increase in risky behavior. The person may do things that are unusual for their normal baseline and pose a risk, such as having unsafe sex, going on shopping sprees, or gambling. Risky physical activities such as speeding or undertaking extreme sports or athletic feats -- especially ones the person is not adequately prepared for -- may also occur. Decreased sleeping habits. The person may sleep very little, yet claim to feel rested. They may experience insomnia or simply feel like they don’t need to sleep."

If a manic episode makes a person with bipolar disorder feel like they’re “on top of the world,” a depressive episode is the feeling of being crushed at the bottom of it. The symptoms may vary between people, but there are some common symptoms to look out for: [11] X Research source Intense feelings of sadness or despair. Like the feelings of happiness or excitement in the manic episodes, these feelings may not appear to have a cause. The person may feel hopeless or worthless, even if you make attempts to cheer them up. Anhedonia. This is a fancy way of saying that the person no longer shows interest or enjoyment in things thy used to enjoy doing. Sex drive may also be lower. Fatigue. It’s common for people suffering from major depression to feel tired all the time. They may also complain of feeling sore or achy. Disrupted sleep pattern. With depression, a person’s “normal” sleep habits are disrupted in some way. Some people sleep too much while others may sleep too little. Either way, their sleep habits are markedly different from what is “normal” for them. Appetite changes. People with depression may experience weight loss or weight gain. They may overeat or not eat enough. This varies depending on the person and represents a change from what is “normal” for them. Trouble concentrating. Depression can make it difficult to focus or make even small decisions. A person may feel nearly paralyzed when they’re experiencing a depressive episode. Suicidal thoughts or actions. Don’t assume that any expressions of suicidal thoughts or intentions are “just for attention.” Suicide is a very real risk for people with bipolar disorder. Call 911 or emergency services immediately if your loved one expresses suicidal thoughts or intents."

It may be viewed as something they could just “snap out of” if they “tried hard enough” or “thought more positively.” The fact is, these ideas are simply not true. Bipolar disorder is the result of complex interacting factors including genetics, brain structure, chemical imbalances in the body, and sociocultural pressures. [15] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Mental Health Informational website from U.S. government focused on the understanding and treatment of mental illness. Go to source A person with bipolar disorder can’t just “stop” having the disorder. However, bipolar disorder is also treatable. Consider how you would speak to someone who had a different sort of illness, such as cancer. Would you ask that person, “Have you ever tried just not having cancer?” Telling someone with bipolar disorder to just “try harder” is equally incorrect. Medication and therapy can help manage the symptoms of bipolar disorder, but the disorder can last a lifetime. [16] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source There’s a common misconception that bipolar is rare. In fact, about 6 million American adults suffer from some type of bipolar disorder. [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Even famous individuals such as Stephen Fry, Carrie Fisher, and Jean-Claude Van Damme have been open about being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. [18] X Research source Another common myth is that manic or depressive mood episodes are “normal” or even a good thing. While it’s true that everyone has their good days and bad days, bipolar disorder causes shifts in mood that are far more extreme and damaging than the typical “mood swings” or “off days.” They cause significant dysfunction in the person’s daily life. A common mistake is to confuse schizophrenia with bipolar disorder. They are not at all the same illness, although they have a few symptoms (such as depression) in common. Bipolar disorder is characterized principally by the shift between intense mood episodes. Schizophrenia generally causes symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech, which do not often appear in bipolar disorder. It is possible for someone with schizoaffective disorder, to have the symptoms of both though. [19] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Many people believe that people with bipolar disorder or depression are dangerous to others. The news media is particularly bad about promoting this idea. In reality, research shows that people with bipolar disorder don’t commit any more violent acts than people without the disorder. People with bipolar disorder may be more likely to consider or attempt suicide, however.

In addition to being inaccurate, this type of language trivializes the experience of people who have bipolar disorder. Be respectful when discussing mental illness. [21] X Research source It’s important to remember that people are more than the sum of their illness. Don’t use totalizing phrases such as “I think you’re bipolar.” Instead, say something like, “I think you may have bipolar disorder.” Referring to someone “as” their illness reduces them to one element about them.

[23] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Reassure the person that they aren’t alone. Bipolar disorder can make a person feel very isolated. Tell your loved one that you are here for them and want to support them in any way you can. Acknowledge that your loved one’s illness is real. Trying to minimize your loved one’s symptoms won’t make them feel better. Instead of trying to tell the person that the illness is “no big deal,” acknowledge that the condition is serious but treatable. For example: “I know that you have a real illness and that it causes you to feel and do things that aren’t like you. We can find help together.” Convey your love and acceptance to the person. Particularly while in a depressive episode, the person may believe that they are worthless or ruined. Counter these negative beliefs by expressing your love and acceptance of the person.

[25] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Avoid statements such as “You’re worrying me” or “Your behavior is odd.” These sound accusative and may shut the other person down. Statements that attempt to play on the other person’s sense of guilt are also not helpful. For example, don’t try to use your relationship as leverage to get the other person to seek help by saying something like, “If you really loved me you would get help” or “Think about what you’re doing to our family.” People with bipolar disorder often struggle with feelings of shame and worthlessness, and statements like these will only make that worse. Avoid threats. You cannot force the other person to do what you want. Saying things like “If you don’t get help I’m leaving you” or “I won’t pay for your car anymore if you don’t get help” will only stress the other person out, and the stress may trigger a severe mood episode."
