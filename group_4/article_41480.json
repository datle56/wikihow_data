It's hereditary and can be treated with antihistamines if it's inconvenient. [7] X Research source Otherwise, wear sunglasses (polarized, especially) or scarves.

Keep a tissue on hand. Often sneezing and blowing your nose go hand in hand. Have a way to wet your nostrils. This can stop sneezing fits before they start. Though snorting water is definitely a feasible option, you may want to stick with wetting a tissue and applying to your nostrils, using your eyedrops, or sniffing the steam from a cup of coffee."

      "title": "Know when not to stop a sneeze.",
      "content": "Know when not to stop a sneeze. A sneeze, known technically as a sternutation, is a major deal for the body. The typical sneeze removes air from your body at speeds up to 100 mph (160 km/h), tremendous velocities that can cause serious injury if incorrectly stifled. That's why you should never try to stop a sneeze that is in progress. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Lung Association Nonprofit health organization dedicated to improving lung health through education, advocacy, and research Go to source For example, do not hold your nose or block your mouth while sneezing. Doing so can cause serious injury. The force and velocity of the average sneeze, if prevented from ejection from the body, can eventually cause hearing loss and damage the blood vessels in your head, especially if you make a habit of stopping a sneeze when it's already begun."

      "content": "Sneeze safely. If you have a broken rib, a sneeze can hurt very badly. Exhale as much air from your lungs as you can.
