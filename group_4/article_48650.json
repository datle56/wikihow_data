      "content": "Your childhood caregivers were very demanding and critical. As a child, you learn to mimic and internalize the way that your parents or caregivers treat you. If your adult figures frequently criticized you, you may have learned to relate to your authentic self with only harsh criticism. [2] X Research source In order to survive their criticism, you had no choice but to internalize this as part of your identity. Even if it felt wrong emotionally, you had to believe it was the truth. Your young mind had no other way to differentiate this information, other than to believe it must be true. Your caregivers may have also demanded that you be extremely well-behaved or academically successful. You may now hold yourself to those impossible standards, and if you fail to meet them, you can’t help but be hard on yourself."

      "content": "You were brought up with strict religious, societal, or cultural expectations. You may have internalized expectations from the media, your church, or the general world about what you should do or who you should be. Often, these expectations are linked to productivity, meaning that your self-worth is reliant on how hard you work. [3] X Research source As a result, you struggle to let yourself relax and beat yourself up if you’re not the very best in your field. By holding yourself to these standards (that no human could ever meet), you end up in a spiral of negative self-talk and self-criticism. When it comes to religious pressure, you may have felt that you had to be a perfect child without any “sinful” mistakes or desires. When, as a teen or adult, you fail to meet these standards, you may feel that you’re a completely awful person."

Everyone has an inner critic, but yours may be crueler or more difficult to stifle than others. Remember that that voice isn’t you, and it’s a result of your environment rather than who you actually are. [5] X Research source While your critical inner voice may feel inescapable, there are ways to cope with and quiet your inner critic. Try pinpointing whose voice you’re really hearing and who in your past it reminds you of. Speak directly to the critic and counteract its negative statements with positive ones. If your inner critic says, “I’m such a screw-up,” for example, respond with, “I’m doing my best, and that’s enough.”"

[6] X Research source Talk to a mental health professional about your concerns to see if they can offer a diagnosis. However, being hard on yourself doesn’t necessarily mean you have a specific mental health condition or disorder. Many people struggle with self-criticism without any underlying conditions."

When you notice a piece of negative self-talk pop into your head, find a gentle, encouraging thought to counteract the negative it. You don’t have to attack or challenge the negative thought—instead, try to soothe the part of your brain that wants to criticize you. [7] X Research source For example, if you think something like “I’m such a lazy slob,” you can say something gentle and soothing like, “It’s normal to feel like you’re being lazy when you’re really just relaxing. You deserve to have some downtime.”"

Think through the exact thoughts you had and make a mental list of how those thoughts made you feel. Try to come up with any evidence that supports this negative thought—and even if you did make a mistake (as we all do), try to reframe the thought in a more positive way. [8] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source For example, you may think that you’re stupid because you missed an easy answer on a test. Instead of using that error as proof that you’re not an intelligent or good person, consider that missing that answer will ensure you remember it for next time. “It may also be helpful to match each event or thought that supports the belief that you are a failure with an equally valid time when you were a success,” suggests licensed psychologist Dr. Catherine Boswell. Did you ace a difficult test last quarter? Did you get a more challenging question correct despite missing the “easier” one? Boswell also emphasizes the importance of “noticing the storyline or narrative that contributes to the notion of being a failure, then reality checking that narrative: Is it really about who you are here-and-now, or is it an old and potentially inaccurate story?” Consider what you learned from analyzing, challenging, and reframing that negative thought. Did it make a difference in how you’re feeling? Keep in mind that this process may take a few tries to work."

Don’t worry about penmanship, grammar, if you sound whiny or dumb, or any other superficial concerns about your writing—write exactly how and what you feel. Then, rip it all up! [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Promise yourself from the beginning that you won’t read what you write and will rip up the paper immediately afterward.

Take some time to learn about what it means to be a good friend or partner, then assess if the people in your life meet those standards (or are at least trying to). [10] X Research source For example, a good friend should be trustworthy, honest, dependable, and supportive of you during both good times and bad. Friends should be non-judgemental about your choices and demonstrate that they care about your well-being. [11] X Research source Similarly, a good partner should communicate with you, listen to your needs and concerns, show empathy and respect toward you, and give you affection in the way you ask for it. [12] X Research source Feel free to set boundaries with anyone in your life that’s not supporting your well-being. If someone is truly being toxic or abusive to you, it may be time to walk away from the relationship altogether."

But that’s easier said than done, so start by trying to adopt a growth mindset . Remind yourself that abilities and identities aren’t fixed—you are always capable of change and growth with enough time and effort. [14] X Research source If you find yourself in a cycle of constantly ruminating on past mistakes, Marriage & Family therapist Samantha Fox advises that you “take a moment to find the feeling you have in your physical body around this experience, connect to it (as uncomfortable as it might be) and become curious as to what might happen if you weren’t ruminating.” “It’s likely that the rumination is a part of you that is protecting you from making the same blunder again by keeping it fresh and alive,” continues Fox. “Try validating the feeling,” instructs Fox, “asking it if there is anything more it needs you to know, and then thanking it for trying to protect you from repeating the same mistake and embarrassment.” As Fox goes on to explain, you need to “let this part of you know that you learned from the experience and, while you deeply appreciate its protective reminders, you will be ok and can it please take a few steps back and let you function from yourself.”"

When you feel stuck in a negativity loop about yourself and your life, Boswell suggests examining “the specific areas in which you feel the most dissatisfied.” Focusing on the specifics, Boswell continues, “gets you out of the all-or-nothing thinking that holds you in overwhelm and helps you avoid the magnitude of thinking you must fix your whole life.” Make a list of specific areas of your life where you’re struggling or feeling disappointed, then “select one or two to work on before tackling the others,” says Boswell. Boswell recommends starting small “with the solutions that are easiest so that you avoid discouragement, or with the solutions that will provide the most significant change.” For example, you may want to pick up a new hobby and also develop a better support system. While you can start taking small steps to build a support system, it may be easier to focus on the simpler goal of learning a new hobby for now."

Hang the page somewhere where you’ll see it often—like your bathroom mirror or the dashboard of your car—to remind yourself of the many excellent qualities you have. [15] X Research source Licensed clinical psychologist Jennifer Guttman, PsyD, recommends “writing daily self-affirmations that reflect your sense of self. For example, write statements that reflect your integrity, loyalty, generosity, perspective, honesty, etc.” If you feel yourself getting stuck on coming up with your positive attributes, return to the list at a later date when you’re feeling more positively about yourself. You can also “ask friends, family, or a therapist about your strengths and successes and write them down so you can review them frequently,” suggests Boswell."

In addition to your list, Guttman also advises “writing daily self-affirmations that reflect tasks you completed,” advises Guttman. For example, you could write an affirmation like “I presented to a major client at work today—I am competent, confident, and brave” or “I folded my laundry today—I can take care of myself even if it takes small steps to do so.” It’s important to “tangibly self-reinforce a job well done,” argues Guttman. “Don’t wait for the outside world to reinforce your successes—you are the best judge of your performance, so you should take charge of reinforcing yourself.”"

Remember that healing can be a slow road, and it’s not linear, so be patient with yourself as you work on your self-criticism habit. [19] X Research source Practice self-compassion by writing a mock letter to your best friend. Describe what you love about them and what your advice is on a situation they’ve been struggling with. Re-read the letter after you’ve finished it, but change your best friend’s name to your own. Consider these questions: Does it feel strange to talk to yourself in a kind and compassionate way? How do you think it would feel if you talked to yourself like that all the time?"

      "content": "Work on improving your self-esteem. Over time, improving your overall confidence can improve your sense of self-worth and make you less hard on yourself. Guttman provides some expert examples of how to overcome your feelings of inferiority, such as “facing a fear daily to tackle something you felt you couldn’t do…This can be as small as making a phone call or looking someone in the eye or as large as speaking in front of an audience of 150.” “Make decisions on your own without opinion shopping,” Guttman offers as another method to improve your self-esteem. “We often delegate decisions to others, which undermines our confidence.” “Making decisions builds confidence,” continues Guttman, “in showing yourself that many positive outcomes occur and that you also have the ability to cope with less than positive outcomes should they occur.” Another step toward building self-worth is “writing daily self-affirmations to remind yourself not to fall into a negativity bias about yourself and your actions,” says Guttman. Guttman defines self-affirmations as “statements you make about yourself that demonstrate pride in your ability and actions. Use the affirmations to balance your view of yourself and to help you build evidence of successes and, in turn, build confidence. Review the affirmations you have written in the past weekly.”"

You may think that everyone judges themselves in the same way or holds themselves to extremely high standards. While it’s true that everyone experiences periods of self-doubt or low self-esteem, being constantly critical of yourself can negatively impact your health and lead to self-destructive behaviors like negative self-talk, substance abuse, and reckless risk-taking.

Negative self-talk comes from that critical inner voice you hear telling you that you’re bad, stupid, or always doing the wrong thing. Almost everyone hears this voice at some point in their lives, but some of us have a louder inner critic than others. Some examples of the negative self-talk you may hear from this voice include: [23] X Research source Overgeneralizations: You may say, “I always do this,” or “I can never do that right,” after making one or two harmless mistakes. [24] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Personalization: You may take offenses more personally than they were intended. If someone snaps at you because they’re in a bad mood, you’ll jump to thinking that they hate you or you did something to upset them. Mind-reading: You may draw negative conclusions without getting enough information to form that conclusion. For example, suppose you text someone, and they respond in a lackluster way. You might assume they don’t like you rather than considering that they may be distracted or preoccupied. Disproportionate thinking: You may outweigh one small negative thing against a mountain of good things, like getting a below-average grade in one class versus getting top grades in your other ones. Labeling: You may judge yourself and others based on a single behavior that you did or observed. For example, you may beat yourself up for being a liar if you told a little fib once or call yourself a thief if you stole something one time."

Reflect on your most present thoughts each time that the timer goes off. Were you in the middle of putting yourself down or criticizing yourself? If so, you may have a habit of being too hard on yourself. Alternatively, you can make a list of all the things you think about yourself, being as honest as possible. Read through the list and ask yourself whether those things sound compassionate or harsh. If one of your close friends made a list like that about themselves, would you think their assessment was fair? You can also ask trusted friends and family (or even a therapist) for their honest feedback. They may be able to tell you whether you’re too hard on yourself or even gently point out when you’re being overly critical in the future."
