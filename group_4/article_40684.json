      "content": "Consult your doctor. The best thing you can do when returning to exercise after being sick is to talk to your doctor about it. [2] X Research source Depending on your illness there are probably specific things to work on and avoid. Know the effects of any medications you’re taking – like if you’re more likely to become dehydrated while exercising. Your doctor may refer you to a Physical Therapist or Occupational Therapist for professional help getting moving, depending on your needs. Say something to your doctor like, “Now that I’m feeling better I want to start a fitness regime. Can you help me make a safe plan?” Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following during exercise: chest pain or tightness, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, nausea or vomiting, irregular heartbeat, numbness in your arms, lightheadedness, faintness, you pass out, or start to sweat profusely (more than would be expected for your activity level)."

      "content": "Acknowledge that you’re starting over. No matter how fit you were before your illness, being sick for a while takes a toll on your body. Your muscles are weaker than before and your stamina and endurance will be lower. This is normal! Acknowledge that you’re basically starting over, like it’s your first time exercising. Prepare yourself mentally to start slow, increase your activity gradually, and be patient. [3] X Expert Source Francisco Gomez Fitness Coach Expert Interview. 24 October 2019 Remember that you can and will get fit, it just takes time. If you start lifting heavy weights right away, there’s a chance that your weakened muscles will get a tear, sprain, or strain. [4] X Research source You have to rebuild your cardiovascular fitness, i.e. endurance. It’s likely your heart rate will elevate more easily now that you’ve been inactive for a while. Your immune system has been fighting hard to overcome your illness, so if you overwork your body you’ll probably feel unwell the next day.

If you make goals and write them down, you're more likely to achieve them. [6] X Expert Source Francisco Gomez Fitness Coach Expert Interview. 24 October 2019 Keep a workout journal to help you stay motivated. Write down your main goal, and then smaller goals for one week, two weeks, and one month. For instance, if your main goal is, “Run a marathon in a year,” don’t expect to start running 10 miles this week. Increase your goals gradually, starting with something like “Week 1: Walk for 30 minutes a day” and working up to “6 months: Run 10 miles 2-3 times per week.” Start as big or as small as is safe and comfortable for you. Be realistic and specific in your goals.

[9] X Expert Source Francisco Gomez Fitness Coach Expert Interview. 24 October 2019 Drink plenty of fluids to help your body sweat and maintain a normal body temperature, so you avoid heat stress and dehydration. Take a break every 20 minutes during exercise to drink some water, even if you don’t feel thirsty. [10] X Research source If your doctor has told you to limit fluids because of a health condition, be sure to ask them about staying hydrated during fitness activities. Some medications affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and cool, such as some to treat high blood pressure and heart problems (beta blockers, diuretics), allergy symptoms (antihistamines), anxiety (tranquilizers), and psychiatric symptoms such as delusions (antipsychotics).

Take a walk every day, and don’t worry if you start slowly – even 5 minutes is a good start. Try to increase how far you walk every day. Get an inexpensive pedometer to measure how many steps you take. The goal for healthy adults is 10,000 steps every day. [12] X Research source From whatever is your starting point, try to increase it 500 steps more every day until you can do 10,000 steps with no pain or discomfort."

      "content": "Listen to your body. If a 30 minute walk leaves you feeling exhausted, that’s okay! Cut it down to 15 minutes until that feels comfortable, then increase it. Everyone recovers at different speeds. Push yourself to be slightly outside your comfort zone, without being in pain or having symptoms return. If you’ve had a severe illness, even walking may seem like a challenge. The idea is to start small, even extremely small, like getting up to use the bathroom or make a meal. Then slowly and gradually increase your activity each day."

Do aerobic exercises like jogging, swimming, the elliptical machine, bike riding – whatever increases your heart rate and breathing rate and gets you to break a sweat. [16] X Research source When you’re ready to work on cardio, aim to do 50% of your pre-sickness activity and go from there. [17] X Research source For example, if you used to do a 10 mile bike ride, start with 5 miles. Pay attention to your body, and increase or decrease that distance as you need to. Once 50% feels good, increase your workout to 60% of your previous activity, then 70%, and so on. Don’t jump back to a full 100% effort as soon as 50% feels comfortable; this will probably be too intense. [18] X Research source"

The range of motion of a joint is how far in what directions a joint can move, and this should sometimes be limited after surgery. For instance, after shoulder surgery your doctor or physical therapist may advise you that you need to avoid reaching overhead until you’re healed. Be sure you understand what movements are safe for you to do before you start exercising."

Swimming is a non-weight bearing cardiovascular exercise – in other words, it gets your heart rate up for a good workout without putting stress on your joints. If you’re recovering from knee, hip, or shoulder surgery, swimming can be a great way to start. Swimming and aqua aerobics are also beneficial exercises if you have arthritis or problems with balance like after a stroke. [21] X Research source For painful joints, also do isometric exercises of the surrounding muscles. Isometric exercises are those that tighten and release the muscle, which makes it stronger. For instance, if your knee is weak or painful, work to strengthen your quadriceps muscles."

Numerous studies have shown that exercise not only improves wellbeing, mental health, strength, and physical wellness, it may decrease recurrence rates in some types of cancer. Make a goal to exercise for 150 minutes each week or longer, and do strength training 2 days each week.
