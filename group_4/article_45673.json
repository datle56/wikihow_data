Common suffixes include things like \"-ed\", \"-ing,\" \"-er,\" and \"-ate.\" [1] X Research source Write out a number of prefixes and suffixes and play around with them while experimenting with different word combinations. Prefixes or suffixes may belong to a specific word or sentence. For example, if you have the letters d, u, e, n, n, c, i, h, and a, notice the prefix \"un.\" You can spell the word \"unchained.\""

      "content": "Look for one, two, or three letter words. Some word scrambles form sentences instead of a single word, so pick out any small words you can. You may find single letter words, like \"a\" or \"I,\" as well as words like \"to,\" \"the,\" \"at\", and so on. Make a list of any short word you find that you may potentially use later. Almost every sentence contains \"the\" at some point. If you're unscrambling a sentence, and you see a \"t,\" \"h,\" and \"e,\" there's a good chance this will end up spelling \"the.\""

      "content": "Look at consonants and vowels separately. Make a list of all the consonants and then make a list of all the vowels. Experiment by placing consonants in front of different nouns to see if anything looks familiar. Also, be on the lookout for any common noun combinations such as \"ou\" and \"ie.\" For example, you may have the letters g, p, n, o, i, u, d, and n. If you separate the nouns (o, i, and u) you'll noticed the common pair \"ou.\" You can slowly build around this to make the word \"pounding.\""

Pair \"ou\" together and try adding random letters before and after it. You'll find you can make the word \"noun,\" which falls in the middle of the word \"announcement.\""

If you have an \"s\" in your word scramble, it's easy to get stumped as you may forget it can come at the end of a word to make it plural. If you're not having any luck solving a problem, experiment by placing the \"s\" at the end of the word. [3] X Research source Look at the letters v, a, e, w, s. You may recognize the \"ve\" pattern and spell something like \"save.\" However, the \"s\" falls at the end of the word here, spelling, \"waves.\""
