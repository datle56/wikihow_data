      "content": "Recognize the symptoms and signs of genital warts. Although genital warts often show few or no symptoms, it's important to identify any symptoms you may exhibit. Consult your doctor for a definitive diagnosis if you notice any signs of genital warts, especially if you've engaged in unprotected sex. Both men and women can contract genital warts, and repeat outbreaks are common because HPV can remain in your system. Genital warts often present few symptoms and even when signs are present, they may be mild and cause no discomfort. In women, genital warts can appear on the vulva, the perineum, the anal canal, and on the cervix. They can also appear on the mouth, tongue, lips, or throat of a person who engaged in oral sex with an infected person. Common symptoms of genital warts in women are: small, flesh or grey colored lesions in your genital area; lesions clustered together that resemble cauliflower; itching or other discomfort in your genital area; and bleeding during intercourse. The warts or lesions may not be visible to the naked eye."
