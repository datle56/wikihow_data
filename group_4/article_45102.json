      "title": "Understand why parental controls are used.",
      "content": "Understand why parental controls are used. Parental controls are for your protection and may even be required by law. Not only are parental controls used to block content that may be inappropriate or upsetting to younger viewers, but they also block access to content and individuals that may be dangerous or illegal (i.e extremist/terrorist propaganda). Furthermore, it may be used to limit the amount of time you spend using electronic devices so that you can spend time with your family and do other important things that need to get done. Be careful when talking to strangers online. You never know if the people you are talking to online are who they say they are. They may be out to harm you. Never EVER agree to meet an online stranger in person without your parents' approval. Never give out personal information on the internet. This information may include your full name, your email address, house address, where you go to school, where you or your family works, or places you go. Also, never send personal photos to people who you don't know or trust. When you are online, you are not just in the comfort of your own home. You are in public, and you should act like you are in public. Assume that all your actions are being monitored at all times (in some countries, law enforcement monitors internet activity to prevent terrorism and cybercrime). Even in private conversations. If you wouldn't say something in the middle of a crowded restaurant, you probably shouldn't say it on social media or in a chat room. Don't say anything to anybody you wouldn't say to them face-to-face. Always remember that there is a person behind every username you see online. Treat them with the same respect you would show someone in-person. Be aware of your physical and mental health. If being online is causing you to feel stress or anxiety, consider taking a break for a while. If you are spending so much time online or consuming media that you are neglecting to take care of yourself, the people around you, or you are not doing other important tasks that need to get done, consider limiting the time you spend online. If your online activities or media consumption are causing problems in your life and you are not able to quit or limit the amount of time you spend doing these things, you may have an addiction that needs treatment."

      "title": "Talk to your parents or the administrator of the account about adjusting the controls.",
      "content": "Talk to your parents or the administrator of the account about adjusting the controls. This is perhaps the easiest and safest way to adjust the parental controls. The person who imposed the parental controls usually has your best interests at heart. They may be more willing to adjust the controls if you discuss the reasons why you think the controls should be lifted. Start by asking your parents or the administrator why they have imposed Parental Controls on your account. Are you using social media like Facebook too much or playing certain inappropriate games too often? Are you neglecting your health, social circle, or studies as a result of spending too much time online? Do you live in a state or country that requires the use of content filtering software? Are you currently under a legal order restricting your internet usage? After understanding the main reasons for the parental controls, try to initiate a change in your behavior or at least show your parents you are trying to change your approach to online activities. This might make them reconsider their actions and agree to an adjustment of the parental controls."

      "content": "Keep in mind no filtering or blocking program is 100 percent effective. While it may be tempting as a parent to install every block, limit, and filter on your childâ€™s electronic devices, be aware that new sites are added to the Internet every day so it is simply not possible for parental control software to catch every suspicious site. There are always workarounds for parental restrictions. Parental controls should never replace parental supervision, and online accountability services such as Truple can help with this. Some parental control software can also block useful information like access to personal health issues and topics your child may need to be aware of. Engage in active parent interaction with your children and have conversations about proper internet use. Talk with them about what content is appropriate and inappropriate as well as how to be safe and responsible online."
