Before you come out, make sure that doing so won’t endanger your health, safety, or living situation. If you think there might be a problem, have a safety plan in place. That means having a bag with some essentials packed and ready to go. Plan ahead to stay at a friend or family member's house, if necessary. Make sure that you are completely comfortable with your own identity before discussing it with others."
