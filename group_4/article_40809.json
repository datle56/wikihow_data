      "content": "Decorate the cover with stickers or gemstones. Even if your diary is already fancy, you can still glue some pretty gemstones to the cover. If your diary is plain, but you don't want to go through a lot of effort of making it fancy, you can always add some pretty stickers to the cover."

      "title": "Cover a plain journal with fabric.",
      "content": "Cover a plain journal with fabric. [1] X Research source This works great for those plain, composition books! For an added touch, add some embroidery to the fabric first, before you glue it on. It can be as simple as several rows of a straight stitch."

      "title": "Cover your journal with colorful paper instead.",
      "content": "Cover your journal with colorful paper instead. You can use scrapbook paper, maps, or wrapping paper. You can even design your own cover on the computer, print it out, and use that instead! [2] X Research source Use glue to make the cover permanent, or tape to make it temporary. Cover your finished journal with decoupage glue (such as Mod Podge) or contact paper to protect the paper from getting dirty or wet."

      "title": "Add some sparkle with glitter to a plain journal color.",
      "content": "Add some sparkle with glitter to a plain journal color. Cover the front of your journal with a thin layer of liquid glue, then shake some glitter onto it. Wait for it to dry, then brush some glossy decoupage glue (such as Mod Podge) onto it. [3] X Research source If you want multiple colors, work with one color at a time. Let each color dry first before moving onto the next. Make sure that your sealer is glossy. If it is matte, your glitter won't sparkle anymore. Sealing the glitter is important. It will prevent the journal from shedding all over the place. Consider sealing the edges of the cover as well."

      "title": "Try a duct tape cover.",
      "content": "Try a duct tape cover. Wrap duct tape around the cover. Fold the ends of the tape over onto the inside of the cover by 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters), then trim off the excess. If you are using patterned tape, make sure that the patterns line up! Cover the spine of your journal with contrasting tape. For example, if you use patterned tape for the cover, use solid-colored tape for the spine."

      "content": "Decorate important events with doodles or illustrations. They don't have to be very big or fancy. A simple sketch, such as a flower, heart, or cat can really make your page stand out. Just make sure that it has something to do with what you are writing about! [4] X Research source If you don't want to draw, you can always use colorful stickers instead! This is great for calendars. For example, if you have a party coming up, add a doodle of a cake, present, or balloon! Another idea is to glue items inside your diary that have something to do with the entry, such as maps, postcards, ticket stubs, and postage stamps!"

In either case, you'd want to make the first page extra special. Here are some ideas to get you started: Write your name, the title of your diary in large letters. If you want, you can add a message that says \"TOP SECRET\" or \"KEEP OUT\", but be warned, if someone finds your diary, this will most likely make them want to read it even more. Use lots of bright colors. Sparkly or metallic gel pens are great for this! Decorate the corners and borders with doodles and stickers."
