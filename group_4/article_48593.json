      "content": "If the washing machine isn’t turning on, start by confirming the machine’s plug is actually inserted into the outlet. If the plug is inserted properly, it’s possible the outlet itself is actually to blame. Unplug the machine and test the outlet by plugging in a phone charger or another device you know works. If the outlet is fine, contact a pro to inspect your washing machine. If the outlet isn’t responsive, check your fuse box. Find the circuit for the washing machine. If the fuse is flipped in the off position, you simply had a power surge that popped the breaker. Flip the fuse back on and re-run your wash cycle. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "If a Whirlpool washing machine door isn’t closed or locked, the machine will refuse to turn on. This is 100% the problem if you see “LD” or “LDL” on the screen (these are the error codes for unlocked lids on Whirlpool machines). Pop the lid open and grab a damp washcloth. Gently wipe down the latch mechanism on the machine and the little lock arm on the lid. Then, try closing the lid and running your cycle. If you’re still getting error codes for the lid or your lid won’t lock, contact an appliance repair company to inspect the machine. You may need a new lid. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Most modern Whirlpool machines have a delay function so that you can automatically run cycles when it won’t bother anyone. However, if the delay settings are already configured, your machine won’t respond when you try to start the machine early. Just reset the machine to clear this issue. Turn the power off, wait 1 minute, then plug the machine back in. If you had a delay cycle set, it will clear."

      "content": "Do you have a button on your Whirlpool washer that says “control lock” or “lock?” If so, your machine has a lock function to prevent the door from opening, mainly to keep kids from opening the drum when you aren’t around. If you accidentally locked the door, hold the lock button down for 3 seconds to unlock it. If the lock button is still illuminated or the door won’t open, try resetting the machine by turning it off (or unplugging it) and waiting at least 1 minute. Then, turn it back on—the lock setting should clear. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "If some of the buttons on your washing machine aren’t responsive but the machine is powering on, it’s possible that some of the buttons aren’t working. This can happen if moisture gets into the control panel or your machine is on the older side and beginning to fail. This isn’t a DIY repair since it involves rewiring or replacing the electrical components in your machine, so contact a professional appliance repair company. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "If washer powers on and everything is in working order, but the drum won’t spin, the drive belt is likely to blame. If you want to repair this one yourself, remove the back panel of the machine. Then, tilt the machine to access the bottom if you have a top loader (the belt will be on the back for front loaders). Look for the rubber strip that runs around the motor and various pulleys. This is the drive belt. If it’s taut and secure, the drive belt is fine, and the motor is likely to blame. If the belt is loose or broken, replace it or contact a professional to do it for you. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "If the machine still isn’t turning on, it’s very likely that the motor is dead (or dying). If your machine is on the older side, this is probably a good time to consider shopping for a new washing machine Alternatively, contact an appliance repair company to look at the motor. They’ll either replace it, fix the problem, or haul your washing machine out if it’s done. [6] X Research source"
