      "title": "Choose white pants made of cotton.",
      "content": "Choose white pants made of cotton. You can tie dye leggings, yoga pants, or even jeggings, as long as they are made of 100% cotton. Check the label on your pants to find out what material they are, and make sure they are mostly white. [1] X Research source Tie dye colors show up the best on white clothing. If you are dyeing yoga pants or leggings, they may have some elastic blended in with the cotton. As long as it's under 10%, your tie dye will still work just fine."

      "title": "Lay your pants out flat.",
      "content": "Lay your pants out flat. Smooth out your pants on a flat surface, like a table or countertop. Make sure the surface is clean so you don't get your white pants dirty, and smooth out any wrinkles or creases in your pants with your hands. [2] X Research source You don’t need to iron your pants; just use your hands to smooth them out as best you can."

      "title": "Scrunch your pants up towards the waistband for a splatter effect.",
      "content": "Scrunch your pants up towards the waistband for a splatter effect. Grab the bottom of the legs of your pants and push them up towards the waistband.

      "content": "Fold your pants accordion style for a spiral design. Start at the bottom of 1 leg of your pants and fold it up in a 0.5 in (1.3 cm) horizontal section. Turn that fold over on itself to make a second fold. Continue this all the way up both legs of your pants, and then fold the waistband the same way. [4] X Research source This folding method creates more of a classic spiral tie dye pattern."

      "title": "Put rubber bands around the middle of your pants for a bullseye.",
      "content": "Put rubber bands around the middle of your pants for a bullseye. Pinch the middle of your pants upwards and wrap a rubber band around them so that they stick up in place. Keep pinching and attaching rubber bands about 2 inches (5.1 cm) apart until you can’t grab any more fabric. [5] X Research source This creates a bullseye design that will stem out from the center of your rubber bands."

      "content": "Attach rubber bands in random places to hold your design in place. Grab 5 to 6 large rubber bands and place them around your pants to hold your folds together. Make sure your pants stay tight in their design and won’t come loose as you apply your dye. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Put on rubber gloves and lay down plastic to protect your surface.",
      "content": "Put on rubber gloves and lay down plastic to protect your surface. Grab some rubber kitchen gloves or latex gloves to keep your hands protected as you use your dye.

      "content": "Place your pants in a plastic bag and let them sit for 6 hours. Don’t disturb your pants so that they have time to soak in all the dye. The longer you leave your pants, the more vibrant the colors will be. Leave them on a porch or back patio so they won’t be moved around. [11] X Research source You can let your pants sit for as long as 24 hours if you’d like to."

      "content": "Rinse out your pants with cold water. Take your pants out of the plastic bag and run cold water over them in the sink. Keep rinsing your pants until the water runs clear so that the dye doesn’t get on any of your other clothes. [12] X Research source Cold water will leave your dye intact and won’t make the colors run together."
