      "content": "Draw reveal lines 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) in from the corners of the door frame. Place the end of a tape measure along the inside edge of the door frame’s top left corner. Extend the tape measure horizontally 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) and draw a small line with a pencil. Then extend the tape measure vertically from the corner by the same distance and make another line. Repeat the process on the right side of the door frame so you know where to place the interior edges of the trim. [1] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 18 June 2021. [2] X Research source Making reveal lines on the door frame ensures that you can open the hinges without them getting caught or damaging the trim pieces. You do not need to mark the bottom corners of the door frame."

Place the end of the tape measure against the floor on the right side of the door frame, and extend it up to the marks you drew in the corner. Make sure the tape measure stays perfectly vertical so you don’t get a skewed measurement. Then take the measurement for the right side of the door frame. Write down your measurements so you don’t forget them. [3] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 18 June 2021. [4] X Research source Make sure to measure both sides rather than assuming they’re the same height since your floor or wall may be uneven."

Extend the tape measure from where the marks intersect on the left side to where they cross on the right side of the frame. Ensure the tape stays level horizontally to ensure you have an accurate measurement. Record your measurement so you’re able to reference it later.

      "content": "Mark the lengths from your door frame on the thinnest edges of 3 trim pieces. Get enough trim pieces so you’re able to cut the pieces to size to fit around the door frame. Extend your tape measure to the same lengths as your measurements so you can draw lines on the trim. Make the marks on the thin edges of the trim since they’re installed closest to the door. Keep your marks about 4–5 inches (10–13 cm) from the end of the trim pieces since you’ll have to make angled cuts. [7] X Research source You can buy door trim from your local hardware or home improvement store. Choose trim that’s a similar color to your door so it doesn’t clash."

Undo the locking lever and turn the saw until it lines up with the 45-degree mark on the base. Lock the lever again to secure the saw so it doesn’t move or shift while you’re using it. [8] X Research source You can buy or rent a power miter saw from your local hardware store. If you don’t want to use a power miter saw, look for a miter box that you can use with a regular handsaw."

      "content": "Put on safety glasses, earplugs, and a facemask before using the saw. Get safety glasses that you cover your eyes completely in case there’s kickback when you use the saw. Opt for in-ear plugs or shop earmuffs since saws can make a lot of noise and damage your hearing over time. Miter saws can also create a lot of sawdust, so cover your nose and mouth with a facemask so you don’t breathe any in.

Line up the blade of the saw with the mark on the trim. Start the saw and slowly pull the handle down to cut through the trim. Turn off the saw and let the saw blade stop spinning before raising it back up. Turn the piece of trim 180 degrees and line up the blade with the second mark to cut it. [10] X Research source The thinnest edge will be the shortest side and the thickest edge will be the longest. If you don’t want to rotate your piece of trim, you may also adjust the saw blade to a 45-degree angle in the opposite direction. If you plan on using butt joints or corner blocks, cut the ends of the header trim to 90-degree angles."

Adjust the saw blade so it points at a 45-degree angle to the left. Pull the saw down to make your cut and let it stop spinning. Turn the saw blade so it’s at a 45-degree angle to the right for the piece of trim that goes on the right side. [11] X Research source When you hold the left piece of trim vertically, the left edge should be the longest. If it’s not, then you had the saw blade oriented in the wrong direction. If you’re planning on using butt joints or corner blocks, then cut the top ends to a 90-degree angle instead."

Drive the first nail 1 inch (2.5 cm) up and 1 inch (2.5 cm) over from the bottom left edge of the trim. Space the rest of the nails 1 foot (30 cm) apart along the length of the trim. [13] X Research source You can buy or rent a nailer from your local hardware store. Avoid putting nails any closer than 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the edge since you could crack the trim.

Push the ends together to ensure there aren’t any gaps between them. If you notice a small gap, note if it’s on the upper or bottom corner. Either sand or trim the corner opposite of the gap, checking the fit periodically until it’s flush. [15] X Research source For example, if there is a slight gap at the top corner between the trim pieces, sand or trim the bottom corner to widen the angle until it’s flush.
