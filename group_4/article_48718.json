      "title": "Angel numbers are a repeated sequence of numbers with specific energy.",
      "content": "Angel numbers are a repeated sequence of numbers with specific energy. Normally, the numbers lie between 000 and 999 , and each sequence has a meaning. [1] X Research source The number is considered an angel number when you not only see the sequence, but see it multiple times in seemingly mundane circumstances. The more often you see the number, and the more of the same number in the sequence (ex. 555) the more powerful it is. The idea of numbers having meanings and energies comes from the study of numerology. Numerologists believe all numbers have certain vibrations that have a specific effect on the universe."

      "content": "Angel numbers are believed to be signs from the universe. For some, they’re direct communication from guardian angels (like the name suggests), while for others they can simply be an omen of the stars. Either way, the numbers are meant to be taken as a message to encourage you in a particular direction or to go forward with a task you’re already on your way to complete. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "The universe wants you to pay attention to something.",
      "content": "The universe wants you to pay attention to something. This can happen even if you’re not at an important crossroads. In fact, this is most likely to happen if you’re experiencing a steady life, with neither major good things nor major bad things happening to you. Seeing the numbers may be calling your attention to something specific, to try and guide you to a crossroads you haven’t reached yet. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "You’re being guided out of a slump. You may be experiencing hardship in your life, or you’re facing a tough decision. Angel numbers could be appearing to steer you in a positive direction. After all – if you’re seeing them, it is a good omen! [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "You’re being affirmed of the direction you’re currently taking.",
      "content": "You’re being affirmed of the direction you’re currently taking. A lot of angel numbers symbolize affirmation or approval as well! If you’ve been anxious about the direction you’re taking in life, or a recent, major choice you made, seeing these numbers can be a spiritual nod to the good decision you made. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "You’re experiencing a spiritual awakening.",
      "content": "You’re experiencing a spiritual awakening. There is a belief that there is a sixth sense – intuition – that can manifest with training, or be brought forth suddenly. Seeing angel numbers could mean you’re experiencing that very awakening of your sixth sense. Some take this as a sign to begin following a religion in life, or otherwise believing in greater forces in the universe. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "One represents new beginnings.",
      "content": "One represents new beginnings. Seeing the number one repeatedly is a sign of something new on the horizon. This could mean a positive change in your course, a new relationship, or otherwise new love entering your life. [7] X Research source If you’re on the verge of something new, this is a sign you’re on the right path. Ones are especially associated with spiritual awakenings, because they’re seen as direct blessings from God. This is believed to be especially potent if ones are seen in triples or quadruples (111 or 1111 .)"

      "title": "Two represents help and guidance.",
      "content": "Two represents help and guidance. The number two is associated with prayers being answered and a direct guide toward the answer to a long-standing question. You may have a decision you need to make or a hardship you need a path through. Twos indicate the universe or your guardian angels have heard this desire for answers, and are trying to push you into the right path. [8] X Research source Two can also represent relationships or budding love."

Whatever recent decision you made was the right one, and your guardian angel is giving you a nod of approval! [9] X Research source If you were on the fence about a decision, this could be a good indication to go forward with whatever you’re worried about."

      "content": "Four represents higher forces that are influencing you. This is a ‘wake-up call’ number, intended to remind you that you’re being watched and guided by forces of good. It can also be a reminder to trust yourself, and to have a strong will as you approach hardship in your life, knowing you have someone in your corner. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Five represents major change on the horizon.",
      "content": "Five represents major change on the horizon. If you are in a slump or feeling like your life isn’t reaching any significant heights, seeing fives is very fortuitous. It symbolizes significant change of the status quo in the best of ways. Angel numbers are always good omens, so you can be rest assured the changes that do happen are for the better.

      "content": "Six represents a needed balance in your life. This isn’t to be taken negatively, but more so as a firm reminder. If you’re seeing sixes, it means that there is something in your life that needs to be addressed, be it a bitter relationship, a dead-end job, or a personal struggle. [12] X Research source This said, sixes also mean that balance will come, but how quickly can be dependent on how you choose to address the message. Sixes seen in triples ( 666 ) is often seen as a bad omen, but that isn’t necessarily the case. If you’re seeing 666 frequently, that can be taken more as a warning from the universe that something in your life is in desperate need of attention, and not necessarily that you’re in danger.

      "content": "Seven represents overcoming obstacles. It can be seen as a sign of deep spirituality and a need to grow closer to the mystic parts of the universe. Seven is a secretive number, but is a subtle sign of support for upcoming obstacles, and that deepening your spiritual connection can make facing these obstacles easier. [14] X Research source"

Good fortune (both in terms of money and in luck) is believed to come more easily when you’re seeing eights.

      "content": "Nine represents generosity and kindness. Seeing nines is an encouragement to be selfless and to give to others. This isn’t to say you’re not doing that enough – quite the opposite. It could be the universe congratulating you on your deep empathy for humanity, and pushing you to continue it. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Take action on the meaning of the number. Once you’ve interpreted the meaning, act on it! If the number represents great change, take on those changes with a gusto. If you’ve been given a sign of encouragement, allow yourself to rest and try and calm any anxieties that are plaguing you. It is believed that what is promised to you will come if you are sure to act on the messages. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Don’t ignore them if you continue to see them. While it’s easy to dismiss the numbers as coincidence, spiritually speaking, it’s important to take them as the cosmic sign they represent. The universe has very few ways to communicate with the mortal world, so earnestly considering any sign that’s given is bound to be beneficial. That, and ignoring messages for too long can cause them to stop appearing, meaning you may miss the chance at divine favor. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Your personal angel number can be found using your birthdate.",
      "content": "Your personal angel number can be found using your birthdate. Finding your own angel number can help you use the messages of that number to better your life. Your personal number is essentially a universal message to you that can be used as a guide. To calculate your angel number, simply take your birthday, and add all the numbers together. The total will likely be a double-digit number. Once you get the total, add both digits of the double-digit number together (if there are two digits). [19] X Research source As an example: April 21, 1989 would be 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 9 = 34, and then 3 + 4 = 7, so your angel number would be 7. Some numerologists do not believe in any test that can discern a personal angel number. [20] X Research source This is because the number is subjective, and sometimes isn’t a number at all. Repeated symbols, such as animals or plants, can also be seen as a message from the universe."
