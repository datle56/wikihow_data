[2] X Research source If you live in an area where freezing pipes can be a problem, drain the toilets, the water heater (turn off the gas or electric supply first) and the expansion tank. Get an air compressor to blow the lines of excess water. Eliminate or dilute the water in drain traps by pouring an \"RV\" type antifreeze solution into them, as directed by the instructions. Close the sink and tub drains. If a house is to be vacant for a long time, you may prevent water in a toilet’s trap from evaporating (and thereby permitting sewer gases to enter the home) by raising the toilet’s lid and seat and covering the bowl with saran wrap. If you have an indoor or outdoor pool, drain the water. Turn off and drain fountains and other sources of standing water. Drain water from dishwashers and pour RV antifreeze. with refrigerators (with a water dispenser or an ice maker) and washing machines, following the manufacturer’s directions. Remove the water filter from inside the refrigerator. Remove and empty any \"whole house\" or \"in line\" type filter canister."

Don't leave anything in it in case the electricity is off for an extended period of time; you won't necessarily be aware if this occurs, and the food will have thawed and refrozen, which is very dangerous. If you must keep frozen food, here is one method for determining if your freezer has warmed during the winter: freeze a container of water solid, then place a coin on the surface of the ice; if the coin has sunk into the ice when you return, then the freezer warmed, letting the ice melt and then refreeze. Wash the refrigerator and freezer thoroughly. Prop open their doors, the better to forestall mold and mildew (which like to grow in the dark) and their odors, which may transfer to the refrigerator’s plastic parts. To further thwart odors, place an open bag of activated charcoal on the inside of the open refrigerator."
