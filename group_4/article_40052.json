      "content": "Drink more water. Dehydration can cause your body to extract as much water as it can as foods move through your digestive tract, producing dry, hard stool. Drinking enough water will soften your stool and help things move along more easily. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Doctors sometimes recommend 2.7 liters (for women) or 3.7 liters (for men) of water per day.

      "content": "Eat more fiber. Fiber is the indigestible material in plant foods. Your body passes them through without absorbing them. This means that they help to produce soft, bulky stool which is easy to pass. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You need both water soluble fiber, which turns into a gel-like material in water, and insoluble fiber, which does not dissolve. Soluble fiber is found in oats, peas, beans, apples, citrus fruits, carrots, and barley. You can get insoluble fiber in whole-wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts, beans, and vegetables like cauliflower and green beans. Many plants have both soluble and insoluble fiber, you can get both by eating lots of different grains and vegetables. Eating more fiber will be most effective if you drink extra water to help dissolve the water soluble fiber."

Look for ones with methylcellulose, psyllium, calcium polycarbophil, and guar gum as active ingredients (e.g., FiberCon, Metamucil, Konsyl, and Citrucel).
