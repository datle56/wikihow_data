Constipation can also be due to too little exercise or as a side effect of a number of different drugs. These include antacids, diuretics, narcotic pain relievers, antidepressants, and muscle relaxants. Constipation can also be caused by pelvic disorders or it can be a sign of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a form of which has both diarrhea and constipation.

Some people have two to three bowel movements a day and this is perfectly normal. Other people have a bowel movement every other day, and this is normal for them. [21] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In general, at least four to eight times a week seems to be most common. The key is your diet and comfort level. People with more frequent bowel movements tend to have high fiber diets and are often vegetarians or vegans. Those with fewer bowel movements tend to have a higher meat content in their diet. [22] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"
