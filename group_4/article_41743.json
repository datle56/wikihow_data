You can also use a container or tub, filling your chosen container up with water. Just make sure your leather will fit in the container without the water overflowing. [1] X Research source You can use warm water or room temperature water."

      "content": "Submerge the leather completely in the water. Once you’ve filled up a container or sink, place your leather in the water. You want the leather to be fully submerged in the water, so you may have to twist it around a little for the water to soak into the leather. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the leather soak in the water for 10 minutes. Make sure your leather is entirely saturated with water. A good way to check for this is to wait until there are no more bubbles coming from the leather. Once you think it’s saturated with water, let the leather continue to soak for 10 minutes.

While this may not be the most comfortable way to wear your leather, it’s important for you to move around with it on to stretch it out. Wear the leather for an hour or two, continuing to bend the parts of the leather you wish to be stretched. [4] X Research source This works best when you’re dealing with leather clothing, shoes, or accessories, such as a belt."

      "content": "Use rubbing alcohol as an alternative to soaking your leather. If you're wary of submerging your leather in a tub of water, you can use rubbing alcohol and water instead. This will simply be sprayed onto specific parts of your leather as opposed to saturating it entirely."

Once the solution is mixed, pour it into an empty spray bottle. [5] X Research source If you don’t have a spray bottle, you can also use a paper towel or cloth. Dip the paper towel into the mixture, making sure that it’s damp but not soaking wet."

If you’re spraying an article of clothing, aim for the areas that will be bending when you wear them. You don’t need to completely saturate the leather, but it should be wet. [6] X Research source If you’re using a paper towel, dab the leather with the damp paper towel to transfer the mixture onto the leather."

Wear the leather until the spots where you applied the alcohol are completely dry. [7] X Research source Wear thick socks if you’re spraying the alcohol mixture onto your shoes before putting the leather shoes on to stretch them out. If you've applied the alcohol to something other than a wearable item, bend and stretch the item using your hands."

Once your socks and shoes are on, use the hairdryer to heat up your shoes. Move your feet around in the shoes to stretch them out effectively.

      "content": "Apply a leather stretching spray for an easy fix. Buy a leather stretching spray that you can spray directly onto the leather to stretch it. The spray should cause the leather to become stretchy and soft. These sprays are often used on shoes and clothing items, so it’s important to wear the leather item after you’ve sprayed it to ensure it stretches properly. [11] X Research source If you’re applying the leather stretching spray to something other than clothing or shoes, you’ll need to hang the leather and weigh down an end with something heavy to stretch it out. Leather stretching sprays can be found at most big-box and shoe stores, or you can buy them online. The sprays typically cost $5-$15."

They typically come in a liquid or cloth form, ranging in cost from $5-$20. [12] X Research source These conditioners are great if you’re trying to make furniture, car interiors, or other accessories more pliable, but they also work well on leather clothing and shoes. Most conditioners will require you to apply the conditioner to the leather using a cloth. You’ll wait roughly 2 hours for the leather to absorb the conditioner before wiping away any excess residue."

You can buy shoe stretchers that will target specific areas of the shoe that you wish to be stretched. Shoe stretchers cost an average of $20. [13] X Research source You can also take your shoes to a professional to have them stretched. Professionals will have better quality and more complex stretching machines, allowing them to stretch out your shoes in a much faster amount of time."

      "title": "Stretch leather apparel by wearing the item around the house.",
      "content": "Stretch leather apparel by wearing the item around the house. Leather stretches out naturally when it’s being used, so by simply wearing your leather pants, jacket, or skirt around the house, it will begin to stretch. Shoes can also be stretched out by walking around in them, though it may lead to some blisters. This isn’t a quick method for stretching leather — stretching it naturally by wearing your leather around is going to take days or weeks, depending on your end goal. Wear your leather for 2 or more hours a day, and be sure to move around while you're wearing it. The more you wear your leather, the faster it will stretch."

      "content": "Stuff leather accessories to stretch them out. If you have a wallet, coin purse, bag, or other accessory that needs stretching, try stuffing it. Use a material such as paper or cloth, making sure the material won’t damage the leather by being too rough. Fill your leather accessory with the material so that it’s as full as you would like. How long you let the item stretch will depend on its size and your personal preference. [14] X Research source This method will work even better if you get the material slightly wet before stuffing the leather. Apply a leather stretching spray before stuffing the leather for it to stretch out even faster. These sprays can be found at a shoe or big-box store, as well as online."

This could be a table, chair, shelf — anything that you can clamp the leather onto. Weigh down the opposing end of the leather using a rock, can, or other heavy source. Weighing down one end of the leather will help it stretch out faster. [15] X Research source You can stretch a leather jacket or pants by weighing down the arms or legs of the article of clothing. Attach the clothing to a strong hanger at the top."

[19] X Research source While you don’t have to wait for all of the ice to melt completely, let most of it melt before removing the plastic bag from your shoe to prevent your shoe from getting damaged."
