      "content": "Understand the inequality signs. An inequality is like an equation, except instead of saying that the two values are equal, an inequality shows a “greater than” or “less than” relationship. The > {\\displaystyle >} sign means “greater than.” The < {\\displaystyle <} means “less than.” [1] X Research source For example, 2 x + 3 2 > − 15 + x {\\displaystyle 2x+{\\frac {3}{2}}>-15+x} means that the value on the left side of the inequality is greater than the value on the right side."

      "content": "Combine like terms, or otherwise simplify the inequality. You can solve inequalities using the same algebraic principles you would use to solve an equation . [2] X Research source You might need to combine variables, multiply to cancel out fractions, or use other operations to make the numbers easier to work with. Remember that you need to keep the inequality balanced, so whatever operation you perform on one side of the inequality, you must also perform on the other side. For example, if solving the inequality 2 x + 3 2 > − 15 + x {\\displaystyle 2x+{\\frac {3}{2}}>-15+x} , you would first multiply each part by 2 to cancel out the fraction: 2 ( 2 x + 3 2 ) > 2 ( − 15 + x ) {\\displaystyle 2(2x+{\\frac {3}{2}})>2(-15+x)} 4 x + 3 > − 30 + 2 x {\\displaystyle 4x+3>-30+2x}"

For example, in the inequality 4 x + 3 > − 30 + 2 x {\\displaystyle 4x+3>-30+2x} , to move the variable to one side, you would subtract 2 x {\\displaystyle 2x} from both sides of the inequality: 4 x + 3 > − 30 + 2 x {\\displaystyle 4x+3>-30+2x} 4 x + 3 − 2 x > − 30 + 2 x − 2 x {\\displaystyle 4x+3-2x>-30+2x-2x} 2 x + 3 > − 30 {\\displaystyle 2x+3>-30}"

For example, in the inequality 2 x + 3 > − 30 {\\displaystyle 2x+3>-30} , to isolate the x {\\displaystyle x} you need to subtract 3 from both sides, then divide both sides by 2: 2 x + 3 − 3 > − 30 − 3 {\\displaystyle 2x+3-3>-30-3} 2 x > − 33 {\\displaystyle 2x>-33} 2 x 2 > − 33 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2x}{2}}>{\\frac {-33}{2}}} x > − 16 1 2 {\\displaystyle x>-16{\\frac {1}{2}}} You can use interval notations to represent the solution to this inequality.
