      "content": "Figure out if you have a first degree burn. First degree burns are the most common, and happen as a result of light scalding, brief contact with hot items, and the sun. The damage is only on the most superficial or outer layer of the skin. [1] X Research source Domino, F. (n.d.). In The 5-minute clinical consult standard 2015 (23rd ed.). They will likely appear red, slightly swollen, and may or may not be slightly painful. Treat your first degree burn at home, since there is usually no need for expert medical attention. The outermost layer of skin has the ability to heal itself with care and time. [2] X Research source First degree burns are classified as ‘minor burns’ and should be treated as such. Sometimes you may get an extensive first degree burn, such as a full body sunburn, but this does not need medical attention."

      "content": "Know if you have a second degree burn. Your skin might also appear blotchy, blisters will form, and the pain will be much more intense. Second degree burns come from brief contact with incredibly hot things (boiling water, for example), extended contact with hot items, and prolonged exposure time in the sun. Unless your second degree burn is on your hands, feet, groin, or face, treat it like a minor burn. If you have blisters, don't drain them. If the blister is drained, keep it clean by rinsing with water and swabbing with antibacterial ointment. You can also cover the ointment on the skin with a bandaid or another dressing. This dressing needs to be changed daily . A second degree burn burns through two layers of your skin. If your second degree burn is wider than three inches, covers your hands, feet, joints, or genitals, or doesn't heal over several weeks, then you should call your doctor for medical help.

These happen when extended exposure to a hot object burns through all three layers of your skin, sometimes causing muscle, fat, and bone damage. The burns will look leathery and have a white or black appearance. The pain can vary depending on the level of damage to the nerves in the skin layer (pain receptors). These burns can look “wet” because of the rupture of the cells and protein leakage. Third degree burns are always classified as a major burn and need treatment from a doctor as soon as possible.

The area will look bright red, white, or black and will have a strong burning sensation as the skin is rewarmed. A low temperature “burn” is still considered a burn because it damages the skin's tissue layers. Treat low-temperature burns as major burns in most cases, and get medical help for treatment.

These types of burns will probably appear in the form of red patches, a rash, blisters, and open sores on your skin. Your first step is always to determine what caused the burn and to call poison control immediately. Contact a poison control center immediately if you believe you've suffered a chemical burn. Care must be taken to neutralize and isolate the spread of the chemical. [7] X Research source Irrigate chemical burns with lots of water, however, avoid water if exposed to dry lime or elemental metals (such as sodium, magnesium, phosphorus, lithium etc.) as these can react with water and cause more injury."

[19] X Research source Do not apply gauze directly to any wound. A wound must always be covered with a cream or ointment before applying gauze. Otherwise, when the gauze is removed, all the newly formed skin will be torn off with it. Remove gauze in the direction of surrounding hair growth. If the gauze is sticking to the wound, use lukewarm water or a saline solution applied to the stuck gauze for easier removal. Make a saline solution by adding 1 teaspoon of salt to a gallon of water.
