    {
      "title": "Start the engine in a well-ventilated area.",
      "content": "Start the engine in a well-ventilated area. Never start the engine in an enclosed space where the fumes can’t escape. Start the mower outside or open up any doors and windows to let air in if you are going to start the engine in a garage or other closed-off area. If you cannot create adequate ventilation wherever the mower is stored, then you can hook up a pipe extension to the exhaust pipe and run it outside to direct the exhaust fumes away from you."

      "title": "Insert the key into the mower’s ignition.",
      "content": "Insert the key into the mower’s ignition. Put the key into the slot to the right of the steering wheel. Do not turn it yet. [1] X Research source The key will automatically be on the stop position when you insert it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push the brake pedal down all the way and unlock the parking brake.",
      "content": "Push the brake pedal down all the way and unlock the parking brake. Put your foot on the brake pedal and compress it all the way so you can unlock the parking brake. [2] X Research source Push the parking brake lever located below the ignition down to unlock it. Keep the brake pedal compressed. [3] X Research source The brake pedal may be located on the left- or right-hand side of your mower, depending on the model."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the throttle lever into the choke position or half-speed position.",
      "content": "Put the throttle lever into the choke position or half-speed position. Move the throttle located to the left of the steering wheel into the choke position if the engine is cold. Move it into the half-speed position if the engine is warm. [4] X Research source Some models of riding mowers have a choke knob instead of a choke position on the throttle. If this is the case for your mower, move the throttle into the half-speed position and pull out the choke knob."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the key to the start position for up to 5 seconds.",
      "content": "Turn the key to the start position for up to 5 seconds. Turn the key all the way to the right for no longer than 5 seconds. [5] X Research source Release the key after 5 seconds if the engine doesn’t start, wait 10 seconds, then turn the key to the start position for another 5 seconds. Repeat this process until the engine starts. It’s important to only turn the key to the start position for 5-second intervals. If you hold it there for longer, you might damage the starter. If the mower doesn’t start and it has been sitting idle for a while, check the gas tank. You may simply need to add gas."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the key return to the run position after the engine starts.",
      "content": "Let the key return to the run position after the engine starts. Let go of the key once the engine is running. The key will automatically return to the run position when you let go of it. The run position is the spot second from the left, immediately to the left of the start position."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave the engine running at half-speed for 2 minutes before moving.",
      "content": "Leave the engine running at half-speed for 2 minutes before moving. Let the engine idle for 2 minutes so it can warm up. Start operating the mower after waiting 2 minutes. Don’t let the engine idle for longer than a few minutes at a time or you can cause engine damage. If you are going to stop operating the mower for longer than 2 minutes, go ahead and turn it off and then start it back up when you are ready to operate it again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the throttle lever into the slow position and idle for 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Put the throttle lever into the slow position and idle for 30 seconds. Move the throttle lever down to put the engine on slow speed. Let the engine idle at this speed for at least 30 seconds before turning off the mower. This minimizes the amount of unburnt fuel that enters the engine before you turn it off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the key to the stop position.",
      "content": "Turn the key to the stop position. Turn the key all the way to the left to stop the engine. Don’t remove the key yet. [6] X Research source You will hear the engine stop when you have successfully turned the key to the stop position."

    {
      "title": "Lock the parking brake.",
      "content": "Lock the parking brake. Compress the brake pedal and hold it down. Pull the parking brake lever located under the ignition up to lock the parking brake, then take your foot off the brake pedal. The brake pedal will stay compressed when the parking brake is engaged."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the key from the ignition.",
      "content": "Remove the key from the ignition. Pull the key out and keep it in a safe place. Don’t ever leave the key in the ignition when you aren’t using the mower. If you leave the key in the ignition and it is accidentally turned to the headlights on position, then you will kill the battery of your mower very quickly."
