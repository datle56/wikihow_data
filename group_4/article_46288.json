      "title": "Go to a spot where flies gather and the tube can hang freely.",
      "content": "Go to a spot where flies gather and the tube can hang freely. It’s best to place the ribbon in a spot where the ribbon can hang freely, not against a wall. That way, you can catch flies from all directions. Door openings, awnings, sheds, and tree branches are all viable locations. [1] X Research source Also find a surface that a thumbtack can penetrate, like wood or drywall. If you have to attach it to a harder surface, use duct tape instead. Remember to place the ribbon somewhere people won't knock into it."

    {
      "title": "Remove the thumbtack from the top of the tube.",
      "content": "Remove the thumbtack from the top of the tube. By the red ribbon on the top of the tube, look for a flat, silver thumbtack. Pull it out and put it aside for later. [2] X Research source You’ll need the thumbtack to hang the ribbon, so put it in a safe place. If you lose the thumbtack, you can also use a regular one in its place. However, try to find the original one or you risk stepping on it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the tube in one hand on the opposite side from the red strap.",
      "content": "Hold the tube in one hand on the opposite side from the red strap. This is the bottom portion that doesn’t come out. Hold it firmly with one hand. Don’t hold the tube too tightly. It’s only cardboard, and too much pressure will crush it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grab the tube by the red strap and pull the ribbon out.",
      "content": "Grab the tube by the red strap and pull the ribbon out. The red strap attaches to the ribbon. Point the strap down and pull until the ribbon starts coming out. Continue pulling until the ribbon is fully extended. [3] X Research source If the ribbon doesn’t come out well, try pulling with a circular motion to help work it out. The ribbon is about 3 feet (0.91 m) long, so you might have to readjust your grip to pull it all out."

      "title": "Hold the red loop up against the surface of where you are hanging the trap.",
      "content": "Hold the red loop up against the surface of where you are hanging the trap. When you find a spot for the ribbon, hold it up against an attachment point. You’ll need a surface that the thumbtack can penetrate, like wood or drywall. Make sure the red loop presses against the surface. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Push the thumbtack through the red loop into what you are hanging the trap from.",
      "content": "Push the thumbtack through the red loop into what you are hanging the trap from. Take the thumb tack you removed before. Push it through the red loop and into the hanging surface. Continue pressing until the tack is flat against the surface. [5] X Research source If you’re trying to hang the ribbon on a harder surface like brick or metal, you can also use duct tape to attach it instead of the thumb tack."

    {
      "title": "Move the ribbon to another location if you don’t catch flies in 2-3 days.",
      "content": "Move the ribbon to another location if you don’t catch flies in 2-3 days. Flies sometimes stay away from certain areas because of light or moisture. If you haven’t caught any flies for a few days, remove the ribbon and move it to another location. See if you have better luck there. If the ribbon gets covered in insects or loses its stickiness, replace it with a new one."
