Using butter will give your baked goods an amazing flavor and cakier texture. [1] X Research source Make sure your melted butter is room temperature before you add it to the batter—or you might accidentally cook some of the ingredients prematurely! [2] X Research source Always use melted butter in recipes that call for oil. Solid butter contains moisture and traps air during mixing, which might be undesirable. [3] X Research source Margarine can work as an “in-between alternative” to both butter and oil. Just make sure to use melted stick margarine, since the fat content will be closer to that of butter. [4] X Research source Butter can also be substituted for shortening in baking recipes. Replace shortening with exactly the same amount of butter, just as you would for oil. [5] X Research source Cooking with ghee is a heart-healthy alternative that offers the flavor of butter and the cooking benefits of oil. Many vegans enjoy it because all the protein/milk solids have been removed in the process of making ghee. It's a 1:1 substitution measurement ratio—so, if you were using 2 tsp (9.9 mL) of butter, you would use 2 tsp (9.9 mL) of ghee."

      "content": "Replace oil with the same amount of butter. If your recipe calls for ½ cup of oil, for example, use ½ cup of butter instead. Melt the butter and let it bubble to eliminate moisture, then continue the recipe. [6] X Research source Butter will give your foods a richer taste, but it also increases cholesterol. You can also combine melted butter and oil. For example, you can use ½ cup of melted butter and ½ cup of oil, instead of 1 cup of oil. This gives you a buttery taste while preserving the flavors and health benefits of oil.

Regular butter will burn under high heat. [8] X Research source Shortening can be replaced with butter in most cases—unless you’re frying or searing, in which case you should use ghee or clarified butter. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Replace the melted butter with ¾ the amount of oil.",
      "content": "Replace the melted butter with ¾ the amount of oil. For example, if your recipe calls for 1 cup of melted butter, replace it with ¾ cup of oil. [10] X Research source Melted butter is part water, part fat, whereas oil is 100% fat. Putting ¾ the amount of oil ensures that your recipe has the correct amount of fat. Try using an oil that compliments your recipe. Canola oil, olive oil, and grapeseed oil are more “neutral,” meaning they have less effect on the taste of baked goods. [11] X Research source Coconut, sesame, macadamia, avocado, and nut oils have strong flavors that stand out. This can be a good thing if it compliments the recipe. For example, banana bread is made with nuts, so walnut oil would make a great butter substitute. [12] X Research source Shortening can also be replaced with oil in some baking recipes—but not always. Don’t use oil instead of shortening in pie dough, biscuits, or scones. They won’t puff up properly. [13] X Research source"

[14] X Research source Coconut oil, palm oil, and palm shortening are good options. [15] X Research source They all come in solid form. Solid butter and solid oils are important to the texture of baked goods. Don’t use liquid oil if a recipe calls for solid butter. [16] X Research source Shortening can replace solid butter in baking recipes. The flavor won’t be as rich, but the texture will be correct. [17] X Research source"

Using oil instead of butter makes food healthier by reducing cholesterol and dairy intake. [18] X Research source Your food will taste different without butter. Adjust the seasoning to get the flavor to your liking. Choose an oil that compliments your recipe. Margarine can work as an “in-between alternative” to both butter and oil. Use the same amount of stick margarine as you would butter. Oil is a good alternative to shortening too, especially if you’re frying or searing. Use a neutral-tasting vegetable oil, like canola.
