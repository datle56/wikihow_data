      "title": "Place the shot at the base of your fingers in your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Place the shot at the base of your fingers in your dominant hand. Rather than holding the shot in your palm, position it at the base of your fingers, with your fingers slightly spread apart. Position your thumb on the other side of the shot, opposite your 4 other fingers. This allows you to flick the ball off your hand. [1] X Research source Bend your hand back in a cocked position. Imagine that you’re balancing a tray or pizza box. Keep it steady, but not over-extended, as this may cause an injury. Start with a lightweight shot , between 4 and 8 pounds (1.8–3.6 kilograms). This lowers the risk of injury as you practice and master proper form."

      "title": "Hold the shot at your neck, right under your jawline.",
      "content": "Hold the shot at your neck, right under your jawline. Nestle the shot in the crook of your neck so that it touches your jaw. Point your thumb down toward your collarbone, and face your palm in the direction that you’re throwing. Make sure that your elbow is up and parallel to the ground, and your upper arm extends straight out from your shoulder. [2] X Research source Keep the put above your shoulder at all times. Otherwise, you may receive a foul. Keep your head tilted slightly upward with your eyes trained in front of you, rather than focused on the shot."

      "title": "Face the side of the ring.",
      "content": "Face the side of the ring. Instead of directly facing your target, make a quarter turn so that you’re facing the side of the ring. Beginning at a 90-degree angle from the target allows you to twist your hips in order to gain momentum when throwing the shot. [3] X Research source If you’re right-handed, face the right of the circle. If you’re left-handed, face the left. The circle usually has a \"toe board\" in front to block the athlete's foot from going too far forward. Don’t step on the toe board. Once your shot has landed and stopped moving, exit the ring through the back portion, rather than walking forward out the front."

      "title": "Step back, bend your knees, and raise your free hand into the air.",
      "content": "Step back, bend your knees, and raise your free hand into the air. If you are right-handed, step back with your left foot. If you’re left-handed, step back with your right foot. Then, bend your knees, placing your weight on that back leg. Raise your free arm, pointing your fingers at an upward, 45-degree angle, where you want the shot to go. This gives you stability and added momentum for throwing the shot. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Twist your hips forward and straighten your knees.",
      "content": "Twist your hips forward and straighten your knees. Explode upward while swiveling your torso to face the direction of your throw. Straighten your back leg to thrust your throwing arm forward. The brunt of your momentum comes from your core, rather than your arm. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Straighten your elbow and flick your wrist to put the shot.",
      "content": "Straighten your elbow and flick your wrist to put the shot. As the lower portion of your body springs upward, straighten your putting arm as though pushing the shot away from you. [6] X Research source Then, as your arm reaches its peak, release the shot from your grip and flick your wrist toward the shot to give it a boost out of your hand. Remain within the circle for the duration of your throw. If your feet step outside the circle at any time, you’ll receive a foul and the throw won’t count."
    },
    {
      "title": "Face the back of the circle with your knees bent.",
      "content": "Face the back of the circle with your knees bent. Start a glide put by positioning yourself with your back facing the direction you’ll put. Place your weight on your bent dominant leg, with your non-dominant foot on its toe slightly behind your dominant foot. Hold the shot as you would during a basic put, tucked near your jaw. [7] X Research source Keep your elbow straight out from your arm, but lean so that it points down at the ground to allow for a cleaner line of release. This position primes you for a huge release of energy. You’ll start low and back, and finish high and forward."

    {
      "title": "Push off toward the front of the circle with your dominant foot.",
      "content": "Push off toward the front of the circle with your dominant foot. “Glide” to the front of the circle by hopping backward. Perform the hop by pushing off with your dominant foot while also kicking backward with your non-dominant leg. Land on your dominant foot, still keeping the shot securely at your jaw. [8] X Research source As you land, twist your hips to face the side of the circle, initiating the put. This linear motion across the circle contributes to the momentum of the put, giving you more power than a standing, basic put."

    {
      "title": "Twist your hips forward and straighten your elbow to put the shot.",
      "content": "Twist your hips forward and straighten your elbow to put the shot. After the hop, a glide put closely resembles a basic put. Swivel your body forward and extend your back leg, exploding upward and “pushing” the shot up and out at about 45 degrees. [9] X Research source As you release it, flick your wrist to give the shot an extra boost with your fingers. Extend your putting arm over the boundary of the ring to maximize your distance. Push the shot away from you to keep your body spinning after the release. Hop on your left foot a couple times to control the spin, and be careful not to step outside the ring."

    {
      "title": "Place the shot behind your ear and face the back of the ring.",
      "content": "Place the shot behind your ear and face the back of the ring. For a spin or “rotational” put, nestle the shot a bit behind your ear, further back than you would for a basic or glide put. Then, stand facing the back of the ring, with your feet planted a bit wider than your shoulders, and bend your knees slightly. [10] X Research source To find a comfortable, powerful stance, jump in place and visualize landing in a wide-set, sturdy position. How you land will dictate your ideal starting stance. Hold your free hand up and out, with your arm extended, to provide a counterweight as you spin."

    {
      "title": "Push off with your dominant foot to spin yourself forward.",
      "content": "Push off with your dominant foot to spin yourself forward. Swivel your hips slightly opposite the direction of your throw to wind up. Then push them the other way and kick into a spin with your dominant foot. Thrust your dominant foot out in the air, using it as a counterweight to control and add momentum to your spin. [11] X Research source Kick in the direction of your throw. If you’re throwing with your right hand, kick with your right foot and spin counter-clockwise. If you’re using your left hand, kick with your left foot and spin clockwise. This spinning motion creates more momentum than a basic or glide put, making this the most effective style if performed correctly."

    {
      "title": "Step into the center of the ring, then kick off again.",
      "content": "Step into the center of the ring, then kick off again. Place your dominant foot in the center of the ring, keeping your weight on the ball of your foot to stay agile. Then, while maintaining your initial momentum, kick your new back foot behind you to continue the spin. Plant this non-dominant foot behind you, toward the front of the ring, so that you’re ready to use your upper body to propel the shot. [12] X Research source At the end of this first spin, you’ll have pivoted 360 degrees, or 1 full rotation. Your second spin will be half of that, or 180 degrees. As you spin, it’s totally acceptable to have your feet extend out past the ring, so long as they stay in the air—you just can’t step outside the ring. Use this to your advantage as you swing your feet in wide arcs."

    {
      "title": "Extend your knees and put the shot.",
      "content": "Extend your knees and put the shot. Now, put the shot as you would when performing a basic put. Extend your back leg while swiveling your hips forward to provide a burst of momentum up and out. As you do, push the shot away from you by extending your arm, and finish with a flick of your wrist to give it an added boost. [13] X Research source Strive to connect each stage of this put seamlessly to the next. Practice the first spin, the second, and the final put separately, then string them together."

      "content": "Stretch your arms against a door or a wall to relax your muscles. Make sure your muscles are limber by performing some stretches to prepare for track events . To stretch your shoulders, stand near a doorway and lift your arm, holding it straight and parallel to the floor. Grab onto the frame of the door and gently lean forward, which will extend your arm behind your shoulder. Hold the position for 30 seconds, then repeat the exercise on the other side.

      "title": "Throw your shot underhand several times to warm up.",
      "content": "Throw your shot underhand several times to warm up. This will prevent you from straining your muscles and ensure that you are working out at full capacity. With both hands, throw the shot forward and underhand several times, with your knees bent to target your legs. Then, hold the shot near your chest with both hands, and push it forward and away from you several times to target your arms. [15] X Research source In addition, perform a more general warm-up with a light run, swim, or bike ride. For specific exercises to target your arms, perform several push-ups or lift weights for 15-20 minutes beforehand."

      "content": "Swing your arms in circles for 5-10 minutes to cool down afterward. Stretch your muscles after throwing the shot to avoid strain and help your body recover. Make wide circles with your arms to stretch for about 5-10 minutes after a putting session. [16] X Research source Do this while walking to also cool down your legs."
