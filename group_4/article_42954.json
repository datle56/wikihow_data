      "title": "Start by learning the idols' names and appearances.",
      "content": "Start by learning the idols' names and appearances. This can be done by checking out the group's profile on their official website, if available. Additionally, fansites such as KProfiles will have photos of each member and their name as well as additional information such as their likes and dislikes. Learning the unique attributes of each idol aids in telling them apart."

      "title": "Learn each member's face and name",
      "content": "Learn each member's face and name . Just as you might meet someone new at a party by first getting their name, you'll want to do the same for the members of the group that you are interested in. It's important to also know their face as it will be difficult to tell who each idol is if you only know them by name. In this way, you can have a visual reference for each member. Try to discern the distinguishing features of each member. For example, does one idol appear to have plumper lips than the others? Or does another have a beauty mark on their face?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch and listen to content of the group.",
      "content": "Watch and listen to content of the group. The more videos you watch of them, the more familiar you will become with each individual member. Fortunately, there is often a variety of content available, such as dance practices, \"guide to Kpop\", so-called \"crack videos\" as well as variety show and other media appearances. As you watch, try to see if you can tell which idol is which by looking for the distinguishing features found in step one. Once you have an ear for how each member sounds, you can be better able to figure out which one is singing when listening to their songs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch color-coded lyric videos.",
      "content": "Watch color-coded lyric videos. In these videos, while each member is singing, that same person's photo will light up on the screen, making it easier to associate their singing voice with their appearance. To find these videos on YouTube, simply type in the group's name plus \"color coded lyrics\"."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen to their music while checking the lyrics.",
      "content": "Listen to their music while checking the lyrics. User-contributed lyric sites such as Genius will often include notes about which member is singing which part of the song. By listening to the unit's music while checking the lyrics and notes on such websites, you can further familiarize yourself with each idol's singing voice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch performances by the group.",
      "content": "Watch performances by the group. Music videos, concerts and other performances provide a great way to combine a visual of the members with their vocals. While it can be easy to get caught up in the music while watching, try to focus on who is singing which parts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Challenge your knowledge.",
      "content": "Challenge your knowledge. As you become more familiar with the idol group, try testing your knowledge. For example, as you listen to one of their songs, try to guess who is singing. Then, check your guess against a source which indicates the singer for each part."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give yourself time to become familiar with the group.",
      "content": "Give yourself time to become familiar with the group. The more idols there are in the group, the more time it will likely take to tell them apart. Don't worry if you still can't recall which member is which when watching a performance or hearing one of their songsâ€”it will come in time. Keep enjoying their music and performances and you'll eventually be able to distinguish the different members easily."
