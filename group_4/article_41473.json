He crows to inform the flock of environmental changes and potential hazards, like predators. Note your rooster’s crowing habits and note specific stimuli that causes him to crow. [1] X Research source For example, he may crow to communicate with hens, to respond to other crowing roosters, when the sun comes up, when visitors come and go, or in the middle of the night. Keep in mind that some roosters just have big personalities and crow when they want to!"

Meeting his most basic needs on a consistent and regular basis will decrease his need to crow. To decrease his nighttime crowing, make sure to stock his coop with water and food before you head to bed. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your rooster entertained and stimulated. Roosters are intelligent and social animals that need some attention and affection, too. If they’re bored or want to play, they may start crowing to get your attention. Make sure they have plenty of room to roam around (they’ll get bored or agitated if they’re stuck in a coop all day) and consider entertainment like: [3] X Research source Hiding food under a layer of hay for them to find. Giving them a large chunk of food, like a corn cob, that requires time to peck apart and eat. Providing toys like pool noodles that roosters can peck at for entertainment. How much room does a flock need? According to Doss, “At least an acre (4047 sq m). A quarter acre (1012 sq m) is fine for just a few chickens, too.”"

      "title": "Decrease the size of your flock.",
      "content": "Decrease the size of your flock. Roosters crow to assert their dominance over other roosters and to communicate with their flock. To avoid crowing matches between roosters, only keep one in the roost. Decreasing the size of your flock will reduce your rooster’s need to crow as well. [4] X Research source Doss explains that this trick may not work all the time: “It's really dependent on the behavior of the rooster, so it may not matter how many roosters you have. They will still crow at 5am in the morning. It's what they're meant to be doing.”"

      "title": "Limit your rooster’s exposure to nighttime stimuli.",
      "content": "Limit your rooster’s exposure to nighttime stimuli. Crowing is most disruptive to you and your neighbors throughout the night. When a rooster is allowed to roam at night or he lives in a coop with an outdoor run, he is exposed to stimuli that will likely cause him to crow. Keeping your rooster inside a closed, darkened coop throughout the night will limit his exposure to predators and light that may cause him to crow. [5] X Research source If lights from a porch or vehicles are an issue, install shutters on the coop windows or switch to a windowless coop. [6] X Research source Some suggest leaving the coop light on all night to minimize changes in the light. However, this isn’t a permanent solution—roosters and hens need darkness to sleep, so only do this temporarily. Some rooster owners also suggest leaving a soft radio on for background noise. This minimizes other noise disturbances, like traffic sounds or dogs barking."

      "content": "Insulate the coop and keep your chickens inside until later in the morning. This probably won’t stop your rooster from crowing, but it will muffle the sound and make it less disturbing to you and your neighbors. Try surrounding the coop with trees or other lush plants to partially block the sound. Then, wait until the sun (and your neighbors) are up before letting your chickens out for the day. Your rooster may still crow once he’s out, but it’s far less irritating in the mid-morning than it is at 5am!"

      "content": "Place your rooster in a cage or coop with a low ceiling. A rooster needs to stretch his neck out to crow, so a low ceiling can inhibit the behavior. Make sure there’s plenty of ventilation and place a blanket over it to block light. [7] X Research source Remember that crowing is a natural behavior, and preventing your rooster from crowing too long may be inhumane. Use this trick sparingly, and don’t leave your rooster in there for longer than overnight."

      "content": "Bring your rooster inside overnight to avoid disrupting your neighbors. If nothing else works to stop or muffle his crowing, set up a darkened, ventilated coop or cage in an area like your garage, a shed, laundry room, or basement. Ideally, the darkness and quiet will keep your rooster from crowing—but if they do, at least your neighbors won’t give you an earful in the morning."

If you or your neighbors can’t handle the crowing, the most humane option is to find a small farm or fellow chicken owner who will take your rooster off your hands. To find a suitable home: [8] X Research source Look for chicken owner groups on apps like Facebook or Meetup. Even Craigslist may have interested people. Reach out to small farms in your area. Call a nearby feed store to see if they know of any chicken owners or farms that may be interested. Visit local farmer’s markets and ask around to see if anyone needs or wants a rooster."

To check the fit: Insert your pinky finger between the collar and the rooster’s neck. Your pinky finger should slide under the collar’s top and bottom edges without a problem. [14] X Research source Listen to the rooster’s breathing. If he is struggling to get air, loosen the collar. Continue to check on him often. If your rooster is not crowing at all, it probably means the collar is too tight."

      "title": "Roosters crow to protect their flock and assert their dominance.",
      "content": "Roosters crow to protect their flock and assert their dominance. A rooster’s main duty is protection, and he crows to communicate important information to his hens. He may crow when danger is lurking nearby, or again once the danger has passed to signal that it’s safe for the rest of the flock to come out of the coop. If there are multiple roosters in a flock, then the crowing may also be to assert dominance over the other males. [19] X Research source Some other reasons your rooster might crow include changes in the environment (like sunrise), to lead the flock to forage, or to establish territorial boundaries. Doss clarifies that a lack of crowing doesn’t always mean a lack of danger: “If they're not crowing, then there could be predators or something stressing them out to not crow.” Do roosters only crow in the morning? No—roosters can crow anytime during the day or night! Their earliest crows of the day usually start before sunrise (when we’re sleeping and sensitive to noise disruptions), which might be why we always associate them with the crack of dawn. How loud is a rooster’s crow? An average rooster crow is 80 to 90 decibels (for reference, a chainsaw is around 120 decibels). When roosters throw their head back to crow, their ear canals close slightly, protecting them from the loud noise. [20] X Research source"
