[1] X Expert Source Lorenzo Garriga Native French Speaker Expert Interview. 9 July 2019. Although many French speakers understand the 12-hour clock, the time on digital clocks, timetables, and schedules will always be in 24-hour time. If you're rusty on your numbers, here they are so you can brush up: [2] X Research source 1-12: une, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf, dix, onze, douze 13-24: treize, quatorze, quinze, seize, dix-sept, dix-huit, dix-neuf, vingt, vingt et un, vingt-deux, vingt-trois, vingt-quatre"

Just say \"heure\" if it's one o'clock, but for any other time, use the plural \"heures.\" Although both words usually sound the same, the \"s\" at the end of the plural makes a \"zh\" sound if the word following it starts with a vowel. [3] X Research source For example, if someone asks you what time it is, you might reply \"Il est cinq heures.\" The word \"heures\" literally translates to \"hours,\" but when telling time, it takes the place of \"o'clock.\" So in the previous example, you're literally saying \"It is five o'clock.\" [4] X Research source"

Also, since the French use the 24-hour clock, midnight is technically the zero hour. Always say \"midi\" for noon and \"minuit\" for midnight, even when you're adding minutes after the hours. However, don't include the word \"heures.\" [5] X Research source For example, if someone asked you at exactly noon what time it was, you would say \"il est midi.\""

Even though the 24-hour clock is the official clock used in France, you might have occasions when you want to tell someone the time using the 12-hour clock. If someone asks you what time it is right now, whether it's morning or evening will be understood. However, if you're indicating the time of something to occur in the future, you might add the following phrases: [6] X Research source \"Du matin\" (before noon): \"Il est neuf heures et demie du matin.\" (It is 9:30 a.m.) \"De l'après-midi (from noon until about 6:00 p.m.): \"Il est cinq heures de l'après-midi.\" (It's 5:00 in the afternoon.) \"Du soir\" (from 6:00 p.m. until midnight): \"Il est huit heures dix du soir.\" (It's 8:10 p.m.)"

Use it to add some character to your speech when you're telling someone the time, or if you want to express more adamantly when something starts. [7] X Research source For example, you might say \"il est neuf heures pile\" (it's 9 o'clock on the dot) or \"le cours commence à dix heures pile\" (the class starts at 10 o'clock sharp)."

The rest follow the same formula — add the word for the single unit onto the word for the tens unit. [8] X Research source For example, if you want to say it's 9:52, use the word for 50 (cinquante) plus the word for 2 (deux) and say \"il est neuf heures cinquante-deux.\" You can give approximate times in French just as you would in English, so it's no big deal if you forget a number word. If it's 9:52, you could either say \"il est environ dix heures\" or \"Il est presque dix heures.\" (it's almost 10 o´clock) [9] X Research source"

In French, you do this by adding the word \"et\" in front of the fraction word (\"quart\" for quarter, \"demie\" for half). [11] X Research source For example, if it's 11:30, you would say \"Il est onze heures et demie.\" The official grammar rule is that you only use these shorthand fraction words until noon. At 1 p.m. or 13h00, when you roll into the 24-hour clock, you use the number words \"quinze\" (15) and \"trente\" (30). However, native French speakers often use these words at any time.

      "content": "Subtract minutes after \"demie\" with \"moins.\" Once it's half-past, the French commonly subtract minutes from the hour it will be rather than adding minutes to the current hour, just as in English you might say it's \"10 to 9.\" After the word \"heures,\" say \"moins\" followed by the number of minutes. [13] X Research source This is particularly helpful if you're just learning French and have a hard time remembering all the number words. For example, if it's 8:50, you could say \"il est neuf heures moins dix\" instead of \"il est huit heures cinquante.\" If you want to say it's a quarter till, or 45 minutes past the hour, you can also use \"moins le quart.\" Since you're subtracting, remember to go up an hour. For example, 9:45 would be \"dix heures moins le quart\" or \"neuf heures quarante-cinq.\" As with \"quart\" and \"demie,\" the official grammar rule is that you don't use this phrase after noon with the 24-hour clock.

If someone tells you the time when you ask, you can simply say \"merci\" and be on your way, but you might want to comment on the time in some way. The following words and phrases help you put the time in context: [17] X Research source \"Tôt\" (TOH) means \"early.\" For example, you might say \"Il est cinq heures ? Je me suis réveillé très tôt, ce matin!\" (It's 5 a.m.? I woke up very early this morning!) \"En avance\" (AHN AHVAHNS) also means \"early,\" but more in the sense of being too early for something, or something happening too soon. For example, you might say \"Je ne suis jamais en avance à l'école\" (I am never early to school.) \"Tard\" (TAHR) means \"late.\" For example, you might say \"Il est vingt-trois heures ? Il est tard, je vais dormir.\" (It's 11:00 p.m.? It's late, I'm going to bed.) \"En retard\" (AHN REH-TAHR) means \"running late.\" For example, you might say \"J'étais en retard pour notre rendez-vous.\" (I was running late for our date.)"
