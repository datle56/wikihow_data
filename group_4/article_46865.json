Anaphylaxis can occur when a person is accidentally exposed to a known allergen, but it also can occur when a person is exposed to an allergen for the first time. It is also possible to become sensitized to an allergen, that is, to develop allergies to things that previously did not cause a reaction. In some cases the reaction can be so severe it can be life threatening. Look for the following symptoms: [2] X Research source Flushing of the skin Rash on the body Swelling of the throat and mouth Difficulty swallowing and speaking Severe asthma Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Drop in blood pressure Collapse and unconsciousness Confusion, dizziness or an \"impending sense of doom\""

      "content": "Ask the person if they need help to use their EpiPen. Anaphylaxis is considered a 'treat first' emergency. If the person knows they need an injection and can inject themselves, ensure they do so before calling emergency services. If they need you to inject them, the instructions for the EpiPen are printed on the side of the device."

The EpiPen will only last for as long as it takes emergency services to reach you. Always have your country's emergency number on your phone. In the U.S. and Canada, the emergency number is 911. In the UK, 999 is the main emergency number. In Australia, dial Triple Zero (000). [3] X Research source Tell the operator your location before anything else, so help can be sent immediately. Describe the condition and the emergency to the operator."

People suffering from severe allergies usually carry those in case of an accident. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source These necklaces and bracelets detail the condition and give additional information on health. They usually bear a Red Cross sign or other easily recognizable visual clues. If you suffer from severe allergies, always carry the instructions with the EpiPen. That way, if you are incapacitated and someone else has to administer it, they'll know what to do. Don’t give the EpiPen to someone suffering from a heart condition unless they have their own based on a doctor's prescription. [5] X Research source"

An EpiPen is a single-use device; once it is triggered it cannot be re-used. Avoid placing your finger over either end to avoid accidentally triggering the device.

Once you have administered or received the EpiPen, you should be seen by a doctor without delay. The second episode might be mild or severe. If not treated, it can lead to a fatality. The second crisis happens when patients seem to have recovered. It’s important to go to the hospital even if you feel fine."

If it looks cloudy or otherwise discolored, then that EpiPen has lost potency due to exposure to extreme temperatures.This can occur anytime before the expiration date. Depending on the temperature exposure and duration it may have lost significant or all of its potency. You can use it in an absolute emergency, but you should replace it as soon as possible."

Degraded epinephrine loses potency but does not transform into a harmful compound. It’s always better than nothing. Once an EpiPen has been used, it should be discarded safely. To do so, bring it to the pharmacy."
