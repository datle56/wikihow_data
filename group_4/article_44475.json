      "content": "Ask your optometrist about dye tinted contact lenses. There are many contact lenses on the market for people with color blindness. These products use a non-toxic dye to absorb wavelengths of light in the optical spectrum that can hinder color differentiation. Ask your eye doctor if these contact lenses would be right for your type of color blindness. [2] X Research source Dye tinted contacts may be more effective for people with red-green colour vision deficiency than other types of colorblindness."

      "content": "Use a Seekey tool to distinguish colors if you are red-green color blind. Seekey is a simple tool for those with red-green colour vision deficiency, the most common form of color blindness. It has red and green plastic filters that allow you to alter how you perceive colors. Keep this tool with you to use in situations when you have difficulty telling colors apart.

      "content": "Download a color blindness app for your mobile device. Mobile technology has allowed for the creation of apps that help color blind people distinguish colors more clearly. Many \"augmented reality\" apps use your phone's camera to adjust colors in a way that makes them more distinguishable. Download one of these programs from the app store for your Apple or Android device. [6] X Research source For instance, download ColorBlindness SimulateCorrect, an app for both iPhones and Androids that adjust colors through your phone camera to compensate for colorblindness."

      "content": "Purchase a software to identify colors on your computer screen for you. Some software programs designed for color blind persons will give you the name of the color at the tip of the cursor when you point to it on screen.

      "content": "Use density and temperature as guides when buying and cooking food. Preparing food without distinguishing colors can be difficult, from selecting ripe produce to cooking meat all the way through. Learn to choose ripe fruits and vegetables when grocery shopping by squeezing them rather than inspecting them visually. Use a digital meat thermometer when cooking to make sure that food, particularly meat, is cooked through. [9] X Research source For instance, avocados should feel slightly soft to the touch when they are ripe, while celery should feel firm.

      "content": "Identify traffic lights by their position when driving. As a general rule, red lights are usually located on the top of vertical traffic lights, with the yellow light underneath and the green light at the bottom. When learning to drive with colorblindness, pay close attention to what lights up and be very vigilant about the traffic and pedestrians around you. On vertical traffic lights, note that the red light is usually positioned on the left and the green is usually on the right."

      "content": "Label or sort your clothing by color to make sure your outfits match. Colorblindness can make choosing clothing difficult. Have a friend or loved one help you identify the color of different items of clothing in your wardrobe. Mark the colors on the tag of each item or sort the clothing in your closet by color to make things easy. Try to identify your clothing through tactile clues such as the feel of the fabric, the cut of the garment, or by accessories like buttons, zippers, or decorative stitching. Have friends or loved ones help you put together full outfits and hang them together in your closet."
