In Britain, about seven in ten people have it, but only one in five are aware of it. This is because some people carry the infection, but don’t have any symptoms."

After your first outbreak has passed, you'll be able to predict when cold sores are going to appear by looking for early indicators. The area where the sore will appear will suddenly feel tingly and itchy. You may also experience some numbness in the area. [2] X Research source This stage, also called the prodromal stage, is experienced by 46% to 60% of people who have cold sores. [3] X Research source Other early symptoms include inflammation, redness, hypersensitivity or soreness in the exact area the blisters will appear."

      "content": "Watch for the first redness and swelling. When a cold sore is first appearing, it can look like the start of a pimple. It will be sore — possibly painful. This area will be red and raised; the skin surrounding the raised area will also be red. You may also notice several small blisters that develop together, then merge as other blisters fill in the area between them. Cold sores can vary in size, ranging from 2 – 3 mm to 7 mm."

      "content": "Be aware that the blister is filled with virus particles. The raised areas take on the appearance of a blister. As the body fights the HSV-1 virus, white blood cells rush to the area and the blister fills with clear fluid containing the virus.

In this final healing stage when the scab falls off, the skin beneath it will be dry and a little flaky. The area may also be a little swollen and red. [8] X Research source From the start of tingling and itching until the scab comes off can take between 8 and 12 days. Be careful not to share glasses or utensils with anybody until the cold sore has healed completely. Do not kiss anyone or place your cold sores into contact with others in any way. Keep your hands off your face as best you can, as infectious fluid can be transferred to you skin. This, in turn, can spread infection to others, or spread it to other parts of your own body."

      "content": "Distinguish a cold sore from similar blemishes. Canker sores and mucositis can be mistaken for cold sores, but aren't caused by the herpes virus. Canker sores appear inside the mouth, often near where the cheeks/lips meet the gums. People who wear braces can get them where the braces rub against the cheeks. Doctors believe they can have many causes: injury, certain toothpastes, food sensitivities, stress, allergies, and inflammatory or immune disorders. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Mucositis is the term used to describe the sores that appear in the mouth and esophagus during chemotherapy. Chemotherapy kills rapidly dividing cancer cells. But it can't distinguish cancer from the cells in the mouth, which also divide rapidly. The resulting open sores are extremely painful.

Herpes simplex viruses need an amino acid called \"arginine\" to multiply or grow. \"Lysine\" is an amino acid that counteracts the reproductive effects of arginine. Lysine is available both as a topical product (ointments) and as an oral supplement (pills). [18] X Research source Use these products daily while you have an outbreak. You can also make your own topical lysine application at home. Crush a lysine pill and mix it with a small amount of coconut oil. Apply the paste directly to the blister.
