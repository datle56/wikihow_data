      "content": "Take your cat to the vet to be tested and treated for parvo. At the first sign of any common symptoms of distemper in your cat , take them to the vet immediately for parvovirus testing, instructs veterinary doctor Ray Spragley. There is no at-home or homeopathic treatment for feline parvo —you must immediately take your cat to the veterinarian if you suspect they have the virus. Discuss your cat’s symptoms with the vet, who will determine whether or not your cat has feline parvovirus and treat it accordingly. Typically, treatments for parvo include vet-administered IV fluids, nutritional support, and medication to control symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. However, keep in mind that feline panleukopenia is a viral infection without any “cure.” It’s mostly up to the cat’s immune system to fight off the virus, and all of the treatment involved in feline parvovirus is meant to support the cat’s immune system to help it mount a defense. If the vet determines that your cat does not have parvovirus, they may run tests to rule out other causes of symptoms like a high fever (which may be caused by FIP or a bacterial infection) and diarrhea (which may be caused by a bowel obstruction)."

      "content": "Approve vet-advised treatments like IV fluids, transfusions, and caloric support. If your cat is already very sick, the vet may need to give it emergency treatment in order to save its life. With feline distemper, potential emergency treatments include the use of intravenous fluids, caloric support, and plasma or blood transfusions. However, follow your doctor’s advice—if they recommend another treatment, allow them to administer it. Aggressive intravenous fluids can help to counteract any dehydration that your cat is experiencing. Because parvovirus can cause such extreme sickness and diarrhea, your cat may also become depleted in vital electrolytes, minerals, and glucose that can be restored via intravenous fluids. Caloric or nutritional support may help to restore the nutrients that your cat has lost as a result of vomiting up their food or losing their appetite all together. Your vet may offer a nutritional supplement like Nutri-Cal or Ready Cal , or they might use trickle feeding to administer food to your cat via an intravenous line. [1] X Research source In some cases, a cat may develop anemia or protein loss as a result of the virus. These cats may require a plasma or blood transfusion , as recommended by a veterinarian.

      "content": "Administer antiemetics, B vitamins, or any other medications prescribed by your vet. There are a variety of treatments that your veterinarian may recommend for your cat—since there is no direct cure for feline distemper, all of these treatments are based on supportive care to support your cat’s immune system while it fights off the infection. Generally, your cat will be given some type of medication to control or soothe their symptoms and support their immune system, often including antiemetics or B vitamins. Antiemetics can help to make your cat more comfortable and reduce their nausea and vomiting. Common medication names for antiemetics include metoclopramide and maropitant. [3] X Research source B vitamins , which are typically administered intravenously by the vet, help to promote good bowel health and can aid recovery in cats with distemper. If you are administering the medication to your cat yourself, follow the dosage instructions to know how often to give your cat their medicine. Follow through with any medication your vet gave you. If they gave your cat a two-week course of medication, keep administering it for the full two weeks, even if your cat’s symptoms are improving."

      "content": "Consider experimental treatments, with the input of a licensed veterinarian. Some experimental treatments for feline panleukopenia do exist, but they haven’t been licensed for this use in cats. If you’re curious, ask your vet about Virbagen Omega interferon, a medication used to treat distemper in dogs by strengthening their immune system to fight the infection. [4] X Research source If your vet approves your use of this medication, it may be worth a shot!"

      "content": "Provide aftercare at home, which includes a heated bed and a bland diet. Cats with parvovirus must be nursed at home after visiting the vet, which is the best way that you can aid their recovery and make them feel as comfortable as possible. Keep your cat warm on a heating pad, since ill animals are prone to losing heat and developing hypothermia. [5] X Research source Turn your cat every half hour to change the side that it’s lying on, which reduces the risk of blood pooling on one side of the body and leading to pneumonia. Once your cat has passed the acute phase of the illness and can eat again (check with your vet if you’re not sure!), reintroduce them to bland food. Ask your vet for the best choice for your cat, but some popular prescription diets designed for gastroenteritis include Hills ID and Purina EN . You could also feed your cat white meat and cooked white rice. [6] X Research source Feed your cat small amounts frequently throughout the day until they’ve been producing a formed stool for 3-4 days, at which point a slow transition back into regular food can start. Parvovirus is a very serious infection that requires a strong immune system to eliminate. Do everything you can to care for your cat and make them as comfortable and pain-free as possible."

      "content": "Keep an eye out for a high fever and watery nasal discharge. A fever is generally the first symptom to develop after parvovirus completes its incubation period (approximately 4-5 days after contact with the virus). [7] X Research source The fever sometimes comes on so suddenly that owners suspect that their feline has been poisoned. You may also notice other symptoms we associate with the common cold, like a runny nose or watery nasal discharge coming from your cat’s nose. If you notice these signs, visit a vet as soon as possible. [8] X Research source To check your cat’s temperature , use a mercury-free digital thermometer in their ear or a pediatric rectal thermometer . If your cat’s temperature is outside the range of 100 to 102.5 °F (37.8 to 39.2 °C), take them to the vet immediately. [9] X Research source Adult cats with strong immune systems or vaccinations may come into contact with the virus but not actually become ill."

[10] X Research source While perfectly healthy cats definitely will vomit or go diarrhea from time to time, look for frothing around the mouth in conjunction with the vomiting, as well as blood in your cat’s stool. You may also notice your cat losing an immense amount of weight, another key sign of feline distemper, as a result of the frequent vomiting and appetite loss. [11] X Research source Diarrhea and vomiting can be serious, not only because they indicate distemper, but also because these symptoms can quickly lead to dehydration and other health issues like anemia . If your cat vomits on a regular basis, for example, due to hairballs, you will have to judge whether the vomiting your cat is doing is out of character or in line with its normal behavior."

      "content": "Look for behavioral signs like a loss of appetite, weakness, or lethargy. Sometimes, pain or physical distress can manifest as behavioral issues. In the case of feline panleukopenia, cats will often feel extremely ill and appear miserable, depressed, or even weak. They’ll often be less energetic than usual and have no interest in play, treats, or food. [12] X Research source If you notice these behaviors in your cat, you should consult a vet about possible illnesses, including distemper."

      "title": "Look for signs of secondary infections, like severe gastrointestinal distress.",
      "content": "Look for signs of secondary infections, like severe gastrointestinal distress. Because parvovirus attacks an infected cat’s intestines and bone marrow, it can weaken their immune system and give them a greater risk of developing secondary infections like pneumonia. The most common sign that your cat may have a secondary infection is increased gastrointestinal distress, including bloody diarrhea and vomiting. [13] X Research source If you notice worsening or new symptoms in your cat, take them to the vet immediately. Follow whatever treatment advice your vet recommends for secondary infections. Depending on the infection, vets may advise antibiotics, which are usually administered by injection since the parvo illness compromises the cat’s gut. [14] X Research source The secondary infections that often follow parvovirus are part of the reason that this feline disease is so dangerous for cats, along with effects on their body like dehydration, organ failure, and blood loss."

      "content": "Be especially vigilant about symptoms in kittens and more vulnerable cats. Kittens are generally the most at risk for contracting feline distemper because they have immature or weak immune systems and may not have been vaccinated. At 3-5 months old, a kitten likely hasn’t had their feline panleukopenia vaccine, so they’re both more likely to contract the disease and develop a serious infection. [15] X Research source If you have a kitten, be especially mindful of checking for symptoms and calling the vet whenever you have a suspicion—even if it’s nothing, it’s better to be safe than sorry!"

      "content": "Stool and blood tests are usually used to diagnose feline distemper. Parvovirus in cats can be tricky to diagnose since the symptoms are numerous and vary wildly in severity. The symptoms are also very similar to other infections, like salmonella, campylobacter, FIV, FeLV, and pancreatitis. However, most vets will order a stool and blood test to attempt to diagnose the disease. [16] X Research source If a cat is infected with parvo, lab technicians may be able to identify the virus in the feline’s excrement or see a reduced amount of all cell types in their blood, which is indicative of feline panleukopenia. A veterinarian may also look at a cat’s exposure history and vaccination status before diagnosis—if a cat hasn’t been vaccinated against parvo, it’s much more likely that they will or have contracted it."

      "content": "Adult cats with parvo have a 10–20% mortality rate if treated by a vet. Meanwhile, adult cats who have distemper but are not treated have an 85% mortality rate—meaning that, statistically, 85% of adult cats who contract parvo but aren’t treated by a vet will not survive the disease. Kittens are even more vulnerable, with kittens that are more than two months old having a 60-70% mortality rate with treatment and a nearly 100% mortality rate if not treated. [17] X Research source In summation, adult cats often have a better chance of surviving parvovirus than kittens, as do cats who receive veterinary care versus those who do not. Parvovirus is a serious and often fatal disease in felines, but vaccination has helped to reduce the number of cats that pass from this illness—however, vaccines are a prevention tactic, not a treatment, so they will not help a cat who’s already contracted parvo.

Whether you have a kitten or have adopted a stray cat, take them to the vet to be vaccinated as soon as possible (for kittens, this is when they’re about 6-8 weeks old). Vaccinating your pet is the most effective way to prevent them from getting distemper, which could potentially save their life, adds expert animal trainer Cameron Thompsen. The vaccine is administered in two doses, three to four weeks apart. Thereafter, cats require a booster after twelve months, and then a vaccination every third year to extend the protection.

      "content": "Keep young kittens isolated until they’ve been vaccinated. Some kittens are born with antibodies received from their mothers, but these antibodies alone will not definitively keep the distemper virus at bay. Since kittens can’t start their distemper vaccinations until they’re around 6-8 weeks old, keep them away from other cats (except for their littermates and mother) until their vaccination is complete. [20] X Research source If a kitten contracts parvo, it can lead to a much more serious and likely fatal infection, so it’s crucial to do everything possible to prevent a kitten from coming in contact with the disease."

If you have multiple cats in your house, it is most likely that they are all infected if one is infected. However, it's still important to isolate the infected cat completely if by chance your other cats are not infected. [23] X Research source Recovered cats can carry on excreting the virus in their feces for six weeks (or longer) after their recovery, providing yet more sources of infection for other cats.

Parvovirus, which is also known as distemper and feline panleukopenia, is mainly passed through excrement and other bodily secretions, like cat pee and nasal discharge. When one cat is infected, their secretions and feces may contaminate a pet owner’s hands and clothing, as well as cat cages, bedding, and dishes. Then, a healthy cat will come into contact with these infected items and contract the disease themselves. [25] X Research source Occasionally, fleas from infected cats may also infect other cats, or cat-to-cat passage may happen, but this event usually only happens in places where many cats live together, like multi-cat households, animal shelters, and pet shops.
