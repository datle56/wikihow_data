You get calories from everything you eat, but the amount of calories you consume impacts your weight. If you get too many calories, your body will convert leftover energy to fat. If you eat too few, you won’t build muscle. Aim to hit your caloric target every day to lose weight while building muscle.

On days when you’re working out, it’s okay if you go a little overboard with the proteins. The protein will help your muscles rebuild and give you an energy boost while you’re lifting.

You can do 10-20 reps if you’re doing these in a rotation with other exercises, or complete them until failure, meaning that you get so tired you can’t complete any more reps.

Once you’ve mastered this movement, you can try a more advanced exercise for building your shoulders like doing a pull-up or chin-up.
