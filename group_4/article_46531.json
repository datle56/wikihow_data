      "title": "Measure and mark the cut you want to make on the material.",
      "content": "Measure and mark the cut you want to make on the material. Use a straight edge or ruler and a pencil or marker to draw a straight line along each area you want to cut. These lines will help you guide the blade while it’s in operation, so make sure they’re bold enough to be plainly seen. [1] X Research source Rip cuts are cuts that go along the grain (usually along the longest dimension of the material), while cross cuts go against the grain (along the shorter dimension). Circular saws are most often used to make straight cuts along a piece of dimensional lumber, plywood, OSB, sheet metal, or other sheet materials. Circular saws can also be used for wavy or curvy cuts, however, for super complex cuts, it may be better to try out a miter saw or use a jigsaw ."

      "content": "Clamp your material to a saw table or between two sawhorses . If you’re using sawhorses, space them so that the distance between them is slightly smaller than the size of your material. If you’re using a table, position the material so the area you’re cutting off is hanging off one edge. [2] X Research source Make sure the material is properly supported and free of obstructions underneath. If you don’t have sawhorses or a saw table, use a strong, stable surface you don’t mind getting nicked or elevate the material with a few spare pieces of wood. Try to avoid cutting your material directly on top of concrete or other hard surfaces—this can cause severe damage to both your work surface and the blade of your circular saw."

      "title": "Loosen the knob in the back to adjust the depth of the blade.",
      "content": "Loosen the knob in the back to adjust the depth of the blade. Position your saw on top of the material so the saw blade hangs off one edge. Adjust the knob in the back until the ends of three teeth poke out below the material. Try not to extend your blade more than 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) past the bottom of the material. [3] X Research source Setting the blade too deep will increase the saw’s friction, which can be dangerous, wear down the teeth, and leave imperfections in the material. If you’re sawing a piece of lumber that’s 1 in (2.5 cm) thick, for example, you’d set your blade no deeper than 1.25 in (3.2 cm)."

    {
      "title": "Adjust the bevel angle knob for angled cuts (if needed).",
      "content": "Adjust the bevel angle knob for angled cuts (if needed). Twist the small knob on the back end of the saw counterclockwise to unlock it. Slide the knob to one of the angle presets on the frame to make custom angled (beveled) cuts. Once you’re satisfied with the angle, turn the clockwise to lock it in place. [4] X Research source Make sure the locking knob is secure before you activate the saw. Otherwise, the scale may move when the blade makes contact with your material. Changing the angle of the blade will allow you to make beveled cuts along squared edges or get just the right contouring on oddly-shaped pieces. If you don't need an angled or beveled cut, adjust the blade so it's perpendicular to your material and lock it in place."

      "title": "Position the line on the baseplate labeled \"0\" over your cut line.",
      "content": "Position the line on the baseplate labeled \"0\" over your cut line. On the front edge of the baseplate you'll see a small notch with a bold line on either side. The line on the left hand side of this notch is labeled \"0.\" [5] X Research source It corresponds to the position of the blade when it's set to 90 degrees, and is used any time you’re making a normal cut. The line labeled \"45\" on the right hand side of the notch is for making beveled cuts at a precise 45-degree angle."

      "title": "Activate the saw blade by pulling the trigger on the rear handle.",
      "content": "Activate the saw blade by pulling the trigger on the rear handle. On some models, there may be an additional safety trigger near the top of the saw that you’ll need to flip with your thumb so the saw starts up when you pull the trigger. Once you engage the trigger, the blade will begin spinning. Wait until it gets up to full speed to begin cutting. [6] X Research source If you’re right-handed, grip the rear handle with your right hand and place your left hand on the front handle for additional stability. If you’re left-handed, reverse this orientation. Double-check your measurements and make sure the baseplate is properly aligned before you begin cutting."

    {
      "title": "Push the saw slowly and smoothly along the surface of the material.",
      "content": "Push the saw slowly and smoothly along the surface of the material. Push the circular saw through the cut at a steady, even pace. Use both hands to maneuver the saw straight down the cut line. Make sure the “0” baseplate notch stays aligned with your cut line the entire time. If it feels like you need to force the blade forward to get it to cut, your blade is probably dull and needs to be replaced. The blade guard will retract as you move the saw forward and lower when you lift it off of your work surface. You can also pull the lever on it to move the guard out of the way when making angled or irregular cuts. Attempting to move the saw too quickly can increase the likelihood of mistakes or cause the blade to become jammed with debris."

      "title": "Release the trigger to stop the blade after each cut.",
      "content": "Release the trigger to stop the blade after each cut. Once you've completed your cut, let go of the trigger and wait for the blade to come to a complete stop. To prevent potential mishaps, keep your finger off of the trigger while you review your work or line up your next cut. [7] X Research source Try to avoid putting your finger on the trigger unless you're preparing to make a cut—you may activate the saw accidentally."

      "content": "Mark both edges of the notch on the material and set the blade depth. Use whatever object you’re fitting in the notch as a guide for your measurements. Place the object against the material and mark both sides with a pencil or marker. Measure the depth of the object and set your sawblade accordingly. [8] X Research source Make sure to clamp your material to a sawhorse or work table before you start sawing. To set the depth of the blade, loosen or tighten the small knob located near the back of the motor. If you’re fitting the notched material into another object, measure the length, width, and height of the object with a ruler or tape measure and mark it onto the material with a pencil or marker."

      "content": "Most circular saws have similar parts, but may be laid out differently. Circular saws are some of the most popular power tools for DIYers and professionals alike. Before you try to cut anything, familiarize yourself with what each part of your circular saw does. [13] X Research source Handles: Hold the large handle and squeeze the trigger to turn on the blade. If your saw comes with a second handle, place your non-dominant hand on it. Safety or trigger lock switch: This is on the handle, and prevents the saw from turning on if the trigger is squeezed. Press it with your thumb and squeeze the trigger to turn on the motor. Blade guard: This retractable plastic cover protects you from the blade. When the saw is pushed forward from the edge of the material, the guard lifts so the blade can cut. Shoe or baseplate: This is the metal base that rests on the material. They usually have measurements on the side and a notch on the front to indicate the position of the blade. Bevel adjustment knob: This is the small knob or lever in a metal slide with numbers etched onto it. Twist and slide the knob up to angle your saw up to 50 degrees (some go up to 90 degrees). Depth adjustment knob: This is the knob usually located next to the bevel adjustment knob. Loosen or tighten this knob to set how deep the blade goes into your material. Electrical cord or battery: If you have a corded saw, there will be a cord connected to the motor. If your saw is cordless, there will be a battery by the motor instead."

Circular saws send debris flying that can injure your eyes. In addition, wear snug-fitting clothing and tie back long hair to prevent anything from getting caught in the moving saw blade. If you’re going to be sawing for an extended period of time, consider grabbing some earmuffs as well. If you have sensitive airways, strap on a dust mask or respirator to avoid inhaling sawdust.

      "content": "Make sure the area is clear and hold the saw until it stops spinning. Before using the circular saw, ensure that there are no cords, tools, or other items on top or beneath the material that the blade can make contact with. When you’re finished making a cut, hold the saw up away from the material and wait until the blade stops spinning before putting it down. [16] X Research source Before making a cut, hold the trigger down to ensure that it reaches full power before pushing the saw forward through the material. Secure one side of the material you’re cutting to your table or sawhorse with clamps. Try to avoid clamping both sides—this can pinch the blade and cause the saw to kick back. [17] X Research source Keep both hands on the saw at all times if the saw is two-handed. If it isn’t, place your other hand safely out of the way."

      "content": "Unplug the saw whenever you’re done using it. Confirm that the blade guard is in the down position, covering the blade. When you need to make an adjustment, change the blade, or when you’re done with the job, remove the plug from the wall outlet. [18] X Research source To store your saw, wrap the cord around the handle, and put the saw away until the next time you need it. Some circular saws come with a case. If yours doesn’t, find a dry, clean area to store it in. Place it on a stable surface on its side with the blade facing away from nearby objects. If you have small children at home, make sure your saw is locked up, out of reach, or otherwise inaccessible."

      "title": "Inspect the saw before you cut with it.",
      "content": "Inspect the saw before you cut with it. Inspect the blade to make sure it rotates correctly and that it’s sharp. Sharp blades work better than dull blades, and are safer. Remove off any sawdust from the air vents with a vacuum or brush and check that the housing cord, trigger, blade guard, and shoe are in good condition. [19] X Research source Try to avoid removing the blade guard. If the guard makes it difficult to make a certain cut, lift the guard’s handle with one hand before starting the blade, then let it go when you’re done."

      "content": "Press the button between the handle and blade and rotate the blade. This is the arbor-lock button, and it locks the saw blade into place inside the circular saw while you’re using it. Usually, this small button is near the top of the saw between the top handle and the upper blade guard. Hold it down as you gently turn the blade until the locking mechanism engages. [20] X Research source If your saw plugs into the wall, make sure it’s unplugged before attempting to change the blade."

      "title": "Use the wrench provided with your saw to loosen the blade’s nut.",
      "content": "Use the wrench provided with your saw to loosen the blade’s nut. Circular saws come with a special wrench or tool you can use to loosen the arbor nut in the center of the blade so you can pull it out. Turn the wrench in the same direction that the blade turns in to unscrew and remove the nut. [21] X Research source If you don’t have a tool to remove the blade, use an adjustable wrench or a socket wrench. You can also order a new one from the circular saw’s manufacturer. The arbor mounts the blade onto the saw. The motor inside the saw causes the arbor to rotate, allowing the blade to spin safely."

      "content": "Remove the old blade, attach the new one, and screw on the nut. Pull the upper blade guard’s lever. Carefully pry the blade off the arbor and remove it. Lift the lever up and slide the new blade onto the arbor, making sure the end of the saw’s teeth face the direction that the saw rotates in. Use the blade wrench to attach and tighten the arbor nut. [22] X Research source Circular saws usually have an arrow on the saw’s blade guard that tells you which direction it spins. If your saw has a diamond-shaped arbor that comes out with the blade, place the blade in between two wood blocks and use a hammer to gently tap it out of the center. Old saw blades can usually be disposed of at a metal recycling center or scrap yard, but some local governments have their own programs. Check what’s available in your area.

      "content": "Sidewinder circular saw Sidewinder saws have their motors mounted in-line with the blade. They’re more compact and lightweight than worm drive saws, and their blades tend to spin faster (usually at 6,000 RPM or higher). This makes them great for cross cutting and unusual cuts. [24] X Research source Sidewinder saws usually cost around $50 to $200, which makes them a popular choice for home DIYers. [25] X Research source All of these saws have corded and cordless battery powered versions, but sidewinder saws are more commonly cordless."

      "title": "Worm drive circular saw",
      "content": "Worm drive circular saw Worm drive saws are versatile but might be a bit intimidating for beginners. These saws have their motors sitting in-line with the handle and come with a narrow shoe or base, making it easier to cut in small spaces. They also have larger teeth, more power, and more durability than sidewinder saws, increasing its torque. [26] X Research source However, because they’re heavier than sidewinder saws and usually require more maintenance, worm drive saws tend to be more popular with construction professionals. Worm drive saws also tend to be a little more expensive, costing between $150 to $400."
