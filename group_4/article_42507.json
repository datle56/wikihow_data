      "title": "Try buccal testosterone.",
      "content": "Try buccal testosterone. Buccal testosterone is taken orally through a lozenge. The lozenge dissolves in your mouth. It is normally taken twice a day, in the morning and night. This approach is an efficient way to dose testosterone in men. [2] X Research source However, the lozenges have a bitter taste and can cause mouth irritation."

      "title": "Take transdermal testosterone gel.",
      "content": "Take transdermal testosterone gel. Transdermal testosterone gel is a commonly used approach. It is a gel that is applied on the body which mimics a dose that would normally occur. The gel is applied to the shoulders, upper arms, chest, or belly. Make certain you wash your hands after application. The gel is applied once a day at the same time, usually in the morning by about eight a.m. [3] X Research source The cost of the gel can be high. You have to make certain the areas are dry before coming into contact with women (especially if they're pregnant) or children. There is a risk of transferring the testosterone if the gel isn't dry."

      "title": "Consider transdermal testosterone patch.",
      "content": "Consider transdermal testosterone patch. The transdermal testosterone patch is another skin-dosing approach, which mimics a dose that would normally occur. Some of the patches may be applied onto the scrotum, though they may be placed on the arms or back as well. The patch is applied once a day at the same time, usually in the morning by about eight a.m. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When you remove the patch, make certain no one else is exposed to the testosterone. Dispose of the patch immediately. The cost of the transdermal patch is high as well."

      "title": "Talk to your doctor before starting any testosterone replacement therapy.",
      "content": "Talk to your doctor before starting any testosterone replacement therapy. Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is only done under the care of a physician. No matter which method you use, it is important to get regularly checked to make certain enough testosterone is entering your blood to be effective. [5] X Research source Before beginning testosterone therapy, your doctor must perform a digital rectal exam and PSA blood test should be measured. If these are abnormal (suggesting an enlarged prostate), then therapy should not be started and further testing should be done. Three months after starting testosterone, the same tests should be performed. If there is concern for enlarged prostate or prostate nodules at that time, then testosterone should be stopped. The Endocrine Society generally recommends TRT if the tested levels of testosterone are lower than 300 ng/dL and there are symptoms of low testosterone. Testosterone pills are available, but are not useful, as taking plain testosterone by mouth has no effect because the liver metabolizes it too rapidly. Modified forms of testosterone pills were made that prevented the testosterone from being metabolized in the liver, but it was shown that these forms can cause damage to the liver.

      "title": "Do not take testosterone unless it is prescribed by a physician.",
      "content": "Do not take testosterone unless it is prescribed by a physician. Testosterone must be prescribed to you by a licensed physician. This hormone is often abused and can be purchased on the black market, which is extremely dangerous. There is no way to verify the product you receive illegally is safe for you to take, or verify the quality, sterility, and purity of the product."

      "title": "Choose intramuscular testosterone.",
      "content": "Choose intramuscular testosterone. Intramuscular testosterone (IM) is an intramuscular injection. The dose usually varies from 200 to 400 milligrams. It can be given every two, three, or four weeks, usually injected into the thigh muscle. The testosterone seeps out of the injection site into the body. The injections may be given in an office, though self injection is often possible, depending on your physician. This approach usually is the least expensive, though you have to get a shot every few weeks. This method does not mimic a dose that would normally occur in the body. There may be times, like right after injection, when the levels of testosterone are higher than normal, and times between injections when the levels of testosterone are lower than normal. This is called a roller coaster effect."

Testosterone is responsible for the production of male sexual characteristics and functions, including a deep voice, facial hair, and denser bone and muscle mass.

      "content": "Understand why low testosterone levels occur. Low levels of testosterone may represent normal male aging; however, low levels of testosterone are also associated with a number of different health issues in men, as well as an increased risk of death. Testosterone levels vary in different men, so it can be difficult to determine if the levels detected in one man are too low or if they represent a normal decrease with age. [13] X Research source Shores, M. M., Smith, N. L., Forsberg, C. W., Anawalt, B. D., &amp; Matsumoto, A. M. (2012). Testosterone treatment and mortality in men with low testosterone levels. The Journal Of Clinical Endocrinology And Metabolism, 97(6), 2050-2058. It is quite normal for a man's testosterone level to decrease gradually with age. It is also quite normal to have fewer erections as a man ages. It is not normal, however, to be unable to have or sustain an erection, and it is not normal to lose interest in sex. This can be a symptom of many other, more common cases as well, including diabetes and depression."

Smaller testes Emotional problems, such as depression, irritability, anxiety, problems with memory or concentration Sleep disruption Increased fatigue or a general overall lack of energy Body changes, such as increased belly fat, decreased muscle mass, decreased strength and endurance, decreased cholesterol levels, and osteopenia (softening of the bones) and osteoporosis (decreased bone density) Swollen or tender breasts Loss of body hair Hot flashes Women can have low testosterone as well. Symptoms of low testosterone in women include decreased sexual desire and function, muscle weakness, decreased vaginal lubrication, and infertility. [14] X Research source"

Depending on your physical exam, your symptoms, and your history, other tests may be performed as well. These tests check for thyroid function, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.

Because of these potentially serious side effects, your physician will be most likely asking you to come in frequently for checkups. This may be every three to six months. You should also keep track of any changes in your body and report them immediately to your physician. The side effects include: [15] X Research source Increased risk of heart attacks and heart disease Increased risk of strokes and blood clots Increased risk of prostate cancer Sleep apnea Polycythemia, or increased levels of red blood cells — this causes the blood to get thicker and increases the risk of blood clots.
