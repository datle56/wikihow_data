As a result, training your upper body with dumbbells may improve your overall muscle coordination, stabilization, and posture. [31] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Other benefits of training with dumbbells include: Beginner-friendly: Dumbbells have a simple learning curve compared to weight machines and barbells. Identifying strength imbalances: Unlike machines, dumbbells require both sides of your body to work equally. You’ll notice if a muscle on one side is weaker than the other, giving you a chance to strengthen it with one-armed dumbbell exercises. Improved range of motion: Dumbbells allow your joints to move more freely so that your muscles can work through a greater range of motion, improving your overall upper body strength and flexibility. More variety in exercise options: Free weights can be incorporated into practically any movement and can be adjusted by increasing the weight or using only one dumbbell at a time.
