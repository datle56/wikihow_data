      "title": "Check your college's dress code for wearing a dupatta.",
      "content": "Check your college's dress code for wearing a dupatta. Each college will have its own dress code. While some may only request that you wear a dupatta, others may have specific requirements for how you should wear it, such as pinning it a certain way or making sure it is draped across your chest. You should be able to find your school's dress code online or in the student handbook."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drape your dupatta modestly to follow most dress codes.",
      "content": "Drape your dupatta modestly to follow most dress codes. Most dress codes that require a dupatta are wanting students to be modest, so keep that in mind when draping your dupatta. For instance, you may want to cover your chest area with the dupatta after pleating it. [2] X Research source Often, you'll be asked to wear a certain type of clothing underneath, such as a salwar suit. Alternatively, you may be asked to wear long sleeves and pants."

    {
      "title": "Ask an advisor if you're not sure.",
      "content": "Ask an advisor if you're not sure. If the dress code isn't explicit and you're not sure what the college wants, it's best to ask. Talk to a teacher or other advisor, and they should be able to advise you about what you should wear. Your parents or friends may also be able to help."

      "content": "Pleat the dupatta at the shoulders and pin it for a look that stays in place. Find the middle of the dupatta by folding it in half across the long end. Put the middle of the long side in the middle of your chest. Pin the top edge of it on the clothing on your right shoulder with a safety pin and let it drape across your chest. Pin the other side on your left shoulder. [3] X Research source At this point, you should have the long ends down your back and the scarf going over your arms across your front."

    {
      "title": "Fold the ends of the scarf and secure it on your shoulders.",
      "content": "Fold the ends of the scarf and secure it on your shoulders. Once you've pinned the middle of the dupatta, pleat the right side of the scarf by folding it over and over itself in a loose gathering motion. Then, use a safety pin to secure on your right shoulder. Do the same on the other side, leaving it lightly draped down across your chest. [4] X Research source You'll end up with it covering your chest and back but not your arms. You can pin it in the middle of your chest, too, if you'd like."

      "title": "Gather the pleats just on one shoulder for an alternative look.",
      "content": "Gather the pleats just on one shoulder for an alternative look. Make long pleats in the scarf, going lengthwise. Put 1/3 of the scarf over your left shoulder and safety pin the pleats in place. Pull up the top edge on the long side of the scarf over to the other shoulder in a loose drape. Use a safety pin to secure it to that shoulder. [5] X Research source With this look, let it hang loosely over your right arm."

      "content": "Create a dupatta shrug and secure it with a belt for a fashionable, easy style. Fold the dupatta in half along the long side to find the middle, then bring each end to the middle. If you laid it out flat, you'd have a fold on each side and the 2 edges of the fabric meeting in the middle like double doors. Pin the top corners of these edges to the back of the fabric in the very middle to make the shrug. [6] X Research source Put an arm under each flap of fabric and up through the hole you've created at the top. Bring the edges of the fabric around to the front to meet each other, then pull a belt over it to keep it in place. If you prefer, you can simply use a safety pin to hold it together in front for a looser look."

      "content": "Fold one end in pleats and wrap it around your body for another modest approach. Take one of the short ends and make pleats across it; just pleat this end, not the whole dupatta. Put 1/3 of it over your shoulder and then pin it in place. Take the long edge closest to your head and pull it across the front of your body to the hip opposite the shoulder that you pinned. Keep wrapping the whole dupatta around the back and to the front again. [7] X Research source Pin it in place on your other hip at the front."

Wrap it around your waist as many times as it will go and tie it to itself in the front to finish the look. [8] X Research source You can tuck in the ends or leave it out."

Wrap it around the straps and tie it loosely on one end to secure it.
