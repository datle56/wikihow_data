      "content": "A soul tie is an intense, all-encompassing connection between you and another person. While soul ties are primarily emotional or mental, they also have physical and spiritual elements. You might feel as though you and the person are fated to be together, or as though you've known each other your whole lives (even though you just met). [1] X Research source When you have a soul tie with someone, all of your emotions feel stronger than they ever have before—this includes positive and negative emotions. Soul ties can be healthy or unhealthy, depending on the character of the person and your relationship with them. Many Christians believe that toxic or \"ungodly\" soul ties form when you have a relationship with someone that is sinful or violates God's will."

[2] X Research source At the extreme end, a one-sided soul tie could lead to obsessive behavior, like stalking. Be careful if someone seems to have a one-sided soul tie with you.
