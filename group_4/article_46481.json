      "title": "Pay attention in class.",
      "content": "Pay attention in class. Good study habits begin before you even leave the classroom. Listen attentively to what the teacher has to say on the subject. Ask questions, and answer the teacher’s questions. Pay close attention for cues (or direct statements) from the teacher about what is most important to know, and take notes especially on these topics."

      "title": "Utilize all resources made available to you.",
      "content": "Utilize all resources made available to you. Read the assigned chapter in the textbook, and read over any notes, handouts, or other materials given to you. If there is a review or study session offered by the teacher, go to it. Give yourself the best chance for success. You'd be surprised by the number of people who do poorly on tests because they don't read the book."

      "content": "Pick apart the textbook. Don’t just read the assignment mindlessly — actively engage with it. [4] X Expert Source Jai Flicker Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. Pick out the important words (sometimes they’re in bold), look them up if needed, and write your own definition for them. Carefully examine introductions, conclusions, review sections, and recap questions you find in textbook chapters."

    {
      "title": "Put information into your own words.",
      "content": "Put information into your own words. As with writing down your own definitions for key terms in the textbook chapter, it’s best to put all the critical information in your own words. Keep a notebook and pen near you, and write out the key points you are studying. If you have someone else’s notes, rewrite them yourself; it’s even best to rewrite your own classroom notes. This is a proven trick to help your brain engage more in the material."

    {
      "title": "Process, then summarize the information.",
      "content": "Process, then summarize the information. Our brains engage the material we’re studying at multiple levels at once. While we consciously take in and try to comprehend the material we’re studying, unconscious layers of our brain are working behind the scenes to organize and make sense of the material. Stop every so often so that you can take advantage of this behind-the-scenes work you’re doing without realizing it.

You may be amazed at how much of the material you actually recall and understand. You can also try summarizing the entire study session the day after."

    {
      "title": "Put the information into practice.",
      "content": "Put the information into practice. Associate what you’re learning in theory with a more practical or tangible example. If you are studying history, for instance, try to make a story related to the subject. Or visit a museum, battlefield, etc. associated with it. If you’re reading about how to do a simple science experiment, try doing the actual experiment. Create games, songs, images, or other types of mnemonic devices to help you associate and recall the information."

      "title": "Don’t delay in getting started.",
      "content": "Don’t delay in getting started. Start studying as soon as you can after school. The minute you come in the door, get everything together that you need and begin your study session. Not only will the information be fresher in your mind right after school, you’ll also head off potential distractions before they have a chance to affect you."

      "title": "Organize your study space.",
      "content": "Organize your study space. Maybe you think you can study just as well with a messy desk as you can with a neat one. In reality, though, having only the things you need right where you need them eliminates distractions and makes your study time more efficient. Place your pencils, notebook, folders, textbook, calculator, and any other important study materials within easy reach so you don’t lose focus while reaching or looking for them."

      "title": "Eliminate distractions.",
      "content": "Eliminate distractions. Choose a quiet, isolated spot for your study space. Ask not to be disturbed. Play soothing music or put on noise-canceling headphones to block out distracting sounds if necessary. Keep common distractions like cell phones tucked away and/or out of reach, and silenced or shut off."

      "title": "Relax.",
      "content": "Relax. Before you begin studying, and during your study session, take a moment to gather yourself and reduce your stress level. Do some deep breathing exercises, meditate or pray, listen to some soothing music, or do whatever else helps you to relax. Excess stress will cause you to lose focus.

      "content": "Take breaks. [7] X Expert Source Jai Flicker Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. Generally speaking, do not spend more than an hour studying without having a break, because your brain gets tired and can’t give full attention to the subject. Make them quick breaks — just a couple minutes — so that you don’t lose your momentum. Just give yourself enough time to take a drink, stretch out a bit, use the bathroom, do a quick calming exercise, or something similar."

      "content": "Keep your brain active to strengthen it. [8] X Expert Source Jai Flicker Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. The human brain operates by making neural connections. When we put our brains to use regularly, new connections are made and existing ones are strengthened; when we don’t, connections become dormant or decayed. Keeping your brain actively engaged will help it function at its peak now and throughout your life. [9] X Research source Try new things. Create. Debate. Ruminate. Daydream. Keep your brain working and it will work better when you need it for studying."

      "content": "Challenge your mind with puzzles, games, and activities. If you want to build muscle, you have to keep increasing the amount of weight you’re lifting. If you want to build brainpower, you have to keep challenging your mind. While some of the claims made by “brain training” apps and programs are dubious, challenging your mind with puzzles, games, new activities, and difficult subjects can help enhance mental performance.

      "content": "Exercise regularly for body and brain health. Your brain is part of your body, so it makes sense that the healthier you are overall, the healthier your brain will be. Regular exercise creates greater efficiency in oxygen and nutrient supplies to the brain, and can enhance your mood and immune system, among other benefits.

While the popular understanding is that the left side of the human brain controls logical thinking and the right side provides our creativity, the reality is far more complex.
