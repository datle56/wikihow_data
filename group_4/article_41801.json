      "title": "Massage the bottom of your foot while pulling your toes back.",
      "content": "Massage the bottom of your foot while pulling your toes back. Sit down in a comfortable chair and bring one of your feet to your lap. Grab your toes with your nondominant hand and gently pull them toward the top of your foot until you feel tension in your arch. Starting near your heel, lightly rub the bottom of your foot with your dominant hand. Work up toward your toes and apply more pressure as you feel more comfortable. Keep massaging your foot for about 10 seconds before switching feet. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try to massage your arches around 2–4 times daily to help relax your muscles. Avoid lifting your toes so high that the stretch feels painful. You should only feel slight tension in your arch while you’re stretching."

      "title": "Push the ball of your foot against a wall until you feel tension in your arch.",
      "content": "Push the ball of your foot against a wall until you feel tension in your arch. Face a wall, and plant your heel on the ground as close to it as you’re able. Rest your toes against the wall so your foot is at a 45-degree angle. Keep your other foot firmly planted on the ground as you lean your body forward. When you feel tension in your calf and arch, hold your position for about 30 seconds before relaxing. Switch feet to stretch your other arch. [2] X Research source Repeat these stretches 2–3 times daily. This stretch works well if you have frequent pain due to plantar fasciitis. It’s okay to lift the heel on your back foot slightly to help you lean closer to the wall."

      "title": "Kneel down so the balls of your feet stay planted on the floor.",
      "content": "Kneel down so the balls of your feet stay planted on the floor. Crouch on the floor so you’re supporting your weight with the balls of your feet. Keep the backs of your heels pointing up throughout your stretch. Lean forward to place your hands and knees on the floor in front of you without lifting your feet off the ground. Keep your buttocks just above your heels so you feel tension in your arches. Hold the stretch for about 15–30 seconds to help alleviate any foot pain you have. [3] X Research source Stretch your arches like this 2–4 times each day. If it hurts your knees to kneel on a hard floor, try doing your stretches on a yoga mat or carpeting."

      "title": "Stand on the edge of a step and lower your heels.",
      "content": "Stand on the edge of a step and lower your heels. Position yourself so the balls of your feet are on the bottom step and your heels hang over the edge. Hold onto a banister or brace yourself against a wall as you drop your heels below the edge of the step. When you feel slight tension in your arch, hold your position for 15–30 seconds before raising your heels back up. Repeat the stretch 2–4 times for more relieve. [4] X Research source You can practice this stretch as many times throughout the day as you want, or before and after physical activity. Stretching on a step also helps increase the flexibility in your calves. Do this on the bottom step of your set of stairs just in case you lose your balance."

      "title": "Roll a water bottle under the bottom of your foot to massage your arch.",
      "content": "Roll a water bottle under the bottom of your foot to massage your arch. Sit down in a chair and lay a full water bottle on the ground so it’s perpendicular to your foot. Press your foot down on the water bottle and roll your foot back and forth on top of it. Apply light pressure at first and start increasing it as you feel more relief. Continue massaging your foot for 2–5 minutes before switching feet. [5] X Research source You can also use a can or foam roller instead of a water bottle. If you want additional pain relief, try filling the bottle ¾-full and freezing it before you use it for massaging your arches. If the bottle feels too cold, wear socks during the massage."

      "title": "Loop a towel around your foot and pull it toward you.",
      "content": "Loop a towel around your foot and pull it toward you. Roll up a towel lengthwise and hold it by each end. Sit on the floor with your leg stretched straight out in front of you. Put the middle of the towel perpendicular around the ball of your foot and pull the ends toward your body until you feel your arch stretch. Hold the stretch for about 15–30 seconds before relaxing and switching feet. [6] X Research source Repeat your stretch 2–3 times per foot for additional relief. Avoid bending your knee while you’re stretching since it won’t be as effective at relieving pain."

      "title": "Push your big toe against the floor while lifting your other toes.",
      "content": "Push your big toe against the floor while lifting your other toes. Sit down and keep your feet firmly planted on the ground. Press your big toe on the floor and slowly try to raise the other 4 toes on your foot. Keep your toes raised for about 8 seconds before lowering them back on the floor. Do 12–15 reps for each foot to help keep your arches strong. [7] X Research source You can do this exercise barefoot or while wearing shoes, so you’re able to do it while sitting at a desk or when you’re working. It may be easier to complete the stretch if you only do 1 foot (0.30 m) at a time so you’re able to focus on your form."

      "title": "Spread your toes until you feel your arch stretching.",
      "content": "Spread your toes until you feel your arch stretching. Keep your foot pressed flat against the ground so your toes aren’t curled or extended. Try to move your big toe away from your other toes until you feel your arch muscles contracting. Keep your toes spread out for about 8 seconds at a time before relaxing again. Continue doing 25–30 reps per foot. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you have trouble spreading your toes, you can try holding them apart with your fingers. It may be difficult to complete this stretch if you have bunions."

You can perform this stretch while you’re sitting down at a desk or working."

Curl your toes to pinch the towel and scrunch it toward your body. After pulling the towel toward you, push it away with your toes. Do about 10 reps before switching feet.

Curl your toes around a marble to try and pick it up from the ground and drop it into the cup. Try to pick up all of the marbles with one foot before dumping them back on the floor and switching feet. [12] X Research source Use various-sized marbles to add more difficulty to your exercise."
