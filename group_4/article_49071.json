You will perform psychosocial evaluations that document current and past problems a patient has had with mental, family and social issues. This form of social work involves working with patients who have chronic and terminal illnesses and their families.

As a clinical social worker you may work in inpatient or outpatient facilities. You may also have a private practice with clients coming to you directly for therapy instead of through a mental health or substance abuse facility. Employee assistance programs are also an option for you as a clinical social worker. They provide a limited number of counseling services for a company's employees. Social workers are also employed as case workers dealing with child welfare and neglect as well as adoption and foster care.

Because you have a doctorate, you will also be qualified to work in government agencies that research and implement policies that address child welfare, poverty, violence and other issues."
