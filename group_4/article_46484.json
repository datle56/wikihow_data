To be Zipcar eligible, you need to be 21 years or older, have a valid driver’s license and accept Zipcar’s terms and conditions. [1] X Research source If you are 18-20 years old and a student at a college or university, you are also eligible to join Zipcar. If you do not have a US or Ontario based driver’s license, you must complete a “declarations form.” This form can be found on the Zipcar website and is used to certify that your license is valid and that you don't have any major driving violations. If you live in Michigan and are under 21, you must not have any alcohol related violations in order to join. Joining Zipcar is the same if you live internationally, but check Zipcar's website for a full list of international cities where the company operates. Note that in Spain, Zipcars are called Avancars."
