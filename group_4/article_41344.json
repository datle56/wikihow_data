[2] X Research source Take deep breaths and make a promise to yourself that you aren't going to take your life for at least 48 hours, and not before seeking professional attention. As hard as it might be, put off your plans for two days to give yourself a more time to rest and think things through. Right now suicide might seem like the only option, but circumstances can quickly change. Promise to give yourself at least two more days to find a better option, or reason to keep looking. Try to see your emotions and actions as separate. The pain can feel so overwhelming that it distorts your thoughts and behavior. But thinking about suicide isn't the same thing as going through with it. You still have the power to make a choice not to take your life. [3] X Research source"

Lock away anything you could use to harm yourself, like pills, razors, knives, or guns. Give them to someone else for safekeeping, throw them away, or put them in a place that's not within easy reach. Minimize alcohol and drug use. Despite the temporary good feelings, they can make depression worse or harder to deal with. If you don't feel as though you'll be safe in your own home, go somewhere where you do feel safe.

Try filling out the coping kit, or read it over to get an idea of what belongs on this plan. Here's an example of a basic safety plan, although adding warning signs and specific numbers is a good idea: 1. Call someone on my list of people I can talk to. Write a list of five names or more, including 24-hour suicide hotlines. In a crisis, keep calling people on the list until I reach someone. 2. Delay my plan for 48 hours. Promise myself that I won't take my life before thinking through other options. 3. Ask someone to come stay with me. If no one can come, go to a place where I feel safe. 4. Go to the hospital. Drive myself or have someone take me. (It's not recommended that you drive yourself, as you might take reckless actions when driving due to a \"death wish\", so it's better to have someone else take you to the hospital, such as a trusted friend or one of your parents). 5. Call emergency services."

      "content": "Think about why this is happening. When you're in a calmer, safer mental state, think deeply about why this is happening to you. Is it something that's happened before, or is this the first time? Suicidal thoughts can be caused by many different things, and it's really important to figure out what's at the root so that you can see your situation objectively and take the right approach to stopping the thoughts. Depression, schizophrenia, bipolar, PTSD and other mental conditions often lead to suicidal thoughts. [5] X Research source These conditions can often be treated with therapy and medication. Make an appointment with a therapist and start exploring treatment options if you have a mental condition that's causing you to feel suicidal. If you're a veteran or you've experienced bullying, abuse, poverty, unemployment, major illness, or loss, you are at increased risk of suicide. It's important to get support from people who have been there and understand what you're going through. Support groups exist for all of these conditions. Certain events or circumstances can lead us to feel helpless, isolated, or burdensome - feelings which often lead to suicidal thoughts. But even though it's impossible to see it right now, these circumstances are temporary. Things will change, and life will get better again. If you don't know why you're feeling suicidal, it's important to work with a doctor, therapist, or counselor to find out what's going on."

      "title": "Identify your triggers.",
      "content": "Identify your triggers. Sometimes suicidal thoughts get triggered by certain people, places or experiences. It's not always easy to figure out whether a trigger is at play. Think back and see if you can recognize patterns that might clue you in as to whether your suicidal thoughts come as a result of certain experiences, and avoid those experiences in the future if you can. Here are a few examples of factors that can trigger crises: Drugs and alcohol. The chemicals in drugs and alcohol can often make depressive thoughts turn suicidal. Abusive people. Spending time around a person who is physically or emotionally abusive can trigger suicidal thoughts. Books, movies, or music that trigger tragic memories. For example, if you have lost a relative to cancer, you may wish to avoid films about cancer patients."

      "content": "Learn how to cope if you hear voices. Some people hear voices or a voice telling them to behave in a certain way. This situation has traditionally been considered a symptom of mental illness that is treated with heavy medications, but recently mental health organizations and voice hearers have been recommending alternate methods of coping. Try contacting Intervoice or Hearing Voices to discover support networks and long-term coping advice. In the short term, these approaches may help: [6] X Research source Plan your day around the times when you most commonly hear voices. Some people prefer to relax or shower during those times, while others like to stay busy. Listen to voices selectively, concentrating on positive messages if there are any. Rephrase nasty statements to neutral ones, and use the first person. For example, turn \"We want you to get out\" to \"I'm thinking of going out.\""

      "content": "Get the care you need. No matter why you're having suicidal thoughts, taking steps to get some kind of care is the only way to make them stop. Having an action plan for coping in the moment, and doing longer-term work to figure out your feelings and alter your situation can help you feel better again. If you're not sure where to start, contact a suicide prevention hotline such as the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline if you're in the United States (which can be reached by calling or texting 988), and ask for help finding resources you can turn to in your area. Figuring out a treatment plan isn't always easy. You'll need to connect with a therapist you like working with and who uses an approach that works, and you may opt to try a medication or a combination of medications that could take awhile to remedy the problem. It's OK if you don't get immediate results - the important thing is to keep trying. Keep using your safety plan when you need to and working toward feeling better. For some people, suicidal thoughts come and go throughout life. But you can learn how to cope with the thoughts when they come and have a full, satisfying life, no matter what."
