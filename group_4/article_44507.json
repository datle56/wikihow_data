      "content": "Try washing with water only. One of the biggest skin care mistakes you can make is washing your face with harsh cleansers. If your skin is dry, it's under-producing oils that protect your skin from flaking off. Harsh cleansers wash away the oils you do produce, making the problem worse. Instead of washing with soap of any kind, try washing with just plain water, especially when you're not wearing makeup. [1] X Research source Warm, not hot water should be used, since hot water can be drying. Wet a washcloth with warm water and gently run it over your face. Then pat your face dry with a clean soft towel. Even cleansers that are labeled as having moisturizing properties probably contain ingredients that are drying. Look at the label and read the ingredients: if you see sulfates, any type of alcohol, or salicylic acid, don't use it on your face."

      "content": "Consider the oil cleansing method. This is the best method for washing your face at night when plain water isn't going to cut it. The oil cleansing method removes makeup, dirt, sweat, and everything else without drying out your skin. It might sound counterintuitive to use oil to clean your skin, but adding oil actually attracts the oils that are there, acting as a gentle cleanser . You can tell your friends with acne to try it, too, since this method is healing for all skin types. Start by making an oil blend that suits your skin type. For very dry skin, jojoba oil, argan oil, and almond oil are all quite effective and nondrying. If you have oily spots, too, add some castor oil to your blend. Splash some warm water on your face, then use your fingers to rub the oil blend all over. This is an effective way to remove eye makeup, too, even the waterproof kind. Use a washcloth wet with warm water to gently remove the oil. Wipe it off using a circular motion, rinsing it out every so often. Continue until all the oil is gone. Repeat if you still have makeup on your face. Rinse your face with warm water and pat dry with a soft towel."

      "title": "Exfoliate your face",
      "content": "Exfoliate your face a few times a week. Dry skin is actually a layer of dead skin cells that build up and begin to slough off. Removing this layer of dead, dry skin a few times a week reveals the fresh, healthy skin underneath. Try one of the following methods for exfoliating your skin: Use a scrub . You can make a scrub by mixing a tablespoon of honey and a teaspoon of ground oatmeal. Simply rub it over the dry spots in a circular motion, then rinse it off. If you have more buildup than a scrub can handle, try using glycolic acid or another alpha-hydroxy acid.

These acids are derived from fruit or sugar, and they exfoliate dead skin cells while strengthening the skin underneath. Don't scrub your skin with a brush or cloth or use a harsh body scrub. This damages and weakens the skin."

      "content": "Moisturize in the morning. The jury is out on whether it's a good idea to cover your face in cream at night. Some research seems to indicate that facial cell renewal happens at night, and if you cover your face with cream, it won't naturally renew itself with healthy cells. Moisturizing in the morning, however, is a great idea, since it protects your face from pollutants, dirt, dry air, hot air, and everything else you'll encounter throughout the day that could dry out your skin. After using a washcloth wet with warm water to cleanse your face, apply a moisturizer. [4] X Research source"

One easy way to distinguish the good from the bad is to check the ingredients for alcohol. This ingredient is drying, so there's no reason to use it on your face, especially when you have dry skin. If a moisturizer has a long list of ingredients containing lots of words ending in -ohol, avoid it. Look for a natural moisturizer made from a blend of oils and lanolin. These protect your skin and won't dry it out. Use a cream-based moisturizer for the best results. [5] X Expert Source Mohiba Tareen, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 26 March 2020. On the days when your skin is really dry, try pure argan oil or coconut oil. Choose unrefined coconut oil, since that's better for your skin than refined coconut oil."
