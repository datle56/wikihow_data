      "content": "Make and set up a new composition. Projects in Adobe After Effects are called compositions, or comps. At the Welcome screen, locate and click on the New Composition button in the right column. If you already have the program open, you may either click on the “Composition” tab and select “New Composition” or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + N . Every time you create a new composition, a “Composition Settings” window will appear on your screen. [2] X Research source Don't know what resolution to choose? Locate “Preset” and click on the drop-down menu. The menu is divided up into four sections, respectively: Web settings, standard definition broadcast settings (NTSC and PAL), HD settings (the most used), and film settings. Select \"UHD 8K 23.976\", which is four times the resolution of 1080p HD with 23.976 frames per second. It's always a good idea to create effects in 8K for future-proofing. In the second row, find “Start Timecode” and “Duration.” Leave the “Start Timecode” at 0. “Duration” refers to the total length of the project, from start to end. Set the “Duration” to the required length for your composition. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source"

When you select “Save,” a “Save As” window will appear. At the top of the window, type in the name of your composition. Select a location to save this file to and click the “Save” button at the bottom of the screen. The saved composition will appear in the “Project” tab to the left of the screen.

From this tab, you may alter the order of the files and edit the appearance of a file. To adjust the hierarchy of the layers, drag a file up or down the list. The order of the files will alter the appearance of the composition (see the “Composition” window.) Files at the top of the layer list will appear over files at the bottom of the layer list. To alter the appearance of a file, click on the sideways triangle next to the layer's number. This will open up a “Transform” menu.

Locate the “Parent” category in the layer tab. In the “Parent” column for this layer, locate the curly-q shaped icon in the child's row.

Click on the stopwatch icon next to the property you wish to alter. This will record a keyframe at the current time indicator. A yellow dot or a greater than/less than symbols will appear on the timeline to mark the keyframe.

If a layer is linearly animated, the layer will start and stop moving abruptly and it will also move at the same rate the entire time. Altering a layer's position is an example of linear animation.
