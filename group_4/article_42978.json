      "title": "Imagine yourself in their place.",
      "content": "Imagine yourself in their place. In order to get over your own scruples (if you have any) about confronting the person at work who smells bad, put yourself in their shoes. Remind yourself that if you had a body odor problem that concerned your coworkers, you would want to know. Imagining yourself in their place will put you in the right frame of mind for the coming conversation."

      "title": "Talk privately with the person.",
      "content": "Talk privately with the person. In order to avoid embarrassing them more than you need to, find a quiet place to initiate the discussion. If you’re a manager, you can pull them into your office. If you’re just a coworker, pull them aside in the breakroom or another empty space when nobody else is about. [1] X Research source To talk privately with the smelly person, ask them, “Can I talk to you?” or “Do you have a moment to talk?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Start the conversation with praise.",
      "content": "Start the conversation with praise. Starting the conversation with praise will soften the blow and let the person know that you are not trying to be malicious. Be honest in your application of praise. If the person is not a good worker, for instance, do not suggest that they are. Find something else to praise them about. [2] X Research source Tell the smelly person, for instance, “You are a hard worker and a valuable member of this team.”"

      "title": "Disarm the person who smells.",
      "content": "Disarm the person who smells. Before you get into the actual issue of the worker’s stench, acknowledge that the conversation will be a bit uncomfortable but is necessary nonetheless. Disarming the person who smells in this manner will show them that you’re on their side and sympathize with their position. [3] X Research source Start by saying, for instance, “This is bit awkward, and I hope I don’t offend you, but...”"

    {
      "title": "Be as honest and direct as possible.",
      "content": "Be as honest and direct as possible. If you leave the stinky person with vague comments about “hygiene,” they might think you’re asking them to brush their teeth to solve their bad breath. To avoid any confusion, be gentle but don’t mince words. [4] X Research source You could say, for instance, “You seem to have a disagreeable odor these days.” Never tell the smelly worker that anyone else has brought the issue to your attention. This will only cause them further embarrassment."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask if they’re aware of their smell.",
      "content": "Ask if they’re aware of their smell. After laying out the issue in gentle but explicit terms, find out if the person at work who smells bad knows that they smell bad. If someone at work who smells bad admits that they have a medical condition that causes them to emit a bad scent, thank them for being honest with you. Ask, for instance, “Is this a problem you’re aware of?” or “Has anyone ever told you this before?” If they say it's due to a medical condition, you could say, \"Oh, I'm so sorry I brought it up. Thank you for letting me know. I won't mention it again.\""

      "title": "Suggest possible causes and solutions.",
      "content": "Suggest possible causes and solutions. When someone at work smells bad, they usually don’t know it. And if they don’t know it, they likely don’t know how to correct the problem. Offer helpful comments regarding the potential cause and possible suggestions for how to deal with the problem. [5] X Research source For instance, you might say, “Perhaps you just need to wash your clothes more often. Or maybe you could try showering more frequently.” Reader Poll: We asked 182 wikiHow readers if they use deodorant, and 53% of them said yes. [Take Poll] So, suggesting deodorant might be an option."

If, after telling someone at work they smell bad, they do not take reasonable and appropriate steps to freshen up, you should report the issue to a workplace superior. With luck, they will have more success than you did in correcting the coworker’s stench. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply pressure if necessary.",
      "content": "Apply pressure if necessary. If you’re in a management position and the person at work who smells bad is combative or disagrees with you, insist that they must come to work smelling fresh. Remind them that stinky workers reflect badly on the business and that failing to correct their foul odor could hurt their relationships with their coworkers. [7] X Research source Say, for instance, “We have a company policy that requires all workers to be fresh and clean at work.”"

      "content": "Move to a different location. If possible, change your cubicle or desk. If moving altogether is not an option, try to at least find ways to minimize the amount of time you spend near the stinky colleague. For instance, volunteer to take on a different set of responsibilities that takes you to a different part of your workspace. [8] X Research source"

You could also try a plug-in air freshener that sprays in automatic, regular intervals, or you could use a pressurized air freshener of the sort that comes in an aerosol can. [9] X Research source"
