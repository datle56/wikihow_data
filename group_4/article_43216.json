[8] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Try swiping on an antiperspirant + deodorant combo every day before you leave the house to combat sweat and odors. You can also talk to your doctor about prescription antiperspirants, since they’re stronger than the ones you can get over the counter. Keep your antiperspirant on you throughout the day to reapply as needed. If you want to go the natural route, try making your own deodorant at home! All you need is 4 tbsp of coconut oil, 3 tbsp of cornstarch and 1,5 tbsp of baking soda. Mix everything in a jar and add 25 drops of your favorite essential oil. This all-natural deodorant can be stored for up to 3 months. Reader Poll: We asked 331 wikiHow readers if they use deodorant, and 79% of them said yes. [Take Poll]"
