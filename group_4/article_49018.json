The doorbell has 2 wires connected to it, 1 at the top and 1 at the bottom, and it’s important that you remember which one is which so you can hook up the new one properly. Take the top wire and bend the end of it so you can tell them apart. You can also take a picture to see what wire connects to what. [4] X Research source Sometimes, the wires may be different colors, but it’s common for them to be too similar to tell apart."

For instance, if you’re wiring a doorbell to your front door, flip off the switch that controls power there. If you are not sure which breaker turns off your doorbell unit, turn off the master breaker to shut off power to your entire house. Try turning on lights in the area to make sure the power is shut off."

A doorbell transformer is an electrical component that literally transforms power from a higher voltage to a lower one to power your doorbell and chimes. It’s a small, metal box with 2 terminals and is usually located in an outlet box near the front door. Open up outlet boxes or look beneath them to find the transformer. [8] X Research source If the transformer box isn’t located in an outlet box, check near your breaker box for it. It could be attached to the top or bottom of it. [9] X Research source"

Strip away about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of the sheathing with a wire stripper or a knife to expose the wires. Use a screwdriver to loosen the screw on the top terminal of the transformer. Slide the exposed wire beneath the terminal screw and then tighten it so it’s secure. Then, connect the other end of the wire to the top terminal of your doorbell the same way. [10] X Research source You can drill a hole in your wall to thread the wire to connect the terminal to the doorbell or cover the wire with a cord cover. Make sure the terminal screws are tightly secured so the wires are connected and won’t come out of place. You can find 16 AWG wire at your local hardware store, electrical supply store, or by ordering it online."
