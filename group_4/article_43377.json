      "content": "A Rolex is soundless because it's powered by automatic movement. Ordinary watches are powered with quartz movement, which is why the second hand makes that “tick, tick, tick” sound. A ticking sound is a tell-tale sign of a fake Rolex. [1] X Research source The mechanical movement that powers a Rolex is self-winding. You will never have to wind an authentic Rolex watch."

      "content": "A regular watch's second hand will jerk from one position to the next. The second hand of an authentic Rolex should turn smoothly without pausing to mark each second. If the second hand's motion is anything less than silky smooth, the watch is counterfeit. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "A real Rolex will have a date window made of magnified glass.",
      "content": "A real Rolex will have a date window made of magnified glass. Rolexes have a small dial or window that displays the date on the right side of the watch face. The glass, called the cyclops, should magnify the numbers underneath. If the glass doesn't magnify the number, the watch if probably fake. [3] X Research source Rolex magnification windows usually magnify the date to 2.5x; the date should take up nearly the entire window. Some good counterfeits may magnify the date a little, but the date won't fill up the entire window. If the magnification window is imperfect or off center, the watch is fake."

      "content": "Rolexes are made of quality materials that have some heft to them. Test the weight of the watch in your hand. A Rolex feels solid and substantial in your hand and on your wrist. If your “Rolex” feels suspiciously lightweight, it's not the real thing. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Rolex uses high-quality polished steel for their watches.",
      "content": "Rolex uses high-quality polished steel for their watches. An authentic Rolex will never be made with plastic or aluminum pieces. Turn the watch over and examine the back side. If any part of the watch is made from plastic or thin, cheap-looking metal like aluminum, you're dealing with a fake. Rolex uses a proprietary stainless steel alloy for their watches called Oystersteel. If the back casing looks metal on the outside but has a plastic inner case, the watch isn't genuine. Some imitations have a clear glass back so you can see the inner workings of the watch. No authentic Rolex model has this feature."

      "title": "Every Rolex has an engraved serial number.",
      "content": "Every Rolex has an engraved serial number. Remove the watch band by pushing the joint holding the band out of place with a thumbtack. The serial number should be etched between the lugs (where the band attaches to the case with metal spring bars) at the 6 o'clock end of the dial. The lettering will look perfect and precise, never rough. [5] X Research source Between the opposite set of lugs, you should see \"ORIG ROLEX DESIGN\" followed by a case reference number. To look up the date of your watch's manufacture with the serial number, you can use this handy online source ."

      "content": "A real Rolex dial has an etched logo at the 6 and 12 o'clock positions. Starting in the early to mid 2000s, Rolex began etching their trademark crown logo into the crystal of their watch's dials. The logo is very small, so use a magnifying glass or a jeweler's lens to find it. If the etching is large enough to easily see with the naked eye, you may have a fake on your hands. The logo above the 12 o'clock position should be made of high-quality metal. The circles at the end of the crown's points will be raised bumps, and the crown's outline has a different metallic sheen than the inside. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Each letter should be perfect, with straight lines and smooth curves. The spaces between words and letters should be consistent. If the lettering looks even slightly uneven or smudged under magnification, the watch is probably not a Rolex. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "An authentic Rolex dial has etched lettering inside the rim.",
      "content": "An authentic Rolex dial has etched lettering inside the rim. Use a magnifying glass or jeweler's lens to check. The lettering around the dial should be fine, precise, and elegant, with no imperfections. If the lettering looks painted or printed (rather than etched), the watch is fake. All watches from Rolex's Oyster Perpetual series (which is one of their most famous lines) bear this etching. [8] X Research source The only exceptions are from the Cellini series; they have non-standard designs (rectangular faces, etc.) so some of them won't have the dial etching."

      "content": "All packaging should have the official Rolex name and logo. Everything about a Rolex watch should be elegant, dignified, and perfect, including the packaging. The watch should come in a fine jewelry box with a mount to hold and display the watch. [9] X Research source Most Rolex packaging contains a certificate of authenticity, a manual, and 5-year warranty paperwork. [10] X Research source If your watch is missing any of these things, it may not be genuine."

      "title": "Test the water-tightness to confirm authenticity as a last resort.",
      "content": "Test the water-tightness to confirm authenticity as a last resort. All Rolex watches are waterproof; a fake watch won't be. To test it, fill a cup with water, dunk the watch into the cup for several seconds, and take it out. The watch should continue to work fine and there shouldn't be any water inside the dial. Rolex actually created the very first waterproof watch case in history. The case, which they named the Oyster case, is still used today. The Submariner is the only Rolex watch designed for deep water usage — while other Rolexes should be fine in the shower or swimming pool, they may leak under more serious aquatic conditions."
