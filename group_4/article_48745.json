If you get butterflies whenever this guy walks into the room, or you feel yourself blushing when he gives you a compliment, you probably like him! When you’re attracted to someone, your body actually goes through changes when you see them: your heart might beat a little faster, you might breathe a little quicker, and your skin could get flushed.

Try to remind yourself that a rejection isn’t the end of the world, and even if he says no, you can still pat yourself on the back for putting yourself out there!

Maybe he’s dated a few people in the past, or maybe you’re just worried you won’t know what to do with a boyfriend.
