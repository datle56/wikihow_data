      "content": "Keep your repair patch cool enough that you can touch it safety with your bare hand. Hotter patches can ruin the weld, and cold patches will take too long to heat up to welding temperature. Consult your engineering specifications documents to know the best temperature for the exact iron formula you are using in your project."

      "title": "Expect to find small cracks in the iron when your welding is done.",
      "content": "Expect to find small cracks in the iron when your welding is done. This is a normal and unavoidable part of welding cast iron. Use sealing compound for joints and sections that must be watertight. To stay safe while welding, protect yourself from UV radiation. Welding produces intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which can harm your eyes and skin. Ensure to shield nearby people and use screens or curtains to confine the welding area. Regularly check your welding equipment for damage or defects. Faulty equipment can pose safety risks, so it's crucial to maintain it properly. Be cautious of electrical hazards. Welding involves high electrical currents, so ensure you have a properly grounded workpiece and avoid contact with the electrode, work clamp, or any other live electrical parts."
