      "content": "Decide what color(s) to add to your mortar. Stain is translucent so you must consider what colors are already in the mortar and then decide what must be added to obtain the color you want. If you are disguising a repair or addition, what additional colors would make the new mortar match the old? If you just want a different look, what colors would give you the look you want? Be sure to consider how light or dark, strong or weak the colors should be. Don’t worry if you are not 100% certain about your decisions at this point."
