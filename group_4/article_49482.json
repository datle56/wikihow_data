      "title": "Include the location and time to provide context for what was happening.",
      "content": "Include the location and time to provide context for what was happening. While this is optional, it can help you remember what was happening at the time you wrote each entry. This is a big help if you plan to read over your journal in the future. Record the location and time under your date or at the start of the journal entry itself. [2] X Research source / For instance, you might write “Good Beans Coffee House,” “School,” “Paris,” or “My bedroom” for your location. For the time, you could write the actual time, such as “12:25 p.m.,” or the time of day, like “Early morning.”"

      "content": "Start with an opening like “Dear Diary” or “Dear Self” if you prefer. Using a salutation is totally optional, so feel free to skip it. However, you might try it a few times to see if it helps you get in the mindset to write. Choose a salutation that appeals to you if you want to use one. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Write the body of your entry. If you're writing in a personal journal , you can write the body of your entry about whatever you want and for as long (or short) as you want. For example, you can write about what you did that day, how you're feeling in the moment, or what the environment around you looks like (or all three!). If you're writing in a school journal for an assignment, follow the assignment requirements and stick to the topic and word count your teacher or professor gave you."

      "title": "End with your last thought or a sentence summing up your thoughts.",
      "content": "End with your last thought or a sentence summing up your thoughts. Personal journal entries don't need formal endings, so feel free to end yours with the last thought you wanted to jot down. When you're writing an school or college journal, though, include a closing statement that sums up your thoughts or conclusions. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Write about what’s going on in your life.",
      "content": "Write about what’s going on in your life. This includes things like the activities you’re doing, events that happen, and accomplishments you make. Use your journal to record what your life is like right now so you can look back on it later. [5] X Research source This is a great way to help you document things you want to remember. For instance, you might write about something funny that happened at lunch, scoring the winning goal in a soccer game, or a fight you had with your friend. The events can be positive or negative."

Here are some prompts to get you started: [7] X Trustworthy Source Reading Rockets Online resource supported by PBS providing research-based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers Go to source Write about what you’d like to do this weekend.

      "title": "Be creative with structuring and formatting.",
      "content": "Be creative with structuring and formatting. You can use any format for writing your posts, so play around with different structures. This can help you keep up with your writing habit because it provides you the freedom to do what comes naturally that day. For instance, you could try the following: [10] X Research source Turn a memory into a story. Record what you dreamed last night. Write a list, such as what you did that day or what you’re grateful for. Doodle or paste pictures into your journal. Record song lyrics or quotes that mean something to you. Write your own lyrics or a poem. Write in a stream of consciousness."

      "title": "Use “I” to write your journal in the first person.",
      "content": "Use “I” to write your journal in the first person. You’re writing about your thoughts, experiences, and reflections, so don’t worry about putting them in third person like a book. It’s okay to write your journal entries using the pronoun “I” unless you just prefer not to do so. [11] X Research source For instance, you could write, “I went to lunch with Sari today,” not “Amy had lunch with Sari today.”"

      "content": "Incorporate details that appeal to your 5 senses to make your post vivid. Including lots of sensory details can make your journal entries more interesting and help you remember what happened later. Think about what you saw, heard, smelled, felt, and tasted during the events or experiences that you’re writing about. Then, include some of these descriptions in your entry. [12] X Research source For instance, let’s say you’re on vacation at the beach. You might include details like, “sea spray hitting my face,” “the smell of burning wood from bonfires on the beach,” “the taste of salt on my lips,” “the sun glinting off the surface of the water,” and “the shouts from other beach goers having fun.”"

      "content": "Make your journal entry as long as you want. You don’t need to fill out an entire page every time you write – but you can if you want! It’s okay to have some short entries and some longer entries. Write down what you have to say. If you’re having trouble thinking of something else to write, go ahead and end your entry. [13] X Research source With journaling, it’s more important to write often than to write a lot."

      "title": "Organize your thoughts to make them coherent.",
      "content": "Organize your thoughts to make them coherent. A journal entry doesn’t need to be as organized as an essay, even if it’s for school. However, your teacher should be able to read it and follow your train of thought. Use complete sentences to express your thoughts, and start a new paragraph when you switch to a new idea. [14] X Research source If you’re telling a story, try to follow a narrative structure to give it a beginning, middle, and end. Proofread your journal entry (or ask a friend to do it) before you submit it to check that it makes sense."

      "title": "Reach the required word count.",
      "content": "Reach the required word count. Check your assignment sheet to find out if your instructor requires journal entries to be a certain length. If they do, make sure you reach the correct word count so you get full credit. Use the word count tool on your word processor or count your words if you hand-wrote your entry. For handwritten journals, your instructor may require that you simply fill up a page. Make sure you know the exact requirements so you can do your assignment correctly. If you’re struggling to think of something to write, make a mind map about the topic to help you brainstorm some new ideas."

Use proper capitalization, punctuation, and sentence structure throughout your journal entry. Otherwise, you may lose credit.

      "title": "Proofread your journal entry and correct any mistakes.",
      "content": "Proofread your journal entry and correct any mistakes. Since your journal is part of a school assignment, it must be free of errors. Read over your journal entry at least twice to check it for mistakes in grammar, spelling, or the narrative and make any necessary corrections. [16] X Research source This is especially important if you’re keeping your journal as a graded assignment. If you’re typing your journal entries in an online portal, there may be a spellcheck tool you can use. However, you should still proofread the entry to look for other errors."
