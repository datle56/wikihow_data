      "content": "Acknowledge and accept whatever hurt your feelings. Define your pain and label it for what it is. A major disappointment or unexpected hurt can be hard to accept, but acknowledging exactly what you feel can help you heal. Ask yourself to name each emotion and identify why you feel that way, whether you feel anger, sadness, grief, or disappointment. [1] X Research source Take a few moments to breathe deeply and think about your feelings without judging or analyzing them. What feelings are there? For example, you might think, “I’m feeling sad, angry, and anxious because of my fight with Shirley.” Identifying and naming your feelings can help you separate them from who you are as a person. It’s okay to feel however you feel; negative emotions don’t make you a bad person! Don’t try to push your emotions down or ignore them. Ultimately, that’ll just make them harder to deal with."

      "content": "Let yourself feel any negative emotions you might have. When you experience a major hurt, you need time to feel sad, frustrated, confused, or even angry. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Remind yourself that it’s normal to experience those negative feelings after a loss or betrayal—so don’t try to force yourself to get over it before you’re ready. Instead, find healthy ways to express those negative feelings. For example, try writing in a journal. Unpack your feelings there and write about what you’re feeling, even if you think the emotions are dark or ugly. Seeing your emotions on the page may help you process them! You could also try a writing exercise. Write down absolutely anything that comes to you, no matter how angry or irrational it might seem. Then. when you’re done, rip up the paper."

      "title": "Find the source of your hurt feelings.",
      "content": "Find the source of your hurt feelings. Whatever situation is currently upsetting you might not be the only source of your hurt feelings. You might be reacting to negative emotions that have built up inside you for days, weeks, or even longer. So, ask yourself what experiences might be causing your pain. Has anyone else made you feel this way? Is it possible you’re holding onto anger over a different situation, too? [3] X Research source Say a friend stands you up for lunch. It’s perfectly valid to feel hurt over something like that—but consider whether there are other factors in play, too. For example, say a friend betrayed you years earlier, or you have a family member who always stands you uo, too. If you didn’t deal with your emotions towards those issues, they might add to the anger you feel over the current problem. That’s why it’s important to find the root of your hurt feelings!"

      "content": "Put distance between yourself and the hurtful person. If your hurt feelings are overwhelming, it might help to steer clear of anything (or anyone) that might remind you of the problem. Take time to clear your head, calm down, and get in a better headspace before going back to confront whoever hurt your feelings (or even spending time around them). [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This might mean putting physical distance between yourself and another person, or it might just mean putting psychological distance between yourself and a problem by not thinking about it for a little while."

      "title": "Practice mindfulness to gain control of your emotions.",
      "content": "Practice mindfulness to gain control of your emotions. When you feel hurt, you might be tempted to turn your thoughts into actions—taking revenge or hurting the person who hurt you. However, it’s important to control those emotions (instead of letting them control you). So, try practicing mindfulness by living in the moment and being more aware of where you are and what you’re doing. [5] X Research source Try doing some simple relaxation exercises when you feel tense or upset. For example, you might try some breathing exercises , yoga , or a little meditation . Put a plan in place if you’re worried about acting on your intrusive thoughts. For example, you might call a friend who can listen and be there for you when your hurt feelings make you want to do something rash."

      "title": "Try a behavioral therapy technique called “balanced thinking.”",
      "content": "Try a behavioral therapy technique called “balanced thinking.” Balanced thinking helps you challenge extreme thoughts and figure out when you’re being unrealistic. Start by writing out your feelings about the situation. Then, follow up by considering the evidence behind that feeling. Is there any? Is there information you might be missing? From there, see if you can come up with a more balanced, realistic thought. [6] X Research source For example, your genuine feeling might be, “They’re trying to ruin my life.” However, thinking it through might reveal that you don’t have evidence for that beyond a single argument—so a more realistic thought might be, “We both got upset and said things we didn’t mean.” You could also try shifting your perspective by pretending to look at the situation as someone else. What would your mom, favorite celebrity, or future self say about the problem?"

      "title": "Focus on yourself instead of the thing that hurt you.",
      "content": "Focus on yourself instead of the thing that hurt you. Whenever you start thinking about the situation that caused your hurt, remind yourself that you’re no longer obligated to feel sad about it. The situation isn’t a part of who you are—it’s just something that happened to you. Refocus yourself and your present situation instead of dwelling on what happened . [7] X Research source One way to avoid dwelling on the past is to learn from what happened and come up with a plan to prevent it from happening again. Brainstorm different ways to improve your current situation, or write down a list of lessons you learned from going through it. When you take action after something negative, you empower yourself to move forward!"

      "title": "Get closure on the situation if you can.",
      "content": "Get closure on the situation if you can. By getting closure , you can bring the situation to a natural close, giving you the sense of resolution you need to start moving on. Figure out what you need to get closure over the situation that hurt your feelings, then make a plan to go and do it. Think of it like a ritual; once you perform the ritual, your pain might lessen in time. [8] X Research source For example, if you feel hurt by someone's actions, you might get closure by confronting the wrongdoer. Try not to blame them for what happened; instead, express how you feel and explain how you want to move forward. Say something like, “I was really hurt by what you did. I need space to decide if I want to continue the relationship or not. I will contact you if I decide to.” Another possible strategy might be as simple as giving back the property of the person who hurt you (like an ex-partner or spouse) and saying a final goodbye. However, you might have to accept that the person who hurt you isn’t going to apologize. If they do, that’s great! If they won’t, however, the best thing to do is accept the situation and keep moving forward without an apology. Even after a hurtful or disappointing situation, being honest with another person can only strengthen your relationship with them (if it’s a relationship worth having).

So, remind yourself that no matter what happened, you’re not broken. There’s nothing wrong with you; despite how you might feel, there’s still good in your life. Practice thinking of anything you’re grateful for when you’re feeling hurt—from loved ones to your favorite song or stuffed animal.

Over time, you might find that you have even more to be happy about than you thought! Take time to appreciate even small things.

      "content": "Replace your negative thoughts with a positive mantra. Filling your head with negative self-talk can bring your whole life down. If you find yourself thinking negatively, catch yourself and try to change the negative thought into a more positive or realistic statement. Rehearse a positive mantra to recite when you start feeling bad, and use it to reframe those intrusive, negative thoughts. [10] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source For example, if you catch yourself thinking a negative thought like, “I’m alone and totally helpless right now,” try reciting a positive mantra like, “I’m strong and capable of finding a new way forward in life that is healthy for me.” Similarly, challenge a negative thought like, “I will never know good wholesome people who aren't trying to manipulate me,” by thinking of any person you know who has shown kindness and trustworthiness. Once you identify at least one person who fits this positive category, you have attacked and invalidated the negative claim."

When you own up to your part in the current situation, you’re actually empowering yourself, giving yourself the chance to grow from the experience.

Forgiveness isn’t something you give to other people; rather, it’s an act that can facilitate your own healing and ultimately make you feel better, whether or not the other person deserves it.

It can eventually make you feel depressed or unable to focus on things that actually make you happy.
