This keeps the heat in well and won’t add any bulk to your outfit. [1] X Research source If your hoodie doesn’t have a zipper, you can just pull it on like you normally would. Satin and silk scarves are usually fairly thin. Try wearing a hoodie that's a little more fitted. [2] X Expert Source Taissha G.

      "content": "Fold your scarf in half. Hold your scarf in your hands and fold it in half so that there is a looped side in one of your hands. Make sure the fold is relatively even so that your scarf doesn’t look unbalanced. [3] X Research source If you have an infinity scarf, start with it laying flat and then fold the loop in half so that you have 2 smaller loops. Opt for a solid-colored scarf, if you can—you don't want your outfit to have too much going on. [4] X Expert Source Taissha G. LaReau Wardrobe Consultant & Stylist Expert Interview. 31 January 2022."

Slide your scarf around on your neck until it looks mostly even on either side. [5] X Research source If you are using an infinity scarf, pull the 2 small loops over your neck."

Pull the hanging ends through the loop so that the scarf fits snugly against your neck.

Make sure the scarf is mostly centered so that your outfit looks even. [7] X Research source If your hoodie doesn’t have a zipper, try to make your scarf mostly even by aligning it with the pocket. Adjust your infinity scarf so that the 2 small loops are even."

Put on your hoodie and zip it up all the way with the hood up. [8] X Research source If your hoodie doesn’t have a zipper, just pull it on like you normally would and keep the hood up."
