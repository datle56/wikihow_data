      "content": "Try a toothpaste with activated charcoal added first. An activated charcoal toothpaste will be less abrasive than an activated charcoal paste, as well as easier to clean off your teeth. If you've never tried activated charcoal before, you may want to start with a toothpaste first. [2] X Research source While activated charcoal may be good at removing surface stains, toothpastes are largely ineffective at whitening your teeth because they don't stay in contact with your teeth long enough. However, if you smoke or drink coffee, your teeth may seem whiter after using an activated charcoal toothpaste. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Make your own paste with tablets if you have healthy teeth and gums. Making your own activated charcoal paste is typically less expensive than pre-made branded products. Additionally, you avoid other ingredients in pre-made products that may lessen the effectiveness of the activated charcoal. [5] X Research source Activated charcoal tablets are available online and at some natural food or health and beauty stores. Activated charcoal is also available in capsule form. You would need to break open the capsule to use the charcoal on your teeth. Read the information on the package carefully and make sure the tablets you buy are okay to use in your mouth. Although paste made with tablets is typically more abrasive than branded activated charcoal products, you can control the abrasiveness depending on how finely you crush up the charcoal."

      "content": "Crush a tablet of activated charcoal into a cup or bowl. Take a single tablet of activated charcoal out of the bottle and drop it into a small cup or bowl. You may want to use the back of a spoon to crush it up a little bit. [6] X Research source The finer the consistency of the activated charcoal, the less abrasive your paste will be. Try not to leave any large or jagged pieces of charcoal, as these could damage your teeth or gums."

Once you've sufficiently crushed up the activated charcoal tablet, mix it with water to until it has a consistent paste-like consistency. [7] X Research source Adding more water and crushing the charcoal more will make your paste less abrasive. However, you should only add a few drops of water at a time. If the paste becomes too watery, it won't adhere to your teeth."

      "content": "Apply the paste to your teeth with a soft-bristled toothbrush. Dip a soft toothbrush into the paste and brush it gently on the exposed surfaces of your teeth. Use light pressure to keep from scrubbing too hard – you might damage your teeth's enamel. [8] X Research source Be sure to use a different toothbrush than the one you regularly use to brush your teeth – small bits of charcoal will get trapped in the bristles, and the bristles themselves will become stained. Get a toothbrush with the softest bristles you can find to minimize the abrasiveness. You might try a child's toothbrush, which typically has softer bristles than an adult toothbrush."

      "content": "Leave the paste on your teeth for 3 minutes, then rinse. Once you've covered your teeth in the activated charcoal paste, wait for 3 minutes to allow the charcoal to do its work. Rinse your mouth with cool water repeatedly until you are no longer spitting any charcoal fragments. [9] X Research source After rinsing with water, you may want to follow up with a regular mouth rinse so your mouth doesn't taste like charcoal. When you first start, you may have a hard time leaving the activated charcoal in your mouth for 3 minutes. Start with 1 minute and work your way up."

Using activated charcoal is not the same as brushing and flossing your teeth, and doesn't take the place of regular dental hygiene. Even while using activated charcoal, follow a normal routine of brushing your teeth at least twice a day. [10] X Research source Monitor your teeth and gums carefully when you brush your teeth after using activated charcoal. Discontinue your activated charcoal treatments if you notice your gums bleeding, or if your teeth feel rough or more sensitive than usual."

      "title": "Treat your teeth with activated charcoal at most once every 2 weeks.",
      "content": "Treat your teeth with activated charcoal at most once every 2 weeks. Activated charcoal is abrasive, and repeated treatments will damage your enamel. Once you lose enamel there's no way to get it back. Using activated charcoal sparingly minimizes cumulative damage. The primary benefit of activated charcoal is the removal of surface stains from your teeth. Waiting a couple of weeks will allow a buildup of stains so the charcoal doesn't start eating away at your enamel."
