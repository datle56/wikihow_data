      "content": "Choose an egg-laying farm if you want to work with egg production. Chicken farms usually fall in 1 of 2 categories: egg-laying or meat production. If you want to focus on selling farm-fresh eggs and working with hens rather than selling meat, this may be the best type of farm for you. Many consumers prefer farm-fresh eggs to store-bought, so this can be a selling point for your business. Although less common, some chicken farms handle both meat production and egg-laying. If you choose this option, it may require twice as much equipment and physical labor. Studies show that eggs from chickens raised in good environments have double or triple the omega-3 fatty acid content and a third of the cholesterol as other eggs. By creating an egg-laying farm, you can assure your customers that they weren’t fed or exposed to unhealthy chemicals. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a meat production farm if you're interested in processing meat. These farms are also called broiler farms. Meat production is a lucrative farming business if you're comfortable butchering and processing chickens for meat. Meat production farms can also utilize every part of the chicken when selling their products, including the bones, which have the potential for higher revenue. [2] X Research source Broiler farms typically grow between 4 and 8 flocks a year, depending on the size of the chickens. Large chickens are typically processed into value-added products like chicken patties and chicken fingers. Medium-sized chickens are often packaged as boneless breasts or whole rotisserie chickens. Small chickens are often sold as fast food products. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a location close to your city's limits. While you can't always start a farm in your backyard, staying near a city is useful for transportation. Buy land outside of your town or city's limits, but close enough that you can drive to or from it on a daily basis. This will help you save on labor and transportation costs. [8] X Research source The further you move from your city or town, the cheaper the land will be. If you can't find land near the city limits, look for land in the countryside where you'll have plenty of space to farm. Poultry expert Alexandra Doss recommends that you “have at least an acre or so” of land for a chicken farm, but “a quarter of an acre is fine for a few chickens, too.”"

To better prepare for a career in chicken farming, choose a Bachelor's degree in agriculture, business, or a niche major like farm administration or poultry science if your college offers it. If you choose agriculture or poultry science, add a business minor (or vice-versa) to take classes on marketing, leadership, and other relevant topics. Get your degree online if you don't have time for a traditional four-year degree. Other ways to learn about poultry farming include taking a training course or consulting an established farmer for advice and mentorship."

Buy or build a chicken coop or cage on your farm with dimensions based on how many chickens you're housing. Here are some poultry housing systems to consider: [14] X Trustworthy Source Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition Go to source Extensive: A cost-effective system in which your chickens roam freely on the ground and just have a shelter. Semi-intensive: In this system, you’ll breed half your chickens in cages and the other half will roam freely on the ground. This system protects the chickens from predators and bad weather. Deep-litter: This system is best for broilers. The chickens can move freely on the ground made of straw, sawdust, and leaves. This system allows you to easily feed them and reach their eggs without unnecessary hurdles. Slatted or wired: This system includes creating small houses with wooden slats or wired mesh flooring. The slats are 4 feet above the ground and you can easily feed the chickens and collect eggs . This is ideal for adult birds as the houses have a low temperature. Battery-caged: In this system, you’ll place the birds in metal cages and separate them into groups. Each cage has its own food and water containers and provides nests for the chickens to lay eggs in. This is the most effective system for egg production, but it may be too expensive for a new business. Build the chicken coop or cage at about 4 sq ft (0.37 m 2 ) per chicken. [15] X Research source Clean the chicken coop or cage regularly to prevent the chickens from spreading diseases."

      "content": "Feed your chickens daily. Buy chicken feed from a pet or agricultural supply store and feed your chickens once a day. Give each chicken about 3.5 ounces (99 g) of chicken feed a day to keep your chickens healthy and prevent malnourishment. Ensure they have access to fresh, clean water, as well. [16] X Research source You can also give chickens corn, halved grapes, or cabbage as a treat, but avoid feeding them these treats more than several times a week as it's less healthy than chicken feed. [17] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Nearly 70% of your production cost comes from supplying poultry feed. As you become more experienced, consider learning how to prepare your own feed . Until then, buying it from the market is fine. If your chickens aren’t fed properly, they’ll produce fewer eggs and become susceptible to various diseases. If you use ingredients like maize, ensure the moisture content is never above 10-11%, as this may lead to fungus. To prevent this, purchase your feed from a reliable company."
