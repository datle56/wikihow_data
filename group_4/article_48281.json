Some, like water parks, also need extra seasonal help in summers and are looking to hire teens or students to handle their influx of crowds (some hire as young as 14 years old). Plus, you may get fun perks like free movies or discounted theme park tickets!

      "content": "Think about what work schedule fits with your school commitments. As a 15-year-old, your academic priorities come first! Think about your class and homework load, extracurricular commitments, and other obligations you have as a student when you’re job hunting. Different kinds of jobs have different schedules or busy times of the year, and some may mesh better with your school schedule than others. A typical part-time job is a good bet if you’re looking for hours after school or on weekends. Seasonal work hires more staff for busy times of year if you don’t want to work year-round (for example, an amusement park will need more staff during summer than winter). Entrepreneurial ventures (like starting your own babysitting, dog walking, or photography side hustle) are the most flexible since you can decide your own hours and workload."

Maybe a babysitting or camp counselor job is a good fit. Do you love film and entertainment? Then perhaps a movie theater job is right for you. While your options may be a bit more limited at 15 than when you’re 18 and up, there’s still plenty of opportunities to explore work that interests you! Also consider the kind of environment you want to work in. Do you prefer small teams and being outdoors? Consider life guarding or landscaping work. Or, if you see yourself thriving in customer service and interacting with lots of people everyday, a grocery store or restaurant position may be a better fit."

Some great job listing sites include LinkedIn, Glass Door, Indeed, and Monster, but there are many out there to try. Try entering “teen” in the search bar and then set your location to your town, county, or whatever radius you’re willing to travel (if you have a car or public transportation to use). [9] X Research source Keep in mind that not all the jobs that pop up will hire 15-year-olds. If the job listing doesn’t specify an age requirement, feel free to send them a message asking if they accept applications from 15-year-olds. In addition to job sites, ask your parents, neighbors, teachers, employed friends, or any other contacts you have if they know of any place that’s hiring teenagers. Sometimes, having a connection or recommendation can make a huge difference in landing the job! [10] X Research source Don’t be afraid to visit businesses in person, either. Following up on a “help wanted” sign in the window or simply asking a manager if they have any openings can make a strong first impression on potential employers."

      "content": "Make a simple resume and cover letter to submit with applications. As a 15-year-old, you probably don’t have much professional experience to flesh out a resume , and that’s OK! Instead, focus on other skills and experiences that make you unique and qualified for the job. This could include academic awards and accomplishments, volunteer experience, your hobbies and interests, or special skills like speaking another language or knowing how to code. Most jobs require a resume. A resume is essentially just a 1-page document that lists your work experience and previous jobs along with your primary responsibilities and accomplishments. Some applications may also require writing a cover letter , or a letter that complements your resume and introduces you to potential employers. Include information like why you want the job and feel qualified for it, how the job fits into your overall career goals, and what unique skills or perspectives you can bring to the position that set you apart from other candidates. For resume and cover letter help, feel free to use school resources like your guidance counselor, writing tutors, or even trusted teachers and coaches for feedback."

If a potential employer reaches out to schedule an interview, prepare yourself for some common questions they may ask and do some research on the company and their mission or goals so you’re fully informed on what they do. Wear a nice, clean, unwrinkled outfit (slacks or a skirt and a dress shirt or a nice dress are appropriate for most situations) and plan to arrive early in case of traffic or setbacks. Don’t be afraid to show a bit of personality in your interview! They may seem intimidating, but most employers want to know they’re hiring kind, dependable, easy-to-work-with, and motivated people (especially when they’re working with teens). Expect to get questions like: “Why are you interested in the position or company?” “Why are you a great fit for the role?” “What interests you about this type of work?” “When did you experience a problem or conflict, and how did you solve it?” “What do you hope to gain from this job? What are your career goals?” Unfortunately, not every employer will offer you an interview (such is the world of job hunting!). This doesn’t mean you’re a bad or unqualified candidate; there may have been a ton of applications for the same position, or they may have filled it before they even saw yours. Don’t take it personally and keep applying—you’ll find something eventually!"

The Fair labor Standards Act (FLSA) places restrictions on child labor to protect the health, well-being, and education of minors. Most notably, the law sets 14 years old as the minimum age for employment, bars minors from working in hazardous fields (like excavation or construction, driving, or operating dangerous equipment), and requires minors to be paid at least the federal minimum wage (though this may vary in certain circumstances). [12] X Trustworthy Source US Department of Labor Federal department responsible for promoting the wellbeing of workers Go to source The law also sets additional limits for the times of day and number of hours 14- and 15-year-old can work. Teens in this age range may not work: [13] X Trustworthy Source US Department of Labor Federal department responsible for promoting the wellbeing of workers Go to source More than 3 hours on a school day, including Fridays. More than 18 hours per week when school is in session. More than 8 hours per day when school is not in session. More than 40 hours per week when school is not in session. Before 7am or after 7pm on any day (except from June 1 through Labor Day, when night time work hours are extended to 9pm). Some of these requirements and restrictions are different and more lax for teenagers who are 16 or 17 years old, allowing them to work more hours and in more types of roles. The FLSA does not apply to agricultural jobs or ranching. There are exceptions to the rules for certain circumstances that may apply to you or your situation.
