      "title": "Store the tank upright in a dry, ventilated area away from your home.",
      "content": "Store the tank upright in a dry, ventilated area away from your home. Find a flat, sturdy surface to place the propane tank on so it doesn't tip over or roll away. Ensure the spot is well-ventilated and away from your home, like on your porch, next to your detached garage, or in an open-air shed. Just make sure the spot is mostly shaded so the tank is protected from direct sunlight and rain or snow. [1] X Research source As another idea, place your tank on the lower shelves of an outdoor shelving unit mounted to a secure wall. Always store a tank upright . If your tank were to leak, this ensures only gas comes out, not the liquid. This also helps the tank work better, since the over-pressure vent must be in contact with the propane vapor, not the liquid. Warning : Propane is very flammable, which is why it’s important to keep it away from your home and out of enclosed, unventilated spaces. The propane may leak and accumulate in the space, which can be a fire hazard. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the tank 10 ft (3 m) from heat sources and flammable materials. This includes open flames, sparks, heaters, and any electrical devices. Metallurgy expert Surekha Krishnan says heat sources and flammable materials can cause your tank to overheat or ignite on fire. Also, do not store extra tanks close together or near your grill. If one tank happens to ignite, you do not want other tanks nearby to ignite as well. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep your tank away from the vents and windows of your home.",
      "content": "Keep your tank away from the vents and windows of your home. Look for exterior vent grates and windows anywhere near your propane tank. Propane gas is heavier than air, so it will sink closer to the ground and may go into vents or basement windows. In case of a leak, you do not want to place tanks in an area where it could easily enter your home and contaminate the air, as it might ignite or explode. [4] X Research source Never store your propane tank near air conditioners, radiators, or heat vents since they could pull the gas into your home. They might also overheat or ignite the propane. Never store or use your tank inside the home. Tip : Propane has a distinct, rotten egg odor. If you smell this, the tank likely has a leak. If propane leaks into your home , evacuate the area immediately and call your local fire department."

      "title": "Ensure the tank is turned off when you’re not using it.",
      "content": "Ensure the tank is turned off when you’re not using it. To reduce the likelihood of leaks and potential fire hazards, turn off the propane tank whenever you’re not using it. Simply turn the valve on the top of the tank clockwise (to the right) to turn off the flow of propane. [5] X Research source Make sure any appliances the tank is connected to, such as a grill, are completely turned off when you’re not using them, too."

      "content": "Summer: Provide shade so the tank doesn’t get above 120°F (49°C). As the temperatures rise, the pressure inside your tank rises, too, which can potentially lead to an explosion. Keep your tank out of direct sunlight and in a shaded area during the warmer months so it doesn’t overheat. For instance, store it under trees, an awning, or inside an open shed. [6] X Research source This also keeps the tank out of the rain, which prevents it from rusting or getting damaged. Propane tanks have a release valve that will help relieve pressure if temperatures are consistently high. The built-up pressure will leak out and dissipate into the air. Warning : For the release valve to work properly and not leak liquid propane, the tank must remain upright. Make sure there are no sources of ignition near the tank so excess pressure does not light on fire."

      "title": "Winter: Keep your tank temperature above -40°F (-40°C).",
      "content": "Winter: Keep your tank temperature above -40°F (-40°C). Propane tanks can withstand freezing temperatures, so you don’t have to do too much to winterize your tank unless temperatures in your area regularly drop below -40°F (-40°C). As the temperatures drop, the pressure in your tank lowers, which can prevent it from working. Simply move the tank to a covered area so it doesn’t get snowed or rained on and monitor the tank pressure . [7] X Research source Keep your tank full so the pressure does not drop too low. In general, refill your tank when the pressure gauge is at or below 20%. Don't cover your propane tank to try to insulate it. This can block out the sun’s warmth and lower the pressure even more. If you live in a snowy area and can’t cover the tank, mark its location in case it gets buried so you can easily find it and clear away the snow. Warning : Never use a heater or electrical device to warm up your tank. This can potentially overheat the tank or ignite the propane."

      "content": "Use a storage cabinet or milk crate to keep the tank upright. Many home and garden stores sell special cabinets for propane tanks that are well-ventilated and keep the tanks upright. As another option, a standard-sized milk crate should hold a 20 pounds (9.1 kg) tank that you use for gas grills. [8] X Research source As another idea, build a barricade around the tank with cinder blocks or bricks. Just make sure to leave the valve and handles exposed. As another alternative, hide the tanks behind a slatted fence or trellis. It’s important to keep the tank upright to ensure that the valve doesn’t get damaged and gas doesn't leak."

Then, use a grill cover to protect the tank from the elements and direct sunlight. This makes it easier for you to use the grill at any time of the year. [9] X Research source If you store your grill in a garage or enclosed shed, remove the tank and leave it in a suitable place outside. Note : Do not store any extra propane tanks under or near the grill. This can potentially expose the working tank to flammable conditions. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "No, it is unsafe to store propane tanks indoors or under your house. Do not store propane tanks inside your home, garage, basement, cellar, or crawlspace. If the gas leaks, it will accumulate and contaminate the area, potentially leading to a fire or explosion. Even the spark of starting a vehicle or lawn mower could ignite a propane leak and cause a dangerous accident. [11] X Research source It’s only safe to store propane tanks “inside” if the structure is open, well-ventilated, and detached from your house. For instance, it’s okay to store your tank in an open-air shed or under a carport."

      "content": "Ensure the valve is closed when the tank is not in use. Turn the valve clockwise (right) until it is hand-tight. This helps prevent any possible gas leaks from escaping the tank. If you smell an odor similar to rotten eggs or a skunk's spray, propane may be leaking from your tank. Check the valve to ensure that it is all the way turned off. [12] X Research source If the leak is only evident when the valve is on, check for a leak at the line connection to the tank (be sure the connection is tight) or for leaks along the length of any flexible line (where it may have been mechanically damaged or chewed by a rodent). If a fuel line is damaged or the connection to the tank cannot be properly sealed, replace it. If you still smell a leak , call a registered liquified petroleum technician to examine the tank. They’ll be able to determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced."

      "content": "Check for leaks whenever you disconnect or reconnect the tank. Before you unhook or reconnect a propane tank to your grill or another appliance, the experts at Jones Welding Company recommend that you “inspect the propane cylinder, hose, and connections for any leaks.” They suggest that you “apply a leak gas solution detector,” like Snoop Liquid Leak Detector , around the valve and hose connections. If the solution bubbles, there’s likely a leak. So, “shut off the gas supply and fix the issue before proceeding.” If you can’t fix the leak, call a registered liquified petroleum technician to examine and repair your tank. Alternatively, spray the valve and connections with dish soap mixed with water. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak. [14] X Research source"

Even if there doesn't seem to be any damage, the tanks may have internal wear and tear. Simply check the expiration date stamped on your tank to see if it needs to be inspected by a liquified petroleum technician. [16] X Research source After doing the initial inspection, get your tank checked every 5 years. The inspector will re-stamp the tank with a new expiration date."

[17] X Research source Or, place the propane tank between your front and back seat and use a bungee cord to prevent it from moving around. Keep your windows rolled down so the car is well-ventilated. [18] X Research source If you have to place the tank in your trunk, set it inside a milk crate so it stays upright. Head directly to your destination—do not stop to do other errands or keep the tank in your car longer than it needs to. This is especially important when it’s hot outside."
