      "content": "Get the right size shoe. If you have not bought shoes for a while, consider getting your foot size measured at the store. People's feet tend to change sizes as they age, and you do not want to buy a shoe that is too small or too large. Many flats also come in narrow, normal/medium, and wide widths. If you have very narrow or very wide feet, this is something you might want to consider."

      "content": "Know that there are different types of flats. Most flat shoes will come in different heights: below the ankle, above the ankle, and boot height. Here are some examples of the different types of flats: Below the ankle flats, such as Converse, moccasins, loafers, pointy-toed flats, and ballet flats, help legs appear longer. Above the ankle flats, such as low boots, military boots, high top Converse, and sandals with ankle straps, tend to make legs look shorter. Flat boots are great for the winter, and can help legs look more slender. Consider getting boots that have a slight dip in the front. These can be flattering on all body types. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider matching your shoe to your body type. Everybody can wear flats, but certain styles paired with certain outfits look more flattering on certain body types than others. If you have a petite body, consider pairing flats with skinny jeans that hit at the ankle. This will help to make you appear taller. Stick to more pointed toes rather than rounded toes. If you have an hourglass shape, wear flats with dresses that finish above the knees. If you have fuller shaped legs, choose flats in a lighter color. This will make what you are wearing the focal point, rather than drawing attention to your legs and feet. Nude-colored shoes also tend to make legs look longer. If you have a tall body, consider pairing flats with a loose top and leggings. If you want to make your legs look longer or leaner, opt for a very slight heel."

For example, you pair some skinny pants with white canvas sneakers and a black shirt. Keep warm with a black jacket and a red, plaid scarf."

Most important of all, you want to be comfortable, especially if you will be on your feet for long periods of time. Here are some things to consider: If you work retail, refer to your company's dress code to learn what colors and styles of shoe are acceptable. Consider choosing a simple, comfortable flat, such as loafers or sneakers. Most companies will ask you to wear a solid-colored black or brown shoe. If you work in an office, sneakers might be too casual and heels might be too painful. Consider getting a pair of pointy-toed flats. They are the best alternative to painful heels while still looking formal. They work great with dress pants and pencil skirts. [8] X Research source A cute work outfit can consist of a white blouse with lace insets, a black pencil skirt, and black pointy-toed flats with ankle straps. Polish up your appearance with some red lipstick, a ponytail or braid, and a classic pearl necklace. [9] X Research source"

You also want to be comfortable, especially if you need to walk far to get from class to class. Choose shoes that are comfortable, and don't wiggle or slip off your feet; the last thing you'd want is to lose a shoe while you are hurrying to your next class. Here are some cute outfit ideas to get you started: In the fall, pair some skinny jeans with pointy flats, a loose-fitting blouse, and a jacket. Keep your hair loose and your makeup simple. [10] X Research source In the winter, consider pairing some skinny pants with cozy boots. Wear a long cardigan or sweater over a fitted shirt, and cinch them around your waist with a thick belt. Accessorize with a loose scarf, and keep your jewelry to a minimum; you don't want it to get caught on anything. In the spring and summer, consider pairing some light-colored ballet flats with a flirty, pastel knee-length skirt and a white blouse. If it is colder, switch the skirt out of a pair of skinny jeans."

      "content": "Coming up with casual outfit ideas. Try to pair simple flats with a fancier outfit. Most people associate simplicity with comfort, and comfort with casualness. A simple pair of canvas sneakers or ballet flats does not mean that the rest of your outfit has to be mundane. Here are some ideas to spruce up the rest of your outfit while still looking casual: Accessorize. Wear some jewelry, a cute belt, or a scarf. If you can, try to match your accessories to your shoes. This will tie your entire outfit together. Go with layers. This is a great way to make any outfit more interesting. It will also give your more opportunities to match a piece of your outfit to your shoes. An example of layering would be: skinny jeans, a scoop-necked white blouse, and a green cardigan. Finish the outfit off with a pair of green, pointy-toed flats and a brown belt. Match your shoes to your outerwear. If it is chilly, you can layer your outfit further by throwing on a fashionable coat, a cute jacket, a cozy cardigan, or a flannel shirt. This will not only keep you warm, but it will also make your outfit look more interesting. Again, try to match the color of your outerwear to your shoes."

There are a few things that can make any pair of flats look dressier. Here are some things you should consider: Pointy-toed flats can look very formal. They are the next best thing to heels. Flats made from patent or metallic materials tend to look more formal than fabric ones. Dress sandals with embellishments, such as silver chains, rhinestones, and brooches can also look very dressy. Try to match your jewelry to these embellishments."

      "content": "Dress for the weather. Most flats are going to be warm-weather type shoes. As such, you should avoid wearing sandals, ballet flats, and pointy-toed flats during the cold months. Save those for the warmer months. When the cold weather rolls around, stick with boots. You might be able to wear sneakers during the colder months, depending on how wet, snowy, or cold it is."

      "content": "Wear flats with socks to keep warm and reduce sweat/odor. This does not mean that you have to wear thick socks with every type of flat, however. Here are the types of socks you should pair with different types of flats: Wear open-top, below the ankle flats (such as ballet flats) with thin, sheer socks. You can also get low-cut or hidden socks. [11] X Research source Below the ankle shoes that do work with socks include: brogues, loafers, creepers, derbies, and Converse. Avoid wearing ballet flats and other open-top flats with socks and tights. This causes the fabric to bunch up and wrinkle in the toe area. Pair above the ankle flats and boots with socks or tights."

      "content": "Consider getting an arch support shoe insert. Most flats lack proper arch support. This can make them uncomfortable or painful to wear for some people. If your flats are not comfortable enough for you, check the inside sole and see if there is enough arch support. If not, get a shoe insert that has extra padding in the arch area. It will make them more comfortable to wear."

This does not mean that you have to wear crew socks with every pair of flats that you own. For example: Ballet flats and other types of flats that leave the top of the foot exposed won't look very good with crew socks. Consider wearing them with low-cut or hidden-liner socks. They will protect your feet, but they won't show beyond your shoe. Flat sandals will have to be worn barefoot. Fortunately, all those open spaces give your feet plenty of ventilation and reduce sweat."

If you own a pair of flats that slip off the back of your heel with every step you take, you may end up with calluses and blisters on the back of your heel. You can keep your shoes in place with some heel inserts. For example: If your shoes fit well and only slip a little, you might just need a little bit of cushioning, such as a strip of adhesive suede or moleskin. If your shoes are a little bit on the large side, consider getting a cushioned heel insert. It's shaped like a long oval, and sticks right onto the inside of your shoe's heel. They are usually made out of foam or gel."

      "content": "Prevent blisters with strips of adhesive moleskin. If you have a pair of ballerina flats that dig into your heel, or some flat dress sandals that bite into your toes, you might want to consider getting some moleskin. This will help soften any sharp edges and reduce friction. Simply cut the moleskin to the shape of the affected area, peel off the paper backing, and stick it right into the shoe. You can buy moleskin in shoe supply stores, in the shoe department of a department store, or in the orthopedic section of a drugstore/pharmacy."

      "content": "Know how to make too small shoes a bit bigger. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to make shoes made from synthetic materials (such as plastic, vinyl, and pleather) bigger. Fortunately, it is possible to make shoes made out of natural materials (such as fabric, leather, and suede) bigger. Here are a few tips: If your shoes are made from a natural material: put on a pair of thick socks, then put on the shoes. Turn on a hair dryer and blow the warm air over the shoes for a few minutes. Wait until the shoes cool off, then take them off. They should now be a little bit larger. Use a shoe stretcher. Buy a shoe stretcher and put it inside your shoe. Twist the knobs until you get the size you need. Spray the shoe with a special she stretching spray. Wait for the spray to dry before taking the stretcher out. Take the shoe to a shoe cobbler."
