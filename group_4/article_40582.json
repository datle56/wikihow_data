Designed to be lightweight, running shoes keep your feet from overheating. Dress for the weather—for example, wear a long sleeve thermal in the winter."

Stick to shaded areas if the weather's too sunny, and head to an indoor track if it rains. Start on smooth surfaces, like sidewalks, and work up to uneven terrain. If you plan to run in more isolated locations, like hills, then bring a friend or two. [3] X Research source Remember to wear reflective running gear if you train at night. Always bring your phone in case of an emergency. Avoid wearing headphones so you can stay aware of your surroundings. Apply sunscreen when the weather's hot and wear waterproof attire when it rains."

      "content": "Dynamic stretches loosen up your muscles and prepare you to run. Right before you run, practice dynamic—also known as \"active\"—stretching. To increase your flexibility so your runs are easier, try dynamic stretches that make you move, like leg swings or walking lunges. When you take this precaution, you’ll also avoid any muscle sprains or injuries. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Knee-high walking, skipping, and walking butt kicks are other popular dynamic stretches. Since you pump your arms when you run, also try arm circles or arm swings. Dynamic stretches are similar to the movements you make while you run, so they'll warm up the right muscles. That way, they won't lock up when you train."

      "content": "Dynamic posture helps you run with speed, comfort, and efficiency. For best results, use dynamic posture, a way to move all the joints in your body for more effortless jogs or runs. Take quick and short strides—about 180 foot strikes per minute—and move your elbows in the same rhythm as your knees. Make sure your knees move forward and backwards without twisting. Look up as you jog or run to keep your head slightly raised. [8] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Once brisk walks become too easy, you'll be ready to either jog or run. This next step gives you a great opportunity to perfect your dynamic posture. It's important to use dynamic posture every time you jog or run to create the right habits, develop the right form, and avoid injury. Dynamic posture becomes more important as you run longer distance and need to avoid tiring out your body with inefficient movements."

That way, you'll be able to complete your runs without wearing yourself out. Since you'll find the pace easy to maintain, it's likely that you'll get a boost of confidence and look forward to your workouts. [9] X Research source Even experienced long-distance runners mostly prefer to keep the same pace. Maintaining your pace gives you the best \"fuel economy,\" which means you burn the least amount of energy no matter how far you run."

[10] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source If you have an off day, sore muscles, or fatigue, break up your exercise routine. You might want to do three 10-minute jogs, for instance. When you're done, you can pat yourself on the back for hitting your daily goal. Steer clear of doing a week's worth of exercise in 1-2 days—that way, you'll avoid an overtraining injury from pushing your body's limits. Try cross-training to keep things fresh and exciting. Alternate running with biking or swimming to boost your cardio health and become a better runner."

Thirty minutes of continuous activity that doesn't tire you out or leave you out of breath is a great sign you've gained more cardio endurance. If that's the case, go for a longer distance. For example, if you can run 1 mile (1.6 km) easily, try to cover 2 miles (3.2 km) in one training session. That way, you'll be close to running a 5K, or 3 miles, one day.

Also eat a diet with plenty of carbs, healthy fats, and protein so you'll give your body fuel for long-distance runs. [15] X Research source Sip water before, during, and after a run.

[16] X Research source While you might've heard about \"carb loading\" for runs, doctors actually recommend that you stick to a balanced diet that doesn't just focus on carbs.
