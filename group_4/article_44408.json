      "title": "Decide where to travel.",
      "content": "Decide where to travel. The world is a big place, and there are many, many different places you can visit. Decide if you want to spend all of your time in a single country, a single continent, or if you truly want to travel over the entire globe. It can be helpful to start your international travel in a location you've been to before, and branch out further from there. Certain countries (especially in Asia) can be less expensive for Western travelers, although they may lack some of the amenities that we've grown used to. Certain regions are also better set up to accommodate tourists and travelers, by offering hostels and other accommodations. (For example, New Zealand is well set up for travelers, while Japan is less so.) However, if you're looking for a more adventurous travel experience and want to avoid places most international travelers visit, you may want to plan to visit less accommodating destinations."

      "content": "Make a travel schedule. Before you jump on a plane, train, or ship, you'll need to have at least a rough idea of where you'll be going and how long you'll spend at each destination. It can be easy for a worldwide vacation to take more time than anticipated, so try to set out as specific of a schedule as possible before you leave. Alternately, some people prefer to leave their travel open-ended, and to only plan one week and one destination into the future. [1] X Research source How long do you want your trip to be? Your schedule will be dramatically different if you want to travel the world for a month, 6 months, or a full year. Plan ahead for how your world travel will fit into your life back home. Are you going to quit your job, or will your employer allow you to work while you travel?"

      "title": "Research the country (or countries) you'll be traveling to.",
      "content": "Research the country (or countries) you'll be traveling to. Do your homework about histories and current events in each country you plan to visit when you travel across the world. This will help you be aware of any local customs you need to follow and any conflicts or dangerous areas of the country you should avoid. If you know any individuals in a country you'll be traveling too (even if they're only the friend of a friend), get in touch and ask them about any disruptive political or cultural events that may interfere with your travel plan."

      "title": "Budget for your international travel.",
      "content": "Budget for your international travel. The expense of round-the-world travel is a major deterrent for many people. In addition to the plane tickets and other travel fees, you will need to pay for food and lodging, both of which quickly become expensive. [2] X Research source Plan this out (as much as possible) ahead of time, so that you can limit your spending and will not be unpleasantly surprised by your expenditures once your trip has ended. [3] X Research source Start planning well ahead of time and decide how you're going to fund your trip. For example, if you're going to pay for everything out of a savings account, you may need to work extra hours for months on end to fund your travel. A general rule of thumb is to try not to exceed $50 a day (not including air fare.) [4] X Research source Avoid expensive travel options within a country; travel by foot or local transportation whenever possible, and keep an eye out for budget-friendly airline or train options. Unless eating in restaurants when you travel is important to you, avoid them. Restaurants quickly become expensive, and you can buy groceries and cook your meals for much less money. Put a cap on your spending: an amount that you absolutely cannot exceed, and make sure that your budget doesn't put you over that amount."

      "content": "Let your travel pay for itself. If you have the time and interest, you may be able to travel extremely inexpensively by either uniting your travel goals and your employment, or by taking a few cost-cutting measures for lodging. Work for an international teaching organization. Operations like the EKIP Program allow you to teach English overseas for an extended period of time, often with the majority of your expenses paid. Stay at hostels when you travel. [5] X Research source Hostels are inexpensive, generally safe environments to spend a few nights in while you're traveling. Work on a cruise ship. These are built to travel, and you'll be generating an income at the same time."

      "content": "Learn some universal phrases. It would be a huge undertaking to learn the language of each country you want to visit when you travel the world, but you can make traveling easier by memorizing a few key phrases in each country's language to help you communicate with the locals and get around. Learn how to: Greet and thank someone. How to agree and disagree (a polite “yes” or “no). How to ask how much money something costs. How to ask where a place is located (the bathroom, the library, a restaurant, the airport or train station, etc.)."

      "title": "Compare methods of travel ahead of time.",
      "content": "Compare methods of travel ahead of time. You will likely have the option of traveling by ship, train, or airplane. All of these methods will have multi-country ticket plans. Price out around-the-world ticket packages for the countries you want to visit so you can choose the most economical form of travel. Although financial saving may be your main goal, also consider the speed and safety of the methods of travel you are considering."

      "title": "Update your passport.",
      "content": "Update your passport. Traveling to other countries requires you to have a valid passport. Planning to start traveling the world will be much easier and more efficient if you have this well ahead of time. The passport application process can take 4 to 6 weeks to complete, so give yourself a few months before you plan to travel in order to acquire this documentation. If you do not have a passport, the best place to look for instruction is online. There are online forms you can fill out to receive your passport. [6] X Research source You can also fill out and submit the passport paperwork at your local post office."

      "title": "Get a visa, if necessary.",
      "content": "Get a visa, if necessary. Certain countries will require you to have a travel visa before entering, while others only need to see a passport. (For example, American citizens do not need a travel visa to enter the EU.) The document will specify your reason for being in a country, and how long you anticipate staying. [7] X Research source In addition, different countries have distinct visas, and you will need a separate visa for each visa-requiring country you travel to. Some visas last for more time than others. Check before you start traveling. You'll need to know if your visa lasts for five years, three years, or only one year. Check the U.S. State Department website to see if you need a travel visa for your intended destination. The State Department can also provide the paperwork you'll fill out to apply for a visa."

      "title": "Update your immunizations.",
      "content": "Update your immunizations. Although this is not a glamorous part of the travel process, it will benefit you immensely. [8] X Research source Foreign countries may have different diseases from those you could contract in your native country, so it's best to inform your doctor of every region you'll be traveling to and ask which immunizations they recommend. Be sure to heed any travel health warnings in the countries you'll be visiting. Always check local and national health warnings before traveling to a new region. Be sure to pack any prescription or over-the-counter medications you need, since these could be difficult to acquire overseas."

      "title": "Pack as conservatively as possible for your world travel.",
      "content": "Pack as conservatively as possible for your world travel. You should bring only essentials in your luggage. Heavy luggage and multiple bags will only weight you down and increase the cost of your travel. Bring sturdy, comfortable shoes and clothing that can be layered to accommodate changing climates. Leave expensive electronics and valuable jewelry at home."

      "title": "Stay healthy.",
      "content": "Stay healthy. Getting sick when traveling in other countries will be time-consuming and take the fun out of the adventure, so take care of your health before you leave and when you travel. When you're traveling, follow these general health tips: Get plenty of sleep, especially if you're often changing time zones. Avoid drinking too much alcohol, this will dehydrate you and can lead to poor decisions. Drink plenty of purified water. Unless you've checked ahead of time, the tap water at your destination may not be as clean and safe to drink as your local water at home. Eat a somewhat balanced diet. In unfamiliar countries, it can be tempting to eat an unhealthy diet (or even one comprised of junk food). Keep yourself healthy by eating regular, balanced meals. Wash your hands often."

      "content": "Invest in a global cell phone. Most domestic cell phones (i.e. the phone you currently use) will build up exorbitant fees if you use them internationally. You can be a world traveler and still stay in touch with family and friends by purchasing a universal cell phone that will work all over the world. [9] X Research source Before you look into an international cell phone, check with your current cell provider—they may be able to add an international calling plan for an additional monthly charge. [10] X Research source Depending on the number of countries you'll be traveling in, and the duration of your stay(s), it may be more practical to rent an international phone in each country, rather than buying a single phone for your entire trip. [11] X Research source International cell phones sometimes require that you buy separate SIM cards or recharge it with more minutes, but will keep you in constant contact with familiar people."

[12] X Research source Whether through a phone call, a Skype or FaceTime session, or sending a postcard, communicating with your friends and loved ones will help bridge the distance and keep you from feeling homesick."
