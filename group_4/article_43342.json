      "title": "It could mean she wants you to pursue her.",
      "content": "It could mean she wants you to pursue her . Even if she really likes you, she may wait for you to text her so she doesn’t seem desperate. Don’t take it as an insult if she never initiates your conversations and don’t get discouraged. If you like her, message her! Once the conversation gets going, who cares who started it? It’s nice to feel wanted, and if she’s waiting for you to start the conversation, it could mean that she wants you to want her. Don’t read too much into it, either. If you want to text her, then text her! Try sending something fun like a meme or a picture of your cat to get the conversation started. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "A delayed response could mean she’s playing hard to get . Even though you may feel the need to respond right away when she sends you a text, if she doesn’t instantly respond to your messages, don’t get upset. She may be trying to play hard to get to see if you’ll keep sending her messages. If she continues to respond, even if it takes her a minute, keep at it! [2] X Research source It’s also possible that she’s busy with something and can’t immediately respond to you. In that case, it’s really important that you show restraint or you could come off as needy . Give her a chance to respond before you make a judgment.

      "title": "She might be testing your patience.",
      "content": "She might be testing your patience. If she’s putting minimal effort into her responses, it doesn’t necessarily mean that she thinks you’re annoying. Remember, she’s still responding to you when she doesn’t have to, so she’s still interested in texting you. Keep your cool and keep the conversation going . It could all be a way for her to find out how hard you’ll work to try to win her over. [4] X Research source If all of her texts are one-word responses, she may not be super interested. But if it’s an occasional thing, it could also be because she’s busy at the moment or may not be a fan of texting in general."

      "title": "She may be trying to see if you react negatively.",
      "content": "She may be trying to see if you react negatively. She might try to make you feel bad for taking so long to text her or say that she’s been waiting for you all day. Even if she’s just playfully teasing you, don’t apologize. Apologizing for no reason could tell her that you’re okay with being treated unreasonably. Instead, just tell her that you were busy or you weren’t able to check your phone. For instance, if she texts you something like, “Where have you been? I’ve been waiting for you to respond.” You can say something like, “I was working, how was your day?” or something cheeky like, “In class, did you miss me that much?”"

      "title": "Finding out about your previous relationships could mean she likes you.",
      "content": "Finding out about your previous relationships could mean she likes you. Most girls will want to know about your exes the more they get to know you. Don’t lie or shy away from the questions. She might be testing you to see how honest you are about them. She may also be trying to figure out why your relationships ended to see if you’re good relationship material. Just be honest and open with her. Try not to bad talk your exes to make yourself look better or you could come off as arrogant. [5] X Research source For example, if she asks something like, “Why did you guys break up?” Say something like, “It just didn’t work out and we’re still friends” instead of something like, “Oh, she was crazy.”"

      "title": "She might be trying to see if you’re the jealous type.",
      "content": "She might be trying to see if you’re the jealous type. Pay attention to what she says because it could be a way of her telling you what she doesn’t like in a relationship, especially if she talks negatively about an ex. Don’t lose your cool or get jealous. That may be exactly what she’s testing—whether or not you’re possessive or the jealous type. Getting to know about her past relationships is a natural part of getting to know her. [6] X Research source For example, if she texts something like, “Yeah I saw that movie with my ex,” don’t react negatively. Instead, try to just continue the conversation with something like, “That’s cool, was it any good?”"

      "title": "It could be a test to see if you’ll commit to making future plans.",
      "content": "It could be a test to see if you’ll commit to making future plans. It doesn’t matter if it’s 5 minutes before you were supposed to meet or 5 days. If she suddenly cancels on you, don’t get upset or question her reasoning. Stay calm and tell her that you can try to get together some other time. Then, start working to set up another date or meeting to show her that you’re still interested in pursuing her. [7] X Research source If she texts you saying that she can’t make it, try saying something like, “No worries, let’s try to get together soon.” Keep in mind that if she cancels on you multiple times, it may be because she’s not interested . If she cancels more than 3 times, it may be time for you to move on ."

      "title": "It could be a coincidence or it could be her testing your reaction.",
      "content": "It could be a coincidence or it could be her testing your reaction. If you’re texting her and you mention some event or party that you’re going to, don’t act suspicious if she texts back saying that she’s going to be there as well. This is good news! Tell her that you’re excited to see her there. You could even make plans to get together before or after the event. Use it as an opportunity to show her that you’re interested. [8] X Research source For example, if she tells you that she’ll be at the same party, you could say something like, “That’s awesome! Do you want to grab some pizza beforehand?”"

      "title": "She may be trying to get you to offer her a ride.",
      "content": "She may be trying to get you to offer her a ride. Of course, she could also be genuinely saying that she plans to drive herself. But it never hurts to offer to pick her up. Even if she declines, she may be grateful for your willingness to offer. If she accepts, then even better! [9] X Research source For instance, if she says she’ll meet you at the restaurant, bar, or event, you could say something simple like, “Need a lift?” It’s innocent and harmless and shows that you’re courteous."

      "content": "She might be trying to see how willing you are to help her. If she asks you for assistance doing something simple like helping run some errands or moving furniture could be because she really needs your help. But it could also be because she wants to see how willing you are to go out of your way for her. It could also mean that she wants to spend more time with you. Whatever the case, it’s a win-win for you! [10] X Research source"
