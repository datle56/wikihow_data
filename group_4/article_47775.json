      "title": "This classic smooch is one you can do almost anywhere.",
      "content": "This classic smooch is one you can do almost anywhere. Lean in toward your boyfriend and purse your lips slightly, keeping your mouth closed. Gently press your lips against his for a few seconds, then pull away. [2] X Research source A quick peck on the lips is probably fine to do in public, as long as you keep it short! You always want to fit together like a puzzle when you kiss. It should be comfortable, not awkward! [3] X Expert Source Eddy Baller Dating Coach Expert Interview. 7 February 2020."

      "title": "Save this kiss for a makeout session with your BF.",
      "content": "Save this kiss for a makeout session with your BF. Lean in close and touch your lips together, then part your mouth just slightly. Slowly press your tongue into his mouth, then take it right back out again. The key here is not to put your entire tongue in his mouth—start with just the tip, and then follow his lead. [4] X Research source French kissing is a little more intimate than a close-mouthed kiss. When you’ve reached French kiss level, it means you two are more comfortable with each other. Always try to match your partner when you're kissing. [5] X Expert Source Eddy Baller Dating Coach Expert Interview. 7 February 2020."

      "title": "A nibble here and there can really get you both in the mood.",
      "content": "A nibble here and there can really get you both in the mood. As you two are making out, try gently (GENTLY!) nibbling on your BF’s lips, earlobe, neck, or jawline. Make sure you’re not biting down hard enough to leave a mark, and if he pulls away or flinches, stop and ask if he’s okay. [6] X Research source If you bite down too hard, you also run the risk of leaving a hickey. Hickies are annoying to deal with, and your boyfriend probably doesn’t want to explain any rogue red marks to his friends or family."

    {
      "title": "Use your tongue to trace your BF’s lips before a makeout session.",
      "content": "Use your tongue to trace your BF’s lips before a makeout session. Bring your face close to his, but before you lips touch, slowly stick out your tongue and use it to trace his lower lip. Try not to use too much saliva, and just go gently so that it almost tickles. This move will drive him crazy! [7] X Research source If you’re feeling bold, you can try this one in public (but probably not around the parents). Otherwise, save it for a private time where you two can really savor the moment."

    {
      "title": "Similar to the French kiss, this one involves some tongue action.",
      "content": "Similar to the French kiss, this one involves some tongue action. When your closed mouth is pressed against your boyfriend’s mouth, quickly stick the tip of your tongue out, then pull it back in (like a lizard would). These small, gentle motions can really rile you both up, and it’s a fun way to mix up your makeout sessions if you’re bored of traditional French kissing. [8] X Research source Worried about swapping spit? Don’t be! Studies show that sharing saliva with someone can actually boost your immune system, leading to a healthier, happier you.

      "title": "Spice things up with this steamy kiss.",
      "content": "Spice things up with this steamy kiss. If your makeout session is getting a little boring, part ways and lean down to lightly kiss your boyfriend’s neck. The neck is an erogenous zone, meaning there are lots of nerve endings in it—which makes a light kiss feel absolutely crazy! [10] X Research source You can also aim for his jawline to get his engine revving. Feeling confident with your neck kissing skills? Mix it up by introducing a slight nibble or bite."

      "title": "Tickle your BF’s fancy with a small smooch on the ear.",
      "content": "Tickle your BF’s fancy with a small smooch on the ear. Another erogenous zone, the earlobe can really get him riled up for whatever happens next. Lean over and gently kiss, suck, or bite his earlobe (and don’t be afraid to use some tongue action, too). [11] X Research source Not everyone is into the ear kiss, and that’s okay. If your boyfriend tenses up or pulls away, move onto a different spot."

      "title": "Your hands are some of the most sensitive parts of your body.",
      "content": "Your hands are some of the most sensitive parts of your body. Grab your BF’s hand and gently kiss the tips of his fingers and his palms. If you’re really feeling it, you can even take one of his fingers into your mouth and gently swirl your tongue around it. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "This playful tease lets your BF know there’s more to come.",
      "content": "This playful tease lets your BF know there’s more to come. Lean in and gently kiss his bottom lip while he kisses your top one (or vice versa). Since your mouths aren’t completely pressed together, it’s a nice way to tell him that you’re ready for more later. [13] X Research source Most people lean to the right when they kiss, according to a study in the Scientific Journal. When in doubt, lean that way! [14] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "A kiss on the eyelid tells your BF that you’ll always be there for him.",
      "content": "A kiss on the eyelid tells your BF that you’ll always be there for him. When you two are relaxing together or laying down, lean over and give him a smooch on his (closed) eyelid. Be gentle, and keep your pecks light—otherwise, your angel kiss won’t be much fun. [15] X Research source This is a nice kiss to use if your boyfriend is ever feeling stressed or anxious. It can really help calm him down and let him know that you’ll always be there for him."

    {
      "title": "Pause on your way down south to give his lower stomach a smooch.",
      "content": "Pause on your way down south to give his lower stomach a smooch. This area of your BF’s body actually has a ton of nerve endings too, so some light kisses can really make it come to life. Try gently kissing, sucking, and even nibbling on his tummy to mix up your makeout sessions. [16] X Research source If you’re feeling brave, you can even lightly press down on his stomach to increase the sensations (but only if his bladder is empty)."

    {
      "title": "The inner arms are so sensitive, and so often ignored.",
      "content": "The inner arms are so sensitive, and so often ignored. Bring your mouth down to the inside of your BF’s elbow, then gently kiss it or brush your tongue across it. This erogenous zone will give him shivers and make him excited for whatever happens next. [17] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "If his feet are clean, consider stimulating those nerve endings.",
      "content": "If his feet are clean, consider stimulating those nerve endings. If kissing on feet isn’t your thing, don’t worry—a foot massage works just as well. Grab some lotion or massage oil and gently press into the balls of his feet and his arches. If you want to add a few kisses to the experience, go for it! [18] X Research source If feet are your thing (there’s no shame in it!), try sucking on his toes. This can be really erotic, especially since the feet are often left out of foreplay."
    },
    {
      "title": "Some men really enjoy nipple stimulation.",
      "content": "Some men really enjoy nipple stimulation. If your BF already has his shirt off, try leaning down and giving his nipple a quick kiss or suck. If he moans and leans into you, that probably means he likes it—but if he tenses up or backs up, he might want you to stop. [19] X Research source Having a hard time reading his body language ? Just ask! Something simple like, “Do you like this?” won’t ruin the mood, and it’s nice to get confirmation that your partner is enjoying what you’re doing."

      "title": "Greet your BF with this sweet peck and a hug.",
      "content": "Greet your BF with this sweet peck and a hug. If you haven’t seen each other in a while, let him know how happy you are to be by his side. Lean in and embrace him while locking lips, then hold it for a couple of seconds. He’ll be so happy with your greeting, he won’t even know what to say! [20] X Research source If you’re in public, keep your embrace under 5 seconds."

    {
      "title": "This sweet kiss is a symbol of your love for each other.",
      "content": "This sweet kiss is a symbol of your love for each other. If your boyfriend is being particularly nice or you just feel a lot of love in the moment, lean over and give him a quick peck on the forehead. A forehead kiss is a great way to show affection while letting him know that you don’t need anything in return. [21] X Research source A forehead kiss can be romantic, but some people use it on their friends and family members, too. You could also try kissing him on the top of the head for the same effect."

    {
      "title": "Show your boyfriend that you’re thinking of him with this kiss.",
      "content": "Show your boyfriend that you’re thinking of him with this kiss. If he says something sweet or hilariously funny, lean over and give him a quick peck on the cheek. This kiss symbolizes how happy you are to be with him, and it’s a way to show affection in public that isn’t too offensive. [22] X Research source Cheek kisses are another kiss that you can probably use with close friends or family members, as long as everyone is comfortable with it."

    {
      "title": "This light kiss actually uses your eyelashes.",
      "content": "This light kiss actually uses your eyelashes. Bring your face in close to your BF’s, then press your eyelashes against his cheek or forehead. Gently blink up and down to flutter your eyelashes against his skin and give him a bit of a tickle. [23] X Research source This is a fun kiss to do if you’re tired of your traditional lip kisses or hello kisses."

    {
      "title": "Rub your noses together to show off your sweet side.",
      "content": "Rub your noses together to show off your sweet side. Lean in close to your BF and gently tap the tip of his nose with your own. Rub your noses back and forth for a cute, sappy gesture to show your love for each other. [24] X Research source While this isn’t technically a “lip kiss,” it’s still one you’ll probably want to do in private."
    },
    {
      "title": "This is a common greeting that you can use with your boyfriend.",
      "content": "This is a common greeting that you can use with your boyfriend. When you first see each other, place your cheek next to his and make a kissing sound right next to his ear. If you want to, you can do the same thing on the other side, too. [25] X Research source This is an inoffensive way to say hello to your boyfriend. It’s a great one to use in front of parents or family members who don’t love PDA."

    {
      "title": "Mix things up by recreating this iconic upside down kiss.",
      "content": "Mix things up by recreating this iconic upside down kiss. Have your boyfriend lay on the bed or the couch with his head hanging toward you. Lean over and give him a smooch on the lips to mimic Spider Man and MJ’s famous movie kiss. You can recreate this one even better if your hair is wet from the shower! (MJ gets caught in that rain storm right before her big kiss, so she’s also a little damp)."

    {
      "title": "Play a fun game by putting on your favorite lip gloss.",
      "content": "Play a fun game by putting on your favorite lip gloss . Make out with your partner until their lips are also coated with the gloss, then step back and ask him to guess the flavor. If he guesses right, you get to decide what he wins! You could even use tinted lip gloss, as long as your boyfriend is okay with it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swap candy, food, or even alcohol with a kiss.",
      "content": "Swap candy , food, or even alcohol with a kiss. Put a piece of sweet candy or a swig of alcohol in your mouth, then hold it there. Lean in close and kiss your boyfriend on the mouth, then gently push whatever is in your mouth into his. When you pull away, he’ll have a mouth full of something delicious! Make sure you tell your BF that this is happening ahead of time, since it can be pretty jarring to get something in your mouth that you weren’t expecting to."

    {
      "title": "If you live near a pool or a lake, this one’s for you.",
      "content": "If you live near a pool or a lake, this one’s for you. Have your boyfriend dive underwater, then follow him down deep. Keep a lungful of air as you dive, then press your lips against his underwater. Gently push the air into his mouth so he can breathe it and stay under just a little bit longer. If you don’t want to push air into your partner’s mouth, simply give him a peck on the lips as you two are underwater."
