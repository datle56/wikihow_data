Some commonly accepted exemptions may be listed on the summons, as well as what documentation the court requires to prove the exemption applies to you. [1] X Research source Carefully note any dates on your summons, including the dates you’ve been called to jury duty. You will have to include these dates in your jury excuse letter and may need to provide them to anyone whom you need to write a letter on your behalf as documentation. For example, if you cannot appear for work-related reasons, you may need a letter from your boss that tells the court why you cannot be spared from work on those days."

      "content": "Check the court’s rules for exemptions. Write down the rule number or statute number of any exemptions that fit your situation. There may be some general rules in state and federal law, but each court also has its own rules regarding the types of people who are generally exempt from jury duty. In addition to those listed on your summons, check the court website or call the clerk’s office to learn any other common exemptions. Here are some common reasons to be exempt from court : [2] X Research source Being employed as a public official, police officer, or firefighter (for federal court) [3] X Research source Serving active duty in the armed forces Being over the age of 70 or 80 Having medical issues or disabilities Employment conflict or financial hardship Being a breastfeeding mother or having active care and custody of young children, elderly, or disabled family members Being a full-time high school or college student Some excuses allow you to be excused from jury duty, while others only allow you to have your service deferred for a specific time. Make sure you know whether you're eligible for a complete excuse or a deferral so you ask for the right thing. Many states, like Massachusetts, have strict legal requirements regarding disqualification from jury duty for medical reasons. If you plan on claiming a medical excuse, read these requirements carefully and talk to your doctor before writing your letter.

Keep in mind that if you don’t meet this deadline, you typically won’t be excused from jury duty unless you have an emergency situation that requires your presence elsewhere. [6] X Research source For example, the state of Texas allows you to postpone jury service at least once, but you must send a letter with your reasons for being excused at least two weeks before the date you’re scheduled to serve. [7] X Research source In the UK, you must respond to the summons within 7 days of receiving it or risk being fined up to £1,000. Contact the Jury Central Summoning Bureau for any questions.

[10] X Research source If you’re claiming a work-related reason, talk to your supervisor or manager about writing a letter for you to include with your own letter describing the need for you to be at work on the dates you’ve been summoned.

If the court to which you’ve been summoned has a particular exemption form, it will typically be included in the envelope with your summons. You may also be able to call the clerk’s office to find out if a certain form needs to be used. [12] X Research source For example, if you are summoned to serve on a jury in New Jersey, the court includes a questionnaire that you must complete and return. On that questionnaire, you can indicate if you are not qualified to serve on a jury or if you want your service dates to be postponed. In some jurisdictions, these forms must be completed and sent within a certain period of time after you receive your summons, regardless of whether you are asking to be excused from service.

Be sure to thoroughly explain your situation and relate it to one of the excuses your court typically accepts. [18] X Research source If the court accepts work-related excuses, explain the necessity for you to be at work or the hardship that would occur if you were to miss work. [19] X Research source For example, you may work at a small business that would have to close for the day if you weren't there to run the shop. You could say something like “I currently run a small business as the sole employee. If I were to serve on the jury, I would have to close my shop, which would drastically affect my income. My household consists of (number of residents) and our monthly income is (total income), of which (individual income) is from my business. Our monthly expenses average (total expenses).” If you're requesting to be excused from jury duty because you must care for a child, consider including reasons you are unable to find appropriate child care under the circumstances. Keep in mind that, in some jurisdictions, you are limited to one reason for your excuse. For example, in California, your excuse is denied if you indicate more than one reason why you are disqualified from jury service. For this reason, rather than piling on multiple reasons, pick the one for which you have the strongest documentation."

Define whether you want to be permanently excused or simply have the duty deferred or postponed to a future time. Your request may have a greater chance of being approved if you are willing to serve at a different time. However, if this isn't possible, you should state so clearly. [20] X Research source For example, many courts will excuse breastfeeding mothers from jury duty. [21] X Research source In that case, you may be willing to serve if your duty is postponed until a date in the future when your child is no longer breastfeeding. Say something like “As I am a breastfeeding mother, I am more than willing to serve on the jury once my child is no longer breastfeeding. This should be in about 3 more months.” If you cannot serve at another time because of a permanent disability, for example, try something like “Because my disability is permanent and affects my ability to get around, I am requesting to be permanently excused from jury duty.” In the UK, you’ll need to suggest 3 possible dates in the next 12 months that you could serve on the jury. You may only be excused completely if you have a serious illness or disability, are the full-time caretaker of someone with a serious illness or disability, or if you are a new parent.
