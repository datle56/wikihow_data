      "title": "RedNote became a TikTok replacement seemingly overnight.",
      "content": "RedNote became a TikTok replacement seemingly overnight. With the future of TikTok looking pretty precarious, RedNote is topping the Apple App Store and Google Play Store free app charts. [2] X Research source RedNote is a popular Chinese app that's similar to TikTok, Pinterest, and Instagram. In Chinese, the app is called Xiaohongshu (小红书), which translates to \"little red book.\" This is why American \"TikTok refugees\" call the app RedNote. Pros: Since RedNote already has a sizable user base, there's a lot of content to view and interact with. Many Chinese users seem eager to welcome Americans. Cons: TikTok creators who aren't from America likely won't be moving over, since the ban doesn't affect them. Non-binary and LGBTQ users have been censored or banned for discussing their identity. Monetization: RedNote does not pay creators, no matter their views or follower count. To make money on RedNote, you must do sponsorships or collaborations. Download RedNote from the App Store or Google Play Store ."

      "title": "YouTube Shorts could be a viable TikTok alternative.",
      "content": "YouTube Shorts could be a viable TikTok alternative. Many content creators have already uploaded their TikToks to YouTube Shorts, so it seems like a logical place to go, especially since it already has a huge user base. YouTube also allows creators to go live, similar to the TikTok LIVE feature. Pros: Many Americans already use YouTube. YouTube has very little risk of being banned. Cons: YouTube Shorts can't be as long as TikToks. YouTube doesn't have the most robust content moderation tools. Monetization: YouTube Shorts can be monetized if creators accept the Shorts Monetization Module. Shorts must meet YouTube's advertiser-friendly content guidelines to be eligible. Download YouTube from the App Store or Google Play Store ."

      "title": "Instagram Reels are similar to YouTube Shorts.",
      "content": "Instagram Reels are similar to YouTube Shorts. Many creators upload their TikToks to Instagram Reels as well, and the platform has a massive and dedicated user base. However, Instagram doesn't allow users to go live in Reels, but they can go live on Instagram Live (which is kind of nitpicky, but still a difference). Pros: Many users already use Instagram. Instagram will likely not get banned in the US. Cons: Many Gen Z users call Instagram Reels \"embarrassing\" and will likely not move over. [3] X Research source Meta's switch from fact checkers to community notes has turned many people off from their platforms. Monetization: Instagram no longer monetizes Reels based on views. To earn money from Reels you must do collaborations or sponsorships with advertisers directly. Creators can also get money from Instagram Gifts (similar to TikTok Gifts). Download Instagram from the App Store or Google Play Store ."

      "title": "Facebook Reels are very similar to Instagram Reels.",
      "content": "Facebook Reels are very similar to Instagram Reels. The main reason for this is that Facebook and Instagram are both owned by the same company: Meta. And similarly to Instagram, Facebook doesn't let users go live in Reels (but live video can be clipped and added to a Reel for users to watch). Pros: Many users already use Facebook. Facebook will likely not get banned in the US. Cons: Facebook is not as popular with Gen Z users, so they likely will not want to switch over to Facebook Reels. [4] X Research source Similarly to Instagram, Meta's switch from fact checkers to community notes has turned many people off from their platforms. Monetization: Facebook Reels can be monetized with overlay ads. You can also monetize with the Level Up Program to get Stars on your Reels. Download Facebook from the App Store or Google Play Store ."

      "title": "Snapchat Spotlight allows users to watch short-form content like TikTok.",
      "content": "Snapchat Spotlight allows users to watch short-form content like TikTok. The videos on the Spotlight feed are usually funny or entertaining, so you likely won't find any content relating to politics, news, or other more \"serious\" subjects. Snapchat also has the ability to go live, but it's not available to every user. Pros: Snapchat is already a popular app with a dedicated user base. Snapchat likely won't get banned in the US. Cons: Most of Snapchat's user base is younger, with older audiences using other social media platforms. The type of content you can get on Snapchat Spotlight is limited. Monetization: Snapchat is ending the Spotlight Rewards program at the end of January 2025. However, you can still earn money on Snapchat via the Snapchat Revenue Share Program.

      "title": "Clapper is a short-form app for adults only.",
      "content": "Clapper is a short-form app for adults only. The content on the app isn't necessarily adult-oriented, but Clapper only allows users who are 17 or older to sign up. While the app is trying to position itself as a TikTok alternative, it doesn't have the same depth of video editing features as TikTok, and instead focuses on unfiltered content. Pros: The app is ad-free. Creators can make communities to connect with fans. Cons: Users younger than 17 aren't allowed to sign up. The app has limited content moderation tools. Monetization: There are a number of ways to get monetized on Clapper: Clapper Fam Tiers (a Patreon-like subscription feature), gifts during livestreams or radio shows, Clapper Shop, and DM tipping.

      "content": "Triller is a good alternative for music and dance fans. They even created a website that allows users to save their TikTok videos and convert them over to Triller. According to Triller, many famous American TikTokers are on the platform, including Josh Richards, Charli D'amelio, Noah Beck, and Tyga. Pros: Gaining popularity in light of the TikTok ban. Focuses on music and dance, for users who prefer that content. Cons: Doesn't have a huge user base yet, so content is limited. Describes itself as \"AI-powered,\" which may turn some anti-AI users away. Monetization: Triller creators can get money from donations, selling merchandise, tips, brand partnerships, and licensing their music to the app. Download Triller from the App Store or Google Play Store ."

      "content": "Likee is another short-form video app like TikTok. In fact, Likee has a lot of similar features to TikTok: a suite of editing tools, monetization, gifts, and more. In light of the TikTok ban, many users have begun to move to Likee, further increasing its user base. Pros: Growing user base. Extensive editing tools, unlike some other platforms. Cons: Not as popular as other replacements like RedNote. Wide variety of tools may be overwhelming to some users. Monetization: Likee isn't very clear about how to monetize your content. If you have a large following, you may get invited to become an official creator, which seems to open up opportunities for monetization. Download Likee from the App Store or Google Play Store ."

      "title": "Fanbase is a platform that aims to platform Black creators.",
      "content": "Fanbase is a platform that aims to platform Black creators. Fanbase is slightly different in that it's a subscription-based platform, and is somewhat similar to Patreon. But what makes it a potential TikTok replacement is the \"Flickz\" feature, which is a feed of short-form videos. While it does cost money to join Fanbase, that means the app has no ads. Pros: Focused on uplifting Black creators. No ads. Cons: The Subscription-based model may not be accessible to all users. The platform may have too many features for users looking to only replace TikTok's features. Monetization: Creators can earn money through subscriptions and getting \"loves.\" This revenue is split 50/50 with Fanbase. Download Fanbase from the App Store or Google Play Store ."

      "content": "Neptune is a popular TikTok alternative that isn't even out yet. While many of the apps Americans are moving to in the light of the TikTok ban have active, established user bases, a lot of users are looking towards an app that isn't available yet. That app is Neptune, which boasts a customizable algorithm and hidden metrics (like follower count). Pros: Has a customizable algorithm, unlike TikTok. Beta testers can reserve usernames ahead of time. Cons: The app isn't out just yet. The user base will be smaller since it's new. Monetization: Neptune's website says they will have transparent monetization policies, but the specifics are not available just yet.

      "content": "Zigazoo is a TikTok replacement aimed at kids. Despite being a great way to connect and entertain, social media can also be a not-so-great environment for kids. If you're looking for a TikTok replacement that's more appropriate for younger kids, give Zigazoo a try. All content on the app goes through an approval process, and there's no commenting feature. Pros: Content is thoroughly moderated. The videos are usually challenged-based or educational. Cons: The app's content is aimed at kids, and might not be a good choice for older users. Children may not want to use a social media app their friends aren't using. Monetization: Zigazoo has a Creator Club that states it has monetization opportunities, but they do not go over specifics.

      "content": "Favorited may be a good replacement if you like TikTok LIVE. While TikTok had live streams and short-form video content, Favorited only has live streams. Some TikTokers have moved over to Favorited to do livestream battles, so the platform will likely continue to grow in the light of the TikTok ban. Pros: Great replacement for users who like TikTok LIVEs. Some TikTokers are already moving over. Cons: Users say the app is hard to navigate. The app only has live streams, no short-form videos. Monetization: Creators can earn coins, which can be cashed out to their bank account. However, Favorited does not detail how much money you get for the coins.

Other users scrolling can then buy items they like. Flip says you can even make money on the platform just by creating content. Pros: A good choice if you liked TikTok Shop. Offers a unique social media experience. Cons: Some users have experienced the app texting promos to their contacts list without permission. [5] X Research source The user base isn't large, so you may not find your favorite influencers there. Monetization: Creators can earn money on Flip by making video reviews, inviting new users, and doing live shows. Download Flip from the App Store or Google Play Store ."

Loops is a TikTok competitor that's joining the fediverse, which is a collection of independent social media networks that can communicate with one another. These projects are open source alternatives to mainstream social media networks. Pros: Open source alternative to a mainstream social media network. Connects to the same protocol as other fediverse networks (such as Mastodon and Pixelfed). Cons: The network hasn't been released fully yet.

Fable says it's a community for people to discuss great stories, so it's not just about books—you can discuss the plot of your favorite TV shows, too. On Fable, you join a club that matches your interests for books or TV shows and connect with other users about them. It's less of a one-to-one replacement for TikTok as it's not focused on short-form video content, but it is a place to talk about books and TV shows with like-minded people. Pros: A great place for BookTok users to connect over books. Also includes communities to discuss TV shows. Cons: It doesn't replace TikTok's video aspect. May have too many features for some users.

      "title": "Lemon8 is another popular TikTok replacement.",
      "content": "Lemon8 is another popular TikTok replacement. Lemon8 is another social media platform by ByteDance, the company that also owns TikTok. However, since the app is owned by ByteDance, it is susceptible to the same ban as TikTok. Similar to RedNote, the platform is a blend of TikTok, Instagram, and Pinterest. And also similar to RedNote, Lemon8 has been one of the top downloaded free apps in the App Store and Google Play Store in the first few weeks of January. Pros: The app has a user base of over 10 million despite being released in just 2023. It's very similar to TikTok, so users will have an easy time switching over. Cons: The app is owned by ByteDance and could be banned alongside TikTok. Like RedNote, international TikTok creators likely won't move over. Monetization: Lemon8 doesn't have a monetization program, but users can earn money by doing brand collaborations and sponsorships. Lemon8 is currently unavailable on the App Store and Google Play Store, but you may still be able to use Lemon8 if you previously downloaded it."
