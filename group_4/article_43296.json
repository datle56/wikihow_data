      "content": "Feel the texture of the paper. All U.S. bills are printed on paper made of 25% linen and 75% cotton. [1] X Research source This gives the bills a unique texture that feels very different from regular paper. [2] X Research source Hold the bill in your hand and assess the texture with your fingers. It should feel crisp and slightly rough to the touch, compared to the smooth, glossy feel of regular printer paper. If you have a $5 or $10 bill that you know is real, you may find it helpful to use one of them as a reference point. Compare the texture of these bills to your $2 bill. If they feel very similar, this is a good indication that your $2 bill is real."

      "content": "Check for red and blue threads in the paper. Real U.S. bills have red and blue threads randomly distributed throughout the paper to make it harder for counterfeiters to imitate them. [3] X Research source Pick up your $2 bill and inspect it for these small red and blue fibers. If you see them in the paper, this is a good sign that your bill is genuine."

    {
      "title": "Feel for raised printing on the bill.",
      "content": "Feel for raised printing on the bill. Genuine U.S. banknotes undergo a process called Intaglio printing, which gives the ink a distinctive raised texture. [4] X Research source Run your finger along the surface of the bill to feel for this raised ink. If it’s present, this is another sign that your $2 bill is real. If the bill doesn’t have this raised texture and feels very smooth, it may be a counterfeit ."

      "title": "Look for blurry text, borders, or images.",
      "content": "Look for blurry text, borders, or images. U.S. bills feature very detailed engravings and extremely neat micro-printing. On a real bill, all of the text, borders, and images will look clean and crisp. The printing on counterfeit bills, on the other hand, may look blurry or muddy. [5] X Research source If everything looks neat and uniform on your $2 bill, this is a good indication that it's real."

      "title": "Examine the serial number on the bill.",
      "content": "Examine the serial number on the bill. Each genuine U.S. bill of the same denomination has its own serial number made up of a combination of eleven numbers and letters. [6] X Research source On a real bill, the numbers should be spaced evenly and aligned in a neat row. If the numbers are printed unevenly or spaced at strange intervals, the bill may be a counterfeit. If you received multiple $2 bills at the same time, check to make sure that the serial numbers are different. No genuine $2 bills will have the same serial number, so if you have multiple bills with the same number, they are fake. [7] X Research source"

These modern security features are used on other higher-value notes to distinguish them from counterfeits, but they aren’t present on $2 bills. [8] X Research source If you see them on your $2 bill, it may be a counterfeit. Watermarks are only used on U.S. notes with a value of $5 or more. [9] X Research source Color changing ink is only used on U.S. notes worth $10 or more, and the vertical thread is only used on notes worth $5 or more. [10] X Research source"

It includes the name and the corresponding letter of the Federal Reserve bank that distributed the bill. To the right of the portrait, you should see the seal of the Department of the Treasury printed in green ink. [11] X Research source Keep in mind, however, that the $2 bill was redesigned to incorporate these features in 1976. As a result, these features may not be present or may look different on bills issued before 1976. [12] X Research source"

The current design of the $2 bill features a portrait of Thomas Jefferson on the front and a vignette of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the back. [13] X Research source Earlier designs of the bill featured a vignette of Jefferson’s Virginia estate on the back, so if your bill is a bit older, you may see this image instead of the signing of the Declaration. [14] X Research source The earliest designs of the $2 bill featured Alexander Hamilton, so in very rare cases you may come across a bill that features a portrait of him, instead of Jefferson.

If your bill is 100 years old (or older), it may be worth anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars. [17] X Research source For example, certain $2 bills printed in the 1800s could sell for anywhere from $1,100 to $4,500 dollars. Certain rarer printings from more recent years are also considered pretty valuable. Some bills from 1995 could sell for around $500, and some bills from 2003 may sell for upwards of $900 dollars.

In 1869, the design of the $2 bill changed to include a portrait of Thomas Jefferson, instead.

The $2 notes of 1775 were called “Continental Currency” because they were issued by the Continental Congress to help fund the Revolutionary War.

[28] X Trustworthy Source The Smithsonian Institution Leading group of museums and research institution funded by the U.S. government Go to source These notes didn’t last very long in circulation and lost value very quickly. [29] X Research source In 1861 , $2 Demand Notes were created to help fund the Union’s efforts to win the Civil War, and they were the first paper currency issued by the official U.S. government (post revolution). [30] X Research source In 1862 , $2 “United States notes” or “Legal Tender notes” were issued with a portrait of Alexander Hamilton. These were the first $2 bills that resembled modern iterations of American paper money, and they continued to circulate until 1971. [31] X Research source In 1869 , the $2 bill was redesigned to feature Thomas Jefferson. [32] X Research source In 1929 , the design of $2 bills was standardized—all U.S. bills were made about 30% smaller and each denomination was given a standard design to make it easier to identify counterfeit bills.

[34] X Research source This may seem like a lot, but compared to other denominations like the $5 bill and the $10 bill, the $2 bill is actually pretty uncommon. Because of this, some $2 bills are considered valuable collectors items, and certain rare variations are even worth several thousand dollars. [35] X Research source The value of $2 bills varies greatly depending on several factors (such as the year of the printing and the serial number). Unfortunately, most $2 bills won’t be worth a lot of money unless they have one or more of these unique factors. If you’re lucky, however, you may have one of the rarer, more valuable variations of the bill. Below, we’ll go over some of the things to look out for to determine whether your bill is valuable."

[37] X Research source The series year indicates the year in which a new design of a bill was approved, not necessarily the year that the bill itself was printed. However, it can be a helpful tool to get a benchmark for how old your bill is. For example, if your bill says “Series 1976,” this means that the bill features the most up-to-date design, and that it was printed in 1976 or later. [38] X Research source On older bills, you may see the words “Series 1963,” or “Series 1926,” which would indicate that you have an older bill featuring an older design. [39] X Research source"
