      "title": "“Too Sweet” is about two love interests who are polar opposites.",
      "content": "“Too Sweet” is about two love interests who are polar opposites. The song opens with the lyrics “It can’t be said that I’m an early bird/It’s 10 o’clock before I say a word,” shortly followed by “You keep telling me to live right/To go to bed before the daylight/But then you wake up for the sunrise.” Immediately, we can see that the speaker and his love interest have completely different personalities and outlooks on life. As the song continues, we see that the speaker is jaded and bitter and believes his love interest is too optimistic and uptight for his carefree, self-indulgent nature. This is also evident in the chorus, in which Hozier sings “I think I’ll take my whiskey neat/My coffee black and my bed at 3/You’re too sweet for me.” In saying that he prefers bitter, unaltered beverages, he’s saying that he prefers to live life as it is without trying to improve or change it. We also see how different the characters are in the lines “You treat your mouth as if it’s Heaven’s gate/The rest of you like you’re the TSA.” This lyric implies that the love interest is more uptight and less likely to over-indulge than the speaker, as the TSA is known to uphold strict rules and heavily regulate liquids taken through airport security."

      "title": "The narrator thinks their partner must mature for the relationship to work.",
      "content": "The narrator thinks their partner must mature for the relationship to work. In the pre-chorus, Hozier sings, “Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape/If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I’ll wait/Until that day.” Grapes are barrel-aged to make wine, which is far more bitter than grapes off the vine. This implies that the love interest would need to mature or become more jaded in order for the relationship to work. If she doesn’t, she’ll still be “too sweet” for the speaker, as their outlooks on the world don’t match. Some interpretations suggest that the love interest is much younger than the speaker and that these lines hint that the speaker wishes she was older and more mature."

      "title": "The song is also about overindulgence and self-destruction.",
      "content": "The song is also about overindulgence and self-destruction. Originally written for the album Unreal Unearth , “Too Sweet” is inspired by the sin of gluttony as seen in Dante’s Inferno . [1] X Research source The repetition of “You’re too sweet for me” could be a reference to the temptations of indulgence, with the speaker’s partner symbolizing a temptation that the speaker ultimately resists. Symbolism of overindulgence can also be seen in lyrics like “Don’t you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake/Smelling like a bonfire, lost in a haze?/If you’re drunk on life, babe, I think it’s great.”"

I think I kind of found a new fan base in the last couple of years… Maybe there’s more people who are just listening to the work. But this does feel…a little bit mysterious.” [2] X Research source"

Hozier is known for releasing songs and albums that speak about real-world issues, but “Too Sweet” is one of his most playful songs to date. The artist believes this is part of the reason for its success: “It’s a song about somebody who wants to self-destruct and get trashed! You know, I’ve had a quiet laugh to myself about that…But I guess it’s something that’s fun and immediate and doesn’t take itself too seriously, and that’s part of the appeal.” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "The lyrics contradict Hozier’s previous work. Long-time fans of Hozier know that “Too Sweet” isn’t the first time the artist has referenced sweetness in his songs. However, usually, that sweetness is considered a good thing, like in “Work Song,” when he writes, “There’s nothing sweeter than my baby/I’d never want once from the cherry tree/‘Cause my baby’s sweet as can be/She’d give me toothaches just from kissing me.” [12] X Research source “Too Sweet” allows fans to see Hozier use a familiar metaphor in a new and exciting way."

Lyrically, “Take Me to Church” is a metaphor in which Hozier compares his lover to religion, featuring lyrics like “Take me to church/I’ll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies.” The song grew out of Hozier’s frustration with the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church, and it shows Hozier’s support for the LGBTQ+ community. [14] X Research source The music video features two men in a romantic relationship. Later in the video, one of the men is kidnapped from his house, taken into a forest, and beaten by a lynch mob. Hozier’s intention was to bring attention to the repression and persecution of the gay community in Russia."
