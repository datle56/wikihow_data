      "content": "Make a secure loop with a Bowline Knot for support or a handle. Create a loop near the end of the rope, then pass the working end of the rope through it. Pull the working end around the straight line of the rope, then back through the loop going the other direction. Pull tightly to secure. [1] X Research source This is a great knot if you need to secure something to a post--simply loop the knot over the top. You can also use the Bowline as a handle or step in an emergency situation, if you need to rescue someone who’s fallen. Make it about a hand-span across to create an easy grasp. When tied correctly, the bowline won’t slip or tighten."

      "content": "Use a Clove Hitch for a quick but less secure alternative to the Bowline. First, make a loop around the post or tree, near the end of the rope. Make a second loop just above the first. Slide the free end of the rope under the second loop and tighten. [2] X Research source This knot is quick and easy to tie, but may slip. To make it more secure, use another knot as backup, such as the Bowline."

Pull the same end across the 2 wraps, tuck it under the main line and pull through to tighten.

      "content": "Secure 2 ropes together with the Square Knot. Cross the left end of one rope under the right end of the other, as though you’re beginning to tie a shoe, and pull gently. Take the ends again and cross them in the opposite direction, pulling right under left. [4] X Research source A simple, secure tie, this quick knot is perfect for tying 2 ropes together for a longer line, or tying up both ends of a single rope to secure a bundle."

Pull the rope back towards the cylinder and wrap it around the loop 3-4 times. Tighten until the wrapped rope is snug against the object. [5] X Research source This type of knot is often used to haul logs, and can also be used to shore up a support."

      "content": "Shorten a line with the Sheepshank Knot. Fold your rope to your desired length, creating 2 loops on a flat surface. Create a small loop in the top end of the rope, passing the end over the standing rope. Take the large, nearby loop and pass it down through the small circle. Repeat using the other end of the rope, again making sure that the end of the rope is passed over the standing section. Pull the other loop down through this circle. Pull the knot from either side to tighten. [6] X Research source This knot will only hold tight with a constant tension from either side. If the rope will be stretched back and forth, on and off, tape down the 2 loops to keep the knot secure."

Tie a Clove Hitch around an end pole, near the tip of the pole, then wrap the rope 5-6 times around all of the poles. Then, wrap the rope twice around the line between each pole, going back towards the pole you started with. Finish by tying the loose end of the rope to the end of the original Clove Hitch. [7] X Research source You can spread the legs of this tripod and use it for different purposes around your camp. The Tripod Lashing is often used for making shelters."

Take the length of the rope and tie it around both poles 5-6 times, passing under the bottom pole and over the top pole on both sides. Then, wrap the rope between the poles and around these lines 2-3 times. Use a Square Knot to tie the free end of the rope to the end of the original Clove Hitch Knot. [8] X Research source This knot is great for building larger shelters, making camp chairs or bridges, or simply securing 2 poles together. [9] X Research source"

Leaving a small gap right next to the hook eye, wrap the end of the line around the standing line 5-6 times. Slide the end through the loop near the hook eye, then turn the end and run it back through the second loop you just created. [10] X Research source Gently pull the tag end and the standing line to tighten the knot, using saliva or water to keep the knot lubricated. This is considered the most important fishing knot to know. It’s strong and reliable, and is used to secure fishing line to hooks, lures, and swivels. [11] X Research source"

Then, take the working end of the right line and tuck it back in at the original crossing of the 2 lines, pulling it up and through. Pinch it with your left hand and repeat the wrapping process on the other side. Wrap the left line over the right 3-4 times, in the opposite direction as your first wrapping. Pull the working end back towards the original junction, pulling it back through the loop. [12] X Research source Spit on the loop to lubricate, then tighten by gently pulling the standing lines. The finished knot will create 2 tight spirals of line on either side. You can trim the tag ends of the knot to keep it neat, or leave them hanging. This knot is great if you want to use up broken fishing line, or a line with an odd length. It works best with lines that have the same or very similar diameters."

Wrap the 2 lines together around your thumb until you get to the fold. Pull the fold once around the original loop, then pull it through. Slip your thumb out and gently pull to tighten."
