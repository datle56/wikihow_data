      "content": "It’s time to pay attention and look out for God’s love. If you’re seeing 11:11 repeatedly, it’s likely that God is merely trying to get you to notice him. Perhaps you’ll face an obstacle soon and He wants you to stay strong and remain faithful, or maybe you haven’t been to church in a while and it’s time to reconnect with Him. Regardless of the specific cause, God could just be saying, “Hey, I’m here!” Your interpretation of the sign matters a great deal. We know from the Bible that God can harden or soften the hearts of men, so the way you’re feeling could be a big part of what God wants to tell you."

      "content": "God is reminding you to trust in him. The repetition of the number 1 may be a subtle way of reminding you that there is only 1 God. Whatever you may be distracted by or obsessing over that isn’t the Lord is keeping you from prioritizing your faith and staying loyal. Set time aside every day to pray and reconnect with God—you’ll feel more spiritually fulfilled in no time."

      "content": "You’re on the edge of a brand-new journey. The number 1 is the first number, just as Genesis is the first book in the Bible. This is a symbol of beginnings, and it’s possible that this God’s way of letting you know that an opportunity will present itself soon and it’s okay to take the leap. [2] X Research source If you’re thinking about proposing to your partner or going back to school, maybe this is a sign that God wants you to make the move you’ve been putting off."

      "content": "You will survive so long as you trust in God (John 11:11).” After he had said this, he went on to tell them, ‘Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.’” The story of Lazarus is one of the most popular tales of the New Testament. Lazarus had been dead 4 days, but because he was a follower of Christ, Jesus decides to raise him from the dead. Potential Message: John 11:11 is a reminder that God will reward your devotion. It’s also a phenomenal testament to the power of Jesus’s love. Finally, John 11:11 is a reminder to stay strong. If Lazarus can make it through death, you can make it through anything!"

      "content": "God will guide you towards where you need to be (Deuteronomy 11:11). “But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven.” In this passage, God is guiding Moses and his people to the promised land. The same way God brought his followers to the land where they’d flourish, God will guide you Potential Message: If you’re on the precipice of a major decision (you’re considering moving, taking a new job, etc.), pray on it. God will guide you to where you belong."

Potential Message: This passage is a good reminder that you can bring new forms of love or life into this world if you remain faithful and trust in God."

      "content": "You cannot escape punishment if you deny God (Jeremiah 11:11). “Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them.’” Popularized in the film Us , this passage reminds us that that you will pay for your sins if you do not repent and worship God.

      "title": "Absolutely; God speaks to us in mysterious ways.",
      "content": "Absolutely; God speaks to us in mysterious ways. Even if you don’t buy into angel numbers, numerology, or any of that stuff, Isaiah 55:8 reminds us that we can’t know how the Lord works, “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord.” If you’re seeing 11:11 over and over again, it could certainly be God trying to get you to pay attention to something. [3] X Research source At the same time, if you’re uncomfortable with the concept of God communicating via numbers and you’re worried that they’re demonic or untrue, feel free to ignore 11:11. It’s unlikely God would use a method that makes you uncomfortable to communicate with you. Additionally, verse's numbers, like 11:11, are a modern invention—they were added 1500 years after Jesus’ life, and they’re placed arbitrarily. With all of this said, there’s nothing in the Bible that explicitly says you can’t interpret numbers or that God will never communicate with you via numbers. Go with what feels right to you!"
