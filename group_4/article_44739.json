If the victim was shot unintentionally (such as while hunting), make sure that the firearm is pointed away from others, cleared of ammo, safe, and secured. If the victim was shot in a crime, verify that the shooter is no longer on the scene and that both you and the victim are safe. Wear personal protective equipment, such as latex gloves, if available. [1] X Research source If there’s an active shooter, run and hide. Only help with casualties when it’s safe to do so. [2] X Research source"

They will feel like particularly large and hard veins. Applying pressure to them will constrict blood flow when direct pressure and elevation are ineffective. [26] X Research source To slow blood flow to the arm, use 2 fingers to press on the brachial artery on the inner side of the arm, just below the armpit. For groin or thigh injuries, apply pressure to the femoral artery, between the groin and the upper thigh. This one is particularly large. You will have to use the entire heel of your hand to reduce circulation. For lower leg wounds, apply pressure to the popliteal artery, behind the knee."

Wrap bandage tightly around the limb, between the wound and the heart, 5 to 7 centimeters above the wound. Wrap around limb several times and tie a knot. Leave enough fabric to tie a second knot around a stick. Twist stick until the bleeding stops.
