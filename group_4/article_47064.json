      "content": "Switch your PCIe mode. If you're using a 3.0 riser cable, you may be encountering this error because your GPU'S PCIe slot is set to auto or Gen 4. You can fix this by going to your BIOS settings: Restart your PC. Once you see the splash screen for your motherboard, press the BIOS access key. This key varies depending on what motherboard you have. Some popular mobo manufacturers and their BIOS access keys are listed below: ASUS: Delete or F2 ASRock: Delete or F2 EVGA: Delete or F2 Gigabyte: Delete or F2 MSI: Delete Go to the Advanced tab. Locate your device configurations. The exact layout and location of these settings will vary depending on the brand of your motherboard. Change your GPU'S PCIe mode to Gen 3 . Your GPU is installed in a PCIe x16 slot, so look for a device named PCIEX16_1 (though the last number may be different, depending on how your motherboard is set up)."

      "content": "Make sure your RAM is seated properly. If you've recently replaced or removed your RAM sticks from your motherboard, ensure the current RAM sticks are seated properly. If your RAM isn't seated in the motherboard fully, your computer won't be able to use it as it needs to, which can lead to issues and the Video Scheduler Internal Error. Lower the latches that hold your RAM sticks in place. Remove each RAM stick by pulling firmly, but never forcing it out. Place each RAM stick back into place by pressing it straight down into the RAM slot. Press until you hear a click and the lever has moved up to the locked position. However, never force the RAM to go into the slot, as this could damage the parts."

      "content": "Make sure your GPU is seated properly. Similarly to the RAM, if your GPU was recently replaced or removed, you'll want to ensure it's seated properly. If the GPU isn't seated correctly, your computer may run into errors, especially when trying to watch a video or play a game. Unscrew any screws holding your GPU into place. Remove the GPU by pulling firmly, but never forcing it out. Replace the GPU by pressing it straight down in the GPU PCIe slot. Make sure to press firmly until the GPU is fully inserted into the slot, but never force it, as you could damage the parts."

      "content": "Updating certain device drivers may fix the issue. While this BSOD error usually is due to hardware issues, it can sometimes be caused by a bad driver. [2] X Research source If a bad driver is the case, you can update your drivers using these steps: Boot in Safe Mode. To do this, press and hold the ⇧ Shift key while on the Windows sign-in screen, then select Power > Restart . Right click the Start button and select Device Manager . Expand Network Adapters and Display Adapters . Right click each device and select Update driver . After the drivers have been updated, restart your PC to see if the error still occurs."

Sometimes, new GPU drivers can have bugs that cause crashes, or your drivers might not have been installed correctly and are now corrupted. The best way to fix this is to use DDU to uninstall your drivers and then reinstall them from your GPU's website. Download DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller). Restart your computer in Safe Mode. To do this, press and hold the ⇧ Shift key while on the Windows sign-in screen, then select Power > Restart . Navigate to where you downloaded DDU and run it. Follow the on-screen instructions to uninstall your GPU drivers. DDU will restart your PC once it's done uninstalling the drivers. Go to your GPU manufacturer's website and download your desired driver. You can try the newest driver, or you may want to go back one or two versions if you're concerned that the newest driver is causing the error. Install the drivers once they are finished downloading, following all on-screen instructions."

      "content": "Clean out the inside of your computer to increase airflow. Some users have found that the Video Scheduler Internal Error is occurring because their computer is overheating . The easiest way to fix this is to clean out the inside of your computer, especially the fans that push and pull air in and out of the case. Open your computer's case. If you have a desktop, unscrew the thumbscrews holding on the right side plate and remove the side. If you have a laptop, you may be able to clean the fans without opening the case, but you can also use a screwdriver to remove the bottom of your laptop. Each laptop will be built slightly differently. The bottom of your laptop may not be easily removed. Using compressed air, remove any dust that's stuck to the computer's fans or interior. If there's a lot of thick dust, you may want to use the hose attachment on a vacuum to quickly and easily remove the dust. If you blow a lot of dust out of the fans, don't leave the dust inside your case. Brush it out using your hands, a duster, or a brush. You can also use the hose attachment of a vacuum to get it out of the case."

If you removed your heatsink for any reason and had to put on thermal paste, check to make sure you put the correct amount. To remove thermal paste , use rubbing alcohol and a tissue or cotton swab to remove it all. Let the CPU and heatsink dry. Then, place a pea-sized drop of thermal paste in the center of the CPU and place the heatsink on top before screwing it back in.

If you recently upgraded your GPU or RAM, try putting your old GPU or RAM back in your computer to see if that fixes the error (if you still have them and if they're still working). If this fixes the problem, you may need to try reseating your RAM or GPU when putting your new hardware back in."

      "content": "Updating your BIOS is a last-ditch effort. If nothing else works, try updating your BIOS. Updating the BIOS manually can be tricky, and it can cause your computer to stop working if something goes wrong in the process. If you're not confident in updating the BIOS yourself, bring your computer to a computer repair shop and ask for assistance. Check your BIOS version if you can access your computer. If you can't get onto your computer, skip to the next step. Search for msinfo in the taskbar search bar. Click System Information . Note down what it says your BIOS Version is. Go to your motherboard manufacturer's website and find the latest firmware version for your motherboard. If your BIOS is outdated, continue with the next step. Download the latest BIOS firmware version. If you can't access your computer, you'll need to do this on a different computer. Put the BIOS firmware update on a USB drive. If you're doing this on your own computer, you can leave the drive inserted. If you're doing this on another computer, eject the drive once the update file copies over, then insert it into your computer. Restart your computer. If your computer was already turned off, you can turn it on. Press the BIOS/UEFI button. You'll want to hit the button to open your BIOS/UEFI when you see your motherboard logo on the screen. The button to open the BIOS/UEFI for the most popular motherboard brands are listed below, but check your motherboard manual for specifics: ASUS: Delete or F2 ASRock: Delete or F2 EVGA: Delete or F2 Gigabyte: Delete or F2 MSI: Delete Update your BIOS. How you install the update varies between motherboard manufacturers, but you should see an option to Update BIOS from Drive (or something similar). You may have to go to the Boot menu first. Once the update is complete, restart your computer if it doesn't automatically restart."
