The “best by” or “use by” date refers to when the mayo has the best flavor or quality.

      "content": "Homemade mayonnaise only lasts for an average of 7 days in the fridge. Making mayo can be a great and fun alternative to buying large batches of processed mayonnaise! But there is a downside: it doesn’t last nearly as long. With a lack of preservatives, the eggs and dairy in homemade mayo spoil faster. Some cooks and homesteaders recommended using homemade mayo within 2 to 3 days of making, while others suggest it can last 7 to 10 days before spoiling."

      "content": "In the freezer Mayonnaise can be frozen before its “best by” date, but it will change in appearance and consistency. Frozen mayo needs to be thawed before using, and this can result in a yellow, watery spread. The changes that happen to mayo after freezing and thawing do not mean it’s gone bad. The acidic ingredients and oil simply separate in a freezing temperature."
