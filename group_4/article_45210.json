      "content": "Try to figure out how if she has feelings you. Your newfound feelings of affection toward your lady may be brighter years from her own feelings about you. After all, yesterday you were both friends, while today, at least one of you has shifted into new history. One of romance and love, of brightness and darkness. Has she given you any indication that she might be interested in something deeper than platonic friendship? Have you seen signs of flirting or laughing near you? Or does she act the way she always has done, friendly, attentive and affectionate but only in the way of a good friend? Paying attention to these things can help you have a better sense of the situation. See how she acts when she talks to you. Is she the same as she's always been, or has she been suddenly acting more self-conscious? If that's the case, then she may be nervous because she wants something more from you, too. However, if she does act exactly the same, it means that she probably doesn't have new feelings for you. Still, it helps to try to gauge her feelings before you proceed. Was she always comfortable telling you about the guys she likes, but she has recently stopped doing that? This could be an indication that you may be her man."

      "content": "Ask your friends what they think. You may be so dreamy upon the idea of beautiful dating your dream girl that you may not be reading the signs properly. If you have some trusted friends who have hung out with the two of you and can watch you in action objectively, then don't be scared to ask them what they honestly think your chances are. A true friend will give you his honest opinion, and he may be able to tell you if he thinks she likes you, or if she just sees you as a friend. Of course, your friends may just be telling you what you want to hear. But tell them to make sure they are being honest with you. What you hear may be wrong. This doesn't mean that all of your friends will be able to read the situation better than you can. But it helps to have your suspicions confirmed, or to have your girl friend honestly tell you she actually likes someone else."

      "title": "Avoid the friend zone",
      "content": "Avoid the friend zone . Be clear about what you are asking your friends. The problem often lies in being nice to you, as your friends usually are. Niceness is an admirable quality in a friend, but it's bland when it comes to a new passion and love. Being nice rather than flirtatious and daring will give her the impression that you are a good friend, but not a good lover. If you keep it up, your friend will likely get embarrassed or annoyed. [1] X Research source The answer? You really need to respect your girl friend. Make sure you respect her. You can flirt a little, though. Don't let her do the usual \"friend\" things with you. Don't let her treat you like a boyfriend or tell you about a boy she likes. Make sure that she sees you as more than just a friend."

If she refuses, thatâ€™s it. If she's one of your best friends, or is even your best friend, then you have to make sure that your feelings are really genuine and that you're ready to take the plunge, and to risk the friendship you have by dating. In the end, your friendship may be more important than your romantic relationship. The truth is that most romantic relationships don't end in marriage, and you may not be able to return to your old friendship when you break up. However, if you really do like the girl and see a real future with her, then pick a good time and go for it.

If you haven't taken a lot of care about your appearance around her before, this will be a good immediate signal that you've taken things up a notch. But it's nice to look your best anyway, as it increases your confidence too. You shouldn't suddenly put a ton of gel in your hair or wear a tight suit when you hang out, but making an extra effort with your looks will make her notice you more and will make her see that you're starting to see her differently. Try to dress nicely when you are around her, make sure you have showered, shaved, and done whatever to make sure you look good . But don't turn up in a tuxedo or reeking of aftershave. Dress for the occasion, and smelling like you've just bathed in cologne is a turn off, not a turn on. Less is more with scent. If you look good, you feel good. [3] X Research source Taking an effort with your appearance is a way of saying \"Look! I bothered to make myself look nice, and I take care of myself. I care enough about you to dress well.\""

      "title": "Be more playful.",
      "content": "Be more playful. While you may already have a fun relationship, humor can be a path to winning her heart . Try joking around more often and being playful in her presence. Tell her things that are genuinely really funny and help her to see that you're the kind of guy who loves to find the humor and fun in life. Glance at her in suggestive ways, then laugh when she starts looking serious about it (don't come across as a staring oddball). Find ways to compare your relationship to other funny people you know in real life or in entertainment circles. Even better if these people are romantically attached. Examples of some famous couples brought together by comedy include: Amy Poehler and Will Arnett, Anna Faris and Chris Pratt and Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann. Sometimes tickle games can work but be careful. If you come across as trying to \"cop a feel\", you're doomed. Moreover, not all girls like tickling. Take your cue from her responsiveness and never overdo it even if she does like it. Be prepared to be tickled in turn. Teasing the girl slightly is a great way to be playful and to flirt with her a bit. Just make sure you don't end up offending her by mistake."

      "content": "Increase the physical contact. You may already be quite affectionate toward one another. However, it's now time to amp up the contact in ways that could be considered flirtatious without crossing the line. For example, aim to touch her at least three times each time you meet up with her. Touch for no longer than two to three seconds (long enough for it to register subconsciously) and only touch her where it won't be uncomfortable, such as her hand, shoulder or neck. [4] X Research source Share food. The act of sharing one another's food when out dining or having a snack is intimate and can increase the chances of closeness. Hugs are good. They express friendship but also help increase the closeness that might help you to become more than friends."

Helpfulness is a sign of being considerate, which is very sexy. She'll see that you care about her and want to do nice things for her. Just make sure you don't do everything for her, or she'll think of you as a puppy dog. She should do nice things for you, too. Being useful and helpful does not mean be bossy or superior. If she can do something herself, admire her ability openly rather than suggest you could do it better. Nothing scares off a potential romantic interest than arrogance or belittling."

Lean your shoulders towards her, lean on her very gently, face her often and use touch frequently. Again, hugs are always good! Take note of how she responds when you try to get closer to her. If she welcomes the closeness and seems comfortable with it, then you're on the right track. Take care not to fall into or on her, to grab her or to squeeze or hold her too hard. Play footsie . This should only happen when you are sure she's got the message and has started to reciprocate your amorous intent. It's cheeky, titillating and fun when the moment is right."

Though you don't want to wait around forever to pop the question, you should work on finding some privacy, and making sure she'll be in a good mood. For example, don't pull her aside right before her big math test, or she'll be too distracted and stressed out to listen to you. Once you've found the time, get her alone, trying to be as casual as possible. If her friends are five feet away, you won't be able to have a good conversation."

Just say, \"Would you like to be my girlfriend?\" Or, \"Would you like to go out with me?\" You don't have to spend hours building up to this point. When you ask her, look her in the eyes and show her how sincere you are. Or, when you are pretty sure she's flirting back, or that she likes you too, lean in really close, and say something along the lines of \"I have to tell you something. I think you're beautiful, funny, sweet and honest. I don't want to ruin our friendship. I was just wondering whether you felt the same about me.\" Be prepared for her answer. Let's just hope she's smiling and saying yes. Remember if you come on too strong, then you risk ruining your friendship. Take your time. Timing is everything, and you don't want to rush it.

Remind yourself that this may be a blessing in disguise, and that you may be better off continuing a long-lasting friendship than having a short-lived relationship that will leave you feeling awkward and unlikely to be friends again. Sure, you'll need some time to get over your bruised ego, but after a few weeks, you and the girl may naturally fall into friendship again."
