      "content": "Raise a hand and call for help if you’re not a strong swimmer. Escape involves floating with the current, then swimming parallel to the shore to cross the current's edge. If you can’t swim, call for help and wave an arm to get the attention of a lifeguard or other people on the beach. [3] X Research source If you know how to swim , you should be able to escape and swim back to shore at an angle away from the current. However, if you have any doubt about your ability to break free of the current, call and wave for help."

      "title": "Float or tread water until you can swim out of the current.",
      "content": "Float or tread water until you can swim out of the current. Your instincts may be to fight the current and swim directly back to shore. However, that’s the most dangerous thing you could do. Instead, focus on keeping your head above water and float until the current has weakened and you're able to swim through its boundary. [4] X Research source If you can’t tell how strong the current is, look at any fixed point on the horizon and see if it moves. You should be able to get a sense of how fast you’re floating away based on how quickly the fixed point moves. Most rip currents weaken about 50 to 100 yards (46 to 91 m) from shore. Once the current has begun to subside, you’ll have an easier time swimming out of it. Warning: Even the strongest swimmers will struggle against a strong rip current. Trying to swim against one early on may end up just tiring you out if you need that energy later to swim back. If you try to swim out and you can’t make progress, just float. You won’t be carried that far out."

      "title": "Swim parallel to shore to escape the current.",
      "content": "Swim parallel to shore to escape the current. Most rip currents are between 30 and 100 feet (9.1 and 30.5 m) wide. Look for the nearest breaking waves; they indicate the current’s edge. Swim toward the waves, and be sure to move parallel to the shore instead of directly towards it. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Swim diagonally to the shore after you're out of the current.",
      "content": "Swim diagonally to the shore after you're out of the current. Once you are out of the current, make your way back to shore at an angle away from the current. Swimming diagonally away from the rip current minimizes the chance that you'll reenter it. [8] X Research source Rip currents often form around jetties and other structures perpendicular (at a 90-degree angle) to the beach. If you are near one of these structures, swim away from it. If necessary, stop and float periodically to rest. If you’re exhausted and can’t swim any further, call for help and wave your arms."

      "content": "Spot rip tides by looking for vertical gaps in the wave patterns. Check for areas that don’t have white foam or don’t seem to have any breaking waves. Note that you’re not looking for gaps between a wave and the one behind it. Gaps that indicate rip currents are within the horizontal wave line itself. [9] X Research source Rip currents are basically express lanes to open water that sit perpendicular to the shore. If you see any columns of still water on the beach, the odds are high they’re rip currents."

      "content": "Study the water for a minute or two before you get in. Checking for signs of a rip current can help you avoid getting caught in one in the first place. Just keep in mind that it's not always possible to identify a rip current, so use caution even if you don't see any warning signs. [10] X Research source Signs of a rip current are subtle and aren't always present. A rip current could also form while you're already in the water."

      "content": "Get up high to inspect rougher waters in more detail. When you first get to the beach, look at the area where the waves meet the sand. A high spot, like a dune or boardwalk, offers the best vantage point. [11] X Research source It’s easier to spot a rip current from an elevated position than at eye level. Polarized sunglasses can help make it easier to spot warning signs of a rip current. Without the sun's glare, you might have an easier time recognizing signs such as a gap in wave patterns or debris being carried out to sea. [12] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Track the sea foam if you’re struggling to spot rip currents.",
      "content": "Track the sea foam if you’re struggling to spot rip currents. Usually, waves carry foam, seaweed, and other debris toward the sand. Look for a channel of objects steadily traveling out to sea instead of bobbing up and down or moving toward the shore. It may look a bit like a river within the ocean flowing away from the shore. [13] X Research source Additionally, the water within a rip current may be slightly discolored. This is due to the sediments picked up by the current."

      "title": "Inform a lifeguard if you spot rip tides and avoid them.",
      "content": "Inform a lifeguard if you spot rip tides and avoid them. Don’t go in the water in the area where you’ve spotted signs of a rip current. Tell the nearest lifeguard; they’ll likely already be aware, but it’s helpful to check in with them just in case. Ask them about the beach forecast and if there are any warnings or alerts about hazardous conditions. [14] X Research source Keep your guard up even if you don’t see any signs of a rip current. They can be difficult to spot, and a rip current may be present even if you don’t see any indicators. Pay special attention when you’re surfing. Surfers are especially likely to end up in rip currents because larger waves tend to feed into them. If you see an especially calm channel appear out of nowhere, steer away from it."

      "content": "Swim only when a lifeguard is on duty. Avoid swimming alone, and stick to guarded beaches. Additionally, go swimming in the water in front of a lifeguard stand, especially if there are any alerts about possible rip currents or other hazardous conditions. [15] X Research source Swim near a lifeguard stand, but remember not to set up your blanket or chairs in front of the stand. The lifeguard will need a clear path to the water if they have to make a rescue. If you do go swimming on an unguarded beach, avoid going in deeper than your waist. It's also best to bring a floatation device into the water with you. [16] X Research source"

If you see a flag and aren’t sure what it means, ask a lifeguard. [17] X Research source If you live in the United States, check your local beach forecast online before heading out. Beach flags are normally color-coded. Black, red, and double-red flags usually indicate seriously dangerous swimming conditions. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Use caution even if the weather is nice. While strong winds can make waves choppier, rip currents aren’t directly caused by the weather and can form even in calm conditions. Key factors include the shape of the ocean bottom, sandbars, and structures such as jetties, rocks, and piers. [19] X Research source Rip currents can form at any time, but they’re more likely to develop during low tides."

      "content": "Don’t try to rescue someone caught in a rip current. Only a lifeguard or other trained emergency responder should attempt a rescue. If there is no lifeguard present, call emergency services and yell out instructions to the person caught in the current. [20] X Research source Yell to them “Stay calm! Don’t try to fight the current. Swim parallel to shore to get out of it.” Try to find an object that floats and, if possible, throw it to the person caught in the current. If you don't have rescue equipment, such as a life jacket or ring buoy, a surfboard, boogie board, cooler, or foam noodle could work as improvised floatation devices. [21] X Research source"
