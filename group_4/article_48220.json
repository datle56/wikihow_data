      "content": "A \"blinker hit\" refers to taking a long, continuous draw from a vape pen. The user inhales until the battery indicator light starts blinking, signaling the device's automatic shut-off. The purpose of this extended pull is to inhale a large volume of vapor, which can either create large, impressive clouds of vapor, or produce a more intense, fast-acting high if it is a cannabis pen. Although blinker hits typically are done with weed pens, they can be done with any substance you enjoy vaping with. The duration of a blinker varies based on the device's design, but it typically lasts until the automatic cut-off, usually around 8-10 seconds. At this point, the pen's battery light will blink to indicate the end of the hit. Social media influencers have even popularized posting videos of themselves using vape pens to hit a blinker. These videos, showcasing the user's vaping skills and lung capacity, have received millions of views and sparked viral \"blinker challenge\" trends on platforms like TikTok and Instagram."

      "content": "Blinker hits can take a toll on your lungs. Prolonged, deep inhalation can be taxing on your lungs, particularly if it's not something you're used to. This intense breathing technique may provoke coughing spells, throat irritation, and even dizziness in some cases. [1] X Research source It's crucial to pay attention to how your body responds and respect your personal limits. Though the flashing indicator light may symbolize a badge of accomplishment, your overall well-being should always take priority."

      "content": "Blinker hits usually mean a higher concentration of the inhaled substance. While you can't die from a weed overdose, an overdose is still possible. [2] X Research source Vaping high levels of marijuana can heighten the risk of overdose and lead to undesirable side effects like nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. [3] X Research source Moreover, blinker hitting products with nicotine can lead to becoming \"nic-sick,\" which refers to nicotine poisoning from ingesting too much. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and headaches, and this condition can be fatal. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Lung Association Nonprofit health organization dedicated to improving lung health through education, advocacy, and research Go to source The health risks of vaping can vary significantly depending on the specific substance being inhaled and the user's overall health. Some vape liquids may contain more harmful chemicals than others, and people with pre-existing respiratory issues are particularly vulnerable to potentially negative health effects."

      "content": "It may cause your vape to overheat. Overusing the vape pen can push the device to its limits, raising the risk of overheating. Overheating can damage your vape cartridge or alter the flavor. Additionally, repeatedly overheating the vape may cause the atomizer to fail, leading to clogging or leaks. [5] X Research source If you happen to notice your vape getting too hot, allow your tank and mod to cool down briefly between puffs. Take a draw, then pause for a moment before vaping again, allowing any built-up heat to dissipate."

      "content": "Make sure you have high-quality equipment. Ensure you have the proper equipment before using your vape. You'll need a quality vape pen with an auto shut-off feature, typically signaled by a blinking light. Additionally, make sure you have a cartridge or tank filled with your preferred substance. Finally, confirm your battery is fully charged and the cartridge/tank is securely attached to the battery. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Start with smaller draws so you don’t exceed your tolerance. When hitting a blinker, one common mistake is taking overly large hits. While the instinct may be to take a big puff, this often leads to coughing and discomfort. The better approach is to start with a small hit and gradually increase the size as you become more accustomed to the experience. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use and store your pen according to the manufacturer's guidelines. To ensure safe and proper use of your vape pen, carefully read the instruction manual and follow the steps and safety tips. Avoid modifying the device or using it in unintended ways, as this can lead to damage or even explosions. Furthermore, adhere to the cleaning recommended maintenance guide for your specific pen. [8] X Research source When not in use, store the vape pen in a secure location away from heat, liquids, and other potentially hazardous items. Proper handling and storage will help prevent accidents and extend the lifespan of your device."

      "title": "The battery needs to be charged.",
      "content": "The battery needs to be charged. The most likely cause of the blinking light is a dead battery. Look for a micro-USB or USB-C charging port on the device, then charge it just like you would any other electronic device. [9] X Research source Charge ports are typically visible, though they're often located on the underside of a device. However, the recharge port can sometimes be less obvious, as I recently experienced. Recharge ports may be concealed under a cap or rubber plug on the bottom of the device. If you have a cap, try unscrewing it - the charge port will likely be revealed underneath. Alternatively, the port could be hidden beneath a rubber plug."

      "content": "You’re dealing with an incompatible attachment. Disposable vape devices that allow additional electronic components, such as rechargeable batteries or cartridges, may experience compatibility issues. If you're using a removable cartridge, be aware that not all cartridges will properly connect, even if they appear to fit snugly. The parts may not be making a secure electrical connection with the battery, preventing the device from functioning correctly. [10] X Research source If this happens, swap it out for a different cart or charge cord."

      "content": "You bought a faulty pen. Occasionally, a disposable vape pen may have a blinking light before you can even use it. In this case, the best course of action is to save your receipt and packaging, then take the device back to the store where you purchased it. [11] X Research source If you bought the vape pen online, take a video of the issue and send it to the seller along with an email. The blinking light is most likely caused by leakage inside the device during shipping. #*Fluctuations in air pressure can lead to vape liquids leaking into the battery compartment. Fortunately, most vapes have physical and electronic protections to prevent the device from firing when wet."
