If you’re using a non-stick saucepan, it’s best to use a rubber spatula. On the side of the pan, attach the thermometer. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Stir in the guar gum using a rapid motion. The color of the sugaring paste will depend on how long it’s been heated. Sugar caramelizes and generally turns brown when heated for a long time, which is fine for sugaring purposes. It could also look deep maroon or light or dark amber. Basically, as long as the mixture is soft enough to use at room temperature, any of these colors are fine. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour the sugaring paste into a storage container or a glass mason jar while it’s still liquid. However, you don’t want it to be so hot that it cracks or melts it. Allow it to cool to room temperature for a few hours. Don’t try to use it hot."

[6] X Expert Source Karina Villalta Certified Esthetician Expert Interview. 19 August 2020. While many people say it’s not painful, it really depends on the person. Those who tend to be immune to pain, have sparse hair, or have sugared or waxed before may find it less painful."

      "title": "Prep your skin.",
      "content": "Prep your skin. You definitely want to do this. It’s an important part of the process. Sugaring works best after a shower or bath but not right after, as the moisture will prevent the sugar from sticking. The reason you want to bathe beforehand, though, is because it opens the pores, which helps lessen any pain."

    {
      "title": "Begin with clean, dry skin.",
      "content": "Begin with clean, dry skin. Sprinkle talcum/baby powder all over the area you want to wax. This helps the sugar stick to the hair. Then scoop the paste out. You want it to be about the size of a lime."

      "title": "Stretch the paste by pulling it against the direction the hair grows.",
      "content": "Stretch the paste by pulling it against the direction the hair grows. If the hair is long, this can pull! Sugaring works best on hair that’s short, so it’s a good idea to trim longer hairs before starting. After you’ve applied it, wait a few seconds to give it time to sink into the pores. This helps it to grip better. To remove it, use a flicking motion going in the same direction that the hair grows. Use a new piece of sugar when it stops feeling “stretchy.” [7] X Research source Flick only as far as your wrist can go. For instance, if you’re waxing your leg, don’t go all the way from your knee to your ankle. Don’t pull up or out; pull along. Basically, what you’re doing is sliding the hairs out from the natural way they grow. Use your other hand to hold the skin taut. You don’t want it to bounce as you’re doing it."

      "title": "Sugar the area numerous times if necessary.",
      "content": "Sugar the area numerous times if necessary. Unlike wax, it’s common to sugar an area a few times. If it’s painful afterwards, (which it sometimes is on more sensitive areas), gently rub it with the other hand. The rubbing action acts as a slight pain blocker. The results from sugaring last for weeks at a time. Similar to waxing, the hair gets sparser and softer with repeated sugaring. Gather the little bits that are leftover with the sugar that’s in your hand, the way you pick up Playdoh, as sugar sticks to itself. Overall, you will find it’s a lot less messy than waxing. If you get it on anything, it’s okay. It’s water-soluble and should wash right out. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the pan on only half the burner, or quickly turn it down if it boils over. The size of the pan could cause it to react differently. Usually a non-stick, small saucepan is the best choice. Even with the right pan, you may still need to use only part of the burner or a lower heat."
