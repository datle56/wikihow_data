      "content": "Enter your dog in contests or teach him tricks. When you enter a dog in a contest you compete for first place and you get money if you win. Usually in disc competitions, the max money you can get is $600 if you won first place in a championship. You get a bit less money if you get 2nd or 3rd places. In obedience contests, the max money you can get is $1000. This is the same for Agility contests. Keep entering your dog in contests and you will get more money. You get 400 trainer points per contest. Tricks When you teach your dog tricks you get points only. Teach your dog to sit, roll over, jump etc, and you will get trainer points. But teaching your dog tricks will take some time and effort, so be patient. Sit is usually the easiest trick, Beg is the hardest trick. You get 100 trainer points per trick your dog has learned."
