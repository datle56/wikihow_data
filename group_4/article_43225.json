      "title": "Weigh yourself.",
      "content": "Weigh yourself. Have you suddenly gained a significant amount of weight â€” like more than five pounds in one day? While overeating and lack of exercise can produce weight gain over time, gaining several pounds overnight is a sure sign of water retention. Check your weight at various times of day, keeping a record over a period of several days. If your weight fluctuates significantly over the course of one or a few days, these fluctuations are more likely due to water retention than to actual weight gain. [3] X Research source Remember that for women, the hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle can significantly impact water retention. If your waist has swollen a few days before your period, it's highly likely this swelling will disappear within a day or two of starting your cycle. Reevaluate toward the end of your period.

      "content": "Examine the physical pattern of your perceived weight gain. If you are normally a slim person, do you see less muscle definition? This is an additional sign of fluid accumulation. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider sensible dieting if you still have questions about your weight gain. Remember that weight loss takes time; you will need to give this process several weeks. Trimming your caloric intake and upping your activity level should produce at least some weight loss; if it doesn't, water retention is a likely culprit."

      "title": "Examine your hands, legs, ankles, and feet for signs of swelling.",
      "content": "Examine your hands, legs, ankles, and feet for signs of swelling. The outer reaches of your blood circulation system are also the outer reaches of your lymphatic system. As a result, they are the most likely regions to suffer physical signs of water retention."

      "title": "Consider whether your rings are fitting more tightly than they used to.",
      "content": "Consider whether your rings are fitting more tightly than they used to. Suddenly ill-fitting rings are a sign of swollen hands. Wristwatches or bracelets may offer similar clues, though finger swelling is an especially common sign of fluid retention."

      "title": "Check to see whether your socks are leaving a ring around your legs.",
      "content": "Check to see whether your socks are leaving a ring around your legs. Sometimes this is caused by the fit of the sock rather than by any physiological factor, but if your normally well-fitting socks are leaving marks, your legs or ankles may be swollen. [6] X Research source Suddenly ill-fitting shoes present another important indication of leg and/or ankle swelling."

      "title": "Push down upon any swollen areas with your thumb and then release.",
      "content": "Push down upon any swollen areas with your thumb and then release. If the indentation remains for a few seconds, you may have pitting edema, which is one type of water retention. Bear in mind that there is also a non-pitting form of edema that will not produce this result. You may still be retaining water even if your flesh does not \"pit.\" [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Look in the mirror and evaluate whether your face appears swollen. Puffiness or swelling, or skin that appears stretched or shiny, can be an additional sign of water retention. Under-eye puffiness is especially common. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

      "title": "Consider whether your joints feel achy.",
      "content": "Consider whether your joints feel achy. Focus upon areas where you are experiencing swelling and/or pitting. Stiff or aching joints, especially in your extremities, are an additional sign of fluid retention. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Assess your surrounding environment. If it is a very hot day, your water retention may be caused by the heat. This can be especially true if you have been active in hot weather and your fluid intake has been low. While it may seem like a paradox, drinking more water will actually help you flush out excess fluids. High altitude may also cause you to retain water. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Evaluate your recent activity level. Standing or sitting in the same position for too long may have caused fluid to pool in your lower limbs. [11] X Research source Long airplane flights or sedentary work can cause your body to retain water. Get up and move around at least once every two hours, or perform exercises such as flexing your toes back and then stretching them forward if you find yourself stuck on a long flight.

      "title": "Assess your diet.",
      "content": "Assess your diet. Excess sodium intake often leads to fluid retention. Obesity can also stress the lymphatic system and produce water retention, especially in your body's extremities. [13] X Research source Take a close look at food labels to ensure sodium isn't \"hiding\" in foods you haven't suspected of being salty."

      "content": "Rule out serious medical conditions. While your water retention is likely caused by one of the factors listed above, it can also be a sign of more serious medical problems, including poor heart or kidney function, such as congestive heart failure and renal failure. If you are pregnant and experience a sudden change in water retention, contact your doctor immediately. Water retention can be a symptom of preeclampsia, a condition that involves serious maternal health risks. [14] X Research source"
