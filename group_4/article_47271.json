      "title": "Wipe away any excess egg easily removed.",
      "content": "Wipe away any excess egg easily removed. Act fast. The quicker you remove the egg from the side of your house, the better off you will be. When egg dries, the stains become more stubborn, although still removable. In particular, you want to make sure that you get rid of any pieces of shell fastened to the house. Try to get rid of any looser pieces of the egg that you can easily remove. Due to their high moisture content, eggs remove somewhat easily when the egging is fresh. Prepare cleaning supplies as soon as you notice that your house has been egged. You could also use a dull knife to scrape off excess egg stains. Or you could use a cloth or soft-bristled brush. Wipe away any egg that you can easily see. Be aware that some residue will likely remain."

      "title": "Spray water toward the egg stain.",
      "content": "Spray water toward the egg stain. Take a hose, power sprayer, or pressure washer, and direct a stream of water at the remaining egg stain. The water pressure in the hose will help remove some of lingering egg residue. You don’t want to scratch the house while removing the egg, which is why it’s important to hose off or remove any loose shells. Wash the egg downward. Wet the area beneath the egg before you do so, so that it doesn’t stick as it is washed downward. Avoid using hot water on the egg at any time because it could actually cook the egg enough that it will become harder to remove from the side of your house. Put the hose on low pressure, and use warm water if possible. Try not to use a high-pressure hose, because this can move the egg to other areas of the house. You can buy or rent pressure washers at local hardware stores."

      "title": "Test an area first.",
      "content": "Test an area first. If the remainder of the egg stain doesn’t entirely come off with the water spraying, you’re going to need to apply a cleaning solution to your house siding. By testing a small area of the stain first, you can see if the cleaning solution is removing any of the paint. There are times that you will need to repaint the area that was egged. However, you may be able to remove the egg without causing that issue. Most cleaning procedures work for aluminum or vinyl siding, although more unique sidings like stucco can require a more intense cleaning process."

      "title": "Soak the egg stain.",
      "content": "Soak the egg stain. Especially if the egg stain is old, it might be congealed and harder to remove. Soaking the egg stain makes it easier to get it off with chemicals. If you have light siding, you could dab hydrogen peroxide on the stain first to weaken it. If your paint is a darker color, don’t use this, though, because it is a bleaching agent. With darker stains, you should try non-bleach laundry detergent and water to loosen up the stain before you try to completely remove it. [1] X Research source You could also soak your rag in the cleaning agent you choose, and blot the stain with it, in order to loosen it. Leave whatever chemical you apply to the stain on it for a few minutes before moving to the next step."

      "title": "Mix laundry detergent in water.",
      "content": "Mix laundry detergent in water. This is one of the most common ways to remove egg stains from a house. Take 1 cup of non-bleach laundry detergent, and put it in a bucket of warm water. If the egg has already dried, the stain will be more stubborn and probably require detergent. You could also try using dish soap or even shampoo. You want to choose a gentle cleaner that doesn’t have bleach in it. Take a scrubbing brush with bristles, and dip it into the soapy water. Scrub the egg gently with the warm soapy water. Rinse the area. Once you’ve scrubbed the egg-covered area with the soap-and-water-mixture, rinse it off with the hose or pressure washer. Repeat the process if it’s needed."

      "title": "Try an all-purpose household cleaner.",
      "content": "Try an all-purpose household cleaner. Instead of detergent and water, you could use an all-purpose household cleaner, but make sure to choose one that is alkaline-based. [2] X Research source Alkaline-based cleaners will get rid of the egg stains more effectively by dissolving the fats in them. Formula 409, Zep, and Simple Green are examples of household cleaners that are alkaline based. As with the detergent, put the cleaner in warm water, and gentle scrub the stain. Then, rinse the area to get rid of the remaining cleaner and egg. When using alkaline cleaners, take care to wear gloves and eye protection, and read the label to avoid any irritation to your skin. Use a cleaner recommended for removing organic, high protein matter like blood, grass or food. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use white vinegar.",
      "content": "Use white vinegar. To give the cleaning solution more oomph, try adding some white vinegar into it. White vinegar is an effective, natural cleaning solution for many surfaces. Mix one cup of white vinegar into one cup of warm water. Put the mixture into a spray bottle that you’ve cleaned. Spray the solution onto the egg stain. Make sure the stain is completely wet. Then, take a clean sponge, and soak it in hot water. Wipe the stain with the damp sponge. You may need to remove some of the egg with a paint scraper if necessary, but be careful not to scratch or damage the paint. Consider soaking a terry cloth towel in the solution and holding it onto the egg stain for several minutes to loosen the stain. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean an egg off stucco.",
      "content": "Clean an egg off stucco. Stucco is an exterior plaster finish on some houses. You can get rid of egg stains, but it’s a little bit trickier. Remove the stain as fast as possible because it will be harder to clean if it dries and becomes embedded in the cement. Use a water hose, pressure washer or power sprayer. Put the pressure washer or power sprayer on a medium setting of between 2,000 and 3,000 PSI. Try using a cup of non-bleach laundry detergent in a gallon of hot water, and scrub the stain to remove it with a scrub brush, then spray with water again. Mix a cup of non-bleach formula laundry detergent with a cup of talc, bentonite, or powdered silica into a gallon of hot water. These items are usually for sale in the local hardware or home improvement stores. Stir the concoction until it forms a thick paste known as a poultice solution."

      "title": "Apply the poultice to the egg stain.",
      "content": "Apply the poultice to the egg stain. Once you have the poultice paste mixed, apply it liberally to the remaining egg stain. Use a trowel to put the poultice on any remaining egg. The poultice solution should help dissolve the remaining egg stains in the stucco. Once you are done, put plastic wrap over the poultice solution. It should completely cover it. Let it remain there for an hour. Remove the plastic wrap. Spray the stucco with a water hose, power sprayer, or pressure washer."

      "content": "Get rid of egg stains on a car. Maybe the pranksters hit your car as well as your house. Removing egg from cars is similar to removing eggs from a house. [5] X Research source Remove the egg as quickly as you can. Use a car-wash mitt, a terry-cloth towel or a sponge. Don’t use scrubbers or anything with hard bristles or it could damage the paint on the car. Use a mixture of soap and water. Put it in a spray bottle, and spray the car with it. Let it soften up and then wash it off with warm water. Waxing your car frequently is a good way to protect it from the elements as well as an errant egg."
