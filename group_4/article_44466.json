      "content": "Take an over the counter medication. When you or your child has chickenpox, it will likely be accompanied by a fever. To combat fever and reduce any pain, use over the counter fever reducers such as paracetamol or acetaminophen. Read all packaging information before taking any medication. If you are not sure if the medication is safe to take, do not give or take it before talking to a medical professional. Do not give aspirin or aspirin-containing medication to treat fever or other symptoms of the chickenpox. Taking aspirin while you have the chickenpox can cause Reye's syndrome, which affects the liver and brain and can be fatal.

      "content": "Try over the counter antihistamines. The major symptom of chickenpox is intense itching at the site of the pox. There may be times when the itching is unbearable or causes too much discomfort. When this happens, take over the counter antihistamines such as Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Claritin to help relieve the itching. Talk to your doctor about dosing of these medications for children; they may be especially helpful at night when you want to sleep. [3] X Research source If you find that you or your child are in severe pain or discomfort, see a medical professional. The doctor might be able to provide a prescription strength antihistamine.

      "content": "Eat soft, gentle foods. Sores may develop on the inside of the mouth when you or your child get the chickenpox. These can be very irritating and cause you pain, especially if you eat the wrong foods. Try soft, gentle foods such as warm soup, oatmeal, pudding, or ice cream. If there are especially painful sores inside the mouth, avoid eating foods that are salty, spicy, acidic, or too hot. [7] X Research source You or your child can occasionally suck ice cubes, popsicles, or suckers to ease the pain of sores inside the mouth.

      "content": "Stay home. If you or your child has chickenpox, stay at home or keep them at home as much as possible. Do not go to work or school or let your children who are infected go to school. You do not want to spread the virus to anyone else â€” chickenpox is easily spread through the air or contact with the rash. Plus, you do not want to make the symptoms worse through overexertion. [9] X Research source Once the sores have scabbed over and dried up, the virus is no longer contagious. This generally takes five to seven days.

      "title": "Don't scratch.",
      "content": "Don't scratch. The most important thing to remember about chickenpox is that you or your child shouldn't scratch the pox. Scratching them will make them worse and cause even more irritation and possible infection. If they are scratched too much, the sores can develop into scars that might remain after the chickenpox has cleared up.

      "content": "Cut the fingernails. Although you should avoid scratching or letting your child scratch the sores in general, it is typically difficult to avoid all the time. Since you or your child will likely scratch yourself, keep the fingernails short and filed smooth. This will help prevent the nails from scratching the sores, which can open the skin, prolong the healing process, be more painful, and possibly cause infection.

      "content": "Cover the hands. If you or your child is still scratching with short fingernails, consider covering the hands with gloves or socks. This will help to prevent injury. If you or he attempt to itch with covered hands, there will be minimal irritation and problems because the fingernails will be covered. [14] X Research source Even if you or your child are good about not scratching during the day, cover the hands at night because it is possible to scratch the skin while asleep.

      "content": "Stay cool. The skin will get aggravated and hot during the chickenpox, both from the fever and the sores. Stay away from locations that are too hot or humid because this will make you or your child hotter and make the skin itch even more. This means you or your child shouldn't go outside in hot or humid weather and you need to keep your house at a cool temperature.

      "content": "Apply calamine lotion. Calamine lotion is a great remedy for itchy skin and can help heal the sores. Apply it as often as needed if the itchiness and pain are too uncomfortable to handle. The lotion will soothe the skin and provide an element of relief.

You can put hydrocortisone cream or ointment on bumps that are especially red, itchy, or inflamed for a few days Do not use lotion with Benadryl in it.

If your or your child's fever is bad, make sure the water does not cause discomfort and that it will not induce shivering. [20] X Research source Add uncooked oatmeal grains, baking soda, or oatmeal bubble bath to the water to help soothe the sores and calm the irritation.

Chickenpox will generally run its course without medical help if the infected individual is under the age of 12.

[22] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Your doctor will likely prescribe you acyclovir, which is an antiviral medication that helps shorten the duration of the virus. Try to see your doctor within the first 24 hours after the pox appear for this medicine to be the most effective. An 800 mg pill of it should be taken four times a day for five days, but the dose may be different for smaller or younger teenagers.
