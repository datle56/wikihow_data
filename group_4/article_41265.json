When they increase in size they become abscesses and are of significant concern, both medically and cosmetically. If it increases in size, it will eventually form a head, which means that underneath the top surface, the skin becomes filled with pus. It can break open, draining and oozing pus, which is a mixture of blood cells, bacteria and fluids.

A boil is a common form of a medical condition called an abscess which is a collection of pus underneath the dermis (the layer of skin under the epidermis). There are a number of different types of boils that may appear. These include: Furuncles, which occur in hair follicles. They are associated with a fever and chills and can become chronic. Carbuncles, which are generally larger than furuncles and can also become chronic. They can also form hardened lumps under the skin. Cystic acne, which is both a type of acne and a type of boil associated with more severe forms of acne. Hidradenitis suppurativa, which is an inflammatory condition of the sweat glands. It occurs when there are multiple boils cropping up under the arms and along the groin area. It is also resistant to antibiotics and may require surgery to remove the affected sweat glands. Pilonidal cysts, which result from inflamed hair follicles at the top of the buttock crease. Pilonidal cysts are uncommon, can occur after long periods of sitting, and occurs more in men than women.

The bacteria that causes boils is very common on nearly everyone’s skin, so it is possible for almost anyone to get it from that. There are also some other factors that can increase your risk. These include: Coming into close contact with someone close who has a boil or a Staph infection. If you are around someone with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), take extra precautions, as this can colonize on your body and increase your risk of serious infection. Diabetes, which can suppress the immune system and lead to more infections. Due to the increase in blood sugar, microbes are more likely to colonize and infect a person with diabetes. If you have a boil and are diabetic, seek out medical attention immediately. Any condition resulting in a suppressed immune system, such as HIV or cancer. Other skin conditions that weaken the barrier capabilities of the skin, such as psoriasis, eczema, acne, or other condition in which the skin is dried or broken."

Once they are diagnosed by your doctor, you can have them lanced, which is when the doctor pokes a hole in the head, or pus-filled head, of the boil and drains the pus. In some cases, your doctor may also prescribe antibiotics, which can be topical or oral. This is usually reserved for large boils or those that last longer than two or three weeks. If the boils are on your face or spine, are particularly painful, and/or are associated with a fever, more treatment may be necessary. [5] X Research source"

This can help protect the skin from outside irritants or irritation. If a bandage would just fall off or keep coming off due to the location of the bandage, such as the inner thigh, you can also leave the boil uncovered. When dealing with boils, never try to squeeze it. You should also never use any sharp instrument like a needle or pin to cut or pop the boil. This increases the risk of the spread of infection. If the boil comes to a head and drains on its own, gently wipe away the pus that oozes out with a tissue. Then cover the wound with a bandage so it can heal.
