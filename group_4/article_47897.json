      "content": "On Instagram, CFS stands for Close Friends Story. The Close Friends Story was introduced in 2018 and allows you to create a private story that is entirely separate from your general Instagram stories. With this feature, you select a specific list of friends who are allowed to see and comment on your private stories. This is a great way to increase your privacy on Instagram and get personal without your entire follower list seeing! [1] X Research source On your Instagram homepage, a Close Friends Story has a green circle around the story. This is unlike the purple and yellow ring around regular stories. When you view someone’s Close Friends Story, you’ll see a green rectangle in the top right-hand corner that says “CLOSE FRIENDS.” At this time, you can’t remove yourself from someone’s Close Friends. However, you can mute the user, which prevents all of their stories from showing up. Otherwise, blocking or unfollowing the user will do the trick."

[4] X Research source Instagram doesn’t notify your friends that they’ve been added to your Close Friends list. Your friends will only find out when you post a Close Friends Story (or, if you decide to tell them!). Instagram won’t tell your friends if you remove them from your list, either. Your Close Friends Story only goes to the friends you selected, so your followers who aren’t in your Close Friends can’t request to be a part of it. In fact, they won’t know that you have a Close Friends Story at all."
