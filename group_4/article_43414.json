Without causing yourself too much pain, try to pinch your thumb and forefinger together and pull them (and the flesh between them) away from your body. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Try to pull the pinched skin at least 1 in (2.5 cm) outward. Loose skin is easy to pinch—you’ll feel like the tips of your thumb and forefinger are almost touching. It’s also easy to pull loose skin about 1 in (2.5 cm) or more away from your body. Body fat , however, is much harder to pinch together and pull away from the skin. [2] X Research source If you’re pinching body fat on your stomach, for example, you won’t be able to pinch your thumb and finger almost all the way together—you’ll feel the layer of fat in between. If you try to pull the pinched flesh at least 1 in (2.5 cm) away from your body, your grip will most likely slip off."

      "content": "Undergo a professional caliper test for a more accurate evaluation. While it’s sometimes also called a “pinch test,” medical testing with a caliper is more precise than just using your fingers. Your doctor or other medical professional will measure folds of skin in specific locations with the caliper, and use this data to estimate your body fat percentage . [3] X Research source You can buy a skinfold caliper and use an online calculator to estimate your body fat percentage on your own, but you’re better off having a medical professional do the job so you get a more accurate result."

      "content": "“Body fat” is technically subcutaneous adipose tissue . This tissue (also referred to as SAT) is found under the skin all over your body, and is used for both energy storage and insulation. Excess SAT, however, which often builds up on the stomach, hips, buttocks, and upper arms, can increase your risk of conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. [4] X Research source Excess SAT can also contribute to depression and related conditions, often tied to body image concerns."

      "title": "“Loose skin” refers to any type of sagging or wrinkled skin.",
      "content": "“Loose skin” refers to any type of sagging or wrinkled skin. This sagging or wrinkling is typically a result of a decline in collagen and elastin, which give skin its stretchy quality. Loose skin can also happen after significant and/or rapid weight loss. While loose skin can sometimes cause physical health issues (like repeated rashes), it primarily impacts emotional wellbeing due to body image issues.

No, you’re not guaranteed to have loose skin if you’re over 40, have lost a lot of weight, have recently been pregnant, or have a condition like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. That said, most people who have loose skin fall into one of these groups. Losing weight at a gradual pace is less likely to result in loose skin, while very rapid weight loss (such as after weight loss surgery or sometimes after pregnancy) frequently results in loose skin. [6] X Research source Skin, due to declines in collagen and elastin, naturally loses its elasticity as you age. The effects—wrinkling, sagging, or loose skin—usually begin to appear around age 40. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source While genetic factors and rare medical conditions like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can cause loose skin, health issues related to smoking or frequent exposure to UV light (like sunlight) more commonly lead to wrinkles and loose skin.

      "content": "Excess body fat is usually tied to an elevated BMI. It’s certainly true that factors like genetics, age, gender, and menopausal status can affect how much visible body fat you have. That said, being overweight (based on calculating your body mass index BMI) is the most consistent indicator. [9] X Research source In addition to excess visible body fat (subcutaneous adipose tissue or SAT), having a high BMI also increases the likelihood of excess visceral adipose tissue (VAT), the “invisible” fat that surrounds your internal organs. For adults, a BMI under 18.5 is considered underweight; 18.5-24.9 is considered healthy weight; 25-29.5 is considered overweight; and 30+ is considered obese.

For specific benefits in burning fat or tightening loose skin, though, add one (or both) of the following to your exercise routine: [12] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Burning fat: Do 2-3 weekly sessions of high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIT). You might, for instance, do a bicycle sprint for 8 seconds, then bike slowly for 12 seconds, and repeat the process for 20 minutes.

[13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Tightening skin: Building lean muscle with 2-3 strength training sessions (30-60 minutes each) per week can help fill out and smooth out areas of loose skin. Employ a mix of exercises like lat pulldowns, dumbbell curls, leg raises, and inclined presses for the best results. [14] X Research source"

From there, foods and supplements like the following may provide skin-boosting benefits: [15] X Research source Vitamin C, which boosts your immune system and helps your skin produce more collagen. Food choices include citrus and tomatoes. Vitamin E, which helps protect your skin from cell damage. Good food options include almonds and avocados. Omega-3 fatty acids, which add moisture and suppleness to your skin. Oily fish and walnuts are good food sources. Water, which hydrates your skin. Copper, zinc, iron, and selenium, which have all shown promise in supporting skin health in research studies.

Often these claims are unproven and unfounded, but topical treatments that fall in the following categories have the best research-backed claims: [18] X Research source Cell regulators, most notably retinol , which help boost collagen production in skin. OTC and prescription treatments are available. Antioxidants, including Vitamins B3, C, and E, which protect the collagen in your skin. Again, OTC and prescription options are available."

Consider the following: [19] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Protect your skin from the sun by applying broad-spectrum sunscreen, wearing hats and protective clothing, and avoiding sun exposure during midday. Treat your skin gently by avoiding long, hot baths or showers, shaving with dull razors, and rubbing vigorously with a towel. Apply moisturizer when your skin feels dry.
