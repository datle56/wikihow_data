      "title": "Stretch out the slinky.",
      "content": "Stretch out the slinky. In order to untangle a Slinky, you need to find the place where it is tangled. Identify the problem area by stretching the Slinky out. Don’t pull so hard that the Slinky bends or warps. You might need to arrange the Slinky in a circle if one end has tangled with the other end. Spread it out as much as you can."
    },
    {
      "title": "Identify what the tangle looks like.",
      "content": "Identify what the tangle looks like. Once you’ve stretched out the Slinky, you will see where the tangle has happened. Then you will be able to identify what the tangle looks like. Has one end meshed into another end? Has it been tied in a knot? Most tangles look like a U-shaped section. It usually sticks out from the rest of the coils."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try undoing the knot.",
      "content": "Try undoing the knot. If the tangle is the result of a knot, carefully try to pull apart the knot. You can also try looping the Slinky back through itself."

      "title": "Start with the easiest tangles first.",
      "content": "Start with the easiest tangles first. Your Slinky might have multiple tangles in it. Start with the tangle that is smallest and closest to one end."

    {
      "title": "Hold onto one end of the Slinky.",
      "content": "Hold onto one end of the Slinky. Stretch out the end until you get to the first tangle. Hold the coils on this end in one hand. [1] X Research source You may need someone to help you by holding one end of the Slinky while you work on the tangle."

    {
      "title": "Use a ruler to keep this set of coils aligned.",
      "content": "Use a ruler to keep this set of coils aligned. As you work on undoing one Slinky tangle, you can risk making the Slinky get more tangled. Use a ruler or another straight, hard object to make sure that the Slinky doesn’t wrap back around itself. [2] X Research source You can also use your hands by holding the coiled end firmly in one hand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Twist the Slinky around the ruler.",
      "content": "Twist the Slinky around the ruler. Rotate the Slinky around and around so that more coils move from the tangled side to the untangled side. [3] X Research source Essentially, you’re moving the tangle further along the Slinky until you have moved it to the end of the Slinky. The Slinky should correct its spiral as you twist the Slinky around the ruler."

      "title": "Repeat the process to get other tangles out.",
      "content": "Repeat the process to get other tangles out. Once you get one tangle out, you’ll have more of the Slinky with untangled coils. Use the ruler to hold these coils straight. Twist the Slinky to move the next tangle past the ruler."

      "content": "Hold the coils of one end in your hand. Using one hand, keep the untangled end together so that it doesn’t end up tangling back into the rest of the Slinky mess. [4] X Research source You can also use a ruler or another straight, hard object, to keep the Slinky aligned."

      "title": "Try to get all the tangles out of one Slinky first.",
      "content": "Try to get all the tangles out of one Slinky first. If possible, focus just on one Slinky that seems easiest to untangle. If you can extract one Slinky from the other, then you can work on each Slinky separately to untangle them. There may be a point when one Slinky will become unknotted from the other Slinky."

      "content": "Don’t toss your slinky into a toy bin. [6] X Research source Once the slinky is in a toy bin, one end of it will start to slip down between toys while the other end will stay on top of the toys. This is a good way for it to start tangling up. Instead, store your slinky on a shelf or in its original box."

      "content": "Don’t throw your slinky around. When you throw your slinky onto the ground, it can land with one end meshing into the other end. This will create a tangle. More often than not, it’s very difficult to pull it apart and you’ll need to spend time untangling it."

      "content": "Store a ruler inside the slinky. When you are not using the slinky, put a ruler or another long, straight object through the middle. This will prevent one end from tangling with the other end."
