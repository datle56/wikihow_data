[1] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source The first (and easiest) step is to make sure all of your hardware and cables are connected properly. If you have a desktop computer, ensure all the parts on your motherboard are correctly seated, especially anything inserted into a PCIe slot like your RAM or GPU. It's easy for these parts not to be inserted properly, which can lead to BSODs. If you have a laptop, only open the case if you have computer repair experience. Laptops are more complicated to work on if you don't have the know-how, and this can lead to the computer breaking even more if something goes wrong. Unplug and replug each cable on your computer to make sure it's plugged in fully. Make sure each cable is facing the right direction and push it into its slot firmly, but stop if you feel any resistance. Make sure your computer is off for this step, as unplugging it from power when it's on can cause data loss or corruption."

The easiest way to fix this is to clean out the inside of your computer, especially the fans that push and pull air in and out of the case. Open your computer's case. If you have a desktop, simply unscrew the thumbscrews holding on the right side plate and remove the side. If you have a laptop, you may be able to clean the fans without opening the case, but you can also use a screwdriver to remove the bottom of your laptop. Each laptop will be built slightly differently. The bottom of your laptop may not be easily removed. Using compressed air, remove any dust that's stuck to the computer's fans or interior. If there's a lot of thick dust, you may want to use the hose attachment on a vacuum to quickly and easily remove the dust. If you blow a lot of dust out of the fans, don't leave the dust inside your case. Brush it out using your hands, a duster, or a brush. You can also use the hose attachment of a vacuum to get it out of the case."

This is especially helpful if you can't determine which piece of hardware is causing the WHEA Uncorrectable error. A repair technician can help identify what hardware is broken. Make sure to ask your repair technician about warranty options if your computer's parts are still relatively new. To find a computer repair shop, look on your favorite search engine. Look for professional shops that have a number of good reviews, or get suggestions from friends and family for repair shops. If you have a laptop and you're getting the CPU over temperature error, going to a repair shop is the best bet. Laptops are difficult to fix on your own as the parts aren't always the easiest to remove or replace."
