      "content": "Store your cookies at room temperature for up to 3 days. Keeping your delicious leftovers in a cool, dry place on your counter or in your pantry is the best way to preserve your cookies’ crumbly texture. Just place them in an airtight container or plastic bag and place them in a spot that’s away from direct sun, heat, and moisture. Eat your Crumbl cookies as soon as possible after you buy them. After about 3 days, they start to lose their flavor and go stale. Light and heat cause your cookies to dry out and get stale faster, while excess moisture can change their texture or lead to mold. If you live in a sunny, hot place, add a slice of bread to the container to keep the cookies fresh and moist. Lay the cookies in a single row in your container or bag instead of stacking them if you want to keep their frosting and other decorations intact."

      "content": "Keep your cookies in the fridge for up to 7 days as an alternative. If you want to have yummy, fresh-tasting Crumbl cookies for longer, simply set them in an airtight container or plastic bag in your refrigerator. Just keep them away from meats, cheeses, and other smelly foods to prevent your cookies from absorbing their flavors and odors. [1] X Research source Always keep Crumbl cookies you bought chilled in the refrigerator. Some frostings, like buttercream and cream cheese, store the best in the fridge because the cold keeps them from separating and running. Store the cookies in a single layer to preserve the look of the frosting and other toppings. While the fridge keeps your cookies fresh, the chilly air can change their soft, crumbly texture."

      "title": "Freeze your cookies for up to 6 months if you can’t eat them right away.",
      "content": "Freeze your cookies for up to 6 months if you can’t eat them right away. Place your cookies on a lined baking sheet and set them in the freezer for about 4 hours. Then, take them out and wrap each individual cookie in plastic wrap. Simply set each cookie in a plastic freezer bag and then stack them in an airtight container to protect them against freezer burn and to preserve their tasty flavor and texture. [2] X Research source Crumbl cookies typically taste the best when eaten between 1 to 2 months of freezing them. If you bought your cookies warm, let them cool off before you freeze them. Label the plastic bags with the date you froze the cookies and their flavors. Freezing your Crumbl cookies can cause them to lose their slight crunch and some of their flavor. When you’re ready to eat your cookies, let them thaw for 1 hour. Eat them at room temperature or heat them up using one of the methods described below."

      "content": "Bake Crumbl cookies in the oven for 5 minutes at 350° F (177° C). While your oven preheats to 350° F (177° C), line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scrape off the frosting and decorations on top of the cookies and set them aside. Then, arrange the cookies on the sheet and bake them for 5 minutes. [3] X Research source If the cookies don’t feel warm and crispy after 5 minutes, bake them for another 5. Just watch them closely to ensure they don’t burn. Let the cookies cool for about 5 minutes after you take them out of the oven. Then, re-frost and decorate the cookies. If you have a toaster oven , set it to 300° F (149° C) and place the cookies on a lined baking sheet inside for 3 to 5 minutes."

      "content": "Heat the cookies in a covered pan over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Take out a pan with a heavy bottom and set it on your stove over low heat to warm it up. Then, add in your Crumbl cookies, spacing them apart so they don’t overlap. Just cover the pan and keep the cookies over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they’re warm all the way through. [4] X Research source To add an extra crisp to your cookies, melt a pad of butter in the pan before you drop in the cookies."

      "content": "Heat Crumbl cookies for 30 seconds in the microwave. If you’re in a pinch and need your sugar fix fast, microwaving your Crumbl cookies is a great option. Just place your cookies in a single layer on a microwave-safe plate. Then, simply pop them in the microwave for 30 seconds. [5] X Research source If your Crumbl cookies aren’t soft and warm after 30 seconds, keep zapping them in 15-second increments. Microwaving your cookies can alter their texture and leave them feeling more soggy than crumbly."

      "content": "Crumbl cookies don’t have preservatives so they can get stale quickly. Crumbl cookies are just like homemade cookies—they’re made fresh to order and are never more than 1 day old when you buy them. Their quality ingredients and lack of preservatives mean they tend to dry out quicker than store-bought, packaged cookies if they’re not kept in airtight containers. Instead of selling leftover cookies at the end of the day, most stores donate them to hospitals, fire stations, schools, and other organizations. [6] X Research source"
