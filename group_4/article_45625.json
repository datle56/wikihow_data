      "content": "Check that your phone qualifies for unlocking. Log onto your Globe account and see if you owe any payments for your current contract. If you have a prepaid phone, you’ll just need the IMEI number of your prepaid Globe handset as well as your current Globe phone number. [1] X Research source If you’d like to unlock your phone before your original contract ends, you’ll need to pay extra fees. You know a phone is prepaid if you purchased it as part of a prepaid phone kit from Globe."

Call Globe’s general business hotline at (02) 730-1288, where you can submit an official request for the company to unlock your phone. You can also submit a request via email to enterprisesupport@globe.com.ph. [2] X Research source For instance, you can say something like: “Hello! I’m looking to change carriers on my phone and would like to unlock my device.”"

      "content": "Wait 5 days for Globe to process your request. Keep in mind that Globe is a big company, and they won’t be able to unlock your phone instantaneously. Give them around 5 business days to unlock your phone so you can switch to a different carrier. Wait until you have verbal or digital confirmation from Globe before you tinker around with your unlocked phone. [3] X Research source A customer service agent will likely give you an estimate of when your phone will be unlocked and ready to go. If you aren’t sure if your phone is unlocked, call Globe at (02) 7730-1000."

      "content": "Bend a paperclip so 1 section is at a 45-degree angle. Take an ordinary paperclip and pinch the outer end of the clip. Pull this end of the clip outwards so it creates a 45-degree angle. Don’t stretch the paperclip out all the way—this section will be used to press and pick the individual pins inside of your Globe lock. [9] X Research source Any type of padlock, including a Globe lock, is held in place by several thin, horizontal sections of metal known as pins. These pins naturally sit at different lengths and are all pushed in simultaneously when you use the key, which allows your lock to open."

      "content": "Unfold and bend another paperclip in half so you can pick the lock more easily. Take a second paperclip and unfold it completely, creating a long, thin line of metal. Fold this long section of metal in half, creating a rounded end. As a finishing touch, bend the rounded end of the paperclip at a 90-degree angle so it’ll fit comfortably in the lock. [10] X Research source Try to fold the paperclip in half as thin as you can so it’s easier to work with. This section of the paperclip will help apply pressure to the lock while you pick it, which will make it easier for you to focus on the pins."

      "content": "Press the folded paperclip along the thickest opening of the lock. Hold the Globe lock upside down and look for the keyhole. Note that the left side of the keyhole is thicker, while the right side begins to taper off. As you start picking, press the curved end of the paperclip into the left, wider opening of the keyhole. Apply pressure to this paperclip so the lock is a bit easier to pick. [12] X Research source This paperclip helps provide tension, and makes it easier for you to adjust the pins in the padlock."

Push the paperclip as far in as you can, then drag the pointed section quickly along the right side of the lock. You’ll hear a slight rattle or click as you rake the paperclip over the pins, which means you’re on the right track. [13] X Research source You won’t open the Globe lock instantly—instead, raking the pins adds a slow, steady pressure that will eventually force the pins up and allow your device to unlock. Continue applying pressure with the other paperclip as you do this."

Keep raking the pins over and over again until you’re confident that all the pins are pushed up. [14] X Research source There’s no exact formula to raking a lock. It take a lot of trial and error before you get the process down, so don’t give up!"
