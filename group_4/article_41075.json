      "content": "Apply a warm compress to the joints of your jaw. Soak a clean washcloth in hot water. Wring out the excess, then hold the moist cloth over the tensed or pained portion of your jaw for 10-15 minutes at a time. [1] X Research source Perform this procedure as soon as you notice tension or pain in your jaw, or immediately before known times of high stress to help prevent tension before it builds. The warmth should relax the muscles in your jaw and help them loosen up. A relaxed jaw is less likely to tense up and begin clenching again. Alternatively, if you’re clenching is causing swelling and pain, apply a cold compress to soothe jaw joint pain and reduce inflammation."

      "content": "Massage your jaw joints before bed or when they feel sore or tense. Use your fingers to gently massage the affected muscles. [2] X Expert Source Alina Lane, DDS Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020. Apply firm yet gentle pressure to the tensed portion of your jaw, then work around the entire jaw and mouth area with small, circular motions. It's best to perform this exercise before you have the opportunity to clench your jaw, but you can also repeat it after you notice jaw tension or pain. Massaging the affected area can release tension in the muscles of your jaw. Once the muscles have relaxed and loosened up, you'll naturally be less inclined to clench them. Head and neck massages can also be effective at reducing jaw tension and pain."

      "content": "Practice proper jaw placement throughout the day. If jaw clenching has become a chronic problem, you've likely trained yourself to hold your jaw improperly at a subconscious level. Practice mindful jaw placement every few hours throughout the day to retrain your brain and muscles. [3] X Expert Source Alina Lane, DDS Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020. Do the following to perform a simple jaw placement exercise: Close your lips and keep a slight gap between your upper and lower teeth. Then, place the tip of your tongue in between your front teeth. Hold it there for at least five minutes. During this time, your jaw muscles should relax and reset to a more natural position. If this simple correction doesn't feel comfortable or helpful, you may need to ask your dentist to show you the best position for your jaw. Memorize the way it feels and take pictures of the way it looks. Consult those pictures later while practicing the same placement in front of a mirror."

When you notice you’re clenching your jaw, pause for a moment and do one of the following exercises for several repetitions. Follow up with a jaw massage to stay relaxed and reduce the chance of tightening up later.

Mouth resistance exercise: Place your thumb under your chin and open your mouth, applying pressure to your chin with your thumb to create mild resistance. Hold for 3-5 seconds, then close your mouth. Jaw movements: Place a thin item like a popsicle stick between your top and bottom teeth. Lightly clench to hold the object in place, then slowly move your jaw side-to-side and front-to-back. As the exercise gets easier, gradually increase the thickness of the object."

      "content": "Increase your calcium, magnesium, vitamin C, and glucosamine intake. Calcium and magnesium are believed to help the jaw muscles relax, although there are few studies about their efficacy at reducing jaw tension. Vitamin C and glucosamine help rebuild cartilage in your jaw joints, and glucosamine may also reduce joint pain and increase the range of motion of your jaw. [7] X Research source To increase your intake through diet, focus on foods rich in calcium, magnesium, and vitamin C like dairy products, soybeans, whole grains, beans and legumes, and citrus fruits. Glucosamine is rare in food (it’s largely only found in shellfish shells from shrimp, lobster, and crabs), so consider taking a glucosamine supplement. Consult your doctor before trying any new supplements, as they may interfere with other medications."

[8] X Expert Source Alina Lane, DDS Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020. While stress is unavoidable, you can figure out ways of dealing with causes of stress once you identify them: Consider keeping a journal to help track your causes of stress. Make a note of any incident that causes anxiety, even if it seems mild, and pay special attention to causes of stress that occur immediately before or during daytime incidents of jaw clenching. Avoid any stress triggers that can be eliminated. For triggers that cannot be eliminated, balance them out with behaviors that help relax your mind. For instance, you might listen to soothing music, indulge in a warm bubble bath, meditate , or ease your mind with aromatherapy."

If you frequently clench your jaw when you’re uneasy or panicked, talk to your healthcare provider or a therapist about cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Typically, patients see results within 4-6 months that help them confront stress and anxiety without physical reactions, such as jaw clenching.

Mouth guards are generally made of hard plastic. You'll still feel pain caused by clenching the jaw, and that pain may worsen the underlying tension. Dental splints are made from soft acrylic and fitted to the shape of your mouth. They won't stop your jaw from clenching, but they should reduce the associated pain and may prevent the tension in your jaw from worsening. Note that both mouth guards and splints are generally reserved for nighttime treatment, but in extreme cases when daytime clenching is an issue, you can wear the equipment during daytime hours."

While there's very little scientific evidence to suggest the effectiveness of acupuncture, it stands as a popular form of alternative medicine.
