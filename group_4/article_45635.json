      "title": "Get your unlock code from TracFone.",
      "content": "Get your unlock code from TracFone. Call its customer service hotline at 1-800-867-7183, anytime between 8 AM to 11:45 PM (EST), any day of the week. When you get to talk with a representative, tell them that you need an unlock code for your phone. TracFone is a prepaid service provider, so it won’t be hard to request one. However, they will require your prepaid account to be active for at least a year before they can give you an unlock code. The representative will either dictate it to you over the phone (so have a pen and paper ready) or send it to your email."

There will be a recessed button that you can press (with a small tool like a paperclip) that ejects the SIM tray . Take out the old SIM card and place the new one in, making sure that the new card fits in the tray. Finally, press the Power button to turn your unit on."
