If you’re feeling extra creative, you could even whip up a delicious snack or treat for the 2 of you to share. [4] X Research source You can always use a third-party delivery app like DoorDash, UberEats, or GrubHub if you don’t feel like picking up the food yourself. If you're the cause of the irritation, replacing the undesired behavior with a more loving and caring act can help the situation."

      "content": "Start the conversation by talking in a low, calm tone of voice. It’s completely valid to feel confused and upset about your beau’s bad mood, but raising your voice really won’t accomplish anything productive. Instead, focus on creating a calm, safe space to discuss his mood. Throughout the conversation, do your best to stay calm, cool, and respectful.

Let him explain exactly how he’s feeling, so you’re both on the same page. [9] X Research source You might get the conversation going by saying: “Things seemed a little tense this morning, so I just wanted to check in. I’m here to listen if you wanna talk!” “Is everything all right? I got the feeling that you were annoyed with me earlier. I’m happy to listen if you want to share what’s on your mind.”"

Remind him that his emotions are valid and justified and that you understand where he’s coming from. [10] X Research source You might say: “I understand how frustrated you must have felt when I forgot to turn off my alarm.” “It sounds like you felt really annoyed when I didn’t text you back last night.” “It sounds to me like we had a miscommunication about what time to meet up yesterday, which must have been really frustrating.”"

Let him know that you didn’t mean to make him feel that way and that you’ll do your best to keep his feelings in mind in the future. [11] X Research source Try saying something like: “I definitely lost track of time at work last night, which is completely on me. I’ll be sure to set a reminder next time so I don’t keep you waiting.” “I got distracted with homework and completely forgot to text you yesterday, even though I said I would. I’m really sorry for not keeping my word.” Keep in mind that his bad mood may not be your fault at all! Feeling irritated, sad, and detached may be signs of a bigger issue, like depression.
