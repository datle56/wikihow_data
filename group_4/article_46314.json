If you just washed your hair, dry it with a towel so that it is evenly damp from roots to ends. It should not be soaking wet.

If you do wash your hair before using salt spray, use a moisturizing shampoo and a conditioner.

Place your palm beneath the ends and grab the hair while pushing it up. Work in sections, grabbing about a handful of hair at a time. The strands of hair should naturally gather and lock together, creating texture in the form of beachy waves.

This technique will add textured beach waves to your hair without flattening it out. [7] X Research source Don’t blow-dry with high heat or rub your hair dry with a towel, since either option will create frizz. Blow-drying adds volume.
