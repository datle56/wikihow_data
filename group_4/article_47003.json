      "title": "Hummel figurines are not very valuable unless they're old and rare.",
      "content": "Hummel figurines are not very valuable unless they're old and rare. There are thousands of Hummel designs on the market, and most are simply too high in quantity to hold any intrinsic value. This makes collecting and selling them secondhand not really worth the time and effort, especially considering you can only sell most of them for $15-$30 ($75 max) at auction. Plus, the figurines are outdated and old-fashioned in appearance, so a lot of modern collectors aren't interested in them from an aesthetic perspective, either. [1] X Research source The good news for Hummel collectors out there, though, is there are a select few Hummels that still bring in hundreds (sometimes thousands) of dollars. We'll cover those valuable figurines later in the article!"

      "content": "Mark Every authentic Hummel worth money has the M.I. Hummel signature carved into the side of the base. Additionally, the figurine should have a mold number on the bottom that matches the number of the item in the Hummel catalog. [2] X Research source Finally, each figurine has a trademark on the bottom showing when it was made. The trademark designs vary over the decades from 1935 to today, but they all feature a bee and a wide \"V\" or \"W.\" [3] X Research source If you find a Hummel figurine without a trademark or the M.I. Hummel signature, it's definitely a fake and not worth any money!"

      "content": "Age GmbH, the company that manufactures Hummels now, still releases new figurines every year. But collectors prize the oldest Hummels from the 1930s and 1940s more than the modern releases. The best way to tell the age of a Hummel figurine is by checking the trademark. The oldest trademarks show a wide \"W\" (for West Germany) on top of a \"G\" (for Goebel, the original Hummel manufacturer) with either the M.I. Hummel signature next to it or a wideset, stylized bee above it. [4] X Research source"

Bigger versions of the same design can sell for hundreds of dollars more than the smaller ones. Figures with wide bases and lots of figurines, like Adventure Bound and Ring Around the Rosie, are also highly sought-after, and you may be able to make a bigger profit off these items.

      "content": "Design & construction complexity Another factor that can make a Hummel figurine worth more is its construction complexity. Take a look at the Adventure Bound, for example. This piece has not one, not two, but 7 figurines on the base. Each character has its own distinct clothes, expression, and pose. Such intricate designs – when combined with other factors, like age and condition – can make a figurine like Adventure Bound go for a pretty penny at auction! [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Condition",
      "content": "Condition Like any other collectible, if your Hummel figurine is in good condition, that alone will definitely increase its value. The paint should be mostly if not all intact, and the glaze should look matte. There also shouldn't be any chips or pieces missing from the figurine or its base. If it has any of these flaws, that could lower its potential selling price at auction."

The small boy in the front is holding a spear, and the boy behind him has a lantern slung over his shoulder. We don't know where they're going, but they certainly look ready for an adventure!

If the auction house thinks they have buyers who will want your piece, they'll ask to appraise it first. Once they determine its value, you can sign a consignment agreement outlining your minimum desired price. If the auction house sells it, they receive commission fees for their work. Keep in mind that with an auction, there's no guarantee you'll get more than the minimum price you set in your consignment agreement. Make sure you're happy with that amount before following through with the auction."

Remember to include the cost of shipping in the final price and eBay's seller fees so you can still turn a profit. Just like with an auction house, you do run the risk that no one will bid on your item or you won't get much more than the starting bid price. You also have to provide returns in case the buyer isn't happy with their item or it arrives to them damaged."

An estate sale is a big sale of someone's belongings in the home where they lived. It's most common to hold an estate sale for an older person after they move into a nursing home or when they die. You may not be able to sell the Hummels for more than $20-$30, but it's the quickest, most hassle-free way to get them off your hands."

Always a talented artist, she nevertheless felt compelled to take her vows as a nun in 1934 and dedicate her life to the church. Part of her work at the convent was taking care of children, and these children inspired her to draw illustrations of them playing. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "What are Hummels? Hummels are collectible porcelain figurines of children at play. The first Hummels were released in 1935, with new and reimagined older designs being released every year since. The child figurines are almost instantly recognizable as Hummels by their chubby cheeks, pouted lips, and black eyes. The colors of their hair, facial features, skin, and clothes are soft, never garish. The all-over surface finish is always matte, but the eyes are glazed, making them look particularly lifelike.

These figurines have saturated the market, meaning there are too many of them and they're too easy to find, so they aren't worth anything.

Plus, they can give you a piece of paper called a Proof of Authenticity which will help collectors feel good about buying your figurine."
