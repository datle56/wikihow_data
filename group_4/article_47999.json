      "content": "Your car’s electronic stability control (ESC) system is off. The Service StabiliTrak warning light comes on when your stability control system isn’t functioning. This could be due to a blown fuse, wheel misalignment, or faulty sensors. The warning light can also come on if you’ve accidentally bumped the button that turns off the StabiliTrak. [1] X Research source The button is the same as your traction control button. It’s located on your console and has a picture of a car with zig-zags near the tires to indicate sliding. Faulty wheel speed, yaw, and steering angle sensors are some of the most common causes of a Service StabiliTrak warning light. [2] X Research source In fact, over 99% of the time this code is attributed to a bad front wheel spread."

      "title": "The traction control system (TCS) is malfunctioning.",
      "content": "The traction control system (TCS) is malfunctioning. The StabiliTrak system works closely with your vehicle's traction control system, using many of the same sensors. If there’s something wrong with the traction control, it can cause your car to think there’s also an issue with the ESC. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "There’s a problem with your car’s automatic braking system (ABS). Much like the TCS, StabiliTrak also works with your car’s ABS. Worn brakes and dirt or air in the brake lines can also cause your car’s computer to turn on the Service StabiliTrak warning light. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "There are known issues with the StabiliTrak System.",
      "content": "There are known issues with the StabiliTrak System. In the past, GM has issued recalls associated with a faulty steering sensor that could cause the stability control system to malfunction resulting in dangerous driving conditions. An internal GM probe in 2018 found nearly 74,000 warranty claims related to the faulty steering sensor. [5] X Research source The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration became aware of the situation but did not find enough evidence to open a formal investigation. [6] X Research source If you suspect there’s an issue with your StabiliTrak system, address the issue as soon as possible to maintain your vehicle’s safety features."

      "title": "Press the StabiliTrak button to turn the system back on.",
      "content": "Press the StabiliTrak button to turn the system back on. If the Service StabiliTrak warning light comes on while driving, pull over in a safe spot and put your car in park. Locate the StabiliTrak button. It’s usually near the shifter or steering wheel. Push the button for a few seconds to turn the system on again. If you don’t see the button, refer to your owner’s manual to find its exact location in your make and model."

      "title": "Turn your steering wheel clockwise all the way.",
      "content": "Turn your steering wheel clockwise all the way. When the problem is with the steering angle sensor, rotating the steering wheel can turn the light off. Start your car and put it in park. Then, rotate the steering wheel all the way clockwise. [7] X Research source If the light turns off, you may have a faulty steering angle sensor. Replace the faulty steering wheel sensor to keep the StabiliTrak system functioning properly and ensure the light doesn’t come back on."

      "title": "Use an OBD-II scanner to read and clear the error.",
      "content": "Use an OBD-II scanner to read and clear the error. OBD-II scanners are available online and at most auto parts stores. Connect the OBD-II reader to the diagnostic link connector (DLC) in your car. Following the reader’s instructions, scan your car’s OBD codes and reset the Service StabiliTrak warning light. If there are underlying issues, resetting the codes will not repair the system. The stability control system is malfunctioning and needs to be repaired if the Service StabiliTrak light turns back on."

      "content": "Take your car to a mechanic. If you’re having trouble determining what’s causing the Service StabiliTrak light to come on, it might be time to bring in a pro. While StabiliTrak is a complicated system that works with several other systems in your car, it’s usually a relatively inexpensive fix, ranging between $100 and $200. [8] X Research source The final cost depends on the specific issue, your car’s age and model, and your location."

      "content": "Driving in good conditions can be safe with a lit Service StabiliTrak light. It’s usually possible to drive with the Service StabiliTrak light on if you’re careful and don’t drive in hazardous conditions like heavy rain, snow, and ice. However, driving with your StabiliTrak system on and functioning properly is almost always safer. Use extra caution by reducing your speed and avoiding hard braking when striving without the StabiliTrak system. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Always drive with the StabiliTrak turned on. The StabiliTrak system was designed to be on whenever the car is. While there is a button to turn the stability control system in your vehicle off, it’s not a good idea to drive with the system disabled. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "StabiliTrak is the name of the electronic control system (ESC) on GMs. All modern GMs come with StabiliTrak installed to help drivers stay in control of the car in dangerous driving conditions. The system automatically brakes individual wheels to keep the car moving in the direction you’re steering and helps prevent the car from spinning out. The StabiliTrak system can brake up to 3 wheels at a time and uses sensors to compare wheel speed, steering, and yaw rate to driver input. [11] X Research source"
