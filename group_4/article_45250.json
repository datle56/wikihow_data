      "content": "Locate the windshield wiper control stalk on the right side of the steering wheel. In most cars, the control lever on the right side will let you switch your wipers on and off. You might also spot a dial on the control stalk, which will allow you to adjust the wiper speed—we’ll cover that in just a second. [1] X Research source In some cars, the windshield wiper controls might be on the left side. They’ll still work the same way, though!"

      "content": "Push the stalk up and back down to run your wipers once. Most cars will have a “mist” mode that lets you turn the wipers on for 1-2 wipes. You can use this mode anytime your windshield gets sprayed by a passing car on a wet day, or if it’s just lightly misting out. [2] X Research source In some cars, if you manually hold the lever in the up position, the wipers will keep running for as long as you hold the lever up. In other cars, pushing the stalk up will activate an “intermittent” wiper mode where the wipers will run every few seconds. [3] X Research source"

In many cars, pushing the control stalk down once will turn on “intermittent” wipers, which means they’ll run every few seconds. If you push the stalk down again, you’ll get a “slow continuous” mode. If you push the stalk down once more, you’ll get a “fast continuous” mode. [4] X Research source If your car has rain-sensing windshield wipers, pushing the control stalk down might activate an “auto” mode where the car will choose the appropriate frequency for the wipers. Pick an “intermittent” mode for light-to-medium rain and a “continuous” mode if you’re driving in heavy rain ."

      "content": "Adjust the “intermittent” wiper speed using the dial on the control stalk. Look on your wiper control stalk for a part with numbers, symbols, or arrows that increase in size. To increase the wiper speed, rotate the dial towards you. To reduce the wiper speed, rotate the dial away from you. [5] X Research source Cars typically have between 3-10 wiper speeds. In some cars, you can turn the wipers on simply by rotating the dial towards you, without pulling the control stalk down. The “auto” mode usually activates the rain-sensing system to calculate the ideal wiper speed for you. [6] X Research source"

If you see the symbol on the control stalk, use the rear wiper dial on the control stalk to turn the rear wipers on. If you see the symbol on the dashboard, push a button to control the back wipers. [8] X Research source You can usually find the rear windshield wipers dial to the left of the main windshield wipers dial. In other cars, the back windshield wiper controls might be a push button on the end of the control stalk. Not all cars have back windshield wipers. Check your owner’s manual if you’re not sure whether you have them or if the controls seem different. You can also search online for specific wiper instructions for your car’s make and model."

In that case, push the control stalk away from you to release wiper fluid for the back window. Not all cars have a feature that lets you wash the back window using wiper fluid.
