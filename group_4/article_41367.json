      "content": "Refrain from trying to cut off the wart. Trying to cut off a wart will cause it to bleed a lot. It can also leave a scar. If the wart is causing you significant pain or embarrassment and/or you haven't had any luck with over-the-counter remedies, ask your doctor about possible treatments, such as cryotherapy, to remove the wart. [7] X Research source Over-the-counter treatments for warts typically contain the active ingredient of salicylic acid, and come in the form of gels, creams, and medicated bandages. Cryotherapy involves the application of liquid nitrogen to your wart. The liquid nitrogen will freeze the wart, destroying the skin cells. This is a simple and quick procedure; a typical session will take only 5 – 15 minutes. It may be painful, however. Most warts will blister, scab over, and fall off 7 – 10 days after the cryotherapy session."
