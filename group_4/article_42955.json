      "content": "Write midnight (12:00 a.m.) as 0000 (“zero hundred hours”). Instead of having a 12-hour clock that resets twice, the military clock starts at midnight (0000 hours) and runs for 24 hours through 11:59 p.m. (2359 hours) before resetting at 0000 hours. In these 4-digit times, the first two numbers represent the hour of the day, and the second two numbers represent the minutes within that hour. [1] X Research source Note that the military clock does not use a colon to separate the hours and minutes. There is no need to specify a.m. or p.m. in military time since the clock runs for 24 hours. Contrary to popular belief, the military does not call midnight 2400 hours, or “twenty-four hundred hours” (although some other organizations may use this terminology)."

Note that using “hours” is optional. For example, you could say 0300 as “zero three hundred.”"

For example, 1545 becomes “fifteen forty-five hours” or just “fifteen forty-five.” Here are some more rules for this process: [6] X Research source If there are one or more zeros in front of the number, say them. 0003 (12:03 a.m.) is “zero zero zero three hours” and 0215 (2:15 a.m.) is “zero two fifteen hours.” If there are no zeros in the first two digits of the number, say the first two numbers as a set and do the same with the last two digits. For example, 1234 becomes “twelve thirty-four hours,” 1404 becomes “fourteen zero four hours,” and 0130 is “zero one thirty.”"

If you see a number greater than 1200, that means you've reached the afternoon hours, so just subtract 1200 from that number to get the time using the 12-hour clock. For example, 1400 hours is 2 p.m. in standard time because you get 200 when you subtract 1200 from 1400. 2000 hours is 8 p.m. because when you subtract 1200 from 2000, you get 800. [7] X Research source If you're looking at a time less than 1200, then you know you're working with numbers from midnight until noon. Simply use the first two digits to get the a.m. hour, and the last two digits to get the minutes to convert to military time. For example, 0950 hours means 9 hours and 50 minutes, or 9:50 a.m. 1130 hours means 11 hours and 30 minutes, or 11:30 a.m."

To have zero risk of mixing up a.m. and p.m. hours, these industries use military or 24-hour time.

      "content": "The ancient Egyptians devised the first 24-hour time keeping system. They based their hours off of the movement of 24 stars (12 for daytime hours and 12 for nighttime hours). However, these hours were of different lengths due to the changing of the seasons. The ancient Greeks conceptualized 24 even hours in a day, and using 24-hour sundials (and eventually clocks) came to be standard in many parts of the world by the Middle Ages. [10] X Research source During the Industrial Revolution and the spread of railways, standardized 24-hour time became essential to make sure rail passengers in different time zones and locations could reliably catch their trains. Today, many countries use 24-hour time as their standard method of timekeeping. In the US, it is primarily used only in the military and other scientific industries, which is why it’s known here as “military time.”"
