Read the following problem: Your bank account increases linearly each week. If after 20 weeks of work, your bank account is at $560, while after 21 weeks of work it is at $585, find a way to express the relationship between how much money you've earned and how many weeks you've worked in slope-intercept form."

[2] X Expert Source Grace Imson, MA Math Instructor, City College of San Francisco Expert Interview. 1 November 2019. Notice that the problem states, \"Your bank account increases linearly each week,\" meaning that you are saving the same amount of money each time, which means it will have a smooth slope. That \"smooth,\" uniformly consistent savings plan makes it linear. If you don't save the same amount all the time, then it is not linear."

[3] X Research source If you started with $560 and now have $585 the next week, then you have earned $25 after 1 week of work.

[4] X Research source If you had $560 after 20 weeks of work, and you know that you earn $25 after every week of work, then you can multiply 20 \\times 25 to figure out how much money you earned in those 20 weeks. 20 × 25 = 500 {\\displaystyle 20\\times 25=500} , which means that you earned $500 in those weeks. Since you have $560 after 20 weeks and have earned $500, you can figure out how much you started with by subtracting 500 from 560. 560 - 500 = 60. Therefore, b = 60 {\\displaystyle b=60} ."

So, if you start at the point (0, 3) and go up (\"rise\") 4 points, you'll be at (0, 7). Then, you should move to the right (\"run\") one coordinate, so you get (1, 7) as another point on this line.

So, using those given values we have: y - y 1 = m(x - x 1 ) , y - (-3) = -2(x - 4) , by substitution using the point and slope y + 3 = -2(x - 4) , by simplifying -(-3) to + 3 y + 3 = -2x + -2(-4) , by distribution y + 3 = -2x + 8 , by multiplying y + 3 - 3 = -2x + 8 - 3 , by subtraction (of equals from both sides of the equation) y = -2x + 5 , by simplifying/rewriting it (That fits the y = mx + b called the Slope Intercept Form). What is Point–-slope form based on? The point-slope form expresses the fact that the difference of y values for two points on one line (that is, y − y 1 ) can be stated as directly proportional to the difference of x values (that is, x − x 1 ). There is a proportionality constant called m (the slope of the line). We find that Direct Proportion is a comparison that can be stated in a form similar to y = kx . Here we notice that y - y 1 = m(x - x 1 ) fits the form y = kx . Direct proportion means that given two variables such as x and y, then y is called directly proportional to x, if there is a constant k such that y = kx , if and only if x is not zero. \"k\" is the proportionality constant which is just the slope as we are using it. (You can also express direct proportion by saying \"x and y vary directly\", or express that \"x and y are in direct variation\")."
