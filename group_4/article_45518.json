Unfriending someone, however, allows the other person to interact with you. Here are some major differences: When you block someone, you won't see their comments in a mutual Discord server. This isn't true when you remove someone from your Friends, however. If you unfriend someone, they can still see what you say on mutual servers, and vice-versa. When you block someone, they will not be able to send you a friend request. If you remove someone from your Friends, they can send you a friend request if they notice that you're no longer friends. A blocked user cannot DM you; they will get an error that their message cannot be delivered. Depending on your direct message settings, people not on your friend list cannot send you private messages. Blocked users cannot see your profile info like your \"About Me\" section. Unfriended users can see this information when they look at your profile. Discord does not notify the other person if you block or unfriend them."
