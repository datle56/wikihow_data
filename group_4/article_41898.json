      "content": "Wash your dreadlocks regularly and dry them completely. Shampoo your dreadlocks at least once a week with a residue-free dreadlock shampoo for tight dreadlocks that are easier to style. [1] X Research source Always dry your dreads thoroughly by squeezing them in a towel after washing. Let them air dry completely before styling to avoid creating any damp spots that might become musty. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Sleep in a silk nightcap each night. Keep your dreadlocks frizz free and ready for styling by sleeping in a protective nightcap. A silk cap helps keep moisture in your dreadlocks and reduces friction from your pillow. Your dreadlocks will be hydrated and ready for styling when you wake up each day. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use locking pomade to smooth out frizziness immediately before styling. Use your fingertips to apply a thin film of locking pomade to the frizzy loose hairs at the root of each dreadlock. Work the pomade into the hair to moisturize it, and then twist the lock in the direction of the hair growth to help incorporate the loose hairs. Rub any locking pomade residue on your fingers down the length of each dreadlock. This pomade routine will help set your style and hold it in place, much like a hairspray."

      "title": "Form a traditional braid with your dreadlocks.",
      "content": "Form a traditional braid with your dreadlocks. If your dreadlocks are at least chin-length, put them in a ponytail or in two pigtails. Separate each pony into three equal sections of dreadlocks. Cross the right section of the three over the center section. Repeat this motion with the left side. Continue alternating crossing the sides of the braid over the center until you reach the ends of the dreadlocks. [4] X Research source Secure your single or pigtail braids with hair ties so they don’t come undone."

      "title": "French braid",
      "content": "French braid your dreadlocks. Gather three equal sections of dreadlocks from the crown of your head. Begin braiding the sections in a traditional braid. Gradually, incorporate additional dreadlocks from each side of the head into the side sections of your braid. Continue until all the dreadlocks from the sides have been incorporated fully into your braid. [5] X Research source Secure the braid with a hairband. You could also do 2, 3, or more French braids with your dreadlocks."

    {
      "title": "Curl your dreadlocks",
      "content": "Curl your dreadlocks using rollers. Spray water onto your dreadlocks to dampen them. Then, wrap the end of one dreadlock around a satin-covered foam roller, so the curl is twisting away from your face. Continue wrapping the lock around the roller until you reach the scalp. Secure the roller using a hairpin. Repeat this method until all your dreadlocks are rolled. Let this style set under a warm dryer for 15 minutes, or wrap it in a silk nightcap and let it set overnight without heat. Smaller rollers will create tighter curls, and larger rollers will create looser waves."

      "content": "Fishtail braid your dreadlocks. Separate your dreadlocks into two equal sections, holding one in each hand. Using your right index finger, gather a dreadlock from the outside of the left section. Cross it over the left bundle of locks and pull it underneath the right section, adding it to that right section of locks. Now perform this process using the left index finger and the right bundle of dreadlocks. [6] X Research source Repeat this method you’ve reached the end of your hair. Secure the style with a hair tie."

      "content": "Basketweave your dreadlocks. Grab two small sections of dreadlocks from the crown of your head. Cross them over one another. Then gather two new sections, one from either side of your head from slightly further down, cross them over the sections you just crossed to secure them. Repeat this process until you’ve gathered and crossed all the dreadlocks on the sides of your head. [7] X Research source Secure your basketweave with hairpins or a hair tie. You can turn this into a half-up hairstyle, by basket-weaving from the crown of your head to your ears and then securing it. Leave the rest of your dreadlocks loose."

      "content": "Cornrow your dreadlocks. Use your fingers to separate your dreadlocks into even vertical rows from your forehead all the way back to the nape of your neck. Secure each section loosely with a hair band to keep the integrity of your parts. French braid each individual section starting at the forehead to create fine rows of braided dreadlocks. [8] X Research source Secure each braid with a small hairband."

      "content": "Form a ponytail . Use your fingers to gather all your dreadlocks into one mass. Hold the bunch of dreadlocks at the base against your scalp with one hand. Secure a hairband around the base of the dreadlocks to fix them into a ponytail shape. Play with your ponytail by changing up the positioning. You can secure it at the nape of your neck for a low-key style, or put it high on your head for a theatrical ponytail fit for a popstar. Or, you could change up your part. Use a center part, a deep side part, or even no part at all."

      "content": "Try a bun . If your dreadlocks are shoulder-length or longer, gather them into a ponytail and then twist it, holding the twist in place with your fingers. Wrap the twisted dreads around the hairband at the base of your ponytail to form a spiral bun. Secure your bun with another hairband over the top or with hairpins. [9] X Research source For a casual look, create a looped bun instead. When creating your ponytail, pull your loose dreads only halfway through the last turn of the hairband. This will create a messy, loose bun."

      "content": "Create a Mohawk. Shave the sides of your head to create a thick strip of dreads going from your forehead to the nape of your neck. If your have short dreads, your Mohawk will stand up vertically. If you have heavier, longer dreads, you can style your dreads to either side as you wish. If you don’t want to shave the sides of your head, pin the dreadlocks up into a Mohawk style and secure them with bobby pins. Or, cornrow the hair on the sides of your head and leave the dreads free on the top."

      "content": "Wear your dreads half up. Run your thumbs along the sides of your head above your ears until they meet behind your head. Use a hair tie to secure the top section of your dreadlocks into a ponytail, and leave the bottom section loose.

      "content": "Create a Gibson tuck updo. Pull your hair into a low ponytail at the nape of your neck. Above the hairband, open up a separation in your secured dreadlocks, and flip your loose ponytail through the hole. This will create a twisted effect on both sides. [10] X Research source Flip the loose ends of your dreadlocks up through the hole once more, but this time use hairpins to secure the loose ends of your dreadlocks on the underside of the twisted area. [11] X Research source The final look will be a sleek wrapped updo. You will need medium-to-long dreadlocks to execute this style. Note that the longer your dreadlocks are, the heavier they will be to wear up. Use as many hairpins as needed for your style to feel comfortable and secure."

These are usually applied for a day style and should be removed at night for sleeping. Avoid sleeping in hair jewelry to keep your dreadlocks from becoming frizzy."
