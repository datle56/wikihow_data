Make sure that your lap belt sits low on your hip bones and that the shoulder belt goes across the center of your chest. Children should be seated in proper child restraints until they are large enough to properly wear a lap and shoulder belt.

      "content": "Drive a safe car which is fitted with seat belts and other safety features. You won't have to worry about head support unless you are driving a really old car from the 1980s or under. Older cars, which may just have lap belts and almost never have any additional safety features, are generally less safe than large vehicles. SUVs tend to be more prone to rollover accidents than cars. Try to drive the safest car that suits your needs and budget. The Insurance Institute for highway safety maintains extensive crash test ratings and lists of safe vehicles of different sizes and styles. [2] X Research source In Europe, Euro NCAP maintains these ratings. Their website is at https://euroncap.com"

      "content": "Do not lean against the dashboard. If there is a high-speed crash, the car's airbags inflate. They have saved lives, but they inflate with such force that if you are leaning against the dashboard when they inflate you will be thrown backward and injured. If the car has curtain airbags (also called side airbags) it is also dangerous to lean against the sides of the car."

These features can easily be disabled or malfunction, not responding in the event of an imminent crash or responding when there is no imminent crash. Reliance on these safety features can result in serious injuries. [4] X Research source"

[7] X Research source Look ahead for cars or pedestrians that may move into your car's path. Keeping a safe distance behind other vehicles (following the \"two second rule\" ) can help you have enough time to react when a vehicle in front of you makes an unexpected move. Stay away from distracted drivers (e.g., the guy on his way to work using an electric razor), tailgaters and other drivers engaging in risky behaviors. Keep an eye on parked cars. They may pull out in front of you; people may exit from them or move from between them without much warning."

No anti-lock brakes - If your car lacks anti-lock brakes, you need to pump the brakes to keep the car under control. If you slam on the brakes, your car will start to skid and you will lose control. You cannot steer a vehicle when the brakes are locked. Press firmly, then release. If you feel the tires start to skid release the brakes before steering. Anti-lock brakes - Do not pump anti-lock brakes. Your car's ABS computer will pulse them much faster than you can (you will feel the pedal vibrate a bit when this occurs). Just hold the brakes firmly and steer normally. [8] X Research source"

If the back of your car is sliding to the driver's left, turn the wheels to the left. Wait for your tires to regain traction before braking or pressing the accelerator."

      "content": "Take appropriate measures after an accident. After a crash, switch off your engine, unlock the doors, and turn on the hazard lights. Extinguish any open flames, like matches or cigarettes. This is especially important if one of the vehicles involved in the crash was carrying dangerous goods (e.g. flammable goods such as paraffin or aerosols, or explosive goods), as in such crashes it is important to prevent explosions or fires, as much as you are not in a film and in reality cars can only really explode or catch fire after crashes if the crash involved a vehicle carrying dangerous goods. If you can, carefully move your vehicle to the shoulder of the road. You can exchange insurance information and figure out who is liable for the accident."

Explosions are very unlikely, and you could aggravate any neck spinal injuries, even if the victim feels uninjured. Leave removal of injured people to the emergency services. [12] X Research source Remain in your vehicle, unless if your car is on fire. The last thing you want is that you are struck by an oncoming car when attempting to get out."
