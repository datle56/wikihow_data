      "content": "Purchase a 3.5mm headset/mic Y connector cable. Cables like this have two female 3.5mm jacks and a single 3.5mm male plug. You can order a connector like this online. They are generally inexpensive, costing less than $10. Make sure the 3.5mm Y connector you purchase is meant to connect audio headphones and a mic. Many 3.5mm Y connectors are designed to connect two sets of audio headphones rather than one set of headphones and a mic. Alternatively, you can purchase a 3.5mm-to-USB adapter. This allows you to connect a headset to a USB port on your computer. If your headset has two separate plugs for the mic and the headphones, purchase an adapter with audio-in and audio-out jacks. [1] X Research source Conversely, if you have a headset with one 3.5mm plug for headphones and mic, but your computer has two separate jacks for headphones and a mic, you can purchase a 3.5mm splitter cable to split the single 3.5mm input into two separate outputs."

If you use a desktop PC, the 3.5mm headphone jack may be on the back or front of the tower. This connects both 3.5mm plugs on your headset to a single headphone jack. If you are using a 3.5mm-to-USB adapter, connect the adapter to a free USB port on your computer instead. [2] X Research source"

A Bluetooth headset can connect to your PC without the use of wires. You can get Bluetooth headsets from any store that sells electronics. They can range in price from $20 to several hundred dollars, depending on their quality. If your headset is not Bluetooth-capable, buy a 3.5mm-to-Bluetooth adapter. If your headset has two separate plugs for the mic and the headphones, purchase an adapter with a separate jack for the headphones and the microphone."

If you charge a Bluetooth device using a USB port on your computer, make sure your computer is powered on the entire time. Your headset may not charge as quickly if you charge it off your computer as it would if you use a wall outlet."
