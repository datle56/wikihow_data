There are 3 main types of piece on the Rubik's Cube, named after their positions: [1] X Research source Center pieces are located in the center of each face, surrounded by 8 other pieces. They have only 1 visible face, and do not move. Corner pieces are located at the corners of the cube. Each one has 3 visible faces. Edge pieces are located between the corner pieces. Each one has 2 visible faces. Pieces can never switch types. A corner piece will always be at a corner and a center piece will always be in the center."

When referring to each color face, always go by the color of the center piece, regardless of where the other colored pieces are. You can also refer to faces by their position on the cube when you hold it at eye-level. These positions are: [2] X Research source F (Front) — the face you’re looking at when you hold the cube directly in front of you B (Back) — the face directly opposite you (not visible) U (Upper) — facing up, toward the ceiling D (Down) — facing down, toward the floor R (Right) — facing to your right L (Left) — facing to your left"

A 1-letter instruction (such as L ) means to rotate that face clockwise 90º (one quarter turn). 1 letter plus an apostrophe (such as L' ) means to rotate that face counterclockwise 90º. Here are a few other examples of rotations: [3] X Research source F' — rotate the Front face counterclockwise R — rotate the Right face clockwise L — rotate the Left face clockwise U' — rotate the Upper face counterclockwise (towards you) B — rotate the back face clockwise"

For example, D2 means rotate the down face 180º (two quarter turns). [4] X Research source There's no need to specify clockwise or counterclockwise for 180° turns. Either way, the face will end up in the same position."

Shorthand generally refers to the specific face each piece is a part of. For example: [5] X Research source BD (Back Down) refers to the edge piece that belongs to the Back and Down faces. UFR (Upper Front Right) refers to the corner piece with 1 square each on the upper, front, and right faces. If the instructions refer to a square (a single colored sticker), the 1st letter tells you which face the square is found on. For example: if you need to find an LFD square (Left Front Down) , check the left face. If you need to find a BRE square (Back Right Edge) , check the back face."

[7] X Research source If there's a white edge piece in the bottom row of the R or L face , rotate that face once in either direction to bring the white square to the middle row. If there's a white edge square in the middle row of the R or L face, rotate either the F or B side (whichever is next to the white square) in either direction until that white square is on the Down face. If there's a white edge square on the Down face , rotate the Down face in either direction until the white square is directly opposite an empty (non-white) edge space in the Upper face. Turn the entire cube so that non-white face is located at UF (Upper face, next to Front face). Then, rotate F2 (forward 180º) to bring the white square into that UF position.

For example, if the edge square FU (front face, next to upper face) is orange, then the F center square should also be orange. [8] X Research source If the FUE (Front Upper Edge), RUE (Right Upper Edge), BUE (Back Upper Edge), and LUE (Left Upper Edge) pieces do not match their color faces, use the following methods to match these squares: Rotate the U face until at least 2 of F, R, B, or L faces have matching center and upper edge. (If all 4 match, skip the rest of this step.) Re-position the whole cube so one of the incorrect edges is on the F face (and the white cross is still on the U face). Rotate F2 and confirm that one white edge is now on the D face. Check the other color on the same piece (position FD). For this example, this square is red. Rotate the D face until the red square is directly beneath the red center. Rotate the red face 180º degrees. The white edge should return to the U face. Check the D face for a new white edge square. Again, look for the other color attached to the same piece. For this example, the square’s color is green. Rotate the D face until the green square is directly beneath the green center. Rotate the green face 180º. The white cross should now be back on the U face. The F, R, B, and L faces should all have a matching center piece and upper edge."

For this example, we’ll use blue and orange. Complete the following permutations: [9] X Research source Rotate the D face until the white/blue/orange corner piece is between the blue and orange faces. (Remember, the \"blue face\" is the face with a blue square as its center piece.) Turn the entire cube so the white/blue/orange corner piece is in the DFR position , but don't worry about the exact position of each color on this piece. The F and R center squares should match the colors blue and orange. Note that the Upper face is still white From here there are three possibilities for the corner piece: If the white square is on the Front face (FRD position), apply F D F'.
