      "content": "Learn the names of the 6 faces and how to read algorithms. Rubik’s Cube expert Phil Yu mentions that to make solving less complicated, people use special notation to name the cube’s faces and which way to turn them. An “algorithm” is just a sequence of moves listed in order to move the colors into the right spots. When you see a letter all by itself, turn the matching face clockwise by 90 degrees. U = the upper face on top D = the down face on the bottom R = the right face on the right side L = the left face on the left side F = the front face B = the back face If the letter is followed by an apostrophe, such as U’ or F’ , then turn the face counter-clockwise by 90 degrees instead. If the number 2 comes after a letter, like D2 or L2 , then turn the face clockwise twice for a total of 180 degrees."

Position the cube so the white square is on the upper face, the red square is on the front face, and the blue square is on the right face. [1] X Research source While you may turn and rotate the cube throughout solving it, you’ll always return to this position to check your progress on the top layer. When you’re finished setting the top layer of your Rubik’s cube, the white squares will all be on the upper face."

If it’s already on the bottom layer, then move on to the next step. If the corner is in the top layer, hold the cube so the corner is positioned in the top-right of the front face and do the following algorithm: [2] X Research source (R’, D’, R) This shifts the white-blue-orange corner to the bottom layer. It doesn’t matter which squares are on each face. If the white-blue-orange corner is already next to the white square with the logo and both blue squares are next to each other, then the corner is already in the right position."

Twist the down face until any square of the white-blue-orange corner is in the bottom-right of the front face. The next moves depend on which square is on the front face. [3] X Research source If the white square is on the front face, use the algorithm (R) This brings the white squares together on the upper face and the blue squares together on the front face. If the blue square is on the front face, use the algorithm (R’, D’, R) This positions the blue square on the bottom first, then shifts the white square to the front, and then finally places the white square on the upper face. If the orange square is on the front face, then follow the algorithm (D, R2) This shifts the blue square to the back and then brings the white and blue squares together on the upper and front faces."

[4] X Research source If the orange square is in the top-right corner of the upper face, then just do (R’) This immediately places the corner in the correct position and you can move on to placing the final corner. If the green or white square is in the top-right corner on the upper face, then use the algorithm (R, D’) This brings the white-green-orange corner to the bottom layer with one of the squares on the front face. If the orange or green square are on the bottom-right corner of the upper face, then use (R2, D’) This first places the corner in the bottom layer on the back face, and then positions it on the front face."

[5] X Research source If the white square is on the front face, use the algorithm (R) This places the third white square into the proper spot on the upper face. If the orange square is on the front face, use the algorithm (R’, D’, R) This first moves the orange square on the bottom, then moves the white square to the front, and then positions the white square in the correct spot on the upper face.

If it’s already in the top layer and the white square is on the upper face, then the layer is already solved. [6] X Research source If the corner is in the top layer but the red or green square is on the upper face, then use the algorithm (R’, D’, R) This positions white-green-red corner onto the bottom layer without affecting the other correctly-placed corners. When the corner is in the bottom layer, twist the bottom layer until the piece is in the bottom-right corner of the front face. If the red square is on the front face, use the algorithm (F, D’, F’, D2, D’, R’, D, R) The first moves of the algorithm bring the white square to the bottom-right front corner, and then the last 4 moves place the corner back on the top layer. If the white square is on the front face, use the algorithm (D’, R’, D’, R) This repositions the final corner so the red squares are touching on the right face, and then moves the white square to the upper face. If the green square is on the front face, then follow the algorithm (R’, D’, R) This moves the red square to the right face and then brings the white and green squares together on the upper and front faces.
