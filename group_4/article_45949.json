Turn on both the hot and cold water and let it run for a few seconds to heat up, adjusting as needed until the water is warm. Then, use your hands to splash water on your face.

Then, gently massage the foam all over your face and neck in circular motion, avoiding your eyes. [1] X Expert Source Lydia Shedlofsky, DO Dermatologist Expert Interview. 3 May 2021.

While it may be tempting to scrub the foam into your skin if you’re removing layers of makeup or sunscreen, doing so can irritate your skin. It may also push impurities deeper into your pores and make acne worse. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a gentle moisturizer to keep your skin from drying out. Even if you have oily, acne-prone skin, it’s important that you always follow a cleansing foam wash with moisturizer to restore your skin’s natural moisture. This is particularly important if your cleansing foam contains sodium lauryl sulfate (as most do), which could dry out and irritate your skin if you don’t re-moisturize after use.

      "title": "Try a cleansing foam if your skin is oily and acne-prone.",
      "content": "Try a cleansing foam if your skin is oily and acne-prone. Cleansing foams tend to get rid of more excess oil in your skin than other types of face wash. As a result, this type of cleanser is generally recommended for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Most cleansing foams contain an ingredient called sodium lauryl sulfate, which strips the oils out of your skin. While this can be irritating for many skin types, if you have very oily skin, it may work for you and leave your skin feeling clean and fresh. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a cleansing foam to remove heavy makeup or sunscreen. If you use any makeup or sunscreen products that are difficult to remove, using a cleansing foam could be a good option for you. Cleansing foams create a foamy lather that tends to be more effective at breaking down products and impurities on your skin than other types of face washes, making them easier to remove. If you have sensitive or dry skin, you’ll likely want to only use a cleansing foam to remove heavy makeup and sunscreen and stick to a more gentle cleanser for everyday washes."

      "content": "Choose a moisturizing cleansing foam if your skin is sensitive. While most cleansing foams can be a bit too harsh for sensitive skin types, there are some products that are formulated with moisturizers. These moisturizing cleansing foams are a great option for people whose skin is prone to acne breakouts, yet sensitive and easily irritated. The foam formula will strip your skin of dirt and impurities, while the added moisturizes will keep your face from drying out. When searching for a moisturizing cleansing foam, look for options that are labeled “non-soap” or “neutral pH.” [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid using a cleansing foam if your skin is very dry. Because cleansing foams are formulated to strip oils out of your skin, they generally aren’t recommended for people whose skin is already dry and sensitive. While it’s possible that a cleansing foam with added moisturizers could work for dry and sensitive skin, you’re likely better off trying out a different type of cleanser. A hydrating cream cleanser might be a good option for you if a cleansing foam is too harsh for your skin. [9] X Research source"
