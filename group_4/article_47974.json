      "content": "“NF” or “/Nf” stands for “no force” or “not forcing” in texts and social media. Texting “NF” after you ask someone to do something or ask them a question is another way to say “no pressure.” It’s a way to let them know that your tone is polite and that you’re not ordering them to do something or demanding an answer. Similarly, “/Nf” is a tone indicator on sites like Tumblr and Discord and also means “no force” or “not forcing.” [1] X Research source “NF, but could you give me a ride tomorrow? I’d rather not bike to school.” “Anyone up to playing Fortnite with me? /nf”"

      "content": "Text “NF” when asking for a favor or asking a personal question. If you need to ask a friend or family member to help you with something, add “NF” to your text to let them know there’s no pressure if they can’t or are unwilling to. It’s also great to text “NF” when you’re asking someone something personal so they know you’re not forcing them to answer or expecting a response. “Will you dog sit for me next weekend? NF though, I can find someone else if not.” “I’m so sorry to hear that you and Isaiah broke up. What happened? I’m here if you want to talk, but NF.”"

      "content": "Add “/Nf” to social media posts and comments to clarify your tone. “/Nf” is a popular tone indicator that helps your online friends and followers understand the tone and intent of your message. If you want to ask someone to do something with you, make a request, or ask a sensitive question, adding “/nf” to the end of your comment or post lets the person know that it’s okay if they decline—you’re not pressuring them to do anything or demanding an answer. “When you reblog my posts, can you tag me? /nf” “Everyone seems off today. Did something happen in the Discord server? /nf” Tone indicators are popular on social media because it can be difficult to convey your tone online. Typing “/nf” (and other tone indicators ) after your message helps prevent any misunderstandings or miscommunication by clarifying your intention—you’re not trying to be rude or demanding. Tone indicators are especially useful for people who have difficulty picking up on tone, context, and emotional cues, such as people who are neurodivergent."
