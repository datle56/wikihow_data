Say something like “I understand, it happens to the best of us,” or “Thank you for the apology, I know we’re all busy this time of year,” recommends Cartas. Avoid sounding frustrated or upset.

In the future, I’d like to see a 24-hour turnaround from you on reports. I understand that things out of our control sometimes pop up, so if this happens again, please let me know in advance. Thank you for sending these along for me. If your emails aren’t being responded to in a timely manner, consider putting when you’d like a response in the subject line of your email.

Cartas reminds us that you can stick up for yourself, even in a business setting: “As an [employee], you shouldn’t just do everything that someone is telling you to do. [It’s important to be] able to express to your supervisor or colleagues, ‘Hey, I understand you want to do a project, but at the same time, I have B, C, and D, and these are taking up all my priorities. If you want me to finish that project, one of them has to be delayed. So, which one will it be?’”"

A few things to note, according to Cartas, are to make sure your emails are being forwarded to someone else, your boss is aware of your situation, and a system has been set up for your work to be done by someone else."
