With this deed, the seller guarantees that he or she owns the property being transferred. [1] X Research source If the seller does not actually hold title, then the buyer can sue for compensation. A warranty deed provides the buyer with the most protection. You should use it if you don’t know the seller. Quitclaim Deed. With a quitclaim deed, the seller transfers whatever interest in the property that they own. However, the seller does not promise that it actually owns the title to the property. [2] X Research source Because quitclaim deeds provide less protection, they are usually used to transfer property between family members or between close friends. Grant Deed. With a grant deed, the seller promises that the title hasn’t been transferred to someone else. [3] X Research source Grant deeds are not available in all states."

People can hold a property in the following ways: [4] X Research source Tenants in common. The grantees can take unequal shares. For example, you might transfer property to two siblings, one of whom will take 70% ownership and the other will take 30% ownership. Either person can sell their share when they want. Also, when one owner dies, their share can be left to whoever they want. Language to create a tenancy in common would read: “Grantor, for a valuable consideration, conveys to Grantees, Alice K. Jones and Adam Y. Jones, as tenants in common, the following described real estate, together with rents, profits, fixtures, and other appurtenant interests, in Dane County, State of Wisconsin (‘Property’):” Joint tenants.

Jones, as joint owners with rights of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.…” [5] X Research source Tenants by the entirety.

If you use an attachment, clearly label the piece of paper “Attachment A.” Make sure that you describe the property accurately.
