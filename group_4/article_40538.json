      "content": "Ancient seeds are artifacts that can be converted into fruit seeds. Technically, the game has two types of ancient seeds: artifacts and plantable fruit seeds. To get the fruit seeds, you must first find the artifact version of the seed. Once planted, ancient seeds will grow into plants that yield ancient fruits, which can be sold and made into other products. [1] X Research source When found as an artifact, the description for an ancient seed will read: “It's a dry old seed from some ancient plant. By all appearances it's long since dead…” The selling price for an ancient seed artifact is 5 gold; the selling price for the plantable fruit seed is 30 gold."

      "content": "Ancient seeds can be found in artifact spots and monster drops. There are several ways to find ancient seed artifacts. They can be obtained by digging up artifact spots in Cindersap Forest or the Mountain, looted in artifact troves, or dropped from several types of bug Monster. You can also find them when cutting foliage in the mines, Skull Cavern, or the Volcano Dungeon. The odds of getting a seed are: [2] X Research source Cindersap Forest: 0.7% chance The Mountain: 0.7% chance Monster drops (Bug, Cave Fly, Grub, Mutant Fly, and Mutant Grub): 0.5% chance for all monsters Fishing treasure chests (after Fishing Level 2): 0.7 - 0.8% chance Artifact troves: 3.7% chance In the Skull Cavern, you’ll only find ancient seeds on the Prehistoric Floors. Additionally, the Mines must be in a “dangerous” state (which you can do by toggling the Shrine of Challenge) to find ancient seeds."

      "content": "Plantable ancient seeds can be obtained with a Seed Maker. There’s only one other way to get plantable seeds besides crafting them: using a Seed Maker. However, it’s not guaranteed. Rather, whenever you use the Seed Maker with a crop other than ancient fruit, there’s a 0.5% chance you’ll get a packet of ancient seeds instead of that crop’s seeds. [3] X Research source It takes 20 in-game minutes to process seeds in a Seed Maker, and you’ll only be able to craft the machine after reaching Farming Level 9. If you get plantable ancient seeds before finding the artifact version, you can start growing them at your farm (since only the artifact can be donated to the museum)."

When you find an ancient seed artifact, bring it to the museum in Pelican Town and donate it; Gunther, the villager who accepts museum donations, will reward you with a packet of plantable ancient seeds. In addition, you’ll also get a crafting recipe that will let you make ancient seeds from the artifact version. [4] X Research source"

You can’t grow plants from artifacts, so after donating the first ancient seed, use the crafting recipe (called “Ancient Seeds”) to make seeds from which you can plant and grow fruits. The recipe requires 1 ancient seed artifact, and you’ll get 1 plantable ancient seed per craft. [5] X Research source This will allow you to immediately craft plantable ancient seeds from any future ancient seed artifacts you find! If you have a Deconstructor, you can also craft an ancient seed artifact by adding plantable ancient seeds to the machine."

      "content": "Plant ancient seeds during spring, summer, or fall. Viable ancient fruit seeds will grow once planted—though they only grow during the spring, summer, and fall seasons and have a 28-day initial growth period. Thus, it’s a good idea to start growing them as soon as possible. If you can, plant them on the first day of spring or summer to ensure you get a harvest the next season. [6] X Research source Ancient seeds have six growth stages, each with a different appearance to show the plant’s growth: Stage 1 (2 days long) Stage 2 (7 days long) Stage 3 (7 days long) Stage 4 (7 days long) Stage 5 (5 days long) Harvest After the first harvest, ancient fruit plants will regrow and yield additional harvests. Their regrowth period is 7 days long."

The best place to grow ancient seeds is your greenhouse (which you can repair and use by completing the Pantry Bundles for the Community Center or buying the Greenhouse upgrade for 35,000 gold). Plants in the greenhouse will grow all year, regardless of season, which means you won’t need to worry about winter disrupting your ancient seeds! [7] X Research source However, you can’t plant ancient seeds in garden pots. If you try, you’ll get a message: “Her roots grow very deep...she wouldn't be happy in there.\""

So, to get the most profit from your ancient fruit, turn as many into artisan products as possible.
