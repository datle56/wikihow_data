      "title": "Choose your spouse.",
      "content": "Choose your spouse. If you are not already married it is time to get married. You will want to select your spouse carefully because some spouses cannot be made into vampires. Ysolda is a favorite choice of spouse because of the unusual markings she gets from being made into a vampire, as well as her relative ease to convince to marry. She can be found in Whiterun in the market."

      "content": "Complete side missions in Castle Volkihar. In order to receive the quest “The Gift” you must first complete an undetermined number of side quests for the vampires of Castle Volkihar. At this time, there is no indication of exactly how many quests need to be completed before you can receive the mission from Vingalmo. [1] X Research source If you do not receive the quest, even after performing many tasks for the vampires, you are likely married to an incompatible character. Double-check the list above."

      "title": "Speak to Vingalmo.",
      "content": "Speak to Vingalmo. Vingalmo will give you the suggestion that you should turn your spouse into a vampire by using the Vampire’s Seduction skill. This skill will either automatically show up in your skills list upon receiving the quest “The Gift” or it will appear sometime during the next day. If you do not see it in your skill list immediately, use the in-game ability “Wait” to wait a total of 24 hours. Do not speak to your spouse before you have the skill Vampire’s Seduction after you gain “The Gift” quest, as this can bug the rest of the quest and make it impossible to complete."

      "content": "Use the skill Vampire’s Seduction on your spouse. Be careful as this power can only be used once an in-game day. Once you have used it on your spouse you can bite them and effectively turn them into a vampire. Do not use the Vampire’s Seduction power on your spouse while he or she is sleeping."
