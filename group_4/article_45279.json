The stream tab can be minimized and muted; you will still earn rewards. [1] X Research source To check your Twitch Drop progress, click your profile picture and select Drops & Rewards . You'll see a meter underneath the In Progress header. Keep in mind that watching VODs won't count for Twitch Drops; it must be a live stream."

Anyone watching the live video, whether logged in or viewing as a guest, will count towards this number. When this viewer stops the stream or closes it, the number will drop and reflect this. [2] X Research source You will count as a viewer even if the stream is muted, if you have a different tab in focus, or if the Twitch app is minimized."

This is separate from the Viewer Count because, while users need to be logged into their Twitch account, they don't need to be watching the stream to interact with the chat. They could have the chat popped out of the video interface or the video paused. Chat bots do not count towards Viewer Count since they don't actively watch the stream."
