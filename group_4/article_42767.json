      "title": "Purchase tape to wrap your shin splints.",
      "content": "Purchase tape to wrap your shin splints. You can purchase either trainer’s tape or kinesiology tape to help relieve your shin splints. The tape will limit your range of motion and may allow more blood to flow to the injured area. You can get trainer’s and kinesiology tape at most pharmacies and sports stores, and even some larger retailers. Some professionals suggest black tape, which may adhere better to sweaty skin. Though duct tape may work in a pinch, as it is as supportive as trainer's tape, duct tape was not meant to be used on skin, and therefore the adhesive is much stronger. If you tape your legs with duct tape, you risk blistering and shearing of the skin."

      "content": "Wash and dry your leg. Clean any oils, sweat or dirt off your skin with a mild cleanser and some water. Make sure to dry it thoroughly with a towel. Washing and drying your leg can help ensure that the tape adheres effectively to your skin. [2] X Research source You can use any kind of mild or simple soap to clean your leg."

      "title": "Shave your leg(s).",
      "content": "Shave your leg(s). If you don’t want to use an underwrap or are especially hairy, consider shaving your leg(s). Shaving can help the tape adhere better. It can also be less painful to remove the tape from your leg. [3] X Research source Make sure to shave carefully so that you don’t cut your skin and cause further injury."

    {
      "title": "Use an underwrap before taping.",
      "content": "Use an underwrap before taping. If you prefer not to place the tape against your skin, consider placing an underwrap between the tape and your skin. Be aware that using underwraps is not as effective as using tape only. [4] X Research source Underwrap and skin adhesives are optional. Simply apply the skin adhesive and the underwrap to the areas of your skin you plan to tape. You can get underwrap and skin adhesive at most pharmacies and possibly some sports stores."

    {
      "title": "Cut the tape for application.",
      "content": "Cut the tape for application. Depending on whether you purchase trainer’s or kinesiology tape or strips, you’ll need to cut the tape before you wrap your shin. This can help ensure you use the right amount of tape to effectively treat your shin splints and will keep you from wasting. Cut pieces of your tape to a length of 12–18 inches (45.7 cm) depending on how tall you are. If you are smaller, use less tape, and if you are taller, use more. Round the edges of the tape for easier application. Remove any backing from the tape before you wrap your shin."

      "title": "Flex your foot and start wrapping tape.",
      "content": "Flex your foot and start wrapping tape. Flexing your foot can help the tape stay on your skin more effectively. Once you’ve done this, place one end of your tape on the top of your foot just below your pinky toe. Flex your foot to a 45 degree angle."

    {
      "title": "Continue to wrap the tape around your foot.",
      "content": "Continue to wrap the tape around your foot. From the top of your foot by your pinky toe, wrap the tape under your foot and then across your arch at the highest point, angling the tape upwards towards your skin. [5] X Research source The tape should be taut but not tight. You don’t want to cut off your circulation. If your skin gets very red or starts to throb, you may have wrapped it too tightly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring the tape up your shin.",
      "content": "Bring the tape up your shin. Wrap the tape in a diagonal fashion upwards across the front of the leg. You can tape your entire shin or just the areas affected with shin splints. [6] X Research source Tape around the leg two more times, overlapping each previous band of tape slightly. The tape should cross over the part of your shin that is in pain. Do not wrap your calf muscle."

    {
      "title": "Test the tape application.",
      "content": "Test the tape application. Walk around before exercising. If the tape is too tight, remove it and repeat the taping process, wrapping the tape more loosely in the same fashion."

      "title": "Try different taping methods.",
      "content": "Try different taping methods. In addition to basic shin taping, you can try a couple of other different taping methods. These may be more effective than basic taping for your shin splints. [7] X Research source Wrap using the “X” arch taping method by holding your foot at a 90-degree angle with your toes curled slightly downward. Use one strip of tape around the ball of your foot as an anchor. Place additional strips of tape at the base of each toe and extend them up to your shin. You can opt to put tape strips around the arch of your foot for added support. Wrap using the “lateral taping” method by starting tape at the front area of the ankle and continuing to wrap it around the back. Then wrap the tape up the outer calf and shin area at a 45-degree angle. Repeat this process four times for a support."

    {
      "title": "Remove the tape.",
      "content": "Remove the tape. After your leg begins to feel better or once you’re done exercising, take the tape off of your shin and foot. This can help your skin breathe and keep it from getting infected. If you chose to not shave your legs before taping, you may experience some discomfort."

      "title": "Take time to rest.",
      "content": "Take time to rest. Give your body a chance to rest or switch to lighter activities. Immobility and/or doing lower-impact activities can help heal your shin splints. [8] X Research source If you do high-impact activities such as running or tennis, switch to lower-impact options. You can try biking, walking, or swimming to stay active while giving your legs a rest. You may also want to rest your legs completely for a while. Begin gently moving the affected area if you take a few days of full rest to help prevent stiffness unless it causes too much pain."

[9] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You can use an ice pack as often as necessary for 20 minutes at a time. You can take a slush bath by mixing ice and water in a bathtub. Soak your legs for up to 20 minutes. You can freeze a plastic foam cup full of water to gently massage the affected area. If it is too cold or your skin gets numb, remove the pack."

Stand up and slowly rise up on your toes. Hold for two seconds and then slowly lower back to the ground. Repeat 10 times or as many times as you can. As you get stronger, you can add weights to toe raises. Leg presses and leg extension may also help with shin splints."
