      "title": "Take prescribed antibiotics for bacterial infections.",
      "content": "Take prescribed antibiotics for bacterial infections. Most salivary gland infections caused by one or more blocked salivary ducts — a condition known as sialadenitis — can be bacterial in nature. This means that your doctor will typically prescribe an antibiotic as the first-line treatment. If so, take the antibiotic as directed and for as long as directed — even if you start feeling better. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Common antibiotics for salivary gland infections include dicloxacillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. Side effects can include diarrhea, nausea, indigestion, and abdominal pain. Some people develop mild allergy symptoms like itchy skin or coughing. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you develop severe abdominal pain or recurrent vomiting, or a serious allergic reaction like trouble breathing, get medical help right away."

      "title": "Use an antibacterial rinse if directed by your doctor.",
      "content": "Use an antibacterial rinse if directed by your doctor. In addition to an oral antibiotic, your doctor may also prescribe a mouth rinse that will help kill the bacteria in your salivary gland(s). If so, use the antibacterial rinse as directed. [3] X Research source For instance, chlorhexidine 0.12% mouth rinse is often prescribed for use 3 times per day. You’ll simply swish it around in your mouth for the directed amount of time, then spit it out."

      "title": "Treat the underlying cause of a viral salivary gland infection.",
      "content": "Treat the underlying cause of a viral salivary gland infection. If your infection is diagnosed as viral in nature, antibiotics will not treat it. Instead, your doctor will focus on addressing the underlying cause of the infection — such as the mumps or the flu — and providing symptom management for the salivary gland infection. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In addition to influenza and mumps, viral conditions like HIV and herpes can cause salivary gland infections. So too can medical conditions like Sjogren’s syndrome (an autoimmune disease), sarcoidosis, and radiation therapy for oral cancer."

      "title": "Ask about sialendoscopy to treat a blockage.",
      "content": "Ask about sialendoscopy to treat a blockage. This is a relatively new treatment that involves the use of a tiny camera and tools to both diagnose and treat salivary gland infections. With sialendoscopy, blockages and infected areas can sometimes be removed to help speed the recovery process. [5] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Sialendoscopy is an outpatient procedure with a high rate of success, but it may not be available in all areas due to its more recent introduction and the training required for the doctors who perform it.

      "title": "Consider surgery for severe or recurring infections.",
      "content": "Consider surgery for severe or recurring infections. If a salivary gland duct blockage is chronic or causing significant complications, the best course of action may be to remove the gland via surgery. You have 3 pairs of major salivary glands — near the back of your jaw, and under the front and back of your tongue — so the removal of one will not significantly impact your saliva production. [7] X Research source This type of surgery only takes about 30 minutes, but does require general anesthesia and an overnight hospital stay. Full recovery takes around a week, and the risk of complications is minimal. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Drink 8-10 glasses of water with lemon per day.",
      "content": "Drink 8-10 glasses of water with lemon per day. Keeping your body well hydrated makes it easier to produce saliva, which in turn can help to clear the infection and blockage. Additionally, sour foods spur the production of saliva, so dropping a lemon wedge or two into your water glass is doubly effective. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Plain water with lemon is the best choice, as opposed to sugary beverages like lemonade, which are bad for your dental and overall health."

      "content": "Suck on lemon candies or lemon wedges. Sour candies cause your saliva production to increase, but stick to sugar-free versions in order to protect your teeth. For a more natural — and sour! — fix, cut a lemon into wedges and suck on them one at a time throughout the day.

      "content": "Rinse your mouth with salted, tepid water. Add half a teaspoon of table salt to 8 fluid ounces (240 ml) of lukewarm water. Take sips of the water, swish them around in your mouth for several seconds each, and spit them out. Don’t swallow the water. [11] X Research source Do this roughly 3 times per day, or as often as your doctor advises. Salted water helps to clear away the infection and can provide some temporary pain relief."

      "title": "Apply warm compresses to your cheek or jaw.",
      "content": "Apply warm compresses to your cheek or jaw. Soak a cloth in warm — but not uncomfortably hot — water, then hold it against your skin outside the spot where the infected gland is located. Hold it there until the cloth cools. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can typically repeat this as often as desired, unless otherwise instructed by your doctor. Warm compresses can help reduce swelling and provide some temporary pain relief. Salivary gland infections most commonly occur in the glands in the back of your mouth, so you’ll typically be holding the compress just beneath your ear."

      "title": "Massage your cheek or jaw with your fingers.",
      "content": "Massage your cheek or jaw with your fingers. Applying gentle pressure, move your first two fingers in a circular motion on the skin outside the infected gland — for example, right beneath one of your ears. Do this as often as you like, or as directed by your doctor. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Massaging the area can help relieve pain and swelling, and may aid in clearing away the salivary duct blockage."

      "content": "Take over-the-counter pain relievers as advised by your doctor. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help relieve the pain associated with a salivary gland infection, and reduce the fever you might develop due to the infection. [14] X Research source Even though these are OTC medications found in practically every medicine cabinet, it’s best to consult your doctor before taking one for a salivary gland infection. Take the medication as directed on the packaging and/or by your doctor."

If you develop a high-grade fever (above 103 °F (39 °C) for adults), or begin to have difficulty swallowing or breathing, seek emergency medical care. [15] X Research source If you're having trouble breathing, this is a life-threatening condition. These symptoms can indicate that the infection has spread."

      "title": "Drink lots of water",
      "content": "Drink lots of water every day. The more water you drink, the more saliva you’ll be able to produce. This makes a salivary duct blockage — and therefore an infection — less likely. [18] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Plain water is your best choice for hydration. Sugary beverages are bad for your teeth and overall health, and caffeine and alcohol can actually work to dehydrate you."

      "content": "Don’t smoke or chew tobacco. Think of this as one of the countless reasons why you should quit smoking , chewing tobacco, or never start in the first place. Using tobacco introduces bacteria and toxins into your mouth that may help cause salivary gland infections. [19] X Trustworthy Source American Lung Association Nonprofit health organization dedicated to improving lung health through education, advocacy, and research Go to source Using tobacco can also increase your risk of developing cancer in one or more of your salivary glands. In addition to salivary gland infections, chewing tobacco can cause salivary gland cancer. Talk to your doctor if you feel a lump near your jaw, below your ear, or on the lower part of your cheek. If you're in the US, you can call the CDC's quit line at 1-800-QUIT-NOW for support."
