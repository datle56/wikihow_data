For dogs, veterinary experts recommend measuring the entire length of the dog and adding 6 in (15 cm) to that total. Then, multiply this number by itself to get the minimum amount of square footage your pup needs to roam. [3] X Research source Cats ideally need a decent-sized indoor space with multiple rooms to explore.
