  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Choose a concept or idea.",
      "content": "Choose a concept or idea. Pick a word that describes a concept or idea, such as “Feminism,” “Justice,” “Patriotism,” “Family,” or “Love.” These words are open enough for you to create your own definition based on experience and find sources to support your definition. [1] X Research source You can also pick a concept like “Success,” “Friendship,” or “Faith.” Concepts like “Pain,” “Loss,” or “Death” are also good options."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid concrete objects or things.",
      "content": "Avoid concrete objects or things. Concrete objects like “pencil,” “ball,” or “shoe” can be difficult to use in a definition essay. You may not be able to say much about concrete objects or write about them in a deep or insightful way. [2] X Research source You can try taking a concrete object and using a similar word to make it more open-ended. For example, the word “house” is concrete and obvious. But the word “home” is more open-ended and allows you to create your own definition of the word."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select a word you are familiar with.",
      "content": "Select a word you are familiar with. Go for a word that you recognize or understand on a basic level. This will make writing the definition a bit easier. [3] X Research source For example, you may choose a word like “success” because you are familiar with the word and feel you may have a lot to say about what it means to be successful or to feel success in your life."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go for a word that can have a variety of meanings.",
      "content": "Go for a word that can have a variety of meanings. Make sure the word you choose is multidimensional and can mean a lot of different things to different people. This will give you a lot of room to include your personal understanding of the word, as well as the interpretations of others. [4] X Research source For example, you may choose a word like “pain” because you feel there are a variety of meanings for the word based on who you talk to and how they experience “pain” in their lives."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look up the word in the dictionary.",
      "content": "Look up the word in the dictionary. Start by familiarizing yourself with the official definition of the word. Use a dictionary to look up the word. Notice the structure of the definition, which will start with the term. It will then note the class of the term, which is where it belongs among other objects or concepts. Finally, it may note any synonyms, which are words that mean the same thing or are similar to the word. [5] X Research source For example, if you look up the word “justice” in the dictionary, you may get this definition: “noun, the quality of being just; righteousness, equitableness, or moral rightness.” You can then determine that “justice” is a noun and can be compared to other terms like “righteousness” and “moral rightness.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Research the origin of the word in encyclopedias.",
      "content": "Research the origin of the word in encyclopedias. Find out where the word came from by looking it up online or in print encyclopedias. Search for the word in encyclopedias that focus on certain ideas or concepts, such as a philosophy encyclopedia or a law encyclopedia. Read up on any theories or ideas that connect to the word. [6] X Research source For example, you may look up the word “justice” in an online encyclopedia that focuses on philosophy or law. You may then find information on Western theories of justice and how it became an important concept in Western history and the legal system."
    },
    {
      "title": "Search online for articles, websites, and videos that discuss the word.",
      "content": "Search online for articles, websites, and videos that discuss the word. You can also do a wide search for any scholarly or academic articles that discuss the word in detail. Look for academic websites that address the word, including articles, blog posts, or essays about the word. Look on academic search engines like Google Scholar, JSTOR, and ProQuest for scholarly articles. You can also look for educational videos that have been made about the word on YouTube and other video websites."
    },
    {
      "title": "Interview peers, family, and friends about the word.",
      "content": "Interview peers, family, and friends about the word. Get a personal perspective on the word by talking to your family and friends about what they think about the word. Interview peers in your class or at work about what comes to mind when they hear or think about the word. [7] X Research source You may ask them interview questions like: “What comes to mind when you think of the word?” “How do you feel about the word on a personal level?” “How do you interact or deal with the word?” “What does the word mean to you?” Take notes or record the interviews so you can use them as sources in your essay."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create your own definition of the word.",
      "content": "Create your own definition of the word. Use your research and your own experiences to write the definition. You may focus on how the word works in society or the world at large. You can also compare it to other similar terms. Format the definition by stating the word, followed by a one-sentence definition. [8] X Research source For example, you may write: “Justice, a quality or trait where you act in a morally right way.” Or you may write: “Justice, a concept in the legal system where the fair or equitable thing is done, as in ‘justice has been served.’” It's important to have tact and tread carefully here. It's important to preface your own definition of the word, making it clear that's a personal opinion. Make sure not to create the misconception that your own definition is the accepted or official one. At the end of the day, your objective should be to write the actual definition, and not an opinion essay."

    {
      "title": "Use five sections for the essay.",
      "content": "Use five sections for the essay. A typical definition essay will have five sections: an introduction, three body sections, and a conclusion.

      "content": "Include a thesis statement with your own definition. Include this in the first section of the essay. Your thesis statement should describe your version of what the term means.

      "content": "Analyze the dictionary definition of the word. In the third section, do a deep analysis of the dictionary definition of the term.
