      "title": "Yes, raw aloe can go bad and store bought gel can expire.",
      "content": "Yes, raw aloe can go bad and store bought gel can expire. Aloe vera gel is an organic product, meaning it’s perishable after a certain point. This can mean changes in color and texture, mold growth, and loss of potency. Typically, store bought aloe vera gel has a longer shelf life than the raw aloe vera gel you may have harvested yourself, although it depends on myriad factors. [1] X Research source Raw aloe vera gel lasts 1 day at room temperature, 1 week in the refrigerator, and up to 2 weeks in the freezer. Store-bought aloe vera gel (with preservatives) may last 2-5 years at room temperature or 5+ years in the refrigerator. Without preservatives, ale lasts 2-3 months at room temperature and up to 1 year in the refrigerator. Aloe vera juice/extract lasts 2-3 years (unopened) and about 2-4 weeks after opening in the refrigerator. Raw aloe vera juice lasts up to 2 days in the fridge. Aloe vera capsules usually last 2+ years, but check the expiration date."

      "content": "Get an ice cube tray to store your aloe vera gel in. Freezing the gel in an ice cube tray rather than one large block means that you can just take out individual pieces whenever you need them. Fill the tray with the aloe vera gel and place it in the freezer. Once your tray is filled, the gel is ready to be frozen. Make sure the tray is flat in the freezer to avoid any of the gel seeping out. [2] X Research source Using a silicone tray works best as you can turn the tray inside out. [3] X Research source Small plastic containers also work fine if you do not have an ice cube tray."

Keeping them in a bag will enable you to have easy access when you decide to use them. To thaw, switch the container of frozen gel from the freezer to the refrigerator and let it to thaw slowly. Don’t apply any form of heat as it can impact the healing properties of the gel. You can use your aloe cubes for things like: [4] X Research source Treating sunburn Making homemade soap Making smoothies Making a refreshing hair gel"

      "content": "Note that freezing the aloe gel can reduce its potency. Menali states that while freezing your aloe vera gel is a good technique to help extend its shelf life, it could reduce the potency and healing effects of the gel. Instead of freezing, she suggests storing it in an airtight glass jar in the fridge, which can help preserve it for months."

      "title": "Pour your aloe vera gel into an airtight container with room for honey.",
      "content": "Pour your aloe vera gel into an airtight container with room for honey. This container needs to be large enough that you can mix the honey in. Mix honey in with the gel at a 1:1 ratio. Honey has such a low water content versus a high natural sugar content that it helps preserve the gel for a much longer time than the gel would have naturally. [5] X Research source Feel free to use smaller containers if it is more convenient for your storage set up. The container should also have a lid to keep contaminants out. This process is similar to the way fruit is often stored in syrup or as a preserve. [6] X Research source Using a high-quality honey that is free from preservatives will ensure that the gel lasts as long as possible."

      "content": "Put your aloe vera gel into a blender with a Vitamin C tablet. The gel has a very gelatinous texture in its raw state and this can make it difficult to work with when using the gel for some purposes. Add your crushed vitamin C tablet. For every ¼ cup (60ml) of gel, add in 500 milligrams (0.018 oz) of vitamin C to the mixture. This combination will help preserve the gel for up to 8 months in the refrigerator once it has been mixed in. [8] X Research source Putting the gel through the blender allows it to become separated and liquified. This makes it much easier to work with. You can buy vitamin C from your local pharmacy or grocery store."

[18] X Research source Cons of harvesting your own aloe vera gel include: having to grow and care for the aloe vera plant, purchasing all required tools, dealing with the pungent aroma of the plant when harvesting, potential stains, and a shorter shelf life since the product is free of preservatives."

Although a purchased product isn’t as pure as the freshly harvested stuff, there are certainly benefits to buying aloe vera gel. For one, it’s affordable, starting as low as $4 a bottle. There’s also virtually no labor involved or tools required, making it a very convenient buy, especially considering that it comes with a much longer shelf life of multiple years. Cons of purchasing aloe vera gel include: a non-pure product with additives and preservatives and less fresh, lesser quality aloe which could dilute its potency."
