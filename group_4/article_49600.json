      "title": "Profiles come first on your resume and are written in the first person.",
      "content": "Profiles come first on your resume and are written in the first person. When you write in the first person , you can also leave the \"I\" implied (so, \"Marketing professional\" instead of \"I'm a marketing professional\"). Limit yourself to ~2-4 sentences; or, alternatively, write a shorter paragraph (~1-2 sentences), then include concrete achievements in bullet form instead. [2] X Research source Choose between professional, descriptive header options, like \"Summary of Qualifications,\" \"Career Profile,\" and \"Career Highlights,\" so readers know that you're covering your professional profile. Font type is important, too. Match your font to the rest of your resume, and choose something professional (like Times New Roman)."

      "title": "Outline your recent work or studies.",
      "content": "Outline your recent work or studies. First, help situate your reader and give them a clear picture of where you are in your career. If you’re a recent grad or current student, mention your degree (or eventual degree). If you’re employed, explain your current position. If you’re unemployed, it’s best practice to describe your most recent position. [3] X Research source Pro tip: use strong, descriptive language when describing yourself. Words like “nice” and “smart” won’t be as effective as “loyal,” “proactive,” or “ambitious.” “Literature enthusiast and recent graduate of University of Chicago…” “Energetic, innovative marketing specialist with 12 years of experience…” “Most recently, a skilled Camera Operator and dedicated teammate…”"

      "content": "Describe your talents, abilities, and competencies. When writing your personal profile, it’s important to sell yourself. Can it feel a little weird to outline your strengths and skills? Sure! But you’re responsible for letting the company know exactly why you’re qualified to join their team, so it’s a must. Brainstorm the professional qualities you’ve developed in work or school, and choose ones relevant to the position. [4] X Research source Pro tip: Keep your personal profile short and sweet. Your entire blurb will be just a few lines (max 6), so keep your personal description to just a few words. [5] X Research source “...skilled at working under pressure and hitting competitive deadlines.” “...comfortable dealing with complex, interpersonal issues while managing 30+ students at once.” “...knows how to create polished, unique work that consistently impresses clients from all industries.\""

If you’ve completed relevant training, won awards, mastered technical programs, finished internships, or hit certain impressive numbers in your career, mention them here. Basically, the goal is to provide clear evidence that supports what you've already said about yourself. [8] X Research source Pro tip: Tie your accomplishments to numbers if you can. A sales goal, a number of issues published, or even a number of guests served—these can help your statement shine. “Experience writing code in C, C++, JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, RUBY, Objective C, and Python.” “In 3 years as a Customer Service Representative, I’ve won the Top Support Staff Award 5 times and received a 95% helpfulness rating from customers.” “I’ve managed a kitchen staff of 30+ service professionals and directed luxury dining for 300+ guests at once.”"
