      "content": "Increase your calorie intake. One way you can stop losing weight is to increase the amount of calories you eat each day. You should consume at least 1200 calories each day. Try tracking your calorie intake each day using a calorie tracker app, and then add a couple hundred calories each day. [1] X Research source This doesn’t mean you should start eating a bunch of junk food. Instead, eat healthy calories that provide a lot of nutrition. For example, you can eat nut and nut butters, which have healthy calories and fat. Try adding healthy oils, like coconut and olive, to your meals. Include healthy carbs, like quinoa and oatmeal."

      "content": "Eat more often throughout the day. If you are having trouble getting enough calories, try eating more small meals throughout the day. Large meals only once or twice a day may not provide enough calories for you, and they can make you feel stuffed and overly full. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try eating three meals, then small snacks between meals. You may also want to have small mini meals, like a protein and a vegetable, between your main meals. For example, you may want to eat eggs, avocado, and a piece of fruit for breakfast. For a small snack, you may eat almond butter on a whole wheat English muffin. For your afternoon snack, you may eat some nitrate-free deli ham, cheese, and an apple. After dinner, you may eat Greek yogurt with frozen blueberries and walnuts."

Assess what you are currently doing, how often you are working out, and for how long. Consider cutting back on long cardio workouts, or do cardio fewer days each week. Add in social workouts instead of hitting the gym each day. Go for walks with your family, friends, or dog, or plan a hiking trip with them. Play a team sport at the park, or go for a bike ride through a park. Consider light workouts that help with stress, like yoga, tai chi, or pilates."

If stress is the root of your weight loss, you should find ways to reduce it to help your overall health. [3] X Research source Try deep breathing exercises. For example, focus on your breathing twice each day. Take a minute or two and just breathe in and out calmly, focusing only on the way your breath feels as it enters and exits your body. You may want to breathe in for a count of four or five, hold it for that long, and then release for a count of five. Guided meditation is another good relaxation technique. You can find apps, audio files, and YouTube channels that will lead you through guided meditations for stress. Yoga and tai chi are great exercise for stress relief."

      "content": "Add more protein. Protein is important for maintaining weight and increasing muscle mass. It can also provide healthy calories. Make sure not to eat fatty, unhealthy meats and a lot of red meat. Both of these can be unhealthy due to the high amounts of saturated fat. For example, add in calories from eggs, lean chicken and turkey, and fish. You can even eat natural bacon that is nitrate free. For non-meat options, try Greek yogurt or cottage cheese, which are good sources of protein. Nuts also contain protein and can be put easily into snacks or meals."
