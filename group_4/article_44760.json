If you're treating someone else, ask them to remove any objects around the cut, like food, gum, or jewelry. [2] X Research source Try not to breathe or cough/sneeze near the site of the wound. Don’t blow on the wound, either, since that can introduce bacteria.

      "content": "This step helps prevent infection and reduces the risk of scarring. If there are objects in the wound itself—like dirt particles or pebbles—remove them by having the injured person place the wound under a running faucet until it’s clean. [4] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source If that’s uncomfortable for the person, fill a glass with water and pour it over the wound. Keep refilling the glass until you’ve washed the matter out of the wound. Use a cotton swab dipped in hydrogen peroxide to deep clean the wound. Just be sure the injured person does not accidentally swallow any peroxide. Tip: If you're treating someone else, confirm that they're up-to-date on their vaccines. The injured individual could be at risk for a tetanus infection if the injury involved metal or other dirty items or surfaces.

      "content": "It's best if the person who is bleeding applies pressure to their own lip. If you need to help, though, be sure to wear clean rubber gloves. Using a clean towel or piece of gauze or a bandage, apply gentle but firm pressure to the cut for a full 15 minutes. [6] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source If the towel, gauze, or bandage becomes completely saturated with blood, apply additional gauze or bandages without removing the first layer. Apply the pressure inward, toward the teeth, jaw, or gums. If this is uncomfortable for the injured person, place gauze or clean cloth between the person’s teeth and lip, then resume applying pressure."

[7] X Research source The mouth—including gums, tongue, and lips—has a lot of blood vessels and a heavy blood supply, so oral lesions tend to bleed more than cuts on other parts of the body.

      "content": "Reach out if the bleeding hasn't stopped after 15 minutes of steady pressure. Similarly, if the injured person has trouble breathing or swallowing, if they have loose or missing teeth, or if you can’t get the wound completely clean, seek medical attention. Do this as soon as possible, as the chances of infection increase the longer you leave a wound open and bleeding. If you have any doubt, make sure to contact a doctor. [9] X Research source If the cut goes all the way through the lip, it's important to seek medical assistance immediately. [10] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source If the cut is on the red part of the lip as well as on the normal colored skin above or below the lip (crosses the vermillion border), the injured person likely needs stitches. Stitches will reduce the risk of infection and help make sure the wound heals in the best cosmetic way. Doctors recommend stitches if the cut is deep and gaping, meaning that you can place fingers on either side of the cut and gently pry it open with minimal effort. Doctors may also recommend stitches if there is a flap of skin that can easily be sutured. Don’t wait more than 8 hours maximum to get treatment for deep lacerations that need stitches. Otherwise, they may not heal properly."

      "content": "It's important to treat the wound so it heals cleanly. There is some disagreement in the medical world about whether antiseptic creams are necessary or even helpful, particularly if the creams are used excessively. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source However, some research does suggest they can be helpful in healing if used correctly and appropriately. If you do choose to use a topical antiseptic cream, you can buy one over the counter at any pharmacy or grocery/convenience store. If in doubt, ask your doctor or pharmacist which products might be best for your wound. Make sure you use your chosen product only as directed to avoid applying too much or too frequently. As an alternative, you can apply honey or granulated sugar to the wound. Sugar draws water out of the wound, preventing bacteria from getting the hydration they need to grow. Honey also has antibacterial properties. [12] X Research source Studies have shown that applying sugar or honey to a wound before dressing it can reduce pain and prevent infection.

[18] X Research source Avoid contact between the wound and salt or citrus, as this can cause uncomfortable burning pain. Avoid eating hard, crunchy, or sharp foods like potato or tortilla chips. Run warm water over the wound after meals to clean out any particles that may have been left behind. Contact a doctor if the injured person is having difficulty eating or drinking due to the cut."
