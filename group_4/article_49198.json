      "content": "Figure out which muscles you use. Writing with a looser more relaxed script will be determined by which muscles you use when you're writing. You don't want to write only with your hand or your fingertips. Beautiful writing comes when you use your whole arm and shoulder as you write. To determine this, write a paragraph as you normally would. Pay attention to which muscles you're using. This will tell you if you're writing too much with only your hand rather than your whole arm in a loose, relaxed manner. Your fingers are there to be the guides on the page, but they shouldn't be doing all the work, otherwise your writing will be cramped and tight.

Baseline is the writing line that all letters sit on. Waistline is the line above the baseline, which changes according to the x-height of the letter (in this case, 5 nibs above baseline). Ascending line is the line that all ascending letters hit. It should be 5 nibs above the waistline (or whichever nib length you're using). Ascending letters are the letter like a lowercase \"h\" or \"l.\" Descending line is the line that descending letters hit. It should be 5 nibs below the baseline.
