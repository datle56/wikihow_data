      "content": "Cut 2-3 holes of approximately 0.5 inches (13 mm) in the bottom of each container with a drill or a utility knife. These holes will allow direct contact between the potting soil in the container and the wick. This will maintain a uniform water content in each container during seed germination and growth. The wick is absorbent fabric used to transfer water from the supply to the potting soil. One end will be submerged in the water, and the other in contact with the potting soil of the plant container."

Allow the containers to soak up water for about 30 minutes. Alternatively, use a light mist from a spray bottle or a hose to water the plants from above. Apply water 5 times over 30 minutes. While the containers are soaking, you can begin to set up the self-watering tub."

Consider using a waterproof plug, tape or fabric to block up this hole. This will keep mosquitoes out of the water in the tub and prevent them from laying their eggs. Alternatively, you can scatter a mosquito dunk in the water reservoir. This will kill mosquito larva for up to 30 days. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill the tub with water and saturate a towel in the water. Use a clean, new or used towel or washcloth: this is the large fabric wick. The towel (wick) should be 12-30 inches (30-75 cm) in length and width."

Make sure most of the lid is covered by the towel and 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) of the towel hangs into the water in the tub. If necessary, you can fold the towel and then feed it through. Artificial fibers last longer than cotton as a large fabric wick."

You can repurpose an old skirt lining for this, or use an alternative to protect the wick beneath. In the photo, the yellow towel is the large fabric wick and the black fabric is a tightly woven fabric called Hang-Loose. [2] X Research source If no fabric is used, simply cut the roots of the transplants free from the wick when it’s time to move them to the garden or containers. Weed-X, a fabric used in landscaping, will also work well to control the plant roots."

      "content": "Place the pre-filled containers on top of the fabric wick. Water the potting soil with a light mist from a spray bottle or hose a few times. This will establish the wicking connection (transferring of water) between the water in the tub, the wick (towel) and the potting soil in the container. The wick will keep the potting soil uniformly moist throughout seed germination and transplant growth. Add water to the tub every 5 to 10 days (7-8 is around average) to aid seed germination and growth. At any time, if the potting soil seems too dry, water it from the top to re-establish the wicking connection."

      "content": "Manage seed germination temperatures. Temperatures must remain between 65 and 75° Fahrenheit (18-24°C) at all times for successful germination. Use the lower end of this range for cool season plants, e.g., lettuce, cabbage, broccoli, pansies, and dianthus. Use the higher end of this range for warm season plants, e.g. tomatoes, peppers, squash, vinca, and zinnias."

This is known as “hardening-off” and acclimatizes them to cooler temperatures, lower humidity and increased air movements. This way, the plants will be better able to handle the rigors of the garden environment.
