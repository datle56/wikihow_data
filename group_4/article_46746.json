When you see the name of your selfie stick, you can use your phone or camera to pair with the device. Bluetooth pairing won't necessarily improve the quality of your photos, but this method will be helpful if you don't want to use any extra cables or wires. If you don't know the name of your selfie stick, look for the name in the selfie stick's instruction manual. If the devices have trouble pairing, turn off each device for 5 minutes. Switch them on and try pairing them again."
