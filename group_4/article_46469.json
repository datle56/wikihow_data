      "content": "Touch the other person’s waist. This is a good option if you've never kissed the other person before and you're feeling unsure about what to do with your hands. Rest your hands lightly on the other person’s waist, or gently grip their hips while kissing them. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold hands.",
      "content": "Hold hands. Try holding one of their hands and caressing it lightly with your hand. You can also try grabbing both of their hands and interlocking your fingers with theirs during the kiss. This is a great option if you feel really close to the other person, and it comes off as very sweet. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Touch their face.",
      "content": "Touch their face. This can add some intimacy to the kiss. You can grab their face with both of your hands and gently pull it closer to your face, for example. You can also try gently caressing their cheek, neck, or even their earlobe. Ears are sensitive areas, so lightly stroking their ear may be a turn-on for them! [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Run your hands through their hair.",
      "content": "Run your hands through their hair. Use one or both hands to run your fingers softly through their hair. Go slowly and be gentle! If they have long hair, you could even twirl a strand around your finger as you're kissing them. If you're feeling adventurous, some people even like their hair to be gently pulled! Save this move for someone you feel pretty close to. It may not go over well with someone you've never kissed before. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wrap your arms around them.",
      "content": "Wrap your arms around them. This shows the other person that you're enjoying the kiss. Depending on your height and what you find the most comfortable, you may want to put your arms around their shoulders or their waist. Both are good options!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your hands to end the kiss.",
      "content": "Use your hands to end the kiss. When you’re ready to end the kiss, you can remove your hands from their body. Usually, they will get the message that this means you need a break, but if not, you can gently push them away by applying light pressure to their chest (on males) or shoulders (on females)."

    {
      "title": "Take it slow and observe your partner's reactions.",
      "content": "Take it slow and observe your partner's reactions. Moving quickly from a soft first kiss to something more intimate is jarring for a lot of people, and may even make them uncomfortable. Feel out the situation before you take things to the next level. Are they pulling you closer and returning your kisses? When you take things up a notch, do they respond by doing the same? [5] X Research source If you aren't sure how they feel about going further, ask them what they want. If that feels too weird, you can try a more intimate move and then softly ask them, \"Is this okay?\""

    {
      "title": "Pull the person closer to you.",
      "content": "Pull the person closer to you. If you want to take the kiss up a notch, use your hands to gently pull the person closer to you by the waist until your bodies are pressed up against one another, like you’re hugging . Do this slowly and avoid slamming your bodies together! Moving slowly feels more intimate and gives them time to react to what's happening. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Control their hands with your own.",
      "content": "Control their hands with your own. Show your partner what you like by using your hands to place their hands on your body. For example, you could gently place one of their hands on the small of your back, your arm, your waist, or even your thigh. If they resist or seem uncomfortable in any way, definitely drop their hand and slow down a bit."

      "title": "Put your hands in their back pockets.",
      "content": "Put your hands in their back pockets. If the person you are kissing is wearing jeans, you can slide your hands into their back pockets. Not only will this bring the person you are kissing closer to your own body, it’s one way to touch them sensually through their clothing. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Explore their body.",
      "content": "Explore their body. If you are in a private setting, feel comfortable enough with this person, and have a mutual desire to do more than just kiss, then you can start using your hands to explore the rest of their body. Slip your hand under their shirt and explore their stomach and chest area, or run your hands down their arms or back. [8] X Research source If you're positive your partner is comfortable taking things to the next level, you can use your hands to remove their clothing. Unbutton their shirt, unzip their pants, or take off an item of their clothing. Go slowly so you can gauge their reaction. If they seem hesitant, slow things down."
