Sinks aren't really great because if your vomit comes out chunky, you'll probably have to fish your own vomit out of the drain. If you're outside, try to get away from people and their belongings. Nothing makes you more ticked off when some random drunk comes and spews all over your car. Try to find a forest or an empty lot. You can throw up on the open ground in one of those areas."

Start salivating a saltier-than-usual spit. Extreme discomfort in the stomach. Dizziness , an aversion to movement."

Eat slowly and chew your food before you swallow it. Avoid foods that are hard to digest, such as spicy, acidic, fatty, or fried foods and dairy.
