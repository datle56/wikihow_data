      "title": "Study the market.",
      "content": "Study the market. Before you can open your own sport goods store, it’s important to know what your competition is like and what kind of need there is for another (or a different kind of) store. Pay a visit to the other sporting goods stores already in the area you think you might want to open your shop, and see what sports or hobbies they cover particularly well and not so well. If there is an under-represented sport that you think still has an interested consumer base, consider catering to them. This might be an opening for you to capture the market. Stay current with new trends and up-and-coming sports, such as at-home circuit training or extreme outdoor sports, which might introduce new demands or equipment into the market. [1] X Research source Be aware, though, that if there is no one covering a certain sport or market, it might mean that there isn’t a strong enough customer base to support it. Ideally, you’d want at least one other store in the same field, but one that you think you can surpass with better services, products, or prices."

      "content": "Study your surroundings. Besides other business, take some time to get a sense of what kinds of sports, hobbies, or activities are already popular or have the potential to become popular in your area. If you live nearby natural parks or preserves, outdoor activities like hiking or kayaking might be popular pastimes with a lucrative market. If your town is installing more bicycle lines and paths, there might be increased interest and demand for bicycle equipment. It might be the right time to open a sporting goods store that specializes in renting, selling, or repairing bicycles."

      "title": "Choose your niche market.",
      "content": "Choose your niche market. There are several big name, national sporting goods chains out there which try to offer a smattering of everything and cater to every type of sports fan or hobbyist, from basketball to badminton, to fly-fishing. Instead of following this approach, consider focusing on specialty sports, like hunting and fishing or golf, in order to set yourself apart and become a go-to expert retailer. Focusing on a niche market will allow you to cover every aspect of a particular sport without having tons of inventory or spreading your resources to thin. You can focus on amateur and youth sports, as an example, and carry a wide array of products geared towards kids. You can also decide to go towards the other end of the spectrum and cater to a professional market base with only high-end equipment. You can also chose to focus on sports memorabilia and apparel rather than equipment."

You can take your business plan to a bank or loan office to get pre-approved for a small business loan or another line of credit. This might come in handy when renting store space, buying inventory, or paying employees before you start to turn a profit."

You can also hold a design competition for local high school or college students, and offer the winning designer a store gift card for their work. Take out some advertising space in local print or media outlets. Or hang a banner at the local sports field, if allowed. Find out if your product vendors have their own marketing materials that you can utilize to promote their product at your store.
