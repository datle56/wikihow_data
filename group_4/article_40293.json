      "content": "Prioritize your relationship. The first step toward spending quality time with your significant other is to make your relationship a top priority. A feeling of closeness is one of the most important “ingredients” for a healthy relationship, which you can only find if you spend quality time together. If your girlfriend or boyfriend is, say, number 5 on your list of daily activities, that relationship probably won’t go very far. If you do find that your relationship is a low priority to you, simply apologize to your girlfriend or boyfriend and start making changes. If you feel like your relationship is a low priority to your boyfriend or girlfriend, you need to discuss this."

      "content": "Make spending time a weekly goal. One positive change that shows your girlfriend or boyfriend that you are starting to prioritize your relationship is making it a weekly goal to spend time with him or her. One way to do this is to choose one night per week as date night. Pick a night that rarely has other commitments so that you aren’t tempted to cancel plans with your partner, or a night that your partner isn’t usually busy. Even on days when you can’t see each other in person, make an effort to reach out to your partner through a text or phone call. Reader Poll: We asked 444 wikiHow readers about how often they like to talk to their partner, and 69% of them agreed that they like to check in every day . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Clear it with your parents. If you’re a teenager still living at home, you need to inform them of your relationship and your intention to spend quality time with your boyfriend or girlfriend. Ask their permission to spend this time with him or her. They may say no sometimes because they want you to focus on schoolwork. Tell them that this is understandable but that you would like a balance between school work and your relationship. If they don’t agree with your relationship, this is another issue and you need to tell your boyfriend or girlfriend. If your parents won’t let you, you will either have to break up or wait until there is no school to spend time together."

      "content": "Look at your partner when talking. Making eye contact does a lot of things for human beings, including showing that you are listening. If you want to spend quality time with your partner—not just time, but quality time—then look them in the eyes. Eye contact makes people feel like you are more “believable and earnest.” Looking at someone for long periods of time, also known as gazing, communicates that you value the other person and that the relationship more than the words you are saying to each other."

      "content": "Avoid staring at the TV. One way to make sure your partner feels that they are more important to you than anything else is to spend time talking with them rather than staring at a screen. That’s not to say that you can’t watch a movie or TV together. But screen-watching has its place, and if you are trying to spend quality time with someone, a movie or show is not the time to do it."
