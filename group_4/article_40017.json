Spread the nuts out on the dehydrator trays in a single layer, and arrange the trays in the dehydrator. [3] X Research source Turn on the dehydrator to 150 F (66 C). Dehydrate the nuts for 12 hours and check them for doneness. For crunchier nuts, dehydrate them for an additional three to 12 hours."
