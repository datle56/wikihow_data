      "title": "Only pronounce your r sounds if they are before a vowel.",
      "content": "Only pronounce your r sounds if they are before a vowel. The dropped r is a classic New York sound , though it is actually going out of style. The tricky part is remembering when to subtly drop the r . It only disappears when it is before a consonant, though the disappearance is slight—listening to native speakers can help you find the sweet spot. For example: [1] X Research source Park → \"Pak.\" Nurse → \"Nuhse.\" Water → \"Watta\" River → \"Rivva\" Fear → \"Feah\" [2] X Research source Tip: Note that some New Yorkers also add r s where they aren't needed, like \"idea- r \" or \"law- r and order.\" These are generally colloquial and common in older speakers."

      "content": "Replace a th at the beginning and end of words with a percussive d or t . This sound is found in the clichéd New York accent expression \"toity-toid street\" (\"33rd Street\"), but it is not always so cliché. As Muñoz explains, dropping the softer, whispery thhhh sound for a harder ddd or tttt sound is very New York. The → \"teh\" That → \"tat\" or \"dat\" Three → \"tree\" [3] X Research source Tip: When making d or t sounds, place your tongue against the back of your bottom teeth. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Elongate your vowels into an awww sound, especially as and os.",
      "content": "Elongate your vowels into an awww sound, especially a s and o s. Many of the words that have the o sound (like in coffee) are pronounced with an aw sound. So the word dog, for example, would sound like \"d aw g\", and \"coffee\" would sound like \"c aw fee,\" explains Muñoz. Talk → \"Tawk\" Thought → \"Tawwt\" Tip: The short o sound is pretty rare in New York English. Words which include the long i in the middle, like \"liar,\" use a very similar aw sound, so \"liar\" should sound almost like \"lawyer.\""

      "content": "Learn the tricky \"split a\" sound to extend out your vowels naturally. This is a tricky one because it requires turning one syllable into two. Some linguists believe it is nearly impossible for outsiders to learn, but you can pick it up with a bit of practice! Check out the following examples and see if they make sense. Try saying the first syllable quickly and sliding it naturally into the next: Cab → \"ca-AHB\" Avenue → \"ahav-enue.\" [5] X Research source"

Look at the phonetically spelled out examples below and test out a few words to get used to the accent. The capitalized letters are for emphasis. Sunday → \"sun-dA\" Monday → \"Mun-dey\" Tuesday → \"Twos-dey\" Wednesday → \"Wehn-s-dey\" Thursday → \"Thuhs-dey\" (err being kind of rolled r) Friday → \"Fry-dey\" Saturday → \"Satuh-dey\" [6] X Research source"

Bernie Sanders, Fran Drescher, and Jerry Seinfeld have all made the New York accent recognizable, even if it is considered a bit over the top for everyday speech. But if you're on stage, on screen, or just hamming it up, focus on breathing through your nose and restricting your throat when you speak. Huge → \"Yuuuuge.\" [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick up the \"attitude\" in your speech rhythms. Speaking like a New Yorker is less about what you say and more about how you say it. New Yorkers are known for being direct, opinionated, and confident. They are also known for talking a lot and talking loudly. Speak quickly and succinctly. Use loud , expressive tones when speaking. Really draw out those vowels for emphasis. Throw an extra r at the end of words that end in vowels, like \"That's a good idea r. \""

      "content": "Mash your words together and spread your vowels for a Long Island classic accent. This variation of the New York accent is most defined by its extended vowels and constricted words. To do a Long Island (or as the locals say, \"Lawn-Guyland\") accent, take your time with the vowels, stretching them out as you say them. Also, drop off the end of words to say them faster. [8] X Research source Going → \"Goiin\" Here → \"Heea\""

      "content": "Use some local colloquialisms. While cliché, using informal words and phrases made famous by New Yorkers may help you get more comfortable with your accent. They can help you gain a NYC mindset. Here are some examples: [9] X Research source Pronounce \"New Yorkers\" as \"Noo Yawkez.\" Say \"hey,\" instead of \"hi\" or \"hello,\" and say it quickly. Use phrases like \"Get outta hea,\" \"Fawget aboutit,\" and \"Ahrite ahready.\" Make the classic \"you guys\" into the NYC plural \"yous guys.\" Tip: Know that these phrases and way of speech could be considered offensive due to the stereotypes surrounding them."

      "content": "Listen to native New Yorkers to get the range of different accents. Not every New Yorker sounds the same, which can make it easy for you to diversify your accent. Muñoz explains that there are different “variations.” Because of this, communicating and listening to multiple native New Yorkers can help you make your NYC accent more unique and authentic. For example, people from Staten Island and Brooklyn often come from Italian descent, so their accent has a mix of Italian sounds. Those with a Long Island accent emphasize the g sound, making it harder and more pronounced. An upstate New York accent uses the r sound and has a strong Midwest vowel shift.
