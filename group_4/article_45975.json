When adjusted to the correct position, the top of the crutches should reach between 1.5 to 2 in (3.8 to 5.1 cm) below your armpits. [4] X Expert Source Mayami Oyanagi Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 27 January 2021. The hand grips should be even with the top of your hip line. [5] X Research source When the crutches are properly adjusted, your arms should be comfortably bent while you stand up straight. When you adjust the crutches, wear the shoes you'll be most frequently wearing when you use the crutches. They should have low heels and good support."

The cushions at the tops of the crutches should not actually touch your armpits; rather, your hands should absorb the weight of your body as you start to use the crutches. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the crutches to help you walk. Lean forward and place both crutches about a foot in front of your body. Move as though you are taking a step with your injured foot, but place your weight instead on the handgrips of the crutches. Swing your body forward and rest your non-injured foot on the ground. Repeat to continue moving forward. [7] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Hold your injured foot cocked slightly behind your body, several inches from the floor so that it does not drag. Practice walking this way with your head forward, rather than looking at your feet. The motion will begin to feel more natural with practice. Practice walking backward, too. Look behind you to make sure no furniture or other items are in your way."

      "title": "Practice taking small steps.",
      "content": "Practice taking small steps. Start by placing the foot pads of the crutches a short distance (about 12 in (30 cm)) in front of you so they're slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. When you're stable and ready, lean on the crutches, push against the handles, and straighten your arms to transfer your weight. Swing your body slowly through the gap between the crutches, lifting your good leg and moving it forward. Place the foot of your good leg flat on the ground, keeping the other leg next to the good leg. When you need to turn, pivot with the strong leg, not the weak leg. [8] X Research source As your injury begins to heal, it'll be easier to take larger steps but avoid moving the crutches farther forward than your bad foot's toes. Otherwise, you might lose your balance and fall. Be careful especially the first few days on the crutches since they can be a little challenging to get used to."

      "content": "Distribute your weight correctly as you walk. Lean on the crutches and swing forward, slowly shifting your weight forward using your forearms, not your elbows. Be sure to keep a slight bend to your elbow, and use your arm muscles instead of leaning on your armpits. [9] X Research source Leaning on your crutches with your armpits can hurt and may cause you to develop a painful rash. Instead, support yourself on your hands with your arm muscles. Put socks or a rolled-up towel on top of the armpit pad to help prevent a rash. Leaning on your crutches with your armpits could lead to a condition called radial nerve palsy. If this happens, the wrist and hand can become weak, and occasionally the back of your hand can lose feeling. [10] X Research source The good news is the injury usually heals itself once you relieve pressure. Leaning on the armpit could also cause brachial plexus injury, or \"crutch palsy,\" or rotator cuff tendonitis, which causes inflammation and pain in the shoulder and outer arm."

      "content": "Use the crutches to help you sit. Locate a sturdy chair that won't slide backward when you sit down. Back up to it and put both crutches in one hand, leaning on them slightly and placing your injured foot in front of you. Use the other hand to steady yourself against the chair and lower yourself into the seat. [11] X Research source Lean the crutches against the wall or a sturdy table with the armpit rests down. They may topple over if you lean them tip-down. When you're ready to stand up, turn the crutches right side up and hold them in the hand on your non-injured side. Hoist yourself up and place your weight on your healthy foot, then pass one crutch to the injured side and balance using the hand grips."

Step up with your good foot and keep your injured foot behind you. Lean on the crutches as you take the next step with your good fit and again bring your injured foot up from behind. [12] X Research source You may want to ask a partner to help you the first few times you take the stairs since it can be tricky to keep your balance. If you go up stairs without a railing, place a crutch under each arm. Step up with your good foot, bring your injured foot up, then put your weight on the crutches."

[13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If the steps don't have a handrail, lower your crutches to the stair below, move your injured leg down, then step down with your other foot with your weight on the hand grips. To reduce the risk of accidentally taking a topple, you can also seat yourself on the top step, holding your injured foot in front of you, and use your hands to support yourself as you scoot down the steps one stair at a time. You'll have to ask someone to bring the crutches down for you."
