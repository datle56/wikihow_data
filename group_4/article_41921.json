      "content": "Get a textured hairstyle if you have short thick hair. Short, thick hair that is choppy and textured on top will look more styled than if it were all one length. When you're ready to style it, you can spike it up or brush it off to one side."

      "title": "Go with an undercut if you have medium-length thick hair.",
      "content": "Go with an undercut if you have medium-length thick hair. Undercuts are long on top and short on the sides and nape of the head, so you can still have length without your hair being unruly or in your face all the time. Undercuts work best with thick hair because the long hair on top can support itself and maintain volume after you style it."

      "title": "Wear your hair up in a bun or ponytail if you have long thick hair.",
      "content": "Wear your hair up in a bun or ponytail if you have long thick hair. When thick hair gets long, it can get weighed down and hard to manage. Pulling your hair back in a bun or ponytail is an easy, stylish way to keep your long, thick hair out of your face. Experiment with wearing your bun or ponytail high or low on your head."

[1] X Expert Source Arthur Sebastian Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 29 April 2019.

      "title": "Choose hair products that have \"high hold.\"",
      "content": "Choose hair products that have \"high hold.\" Hair products usually have 3 types of holds: low, medium, and high. Since thick hair tends to be heavier, a product with high hold is helpful when you’re trying to get it to stay up after you style it. When you’re shopping for hair products, they should say on the label what kind of hold they have. [3] X Research source If you have coarse thick hair, you may be able to use products with weaker holds since your hair can stand up on its own more easily."

      "title": "Use thick hair products like clays and waxes instead of gels and creams.",
      "content": "Use thick hair products like clays and waxes instead of gels and creams. Thicker products will give you more control over your hair than lighter products, and you won't have to worry about them weighing your hair down since thick hair is better able to support itself.

      "title": "Try a hair serum to make your thick hair more manageable.",
      "content": "Try a hair serum to make your thick hair more manageable. Hair serums are liquid products that reduce frizziness and tangles in the hair. A hair serum can make your thick hair easier to style by smoothing out the individual hairs on your head so they feel and appear thinner. To use a hair serum, pump a dime-sized amount on your hand and work it into your hair. Then, style your hair like normal. [5] X Research source A little hair serum goes a long way, so be careful not to use too much. A dime-sized amount is usually plenty."

      "content": "Use a wide-toothed comb to style your hair. Wide-toothed combs are better suited for thick hair since they have more space for the hair to pass through. Use a wide-toothed comb to style your hair into place and brush out any knots or tangles. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Brush your hair up if it’s 7 inches (18 cm) or shorter.",
      "content": "Brush your hair up if it’s 7 inches (18 cm) or shorter. Brushing up your thick hair and applying a clay or wax to hold it in place can create a nice, voluminous look. Thick hair can support itself at longer lengths than thin hair can, so you can still create this style if your hair is on the longer side. If your hair is longer than 7 inches (18 cm), it may start to weigh itself down and fall flat. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Slick your hair back if it’s too long to brush up.",
      "content": "Slick your hair back if it’s too long to brush up. Apply a dime-sized amount of clay or wax to your hands and rub them together. Then, run your hands through your hair from the front of your hairline to the back of your head. Don’t forget to brush the sides back as well. A slicked-back style is a great way to get long, thick hair out of your face."

      "title": "Wash your hair every other day.",
      "content": "Wash your hair every other day. Thick hair doesn't need to be washed as frequently as thin hair does, so you can get away with not shampooing every day. In fact, washing your hair every other day will keep it healthier, since it won't get as dry and prone to breakage. [8] X Research source If you have oily skin and hair, you may need to wash your hair every day so it doesn't get greasy."

      "title": "Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo once a week.",
      "content": "Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo once a week. Clarifying shampoos are stronger and more deep-cleaning than regular shampoos, and they’re great at washing out hair products that build up on hair, like waxes, creams, and hairsprays. Since thick hair is more prone to buildup, washing your hair with a clarifying shampoo once a week will keep your thick hair soft and clean. [11] X Research source Clarifying shampoos can be harsh on hair, so don’t use one more than once a week. Minimize dryness by using a moisturizing conditioner after you wash with a clarifying shampoo."

      "content": "Let your hair air dry when you get out of the shower. Part of the challenge of styling thick hair is how much volume it has. That's why air drying is a good idea when you have thick hair — it prevents excess volume. [12] X Research source Avoid using a blow dryer or towel to dry your hair or you'll make it more voluminous.
