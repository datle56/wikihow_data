      "content": "Ah, what would a ranked zodiac list look like without a little Gemini slander? As a star sign ruled by Mercury (the planet of communication), Gemini is associated with themes like communication and interaction, as well as independence. With this in mind, some astrology enthusiasts have come to view Geminis as individuals who are ill-suited to commitment and who don’t have many qualms about stepping out of one relationship and moving on to another. Tip: To prevent any miscommunication or misunderstandings further down the line, clearly establish your expectations for a relationship at the very beginning. Do you want to keep things exclusive, or do you want to try a more open relationship? It’s totally okay to not prefer a committed relationship, as long as you’re upfront about it."

[1] X Research source When such traits are applied to relationships, however, many astrology buffs believe that it can lead to a perfect storm. The passionate and headstrong Aries is likely to make more errors in judgment, especially when it comes to impulsive moments of romance. Tip: Throughout your relationship, take some time to check in with yourself about how you’re feeling about your partner. Be honest about how things are going, and try to identify any issues that need to be addressed, whether that’s improving your communication or dialing up your physical intimacy ."

      "content": "For a sign that craves harmony and balance, astrology enthusiasts seem to think that Libras often struggle to strike a good balance in their relationships. On one hand, Libras crave the intimacy of a committed partnership; on the other, Libras long to be independent rather than romantically tied down. With these contrasting attitudes, some believe that Libras are less likely to be loyal in a relationship. Tip: Before entering a relationship (or even just hooking up) with someone, ask yourself what you hope to get out of things. Are you hoping to end up with a steady partner, or are you just looking for a casual fling?"

This sort of exploratory attitude doesn’t bode well for a Sagittarius’s love life, however, as many astrology followers believe that Sagittarius doesn’t have the stamina or commitment for a long-term relationship. Tip: Think about trying out relationships that aren’t as rooted in exclusivity or commitment, like monogamish partnerships , open relationships, consensual non-monogamy, and more."

      "content": "Surprised to see such a nurturing sign so high up on this list? Zodiac buffs believe that Pisces’ kind and empathetic nature also leaves them vulnerable to infidelity, since they may wander to a new partner or confidant if they feel like their emotional needs and desires aren’t being properly addressed in their current relationship. Tip: Make intentional time to talk with your partner and share what’s on your mind. The more you communicate, the more likely you’ll both be on the same page—and once that happens, it’ll be easier for your partner to meet your emotional needs in a way that works for you. [2] X Research source Due to their emotional nature, Pisces may be prone to emotional infidelity (rather than physical infidelity), which can be just as destructive. Reader Poll: We asked 177 wikiHow readers which type of cheating they’d be most hurt by, and 52% of them agreed that—besides classic cheating—they’d be most hurt by emotional infidelity .

[3] X Research source Just as its ruling planet, Saturn, deals with themes of restriction, Capricorns can find themselves being restrictive and desiring very specific qualities in a partner. They may end up stepping out of their relationship to find someone who best fits said qualities (according to some astrology buffs, anyway). Tip: Never settle in your relationships, whether you’re pursuing a new partner or are in a long-term relationship. If you don’t feel like the connection is there anymore, it’s okay to tactfully break things off ."

[4] X Research source Because of their individualistic and independent spirit, some people believe that Aquarius could be tempted to hop the fence and step out of their existing relationship if they’re feeling a little too tied down. Tip: Remember: it’s okay—and good!—to have some time and space away from your partner. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with slotting away some time in the week just for yourself, especially if you’re feeling a little smothered. Talk with your partner to figure out a plan that works for the both of you. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Research source Still, Leos also have a reputation for being generous, warm, kind, and loyal, so they don’t get a super high spot on this list. Tip: Make a conscious effort to get to know your partner a little better.

      "content": "Ah, Virgo… another sign that tends to get a bad rap on these types of lists. Well, not today! A Virgo’s perfectionism and desire for control—two stereotypes they’re often given grief for—actually make Virgo into a reliable and trustworthy partner. After all, stepping out on your partner doesn’t exactly spell success for your relationship. Tip: Give yourself (and your partner) permission to make mistakes in your relationship. Being in a partnership isn’t about being perfect, after all—it’s about learning and growing alongside your partner so you can become the best possible version of yourself."

      "content": "As dependable and stable as a zodiac sign can be, it’s no wonder that astrology buffs consider Taurus to be great partner material. As far as stereotypes go, Taurus is known for planting roots and sticking things out, even when times get tough. If their relationship hits a bump in the road, Taurus will stick it out with their current partner rather than looking to a lover for emotional support. Tip: Practice good conversational habits with your partner so your relationship can really thrive. It’s always great to start any convo with an open-ended question (a question that can’t be answered with “yes” or “no”). It also helps to use “I” language (“I feel insecure when I receive no reply on my phone for several hours”) versus “you” language (“You make me feel bad when you ignore my texts”).

Known for their nurturing, caring, and home-loving natures, astrology stereotypes agree that you’ll be hard-pressed to find an unfaithful Cancer . A Cancer’s sensitive soul cares deeply for their partner, and they would never consider cheating or stepping out on them. Tip: It’s great that you look out for your partner, but be sure to make self-care a priority , too. It’s hard to look after your partner when you don’t look after yourself!"
