      "content": "“That damn smirk” is a TikTok trend using the Face Puzzle filter. To participate, a user posts a photo or video of themselves smiling using the Face Puzzle filter, which moves their features to different places on their face. They usually move their eyes and mouth down to create a silly, nose-less look and caption their post with “that damn smirk.” It doesn't really mean anything, it's just meant to crack everyone up! Users also tend to comment “that damn smirk” on any video or photo of someone who has a unique smirk or smug smile. In TikTok comments, users often pair the \"proud\" emoticon with “That damn smirk” to show that they’re joking. Users typically post their “that damn smirk” videos with the song “Maps” by Yeah Yeah Yeahs. While the reasoning isn’t clear, it may be related to the “Wait, they don’t love you like I love you” TikTok trend. For the trend, users play “Maps” by Yeah Yeah Yeahs, putting their hands in a “stop” formation with the “Wait” lyric before shaking their hips during the “they don’t love you like I love you” lyric. The Face Puzzle filter is popular on Instagram, Snapchat , and TikTok. To use it, search “Face Puzzle” in the filter section of any of the above apps. You can access the filter section by opening the camera on these apps."

Users are just having fun and making folks laugh at how weird and funny they look with the Face Puzzle filter. For example, on October 4, 2024, TikTok user @5star_brandonnn posted a video where he used the Face Puzzle filter to get rid of his nose, captioning it with “☺️ #thatdamnsmirk.” If you wanted to use it online, it’d go something like this: Your Friend: “Did you see that video Connor posted with the Face Puzzle filter? His smile looked crazy!” You: I know, right. That damn smirk 😏” TikTok user @varqsine even used the meme to describe their dog’s goofy smile in a video posted on January 25, 2025. Since then, the video’s received 3.5 million likes! TikTok user @nimbwr fully embraced the meme on October 2, 2024, when they posted a video with their eyes and eyebrows on their forehead and their mouth was where their nose should be. It was captioned, “that damn smirk.”"
