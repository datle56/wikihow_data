For example, if you have two $100 bills and four $20 bills, your deposit will consist of 6 bills totaling $280. Make a note of these numbers. [2] X Research source In future steps, you’ll use these numbers to confirm that the ATM has counted your cash correctly. Avoid depositing torn, taped, or heavily soiled bills. These could get rejected or jam the ATM’s mechanical components. Deposit damaged or soiled bills directly with a bank teller."

[3] X Research source In most cases, the correct orientation for your card is chip side up, or turned 90 degrees with the chip side facing left. Always insert the card chip-first."

When finished, press “Next,” “Continue,” or “I’m done.\" [7] X Research source Most ATMs only accept a certain number of bills at a time—for instance, 100 bills. Avoid inserting more than this number at once. This slot for deposits is separate from the slot that dispenses cash. It only opens up when you’re making a deposit. Some older ATMs require you to place your cash in an envelope before depositing. If your ATM requires an envelope for deposits, use one provided by your bank to ensure it fits in the ATM. Use a pen to fill out the required fields on the envelope, or fill out a deposit slip and place it inside the envelope with your cash."

If the ATM counted your cash incorrectly, select the option for “Return my cash,” or press “Cancel” to have your bills returned. Then try the deposit again. If the ATM counts incorrectly multiple times, the machine may be malfunctioning. Try a different ATM, or deposit your cash with a teller during your bank’s business hours."

But the U.S. Federal Government only insures up to $250,000 per person, per bank, per “ownership category”—that is, per type of account. [20] X Research source In other words, if you have $300,000 spread across multiple checking accounts in the same bank, the Federal Government will only insure $250,000 of that money. If the bank goes out of business, you’ll get $250,000 back but lose $50,000. This problem only applies to you if you have more than $250,000 deposited in a single bank."

Check deposits made to an account less than 30 days old. Any deposits made to accounts that have been repeatedly overdrawn in the precious 6 months.
