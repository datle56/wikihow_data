      "content": "Limber up . The Whip is a dance that involves a deep stance, with your feet placed wide apart. To make sure you don't strain anything or lose your balance because your muscles are stiff, you should stretch your legs, paying special attention to your thighs and legs .

      "title": "Adopt a deep stance.",
      "content": "Adopt a deep stance. You'll want to plant your feet on the floor so that you are well balanced and so that each foot is wider than shoulder width apart. This should lower your hips, bringing you into a kind of half-squatting position. Your core should be engaged, and your back should be mostly straight with a slight lean forward. [6] X Research source You want to convey both sensuality and attitude. Don't hunch your shoulders or curl your back forward too much. [7] X Research source This can work muscles in your legs that aren't frequently exercised, so you may notice some muscle fatigue or weakness/shaking. If you feel shaking in your leg muscles or a strong burning sensation from fatigue, you may want to take a break. [8] X Research source [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Raise either your left or right hand in front of you.",
      "content": "Raise either your left or right hand in front of you. If you are doing this dance move in a group, you'll want to coordinate which hand you raise with the others who are dancing. Raise one arm so it's fully extended and curl your fingers into a closed fist, much like you are gripping a distant steering wheel in front of you. [10] X Research source [11] X Research source Your hand should remain out in front of you for the entire time you are doing the Whip. Try not to let your arm dip too much; it should be roughly at chin level. Your non-raised hand should be loose and rest at about hip level. You might even want to rest it on your hip, though what you do with it is up to you! If you're doing the Whip by yourself, try alternating between hands, especially when linking freestyle moves. This can make your transitions more natural. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Bounce your hips up and down in small motions.",
      "content": "Bounce your hips up and down in small motions. This should give your body a slight bobbing movement while your feet remain stationary. Your knees and thighs will bend slightly with your bob, but most of the up and down motion should be in your hips and core. [13] X Research source To give your whip style more character, stretch out your arm in front of you at chin-level. Bob it left and right in time to the music and your hips. When your arm reaches the far left or right, you can add a spin move, or transition into another step."

      "title": "Transition to the Nae Nae.",
      "content": "Transition to the Nae Nae . When doing the Whip, you're already mostly in position to do the Nae Nae. The Nae Nae also uses a deep stance, but instead of holding one arm in front and the other at your hip, one hand is raised above your hand and the other stretches below your hip. You'll also want to: Rock back and forth to the left and right. Keep your feet in place and sway your hips to the beat of the music. Add a connecting move to make the transition more natural, such as clapping your hands, then spreading them apart into Nae Nae position. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Alternate your Whip dancing with the Stanky leg.",
      "content": "Alternate your Whip dancing with the Stanky leg . The Stanky Leg is easy to add to the whip. From the classic Whip pose, extend one of your feet in front of you and plant it on the dance floor. Keeping your planted foot in place, lean your entire body in the opposite direction of your stationary foot. Now move your stationary foot in small, circular motions to complete the move. [15] X Research source To continue the Stanky Leg, alternate between feet, shifting the direction you are leaning back and forth. As you do so, loosen up some and bob in time with the music. To keep the Stanky Leg fresh, get your arms involved in the dance. Bend them at the elbow, moving them to the beat and crossing them in front of you. Slide the Whip pose into the Stanky Leg. When your arm is in front of you, move it to the left or right. Lean into your arm while doing so. Once you've far enough, you should be in position for the Stanky Leg."

      "title": "Incorporate freestyle moves.",
      "content": "Incorporate freestyle moves. Freestyle is a matter of preference, and you should do what feels right. However, you might want to break up your Whip by taking a few small steps to the beat of the music to reposition yourself on the dance floor, raising your hands in time with the music as you do so. Consider adding a hand twirl. Raise the hand at your hip while Whipping to join the one on front of you. Twirl them around each other to give your Whip some flavor. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Enjoy yourself . Dancing is about expression and enjoying yourself. Experiment with what feels natural and comfortable for your body, but don't let embarrassment or self-consciousness get in the way of you enjoying yourself. Keep an eye on others who do the Whip to learn new moves. They will likely be flattered you're trying to imitate them and they may give you some pointers! [17] X Research source"
