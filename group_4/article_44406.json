[3] X Research source Visit a website like cruises.com and look specifically for positioning cruises leaving from London or Southampton. Positioning cruises offer some discounts on fares, since they do not stop at ports. Most travel agents and online travel websites will not list these cruises.

      "content": "Research passage on a freighter. Freighters can carry up to twelve passengers without hiring a doctor. This means that you can occasionally find a ticket that costs approximately $50 to $100 per night for a cabin, food and access to facilities. [4] X Research source Freighter tickets are not like cruise ship tickets. They do not provide on-board entertainment. Occasionally, passengers are offered to attend meals and cocktail events with the captain and ship employees. Freighters make delivery stops, since their main duty is to deliver cargo. These stops can take twelve hours to a few days. You must be flexible with your schedule in order to travel this way. Make sure to specify which amenities will be provided on the ship. Some freighters do not allow you to exit the boat in port, but they may not provide meals in port for these shorter trips."
