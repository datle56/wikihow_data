      "title": "Make sure you are within the proper weight limit.",
      "content": "Make sure you are within the proper weight limit. Limit is usually around 143 lbs. Most pogo-sticks state the weight limit either on the directions, or directly on the pogo-stick. If you exceed the weight limit, you will not be able to pogo as high and it may be a safety risk.Also, make sure you are wearing adequate safety gear, as riding a pogo stick can be dangerous when you are first learning. Be sure to start on a hard surface outdoors with lots of room ( not grass, your pogo-stick will sink into the dirt.) Wear a well- fitting helmet, and if you want, elbow pads (knee pads may make it harder to hop on the pogo-stick)."

      "title": "Wear a helmet.",
      "content": "Wear a helmet. Always wear safety gear before you get on a pogo stick, especially a helmet. Also make sure to wear elbow pads and knee pads. Always wear shoes that lace up and have rubber soles. Never use a pogo stick barefoot or in sandals. Make sure your laces are properly tied and far from the springs. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Get the correct size pogo stick. If you are below 5’5” use a pogo stick that is 46 inches. Use a pogo stick that is at least 51 inches if you are between 5’6” and 5’11.” If you are 6” or taller make sure to use a pogo stick that is at least 56 inches."

      "content": "Avoid uneven ground such as grass or dirt. Your pogo stick could get stuck in the ground and you could fall. Don’t use the pogo stick in traffic or in the middle of the street. Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye out for pedestrians, cars, bikers, skate boarders, and skaters. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn to balance.",
      "content": "Learn to balance. If you struggle to balance you can practice your balance off the pogo stick. Use a balance board before you get on to work on not falling. This will help you learn to keep control of the pogo stick once you get on. Stand in a split stance on the board and try to keep the board still. Try putting your feet with one foot in front of the other then slowly rock the board back and forth very controlled. Put your feet side to side. Slowly and controlled tilt the board from one foot to the other. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Get on the pogo stick.",
      "content": "Get on the pogo stick. Make sure the pogo stick is facing outwards. Put the pogo stick vertical and place one foot on the foot rest. Hold on to the handle bars and put your other foot on the pogo stick. Try not to put all your weight on one foot as you get on or you might fall over. [5] X Research source Place both hand on the handlebars and grip firmly. Push down with one foot HARD on one of the foot bars."

      "title": "Start jumping.",
      "content": "Start jumping. So you don’t lose you balance, immediately start jumping on the pogo stick when you get both feet on. Jump towards the pedals, not away from you. Keep your arms on the handle bars and use them to stay steady and keep your balance. Keep the pogo stick close to you, don’t push it forward. You will have trouble bouncing and you might break your stick. [6] X Research source Try just doing one or two bounces at first then get off. This will give you the feel for the pogo stick. [7] X Research source As you push one foot down, bring the other foot onto the other foot bar. Now that you have both feet on the feet bar, hold on tight. To hop, push down with your legs by crouching down, and hop up by pulling gently but quickly up on the handlebars while standing up completely. Do this motion several times, and you will be hopping. Just bring your bottom down near the floor, and jerk up on the handlebars. Don’t jump too high. If you jump high you could lose control of the pogo stick and fall. Only jump high enough to be bouncing up and down slightly off the ground. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Don’t do anything you aren’t ready to do. You might have seen people online or friends doing stunts with pogo sticks. Only do what you are comfortable doing and don’t do anything you are not ready to try. Make sure you can do regular jumping with ease before you attempt any tricks. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Jump with one foot.",
      "content": "Jump with one foot. Once you have control of your pogo stick, you can try jumping with one foot. Start jumping how you normally would. When you have a good rhythm going, take the foot off the pogo stick that is not dominate. (If you are right footed, take off your left foot). Lean to the side of the pogo stick that does not have a foot on it to try to center yourself perfectly."

      "title": "Jump with no hands.",
      "content": "Jump with no hands. To jump without any hands, start jumping how you would normally jump. Then, use your knees to get a good grip on the pogo stick. Slowly take your hands off of the pogo stick handles. Make sure to continue to jump, securing the pogo stick with your knees and using your knees to pull the pogo stick up. Once you start jumping with no hands have somebody give you a ball. You can use a basketball and shoot it in a basket while you are on the pogo stick."

      "title": "Care for your pogo-stick and yourself while using it.",
      "content": "Care for your pogo-stick and yourself while using it. Do not leave it in the rain, snow, or any extreme weather. This may cause rust and other problems. Do not leave it unattended. It could get stolen. Keep it clean! A buildup of dirt or grime could slow the pogo-stick down and make it harder to hop. If a piece comes off or starts to come off, such as the rubber bottom, Stop use immediately and fix it, get it fixed, or replace the pogo-stick. A missing piece could be dangerous. Do not attempt tricks until: you are very good at the pogo-stick, you have supervision by someone who can help in an emergency, and proper safety gear (a helmet). Do not use the pogo stick in dangerous places, such as: streets, near edges, near stairs, or near skateboards. Do not pogo near small children. They could get seriously injured by your pogo-stick. Do not attempt to go down or up stairs. You could, and probably will, hit your face on them. Keep your pogo-stick in temperatures closest to room temperature as possible."
