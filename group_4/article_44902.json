It could be a physical feature (the eyes, the hair) or it could be something they do (the way they walk). Are any of their little tricks ones that you feel you could adapt and use too? If so, adopt them—they will improve as you practice and become part of your style too. [1] X Research source Be careful of becoming a caricature. If you try to adopt somebody's signature look—say, coloring your hair and dressing like the latest popstar confection—people will think \"popstar wannabe,\" not \"wow, now that's hot !\""

Maintain your appearance, learn and maintain good posture, keep your clothes free from \"wardrobe malfunctions,\" (especially if you're on the risk edge of dressing sexily). Don't make it obvious that you're checking yourself out—that comes across as vain or narcissistic. Be discreet. The important thing is to keep up your appearance of hotness for as much time as possible while you're out and about."

Being considered hot doesn't mean just looking hot, it actually means you need to be hot, and who you are and how you act has almost everything to do with it! If you don't feel hot, there's an easy way around that: visualize your own hotness. Carry yourself the way hot people do. They don't slouch, or sit in the corner with their arms crossed. They stand up straight. They make animated gestures with their hands. They smile and laugh a lot. That all stems from one key ingredient of hotness: confidence. There is nothing more attractive than confidence, whether you're a man or a woman. [3] X Research source Be larger than life. The reason hot people are called \"hot\" is because of the implication of heat, fire - not just an allusion to sexual energy, but also being passionate and lively in general. Be willing and able to speak your mind, but do it wisely. This requires a modicum of intelligence and the willingness and ability to learn. It is said that it's better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than open your mouth and erase any doubt. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Groom yourself well. In addition to fitness, looking like you just don't care about yourself is not hot. Externally, that's obvious. Internally, if you don't care about your appearance, it indicates that you don't have much in the way of self esteem or confidence—traits that are not attractive in the short run, nor are they attractive in the long run. [5] X Research source What can you do? Wax or trim your eyebrows, and everything else that looks untidy. Get rid of that unibrow, wax away the upper lip hair, pluck the chin hair, shave your legs, and basically get rid of any hair you can stand to part with except the hair on your head. Modern standards of beauty lean towards overall having no body hair. It helps create the whole smooth-skin look and also makes you look more polished and clean-cut. Don't take it so far, though, that you have to draw on your eyebrows. That's where hot turns into trashy. We all have different facial structures, features we love, and features we hate. Highlight those features that work, and downplay the ones that don't. Applying the right amount of makeup in the right places will do wonders. If you doubt the truth of this, just Google \"stars with no makeup,\" and see how truly ordinary even the hottest of the hot look without makeup. Then understand that hotness mostly radiates from the inside."

This trifecta will not make you a better human being, but will be a step towards \"hotness.\" After all, \"hotness\" is simply shorthand for being sexually desirable, and being physically attractive is what most people look at—initially. [6] X Research source Working out regularly pays big dividends. Is it shallow that we judge others by looks? Of course it is! However, the first thing people see is the \"surface\" you, so that's where we begin our journey to hotness. In general, people will find you more attractive if you're fit. The benefits don't end there, though. Not only will hitting the gym make you look better, but it'll also help you feel better, help boost your self esteem and confidence (more on that later), and even help you sleep better. Tanning your hide is not always a bad idea. One hopes you do not aspire to the obvious fake 'n' bake look exhibited by reality show denizens and politicians, but a smooth, even complexion generally makes people more attractive. It doesn't have to be—and probably shouldn't be—too dark, but the tanning effect has the benefit of covering up minor imperfections. To keep skin cancer at bay, consider a professional spray tan. Avoid the orange tan by checking out photos of clients from your local spray tan salon to make sure they know how to get it right. Laundry day is good for you! It sounds like a terrible bore, but in addition to keeping your clothes clean and wrinkle-free, you will always have the widest possible variety to choose from when you select what you're wearing. Put together outfits that emphasize your best features, and have enough variety to your outfits so that you're not always wearing the same thing."

Eventually (even as soon as the next morning), people will see you disheveled, with no makeup, and sloppy clothes, the veneer stripped away. That's when your real self will be naked and exposed. Don't get so caught up in looking hot that you forget to be a decent person !"
