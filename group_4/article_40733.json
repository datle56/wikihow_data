      "content": "Whine a little. That's right. That's the first step to starting over. You’ve got to feel what you're feeling. Clamming everything up will just make you explode later. And what's more: admitting this is how it is could fuel you to do something about it. Acknowledging your situation and not liking it is the only way you can do something about it. So go ahead. Whine. You're unsatisfied. That's how living works. Talk about it. You know how dieters are supposed to have a diet buddy, or at least let the world know what they're going through? That's for support and accountability. It's the same principle here. Even if you just find one person, you'll have a friend to lean on and someone that can keep you on track when you slip. We all need that support."

      "content": "Take time (off). The fact of the matter is that right now you need a break. Sometimes, life just needs to stop. In as much as you can actually do this, grab that Kit Kat and take a short hiatus. Start replenishing your energy bar for the massive endeavor you're about to rock, showing life who's boss. [1] X Research source If you have a job, you may need to take time off work. Not a long time -- nothing to get you fired. Just a day or two to assess and concentrate. Right now is all about you."

      "title": "Get a stable income.",
      "content": "Get a stable income. There's a definite hierarchy of needs that all humans have. For most of us, it involves having money at our disposal. In order to have food on the table, you need money in your pocket. You don't need a lot, but in order to move up the hierarchy (and to start thinking about climbing up), you need a stable income. So, to put it succinctly, if you're unemployed, start looking for work. Looking for work should take you 40 hours a week. In today's economy, it may not come easily, but it'll come. Keep your nose to the grindstone and leave no stone unturned, nor opportunity turned down."

      "title": "Finish school.",
      "content": "Finish school. If you haven't finished high school, this is doubly important. In order to get a job, you'll need a GED. All it takes is pulling up a Google search and making a phone call to a local adult education center. Most places can help you work out a payment plan and want to see you on the right track. What's more, where's the harm in just asking? [2] X Research source If you have some college, but haven't graduated, consider going back. Not only will you up your employment options, but you'll feel good about yourself. You'll feel accomplished. After all, rock bottom is just a state of mind. There are plenty of people who others might consider to be on rock bottom that feel on top of the world. Finishing college could change your mindset entirely."

There is no personal advancement if it does not. In order to see progress, you cannot keep your old tricks. The buck stops here. [3] X Research source Imagine the person you want to be. Does that person have a dependency on anyone or anything else? When it comes to this self project, why settle for anything less than that ideal image? You owe it to you to be the best you can be. If you can't kick this habit, none of the new, better habits will fall into place."

      "content": "Start thinking proactively. When you need to change everything about your situation and to completely start over in life you need to make some major adjustments between your ears. You need to think like a new person, act like a new person, dress like a new person, and surround yourself with new people, yes. However , to do this, you need to start thinking positively and with conviction. Put away the \"I can't,\" \"what if?\", and \"maybes.\" There's no room for those here. This starting over? You're going to do it. [4] X Expert Source Tracey Rogers, MA Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 6 January 2020. It's highly possible that training your brain to think differently could alleviate this situation entirely. What are you but your thoughts, anyway?

Take a good 15 minutes, close your eyes and really imagine the life you want down to what you feel like in that life. Take a good mental snapshot of your perfect life. You need to believe, without a shadow of a doubt, that this person you envisioned will be you. [5] X Expert Source Lucy Yeh Career & Life Coach Expert Interview. 21 November 2019. You need an end point in order to know just how and where to start your journey. Where do you want to end up? What goals would you like to reach? Write it down.

Being dragged down by the dirt of the day will only be a reminder of your present situation. [6] X Research source Like we discussed earlier -- \"rock bottom\" is very much so a mental state and therefore can come and go with ease. Showers (and other seemingly pointless endeavors) then become tricks of the trade in that they can relax you, take away stress, and cue your mind that it's time to start over. You're not just getting clean -- you're getting prepared."

But the thing is you can't think of these things in such a linear fashion. In fact, you should think backwards. Does the successful person exercise or does the exerciser become successful? Is it the chicken or the egg we should be addressing? [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The first thing to go when you're down in the dumps is your body. You lie in bed all day, only greeting the sun to tell it to go away. To make matters worse, it's a vicious cycle that only propagates itself. Your body starts to drag and then your mind goes with it. When you exercise, your mind starts taking cues from your body instead of the other way around. You feel better, you look better, and you are better when you exercise -- enabling you to tackle the other parts of this insane world."

After the binge, you feel absolutely terrible -- thus forcing the process to repeat. The only thing you can do then is lie on the couch and pray for a release from the impending indigestion. Not very productive, huh?

After a healthy meal, your body feels better and you feel better. Are you noticing a pattern?

Eating healthy is part of the mental trickery to get your mind speeding down the track to Awesome Town."

Instead of thinking thoughts that are helpful and rational you end up thinking things like, \"I'm a complete failure -- I'll never amount to anything regardless of what I do, so why bother trying?\" Here's some news for you: Those thoughts are not facts . They are feelings. And feelings can change. [10] X Expert Source Tracey Rogers, MA Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 6 January 2020. When you catch yourself thinking something negative, either force yourself to immediately stop it in its tracks or add on something to make it better. \"I'm a complete failure\" turns into, \"I'm a complete failure at this one thing today. Tomorrow is another story.\" Take yourself out of the black and white. Nothing is 100%. When they said, \"This too shall pass,\" this is what they were talking about."

In order to snap out of the rut, you’ve got to do things that you may not want to do -- and keeping up your old (pre-rock bottom) life is one of them. If you used to play music, force yourself to play music. If you used to love cooking, cook. It may be the last thing you want to do, but rediscovering what once brought you joy could be just the catalyst for change you need. [11] X Research source In addition to keeping up old habits (the good ones), new ones work just as well! Staying active (both physically and mentally) will force you out of this lackluster, lethargic thought-path you've been squeezed into. Are there any opportunities at your school or workplace? Is a friend trying something out that seems interesting to you? What could be a valuable way to spend your free time? In other words, what could distract you?"

It doesn't have to be world-changing, it just has to get you out of bed and being productive. [12] X Research source It all depends on where you are in the process. It could be something like \"send in 5 applications, \"go for a 2 mile (3.2 km) run,\" or \"talk to a new person.\" Think of a few things you'd like to see come to life in the near future -- what are small things you could do every day to achieve them?"

Seek out the little opportunities in addition to the bigger ones.

Obviously this is easier said than done, but if your present circumstances are highly dictated by location (no job opportunities, no friends to speak of), you may want to consider moving -- if it's financially feasible. It doesn't have to be a big move, but a change of scenery could do you some serious good. What better way to rejuvenate you than to rejuvenate all of your senses? With a move, soon enough you'll forget all about your former life. Who were you once, anyway? If bad memories are associated with where you are currently, give this idea serious thought. Is there anywhere you could go but still maintain your support network? Sit down with yourself and ask if this process (arduous though it may be) would be worthwhile.
