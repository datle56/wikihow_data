      "title": "Look at classic shades.",
      "content": "Look at classic shades. Choose from black or nude for the quintessential vintage look. Alternately, go with brown for something different that’s not too loud. Wear solid-colored tights or leggings underneath your stockings if you want color options."

      "title": "Wear unconventional fishnets.",
      "content": "Wear unconventional fishnets. Pick colored or sparkly fishnet stockings for something outside the norm. Try pulling a color from your outfit for the hue of your stockings. Wear glittery fishnets with a dress or under ripped jeans for a night out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select a pattern.",
      "content": "Select a pattern. Opt for micro-sized fishnet if you want them to appear more subtle. Choose a small diamond pattern for an elegant look. Pick large shapes such as diamonds, circles, or ovals for an edgier style. Thin mesh is dainty and easier to incorporate in your outfit. Small, thin patterns work well for daywear or evening wear."
    },
    {
      "title": "Experiment with rips.",
      "content": "Experiment with rips. Cut holes or rips in your stockings if you want an edgy, grunge style. Opt for a small-scale print to keep the look fashion-forward rather than trashy. This is a great way to reuse snagged stockings."

    {
      "title": "Wear close-toed shoes.",
      "content": "Wear close-toed shoes. Avoid open-toed sandals and pumps with fishnet stockings. Wear closed-toed pumps or boots for a dressy look. Choose loafers or even canvas shoes to mix in a casual feel. For instance, pair tennis shoes with fishnet stockings and wear loose, high-waisted shorts. Try a knee-length skirt with below-the-knee boots."
    },
    {
      "title": "Layer with short skirts.",
      "content": "Layer with short skirts. If you're wearing fishnets and a short skirt, pair this with loose or boxy layers to balance your vamp factor. For instance, consider wearing above-the-knee boots to show a provocative few inches of stockings. Try layering your outfit with tall socks over your stockings, buttoned-up tops, a long sweater or a cardigan with draping."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose fabrics in solid colors.",
      "content": "Choose fabrics in solid colors. Don’t overpower your fishnets with other patterns. Keep the rest of your look simple. Stick to a single patterned piece that isn’t too loud if you want to vary from solid colors. For example, tuck a black-and-white striped shirt into solid black shorts. Wear fishnet stockings and casual shoes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Layer tights under a dress or shorts.",
      "content": "Layer tights under a dress or shorts. Wear tights under stockings in neutrals for a classy look. Wear shorts with layered stockings to avoid showing a lot of leg. Pair cutoff shorts with large-hole fishnets over opaque tights in a vivid color. For example, wear nude fishnet stockings over chocolate tights. Add nude pumps and a tiered, above-the-knee, summery dress."

    {
      "title": "Wear slacks.",
      "content": "Wear slacks. Try cropped pants to show just a bit of your stockings. Alternately, you can roll the bottoms of your pants a bit. Wear full stockings or fishnet “socks” that stop at the ankle (or end between the ankle and mid-shin). For example, try black cropped bellbottoms that show a couple inches of ankle, with black fishnets and pumps.

      "title": "Wear fishnets with denim.",
      "content": "Wear fishnets with denim. Choose long, ripped jeans with stockings underneath. Cuff your jeans to show some ankle, if desired. Alternately, try frayed denim shorts or a skirt. Try pairing a denim skirt with a blazer and ankle boots or tie-up sandals Try wearing worn jeans with heels and a simple blouse. Show the top of your fishnets by matching a highwaisted pair with a crop top and jeans."

      "title": "Wear a piece of clothing with cutouts.",
      "content": "Wear a piece of clothing with cutouts. Mimic the open pattern of fishnet. Pick a dress with cutouts on the sides. Layer another piece underneath to keep the texture of the cutout without showing a lot of skin. This look also works with ripped pants or a jacket, rather than a dress."

      "title": "Incorporate fishnets into your evening look.",
      "content": "Incorporate fishnets into your evening look. Wear a classic dress, such as a red or black number with an above-the-knee hemline. Alternately, wear a metallic wrap dress. Choose a straight, beaded dress for a fancy option with vintage style."
