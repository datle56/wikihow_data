      "content": "Get your heart rate reading. Try to remain still while you press a finger onto the heart rate sensor located under or to the right of your camera, to the right of the LED flash, depending on your model. Do this for about 10 seconds so the sensor and the app can make their calculations. The heart in the middle of the screen will indicate if you are moving by turning orange, and will notify you to stay still. Once the progress is 100% complete, Samsung Health will display the beats-per-minute (bpm) reading in the middle of the screen."
