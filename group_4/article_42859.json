      "title": "Start at home and explain the controls.",
      "content": "Start at home and explain the controls. Explain to your beginner driver how to start the vehicle and shift it into the gear. Show them how to use the controls such as the windshield wipers, turn signals, and air-conditioning. Go over basic maintenance info as well such as refueling, checking tire pressure, checking oil levels, and topping up windscreen washers. Take some time to explain what everything does and allow them to ask you questions. [1] X Research source Review both the drivers' handbook and the owner's manual for the car. Because you drive often, you may not realize just how many controls there are in your vehicle! For instance, a brand new driver may have no idea what hazard lights are for and how to turn them on."

      "title": "Talk about the importance of checking your mirrors.",
      "content": "Talk about the importance of checking your mirrors. While you’re sitting in the parked vehicle, show your student how to adjust the rearview and side mirrors. Explain that it’s very important that you check your mirrors before you back out or change lanes. [2] X Research source Going over these ideas before your driver even gets behind the wheel will help reinforce them."

      "title": "Show them to place their hands at 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock on the wheel.",
      "content": "Show them to place their hands at 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock on the wheel. Keep both of your hands on the wheel to set a good example. Your student will watch and do as you do! Don’t use the outdated 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock positions on the wheel, which don’t allow for as much control and turning ability as the 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Drive around with your student and explain what you’re doing as you drive.",
      "content": "Drive around with your student and explain what you’re doing as you drive. Model good driving behavior by driving around with your student. Follow all of the traffic laws and explain what you’re doing so your student can recognize and understand it. There are a ton of driving laws and practices to follow, and by demonstrating them yourself, your student will see the right way to follow them. [4] X Research source For instance, as you’re approaching a light, you could say, “Okay, so the light just turned red, which means we have to stop until it’s green, so I’ll put my turn signal on so everyone knows I’m going to turn when the light is green.”"

      "title": "Point out signs, lights, and street markings and explain what they mean.",
      "content": "Point out signs, lights, and street markings and explain what they mean. As you drive your student around, point to speed limit signs, stop signs, and different street signs you see along the way. Talk about what they mean and what a good driver needs to do in order to obey them. [5] X Research source For example, you could say, “Okay, see how the speed limit is changing? That means we have to lower our speed and that school zone sign means we have to keep an eye out for school busses and kids.”"

      "title": "Tell your student to stay focused and avoid distractions.",
      "content": "Tell your student to stay focused and avoid distractions. Talk about how it’s important to keep your eyes on the road at all times. Looking away for more than 2 seconds is enough time to cause an accident. Discuss the importance of avoiding distractions and putting away your phone so you aren’t tempted to text or respond to messages. [6] X Research source Tell your student if they need to make a call or send a message, no problem. Just pull over somewhere safe when you do it."

      "content": "Help your student get their learner’s permit. In order to practice driving on public roads, your student will need to have the proper permit. Sign them up for a driver’s education course and review the rules of the road with them to help them prepare. Take them to your local motor vehicle’s office and let them take the test to earn their permit. [8] X Research source Once your student has a permit, they can legally drive with a licensed adult in the car. Keep a log of driving practice hours if one is required as part of the licensing process."

      "title": "Spend about 30 minutes on each lesson.",
      "content": "Spend about 30 minutes on each lesson. Stick to relatively short lessons about 3-4 times a week so your new driver is more likely to retain everything you go over. You also don’t want to overwhelm them with too much information, and 30-minute practice sessions can help prevent that from happening. [9] X Research source The more your student driver practices, the better they’ll get, so try to do it often."

      "content": "Tell them to use their turn signal whenever they plan to turn or change lanes. Help your student develop the habit of always using their turn signal. As they’re approaching a turn, gently remind them. If you see them forget to put on their signal, mention it to them. Eventually, they’ll get better at remembering to do it. [14] X Research source If they’re stopped at a red light, you can have them make a right turn if it’s legal. But make sure they use their turn signal! Additionally, if a vehicle in front of you has its turn signal on, tell your student driver that they need to be prepared to slow down and stop when the vehicle turns."
