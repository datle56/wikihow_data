The ⊞ Win key is in the bottom-left side of the keyboard, while the PrtScn (\"Print Screen\") key is in the upper-right side of the keyboard. You should see the screen dim for a brief moment, signifying that the screenshot has been taken. You can find the screenshot in your computer's \"Screenshots\" folder, which will appear in the \"Pictures\" folder after you've taken at least one screenshot. The PrtScn key may also have Prt Sc or Prt Scr on it. If you don't have the PrtScn button on your keyboard, try using other methods to screenshot . If the picture didn't save immediately, open a program like Paint and press Ctrl + V to paste."
