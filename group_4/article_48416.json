Along with the antibiotics your dog will likely be taking, your vet may prescribe something to increase their appetite and reduce queasiness. If your pup doesn’t have much of an appetite at all, talk to your doctor about medication that might help settle their stomach. [8] X Research source Cerenia is the most common and effective anti-nausea medication for dogs. Depending on how your dog is doing, your vet may also give you an anti-diarrhea, antacid, or probiotic. Most medications come in pill-form. Get your pup to swallow a pill by hiding it in their favorite food so it’s hard to resist."

      "content": "Hand-feed your pup to slowly reintroduce foods. Feeding your puppy by hand not only builds trust, but can encourage and make them feel better about eating. Sit on the ground with your dog and feed them bite-sized pieces of food until they’re full. [9] X Research source Hold the food out to your pup, but don’t force them to eat it. This could cause them to swallow their food wrong, leading to even more problems down the line. If your dog won’t eat after several days, your vet might suggest hand-feeding them with a syringe. That way, you can insert the food into their mouth so it’s much more likely that they swallow it."

As you research how to help your dog recover after parvo, you may stumble upon a more traditional nutritional approach, called NPO (“nil per os,” which translates to “nothing by mouth”). This approach involved not feeding your dog for 24 to 72 hours to heal the gastrointestinal tract before introducing food. However, new studies have shown that introducing foods right away is more beneficial, and will help your dog recover faster.
