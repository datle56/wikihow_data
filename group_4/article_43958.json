Put the end of the double ring belt through the front loop on your left side, then pull it through all the other loops until it is wrapped all the way around your waist. [1] X Research source This applies to any kind of double ring belt. It doesn’t matter if the rings are D-shaped, O-shaped, or square. You could put the belt through the loops in the other direction, starting with the loop on your right side, if you want. However, starting on the left is the typical way belts are worn."

Hold the rings in your left hand and use your right hand to slide the tip of the belt through the rings, going towards your left. Pull the belt all the way through.

Pull the end of the belt back towards your right, going over the top of the first ring.

Pull the slack all the way through so the belt rests flat on top of itself. [7] X Research source Double ring belts don’t usually have their own “keeper loop,” or loop to secure the end of the belt with, as regular belts do, so you have to secure the end in a different way."

      "content": "Pin the loose end of the belt with a bobby pin if it is too short to reach a loop. Hold the end of the belt straight and flat against your waist. Slide a bobby pin over the loose end and the section of belt directly underneath it to clip it in place. [8] X Research source If you don’t have a bobby pin, you could use a hair tie instead. Just slide the hair tie over the belt before you put it on, then put the loose end of the belt through the hair tie to hold it in place."

      "content": "Pull the end of the belt behind itself and straight down for a casual look. Slide the tip of the loose end of the belt behind the section of belt just to the right of the rings, between the belt and the waist of your pants. [9] X Expert Source Sahra Brandt Personal Stylist Expert Interview. 12 October 2021. Pull the tip straight down so the loose end of the belt rests flat against the front of your thigh. [10] X Research source This is a good way to give the belt a relaxed care-free look while still securing the loose end in place so it doesn’t flap around. For example, you could dress down a pair of khakis and a button-up shirt by wearing a double ring belt this way."

Pull the tip out from the bottom edge of the belt, then pull it straight to your right so the loose end of the belt is twisted around the section of belt on your hip. [11] X Research source This is a good casual way to style a double ring belt with a little flair. You could wear a canvas double ring belt this way with a pair of khaki shorts and a striped T-shirt to get a classic summery boat wear look, for example."

      "content": "Stick the end of the belt down with double-sided tape if it is too long or short. Put a strip of double-stick tape on the back side of the belt’s loose end. Press it firmly against the section of belt directly underneath it to stick it in place. This method could be a good option if your belt is either too short for the end to reach your first belt loop or if it is too long and the end still dangles after you put it through your belt loop."
