      "content": "Buy a smartphone or car GPS to get directions and your location. The GPS market is flooded with different devices, options, and features. Unless you plan on using your GPS in the wilderness or for research experiments, however, your smart phone or a car GPS, can provide directions and your location quickly and easily. Most have touch screens and come with a rechargeable battery. Smart Phones: Most smart phones come pre-loaded with a \"Maps,\" or \"Directions\" app that uses GPS. If you do not have one, search and download an app, like Google Maps, from your app store to use GPS. [1] X Research source GPS Devices: These are small, rectangular devices that specialize in driving directions and finding restaurants, airports, and other points of interest. Examples include TomTom and Garmin, and most cost under $170 dollars."

Click on the button labeled with a compass, navigational arrow, or crosshairs to show your current location. Your location is sometimes stored under the heading \"Where am I?\" \"Favorite Locations,\" or \"Current.\" iPhone users can see their current location using the built-in Compass App. Make sure you \"Allow Location Services\" for the compass under \"Settings\" → \"Privacy\" → \"Location Services\" → \"Compass\""

Many touch screen GPS's let you choose a location by holding your finger on the location in the map. Some GPS's will prompt you with a button labeled \"Get Directions.\" Choose this if there is no search bar to input an address. If you know the exact latitude and longitude of your trip, use these; they will give you the most accurate location possible."

Don't worry if you miss a turn -- most GPS will auto-correct and give you a new route to get back on track. If you are struggling to keep up, check your GPS's settings and make the \"Turn Warning Frequency\" setting longer -- giving you more time to hear the next direction."

Latitude and longitude are represented by numbers, known as degrees, which measure your distance from two \"zero lines.\" Longitude measures your distance East or West of the prime meridian, and latitude measure your distance North or South of the equator. This is the most accurate system of measurement for your GPS. An example (guess where it is!), is 37°26'46.9\"N, 122°09'57.0\"W. Sometimes direction is noted by positive or negative numbers. North and East are considered positive. The previous example could be written as: 37°26'46.9\", -122°09'57.0\" If there is no notation, know that the latitude always comes first.

There are over 25 satellites orbiting earth that receive signals from your GPS and use those signals to determine your latitude and longitude. Developed by the army, GPS can accurately tell your location anywhere in the world by several feet -- as long as the signal can reach the satellites.

      "content": "Get into the open. GPS needs a clear view of the sky to accurately communicate with the satellite's, so move away from overhangs or tall trees and head outside if you have issues. Generally, if you can see the sky, the GPS can as well. Tunnels, caves, and basements may all keep your GPS from communicating to satellites and working successfully."

Initializing your GPS acquaints it with your local area. To initialize a GPS, go to \"Settings\" and click \"Initialize.\" Follow your GPS's manual if you have any problems finding the setting, and know that this may take up to 20 minutes. Turn your GPS off and restart it if you are having problems. Make sure you have a clear view of the sky. You may need to reset your GPS the first time you buy it by clearing the memory.
