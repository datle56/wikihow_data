      "content": "Poke the end of the thermometer into the end of the sausage. Using the thermometer in the end of the sausage ensures that you won’t pierce the sausage casing (and let all of those delicious juices out). Try to stick your thermometer directly into the end of the sausage to leave the majority of the sausage intact.

      "content": "Check for an internal temp between 160 and 165 °F (71 and 74 °C). In general, all sausages should be in this range. If your sausage is not, it needs more cook time.

      "title": "Check that the sausage is firm with clear juices.",
      "content": "Check that the sausage is firm with clear juices. Pick up the sausage with tongs and hold it in the air. Is it firm and mostly stands up straight? Then it’s likely done. Check the juices in the pan or baking sheet as well: if they are clear, then the sausage is probably ready to eat. [3] X Research source If the sausage is floppy like a noodle or if the juices are pink in color, your sausage needs more time."

      "title": "Slice the sausage open and check for a brown or taupe color.",
      "content": "Slice the sausage open and check for a brown or taupe color. To be extra sure your sausage is done, use a knife to cut it in half and check the inside. A done sausage will be brown or taupe all the way through, while an underdone sausage might be pink or red inside. [4] X Research source In general, you can eat a sausage if it’s still slightly pink on the inside (since eating underdone beef and pork is usually fine). However, the sausage should be mostly brown or taupe inside."

      "title": "Boil a pot of water on high heat.",
      "content": "Boil a pot of water on high heat. Boiling sausages is a great way to make sure that they’re done before you fry or grill them. Grab a pot that’s large enough to hold your sausages, fill it with water, then let it get to a rolling boil on high heat. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the sausages in the water and cook them for 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Place the sausages in the water and cook them for 30 minutes. Use tongs to carefully place the sausages in the water, then turn the heat down to medium. Most sausages will be done after boiling for about half an hour, so set a timer on your phone or oven so you don’t forget. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Fry the sausages in a pan for extra color and added flavor.",
      "content": "Fry the sausages in a pan for extra color and added flavor. When the sausages are done boiling, they’re technically safe to eat. However, if you’d like to give them some color on the outside, throw them in a frying pan or on the grill for about 5 minutes. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Poach the sausages on low heat.",
      "content": "Poach the sausages on low heat. Poaching your sausages before grilling them ensures a more even cook (that way, they won’t be burnt on the outside and raw on the inside). To poach your sausages, place them in a saucepan and cover them with water. Turn the burner on low heat and poach the sausages until the internal temperature reaches 150 °F (66 °C). [8] X Research source You can also poach your sausages in wine, chicken stock, or beer for added flavor."

      "title": "Warm a non-stick pan over medium heat, then add the sausages.",
      "content": "Warm a non-stick pan over medium heat, then add the sausages. Sausages have a tendency to get stuck to their cooking instruments, so pick a non-stick pan. [10] X Research source Turn your burner on medium heat and add the sausages to the pan. The fat from the sausages will run out onto the pan as they cook, making the sausages even less likely to stick to the pan."

      "title": "Turn the sausages over regularly for an even color.",
      "content": "Turn the sausages over regularly for an even color. Use tongs to flip the sausages and move them around in the pan. That way, every side of the sausage will get golden brown instead of just one side. [11] X Research source Regularly turning the sausages also helps them cook thoroughly."
