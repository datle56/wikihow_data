      "content": "Clean your face thoroughly before using the tool. Washing your face twice daily is the most effective way to get clean, clear skin. (Plus, it’s rejuvenating!) If you plan to use an acne removing tool, rinse your face with a gentle acne cleanser and lukewarm water right beforehand so you’re free of any excess bacteria. Then, pat your face dry with a fresh, clean towel. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Use a cleanser with salicylic acid to help get rid of pimples. Salicylic acid is a moderate natural peeling agent, so it can easily wipe clogged pores clean without any damage to your skin. [3] X Research source Make sure that you wash your face in the morning, before you go to bed at night, and any time your face gets sweaty. Avoid harsh, exfoliating cleansers to prevent irritation, redness, and facial inflammation. Do not scrub your face. Just use your fingertips or a gentle cotton washcloth to gently massage the cleanser into your skin. Then, splash water on your face to rinse the cleanser away."

You can expand your pores by placing a hot, wet towel over your face for 2 to 3 minutes or by taking a hot, steamy shower. You can also use a steam treatment . Just avoid overheating the water as it can burn or redden your skin.

(This can lead to inflammation!) Gently glide the wet fabric across your face. You may need to do this a few times to truly open your pores. Even if you don’t have acne, using steam to freshen your pores to prevent future zits and make other skin refreshers more effective."

      "content": "Select the right extracting tool for your acne. Look in the mirror to see if your face has blackheads or whiteheads. Blackheads can be directly removed with comedone extractors , whereas whiteheads will need to be pierced with a sharp lancet first. Most acne removal devices come in blackhead remover tool kits . These kits contain several comedone extractors of different shapes, with each extractor having 2 ends of different sizes. Pick the size that best matches the size of the blackheads on your face. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don’t press too hard with the whitehead lancet. Excessive pressure may lead to scarring. [8] X Research source Avoid popping too many whiteheads. Using a lancet on more than 1 or 2 can increase your likelihood of infection. If you have more than a few on your face, it’s best to bite the bullet and see a dermatologist. To tell the difference between black and whiteheads, look at the color of the pimple’s tip. Blackheads (open comedones) are dark black or brown because the pore has been exposed and gotten oxygen. Whiteheads (closed comedones) are white, because there’s skin blocking the pimple from getting air. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Both blackheads and whiteheads are totally normal. While blackheads are easier to remove with an extractor, there’s still lots of easy and safe ways to treat whiteheads too."

Then, rock the tool gently from side to side while applying slight pressure. The blackhead in its entirety will be pulled from the follicle and you will see oil ooze from the pore. [10] X Research source Sterilize the comedone extractor with cotton swabs and rubbing alcohol before using it. Your acne tool can accumulate germs when it sits idle and you don’t want to accidentally introduce more bacteria to your face. [11] X Research source If the blackhead does not come out with gentle pressure, don’t try to force it. This can lead to infection and scarring. See a dermatologist if you have a severe blackhead that you cannot remove easily."

Once the whitehead has been opened, center it within the loop of the comedone extractor and rock the tool gently from side to side, applying slight pressure until it is pulled from the follicle.
