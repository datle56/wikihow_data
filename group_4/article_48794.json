[2] X Research source Maybe she spent a few extra hours binging her favorite TV show or maybe she pulled an all-nighter studying for that huge exam. Whenever a person gets less than the 7-9 recommended hours of sleep each night, they develop a “sleep debt,” or an amount of sleep that they need to make up. Your GF might just be snoozing to make up for a bad few nights of sleep. [3] X Research source Try to think about your girlfriend’s usual schedule. If consistently goes to bed at 1 AM and wakes up at 6 AM, she might use your hangout time as a chance to get some much-needed rest."

      "content": "Hypersomniacs feel extra sleepy during the day, or they may consistently oversleep. Typically, people with hypersomnia take frequent naps at pretty inconvenient times, like during their work shift, in the middle of a meal, or even in the middle of a conversation. If your girlfriend has no rhyme or reason for her sleep patterns, hypersomnia might be the culprit. Hypersomnia can be caused by a lot of different things, including drug and alcohol issues, sleep disorders, or autonomic nervous system issues. Talk with her about seeing a doctor if her sleeping habits are really out of control. If hypersomnia is the issue, there are a few prescription drugs that might help her."
