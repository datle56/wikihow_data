Castro recommends leaving as little time as possible between when you collect your urine sample and your drug test. Urine starts to decompose and break down into ammonia as soon as it leaves the body, turning it darker, smellier, and more acidic. [1] X Research source The longer the urine sits around, the less plausible it may be to use for a drug test . To seem the most plausible, urine should be fresh and warm. To collect a sterile urine sample , Tobis recommends a \"mid-stream clean catch:\" For males: “Clean the head of the penis with a safe antiseptic towelette or soap and water. Let the first portion of the urine stream go into the toilet, then use a sterile urine cup to catch the urine in the middle of the stream.” For females: “Clean the labia with a safe antiseptic towelette or soap and water. Spread the labia and discard the first portion of the [urine] stream into the toilet. Then, place a urine cup in the middle of the stream.”"

      "content": "Store urine in a resealable plastic or glass container. Most often, the test administrator will give you a sterile container to use for urine collection and storage. [2] X Research source If you don’t have one, use a plastic or glass container and boil it for 10 minutes to sterilize it. [3] X Research source Make sure the container is airtight, so that no pee will spill out. Castro recommends using a plastic container for short-term storage, or a glass container for long-term storage, as plastic can leech other chemicals into the urine. You can also put the container in a resealable plastic bag for an extra layer of protection. If you plan to store the urine long-term, label it with the date you collected the sample. Keep in mind that glass can break if you freeze it or warm it up too fast. The administrator of the drug test may give you a container to collect a simple in."

Keep it warm with a hand warmer . Right before you take the test, remove the hand warmer and let the urine come back down to your body temperature (around 98.6°F or 37°C).

It's best to refrigerate it as soon as you get the sample, but within 30 minutes will do.

Do not freeze your urine sample for longer term storage."

Keep the urine in an airtight container and use it within 4 months. [6] X Research source Urine samples that show evidence of repeated freezing and thawing may not be accepted for analysis, so plan to only freeze your sample once. Sources differ on how long you can freeze urine and still use it. As a rule of thumb, the sooner you can use it, the better. Be sure that you are freezing clean pee. Freezing pee that contains THC will increase the concentration."

[7] X Research source The best way to bring a urine sample to room temperature is by letting it defrost naturally. Microwaving urine could potentially damage the sample and make it unusable. Make sure you use the sample within the day when you defrost it."

Once the urine has reached room temperature, the next step is getting it up to body temperature, or even slightly higher since urine samples for drug tests must be 90 to 100 °F (32 to 38 °C). [8] X Research source Wrap the bottle in a heating pad or hand warmer, or place it in the microwave for 10 seconds. If you use the microwave technique, it's a good idea to use a hand warmer to keep the sample warm while you are transporting it. It's best to heat the sample to slightly above body temperature, as it will cool down in the time it takes for you to get to the test. The average normal body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C).
