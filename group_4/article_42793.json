Your artist will give you specific instructions on how long to keep this wrapping in place, but 2-10 hours is a good ballpark estimate. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Gently wash your new tattoo with gentle antibacterial soap. After washing your hands thoroughly, scoop lukewarm water over your tattoo until the surface is moist. Then, delicately massage a gentle, fragrance-free soap into the surface of the tattoo. Cup more lukewarm water onto the skin to rinse off the soap, and then let it air-dry (or gently blot it with a paper towel).

      "title": "Sleep with the tattoo wrap on during the first night if your artist recommends it.",
      "content": "Sleep with the tattoo wrap on during the first night if your artist recommends it. Tattoo artists have different opinions when it comes to tattoo wrapping time, so it’s ultimately best to stick with what your tattoo artist recommends. If they suggest leaving the wrap in place for the first night and then removing and cleaning it the next day, be sure to do that. [7] X Research source It’s not a good idea to remove the tattoo wrap and then reapply your own—this leaves you more open to infection. Remove your tattoo wrap the next morning, or whenever your tattoo artist recommends that you do so."

      "content": "Wash your tattoo daily. As you did the previous day, wash your hands and carefully moisten the skin before massaging the soap over your ink. Then, scoop more water over the wound and wait for it to air-dry. Aim to do this daily to keep your tattoo as clean as possible. [8] X Research source There’s no need to apply a new wrapping once you’ve removed the covering your tattoo artist put on."

Do this whenever you’ve washed and dried off the tattoo. [9] X Research source Don’t bandage the tattoo again at any point. [10] X Research source After the first 5 days, switch from antibiotic ointment to a mild, fragrance-free lotion.

      "content": "Take a quick shower with lukewarm or cool water. Set your shower to low pressure with a cool or lukewarm temperature—if the water is too warm, you could lose some of the precious ink. Do your best to keep the water from directly spraying on your tattoo, and clean it off with the same fragrance-free soap you’ve been using. Once you’ve given yourself a quick wash, hop out of the shower as soon as possible. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear loose clothes around the tattoo. Tight clothes and nylon tend to rub against the skin, which isn’t ideal when you have a healing tattoo. [17] X Research source Instead, stick with loose garments that give your skin breathing room without any chafing. You might wear baggy sweatpants if you got a tattoo on your thigh, or a loose T-shirt over a shoulder tattoo."

      "content": "Refrain from swimming as your tattoo heals. Pools, ponds, and any other swimming areas contain bacteria and aren’t an ideal environment for a healing tattoo wound. Wait until your tattoo is totally healed (in other words, no longer scabbing) before submerging it in any type of water.

      "content": "Eat nutritious foods and drink plenty of water to maximize healing. Try to consume somewhere between 9-12 cups (2.25-3 L) of water per day (through both food and drink)—hydration is an essential part of helping your body heal wounds (like a new tattoo). On a similar note, make sure to eat plenty of nutritious foods ; believe it or not, your body actually needs more calories while healing. [21] X Research source Leafy greens, eggs, tofu, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, strawberries, pumpkin, milk, and yogurt are just a few healthy foods to consider munching on while your tattoo heals."
