      "content": "Note this information about MagSafe charging. MagSafe wireless chargers have built-in magnets that align with the MagSafe magnets in certain iPhone models. MagSafe chargers are typically compatible with Qi charging, meaning you can use them on iPhones without MagSafe as well. [1] X Research source The following iPhone models are MagSafe compatible: iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12, and iPhone 12 Pro. Charging an iPhone without MagSafe on the MagSafe charger might lead to slower charging times compared to a normal Qi wireless charger. Make sure not to put items with magnetic strips or RFID chips between the iPhone and the MagSafe charger. The magnets can damage these items."
