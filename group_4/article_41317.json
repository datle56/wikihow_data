      "content": "Stay away from carbonation. Carbonated beverages contain carbon dioxide, which is a major component of air. Drinking them will be similar to drinking a great deal of air all at once. According to board certified pulmonologist Ni-Cheng Liang, MD, if your goal is to avoid burping, this is one of the most important steps you can take. [3] X Expert Source Ni-Cheng Liang, MD Board Certified Pulmonologist Expert Interview. 18 June 2021. Beer and sparkling wine, while not artificially carbonated, are also major culprits for aerophagia. If you suspect you’ve swallowed carbonated air, pulmonologist Ni-Cheng Liang says to “remain upright…because that will enable the gas bubbles to rise to the top of your stomach, bringing them closer to your food pipe so that they can come out in the form of a burp.” [4] X Expert Source Ni-Cheng Liang, MD Board Certified Pulmonologist Expert Interview. 18 June 2021."

      "content": "Stop smoking or vaping. Along with all of the other health benefits associated with quitting tobacco, you can prevent yourself from swallowing air by avoiding smoking altogether.

      "content": "Adjust your CPAP machine if you use one. Check the pressure, as it may be too high or too low, which can lead to hyperventilation. It is also possible that you need a mouth breathing apparatus rather than the standard nose one. If you think the pressure is too strong, ask your doctor if it is possible to lower it. [9] X Research source Like with CPAP machines, pulmonologist Ni-Cheng Liang, MD says, “sometimes people swallow air inadvertently when they are using supplemental oxygen. There's a constant airflow there and then they can't help it, [especially] if they're using the supplemental oxygen while they're eating and swallowing.” [10] X Expert Source Ni-Cheng Liang, MD Board Certified Pulmonologist Expert Interview. 18 June 2021."
