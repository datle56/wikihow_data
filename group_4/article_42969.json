The direct approach can be good because you don't leave them hanging and because you don't leave room for ambivalence, so they can move on to someone else. [1] X Research source For example, you could use the line, \"I appreciate you asking me, but no thank you.\" You could also say, \"No, I'm not looking to date right now.\" Be sure to make \"no\" part of your answer so you are very clear.

In other words, you dodge the request by using a decoy of some sort to not respond directly, such as giving a fake number to the person so they don't know you're rejecting them. [4] X Research source To give out a fake number, you can just make up a number, but make sure it's not someone else's number. Also, this tactic can backfire if the person tries to call it or sees you again sometime. Another option is to say you have a boyfriend or girlfriend. You can also use a friend as a pretend significant other; however, if you use this tactic, you may drive off other people, which can be a problem if you are trying to meet people."

If telling the person won't help the situation, then you may just want to leave it alone, even if the person does irritate you. [6] X Research source For instance, telling a manager you don't like them probably isn't going to be all that helpful to you. Your manager holds power over your career and can make your work life miserable, so telling a manager you don't like them isn't going to be beneficial. You might also get in trouble for insubordination. In addition, you may weigh your options if the person you don't like is a family member or a friend of the family. If you're going to see the person on a regular basis, telling them you don't like them is only going to make those situations more difficult. Similarly, if the person is a mutual friend with other friends, it may make social gatherings more difficult if you tell the person you don't like them. Also, consider whether you're being fair in your dislike. Maybe you took an instant dislike to someone without getting to know them. Try getting to know the person better before making a snap judgment."
