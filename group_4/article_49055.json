Don't be offensive or mean with your humor, because you'll make her worry that you also say bad things about her when she's not around. Instead, be smart with your humor.

Try to know her a little bit more before you attempt to be jocular (certain jokes for you might not be funny to her).

Actually use soap & give yourself a good scrub to help keep your skin healthy. If you're all sweaty, this step is going to be extra important. Some women are attracted to the smell of fresh sweat, but anything more than a couple hours old will scare them away! Get a basic clean-smelling or citrusy cologne or body spray. Use it only lightly. It should be a hint of smell, not a cloud. If you use just a hint, she'll want to lean in to smell you more...a cloud will keep her 5 feet (1.5 m) away! [6] X Research source"

You have to make them feel comfortable if you want them to get the chance to know you. One common mistake is to be a little too much on the stalker side: being too familiar with the girl and too clingy. You have to give girls space. If you stalk them and cling too much, they'll feel harassed and they will start to avoid you. [7] X Research source Be close, keeping in touch every once in a while, but remember she has friends and doesn't (or shouldn't) want to hang out with just you. Dropping cute text messages once a week or so is okay, though. Compliment her in a non-stalker way too. If she's wearing an interesting necklace, say \"That's an interesting necklace\" or \"That's a cool necklace\" NOT \"I always like your necklaces\"."

Confidence is being willing to be weak or wrong but press forward anyway because you know you can get through it and be a better person in the end. [9] X Research source When a man is really confident, he doesn't put himself down. He speaks up and gives and defends his opinion. He makes friends and is willing to talk to people he doesn't know.

Going over the top, however, and constantly putting her down will just make her angry and she'll probably tell people that you're a jerk. This will result in anger and distrust — not exactly what we're aiming for. If you accidentally upset a girl when you're teasing her, apologize sincerely. If she accepts your apology, that's a sign that the two of you will be able to deal with conflict in the future. [11] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019."

Actually remembering a girl's favorites will endear you to her more than any elaborate scheme. If it's early in the relationship, though, and you don't know her favorites yet, get her a gift that symbolizes your feelings or reminds you of something that you've done or will do together.
