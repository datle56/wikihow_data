      "content": "Walking Just walking for a few extra minutes each day can really make a difference. Plus, being outside in the fresh air, especially around nature, can really boost your mental health. [1] X Research source Build a walk around your neighborhood with your morning coffee into your daily routine, or next time you hang out with a friend, invite them to hike in your local park instead of crashing in front of the television. If you’re mostly sedentary, try adding in a 10-minute walk to your day to start, and increase the amount of time every day. Add little moments of walking into your day—for instance, get off the bus a few stops earlier and walk the rest of the way home."

      "content": "Bodyweight exercises It’s important to follow a well-rounded exercise routine that includes both cardio and strength training. But when you’re a novice lifter, getting a gym membership—let alone working out in front of people —can feel a little overwhelming (and expensive). Luckily, there are a lot of strength training exercises you can do anywhere, without any supplies except your own body. Try crunches , wall-sits , and push-ups for great strength training workouts that require no special equipment."

      "title": "Spin class",
      "content": "Spin class Spinning is a great form of exercise for the novice health nut because it’s super easy to modify the workout to your comfort and ability levels. Not only that, a class offers you the added social benefits of an enthusiastic teacher and fellow students. You’ll feel supported by your community of spinners and maybe even develop some new friendships. If you’re worried about exercising in front of a group of strangers, don’t worry—many spinning classes take place in dimly lit rooms, meaning if you need to slow down or stop, nobody is likely to notice."

      "content": "Yoga Yoga might not be what you think of when you think of working out, but it’s a great way to stretch and increase flexibility . Like spinning, it’s also a workout that’s easily modifiable, so you can start simple, and move on to more complex positions as your body becomes stronger and more flexible. All exercise is great for your mental health, but yoga in particular is extremely beneficial for your emotional wellbeing. It’s also a great way to warm up before a more strenuous workout (or cool down after)."

Make a visit to your community pool, gym, or body of water and splash around for a few minutes each day or a couple times a week to get in better shape and boost your mental health."

      "content": "Keep your workouts low-impact and slow. When you’re just starting exercising , it’s important to go easy on your body as you figure out your limits. You might be eager to dive all in, but overextending yourself can result in injury (which can really hold you back). So avoid high-intensity workouts when you first start. Give yourself time to figure out your body’s limitations, understand where you’re at and what you can and can’t handle. Gradually push your limits as your body grows stronger and more resilient. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Really listen to your body when you move: does it hurt when you move this way or that? Do you feel overheated? There’s no shame in pausing or stopping whenever you need to. If you’re reluctant to start exercising, commit to just 10 minutes of exercise every day—or even 1 minute. 1 minute is a manageable amount to commit to, and you’re likely to keep going once you begin. Even if you only exercise for a few minutes each day to start, you’ll grow more resilient and eventually be able to increase your workouts to 10 minutes, 20 minutes, a full hour."

      "content": "Set realistic goals to work toward. Just saying you \"want to be in better shape\" is a little vague. Setting specific goals can make it easier to commit to working out, whether you're aiming to run a marathon or you just want to take the stairs instead of the elevator at your apartment. When you're starting out, try setting a goal to get active 3 days a week or to jog all the way around a track (1/4 mile) within a month or two. Write down your goals to make them more official. Sharing your goals with others may also help you stick to them, so consider telling a few friends your goals for some support and accountability."

      "content": "Follow a balanced weekly routine (and include a rest day). Experts recommend getting at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity in every week, and that you do strength training for all muscle groups 2 times a week. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Spread this time out over the course of the week as it fits into your schedule, but be sure you reserve a day or 2 to let your body recuperate. For instance, you might jog or swim on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and do strength training exercises on Tuesday and Thursday. If you have a busy schedule, dedicating regular time to working out can be hard. Try to build your exercise routine around your existing schedule: if you talk to your friend on the phone every Wednesday evening, go for a walk while you do it. If you like to watch TV after work, hop on an exercise bike while you watch."

      "content": "Warm up and cool down to prevent injury. Warming up before an activity or cooling down afterward generally involves doing that activity slower and at a reduced intensity. Warming up helps your body prepare for exercise, while cooling down helps you recover from your workout. Failing to warm up and cool down can increase muscle stiffness and soreness. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It can be tempting to skip warming up or cooling down, but it only takes a few minutes before and after your workout to adequately warm up or cool down—and it's worth it."

      "content": "Stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet. Getting in shape isn’t only about working out—it’s also about making sure you’re getting enough water and nourishing foods. Eating the right foods can also give you more energy to exercise. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and lean proteins, healthy fats and whole-grain carbs, and, of course, drink lots and lots of water . [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Even if you’re working out to lose weight, it’s important to eat well. Skipping meals or not getting enough nutritional value can reduce your muscle mass, lower your bone density, and cause fatigue, which can not only make it harder to work out, but can lead to injury while exercising. But be sure not to eat too soon before exercising. Try to eat at least 1.5 hours prior to working out.

Taking it easy doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy yourself. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try out different exercises until you find one you enjoy doing, whether it’s using the elliptical or playing Quidditch. (Yes, people play Quidditch !) While it’s important to take things slow when you’re first starting out, sometimes being bored is a sign your body wants to be pushed a little more. Don’t go overboard, but consider challenging your body a bit more to make your workout more of a thrill."

      "content": "Reward yourself with a little treat afterward. You got out of bed early to jog this morning? You deserve a little treat. Giving yourself permission to do something special after your workout is a great incentive to keep up with your routine: maybe go to a movie, or work up to a bigger treat over time—for instance, once you’ve run a 10-minute mile, you’ll treat yourself to a new outfit or that new video game you’ve had your eye on. You can also make working out a treat in itself: for example, get a membership to the botanical gardens so that you can enjoy the scenery while you walk or jog. You don’t have to spend money to treat yourself, either. Tell yourself you’ll only listen to that true crime podcast series while you’re working out as an incentive to exercise: how will you know whodunnit if you don’t go for your daily bike ride?"

If you’re not used to working out, you won’t wake up and suddenly be able to run a marathon, so have some compassion for yourself and go at your own pace. And be sure to celebrate your victories, even if they seem small.
