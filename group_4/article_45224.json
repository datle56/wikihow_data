Compare 4 to the first two digits, 15. How many times does 4 go into 15? If you're not sure, guess and see if you're right using multiplication . The answer is 3, so write 3 on the answer line, above the 5."

Write the result underneath the dividend (the number underneath the division bracket). In our example, 3 x 4 = 12, so write 12 underneath the 15. Subtract the result from the dividend: 15 - 12 = 3 .

In this case, you can start again with that fraction, turning it into another mixed number. Don't forget to add the \"1\" back when you're done. Here's an example, turning 7 / 3 into a mixed fraction: [10] X Research source 7 / 3 = 3 / 3 + ? / 3 7 = 3 + ? 7 = 3 + 4 7 / 3 = 3 / 3 + 4 / 3 7 / 3 = 1 + 4 / 3 That fraction is improper, so ignore the 1 for now and do the same thing: 4 / 3 = 3 / 3 + ? / 3 4 = 3 + ? 4 = 3 + 1 4 / 3 = 3 / 3 + 1 / 3 4 / 3 = 1 + 1 / 3 That fraction is proper, so we're done.
