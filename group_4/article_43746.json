      "content": "Turn your stovetop burner on low heat. You don’t need the caramel to be extremely hot in order to thin it. In fact, adding too much heat could actually burn the sauce! Allow the caramel to warm up over low heat for just a few minutes. Stir the caramel with a nonstick spatula constantly to ensure that it’s not sticking to the bottom of the pan.

      "title": "Add one tablespoon (14.8 mL) of heavy cream or milk.",
      "content": "Add one tablespoon (14.8 mL) of heavy cream or milk. Heavy cream is best, as it’ll preserve the flavor and consistency of your caramel sauce. Start with one tablespoon (14.8 mL), and then add more in ½-tablespoon (7.4-mL) increments if you need the sauce to be thinner. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use water if your caramel sauce contains butter.",
      "content": "Use water if your caramel sauce contains butter. There’s a small possibility that adding more cream to your caramel sauce could cause the mixture to separate. This occurs when the sauce becomes oversaturated with fat. Even if your recipe called for butter, this shouldn’t happen if you reheat the caramel slowly and stir so it heats evenly. However, if you’d like to be safe, go with water! [4] X Research source Be aware that water may dilute the flavor of the sauce."

      "content": "Allow the caramel to cool again before eating it. Hot caramel is dangerous! To avoid burning your tongue, wait at least five minutes and up to a half-hour to let it cool. [6] X Research source To test if the caramel is cool enough, put your hand just above the sauce. If it’s still giving off heat but doesn’t immediately make your hand feel steamy, you’re good to go!"

      "content": "Place your caramel loaf in a dutch oven. Dutch ovens (also known as french ovens) are large, lidded cooking pots that can be safely put inside your oven. You do not need to grease the bottom of the pot. If you’re melting a whole caramel loaf, you may need to cut it in half or bend it to make it fit in the pot. Finally, put the lid back on and pop the pot into the oven. [9] X Research source Try to lay the caramel evenly in one layer. You shouldn’t need to stack pieces of caramel on top of each other."

      "content": "Cook the loaf for 45 minutes before checking it. Your loaf could take up to two hours to melt completely. However, it’s a good idea to check on its progress. If your oven runs hot, or if you’re melting a small loaf, it may be good to go a little early! [10] X Research source You’ll know that the caramel is ready when it’s fully melted and is easy to stir."

      "content": "Gather and measure out your ingredients. Since caramel sauce can be temperamental and burn quickly, get your ingredients ready to add before you start cooking. To make about 1 3 ⁄ 4 cups (410 mL) of caramel sauce, you’ll need: [13] X Research source 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (350 mL) granulated sugar. 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) water. 1 cup (240 mL) heavy cream. A medium nonstick saucepan. A wooden spoon or nonstick rubber spatula. A pastry brush that’s been dipped in a cup of water."

      "content": "Add corn syrup, honey, or lemon juice to keep the sauce thin. You’ll need about 1 tablespoon (14.8 mL) of corn syrup or honey for every cup (236.6 mL) of caramel sauce your recipe makes. These ingredients may slow the hardening of your caramel when it's complete. Use lemon juice instead if you don’t mind the citrus taste. Use ½ tablespoon (7.4 mL) of lemon juice per cup (236.6 mL) of sauce. Add the lemon juice after you’ve dissolved the sugar into the water. Stir in the lemon juice and then stop stirring the mixture completely. The lemon juice should prevent your caramel from crystallizing, but it may alter the taste of your caramel. If you like a little bite, however, go for this option!"

Pour in about a spoonful of cream as soon as it turns into that darker shade of brown. Be careful and stand back a bit from the stove as the caramel will being sputtering up when you add the cream. Use your nonstick spatula to gently stir in the cream. [18] X Research source It shouldn’t take more than a minute or so for the caramel to darken. If the caramel seems too dark (if it’s dark brown or black) or smells burnt, you’ll need to start over. Burnt caramel sauce is not a treat you want to eat!"
