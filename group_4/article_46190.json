      "title": "Choose between a blank presentation and a template.",
      "content": "Choose between a blank presentation and a template. When you start a new PowerPoint file, you can either create a blank presentation or a template. Blank presentations allow you to apply your own style, but this can be a time-consuming process. Templates can give your presentation a uniform style, but they may not suit your exact needs. You can edit any aspect of a template, so feel free to choose one that mostly matches your vision and tweak it as you see fit. You can apply themes to your project at a later time after you've added content. Click the Design tab and select a theme. It will be immediately applied to your project. You can either undo it (Ctrl + Z) or revert to a blank theme if you don't like it. You can access templates from the File tab. Click New and then browse the available templates. You can also download additional templates from a variety of resources online."

You can then adjust this later by grabbing one of the corners with your cursor and then clicking and dragging again.

You can also click the arrow at the end of the list to open the full listing of available transitions. When you pick a transition, it will affect how that slide appears.

Right-click on a blank section of your slide and select \"Format Background\", or click the Design tab and the click the arrow icon next to \"Background\" on the far right. Choose your fill type.

      "title": "Choose a good font size.",
      "content": "Choose a good font size. Presentations are designed to be read, otherwise it would just be a speech. Make sure that your audience will be able to easily read what you have written. A 10 point font may look okay when you're sitting at your computer, but when it's projected on the screen, people may be leaning forward in their seats straining to read. On a related note, make sure that your font choice is readable as well. Curvy and extravagant fonts may look cool, but they'll make your audience just stop caring if they can't read it."

Spelling and grammar mistakes will lower your credibility, even subconsciously, so you'll want to work extra hard to ensure that everything is written clearly and correctly. [2] X Research source Get someone to help you proofread your presentation before you give it. A fresh set of eyes are much more likely to catch mistakes that you gloss over."

    {
      "title": "Practice!",
      "content": "Practice! The PowerPoint is only part of your presentation. The other part is you! Take some time and practice your talking points as well as moving through the slides. Work on your timing and ensure that each slide accurately sums up your talking points. Make your own notes or memorize your presentation; reading off of your slides while you are giving your presentation is a big no-no. See this guide for more information on giving a successful presentation, either in class or at the office."
