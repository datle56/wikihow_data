      "content": "Questions without “yes” or “no” answers will draw them out. Whether you know this person already or you are talking with someone new, show your interest in the other person and encourage them to participate more in the conversation. The best way to do this is by asking questions that cannot be answered with a simple yes or no. Try to phrase your questions in such a way that it elicits a more detailed response. For example: Instead of asking, “Did you have a nice weekend?” try saying, “What did you do this weekend?” Instead of asking, “I like this appetizer, do you?” try saying, “If this was your event, what would you put on the menu?” Instead of asking, “Have we met before?” try saying, “I think we met at Jake’s birthday party a few months ago, what have you been up to since then?”"

      "content": "Compliments are a great way to relax someone and draw them out. Start by identifying something about them that you admire, whether it’s an article of clothing, their hairstyle, or something you know about them—such as that they aced that last big math test—and comment on it. Once they acknowledge the compliment, continue the conversation by asking them more about the thing you’ve commented on. It’s a tried and true way to make new friends, as long as you’re sincere. [3] X Research source “I just love vintage jewelry! There’s got to be a story behind that necklace.” “I can never manage to get my hair to do that.

      "content": "Threading can help you identify promising conversation topics. Threading is a technique that involves dissecting each statement a person makes into parts, and then choosing a part to follow up with to keep the conversation going. This will help you to respond to their comments without coming across as interrogative. For example: If a person says, “I just got back from a work trip and I’m really tired,” you could ask them about their job and about where they traveled. Choose one of these threads and respond with a question or an anecdote like, “I used to have to travel for work a lot, which could be cool, but was definitely exhausting. Where did you go?” or “What kind of job do you have? Do you enjoy it?” Reader Poll: We asked 2267 wikiHow readers what strategy they prefer for changing topics, and only 10% of them agreed that the best way to do so is by using a conversation starter. [Take Poll] Instead, try to organically change the subject based on what you’ve already been talking about."
