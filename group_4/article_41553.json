      "content": "Dig out the bulbs when the leaves are yellowed and dead. Keep the daffodils in the ground until the leaves are yellow and matured, otherwise, it may not flower as well next season. [1] X Research source The leaves usually die within 6 weeks of the flower dying. [2] X Research source Use a trowel or shovel to unearth the bulbs. Bulbs store energy for the next blooming season during the current season. [3] X Research source It is important to leave the plant until it dies on its own because the leaves will collect energy for next year’s blooms."

      "content": "Pull apart the bulbs from the root clumps. If you’ve had the daffodils for some years, there may be multiple bulbs in a single clump. Shake the soil free from the clump to see each of the bulbs. Gently pull the bulbs apart from one another to separate them. [4] X Research source Don’t leave the bulbs in direct sunlight once you have separated them. This will damage them or promote early flowering.

If the bulb is browning or starts to feel soft, it may be a sign of the fungal infection “bulb rot.” If these bulbs are planted, they may not bloom or they will develop prematurely.
