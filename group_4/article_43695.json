      "content": "The scrambler technique is a seduction method based on disruption. The theory goes that you can send mixed signals (i.e. “scrambled” signals) to convince a girl to think you’re an attractive sexual partner. This technique is based on some pseudoscientific ideas that being elusive and occasionally unfamiliar will make you interesting, which will make women want you all the more. [1] X Research source The scrambler technique was invented by Bobby Rio and Rob Judge, two dating coaches with no formal psychological training. Critics of the scrambler technique point out that the method relies on deception and dishonesty, so even if does work it’s not a particularly valid or ethical way to find romantic partners."

      "content": "Curiosity The foundation of the scrambler technique is based on the premise that people are naturally inclined to explore things that intrigue them. If you can make someone curious, you’ll have an easier time capturing their attention. [2] X Research source A lot of guys will use peacocking to draw attention. This is where you choose a single unique article of clothing that will make you stand out from the crowd."

      "title": "Mystery",
      "content": "Mystery If you present someone with a puzzle, they’re going to want to solve it. People are naturally attracted to unsolved puzzles, and enigmatic people are no different. If you can cultivate a bit of mystery , potential partners will be more likely to stick around. [3] X Research source A lot of this can be accomplished just by not being super talkative and brooding a little bit . Lean into your “cool guy leaning against the wall by himself” energy."

      "title": "Commitment",
      "content": "Commitment Nobody is going to stay interested if there isn’t anything connecting you two together. So, look for something you have in common with potential partners and lean into it. It doesn’t even need to be something deep or important. [4] X Research source You might use interest in the same sports team, a clothing item you have in common, or the fact that you two live in the same neighborhood."

    {
      "title": "Affirmation",
      "content": "Affirmation If you affirm a potential partner and make them feel important or powerful, they’ll come back to you for more good vibes in the future. People like to be around other people who make them feel good, so once the connection is established, shower them with love. [5] X Research source Focus on compliments and affirmations that don’t have to do with her looks. For example, if she mentions starting a new project at work, you might say something like, “You’re so ambitious!”"

    {
      "title": "Expectation",
      "content": "Expectation By building expectations, you draw her into wanting to come back to you in the future. Let her in on some interesting future plans you have, reference a fun party you’re going to soon, or hint that you’d enjoy getting to know her better. This creates anticipation, which will generate a ton of interest on her part. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Create uncertainty",
      "content": "Create uncertainty If you respond enthusiastically to an invitation to hang out the first time, play it a little more low-key the second time she asks to chill. If she asks you if you like her outfit, give her a casual nod and a slight smile, but don’t make it super obvious you’re into it. By generating a slight air of uncertainty, you’ll keep her on her toes and help cultivate interest. [7] X Research source Don’t overdo it with this part of the technique. If you create too much uncertainty, she may get the impression you aren’t interested in her. For example, if she texts you something like, “What are you up to?” don’t reply, “Nothing. Want to meet up?” Instead, say something like, “What’s going on.” It doesn’t tell her what you’re actually doing, and it implies you may or may not be free."

      "content": "Build anticipation Get her excited at unexpected times. You might hint that you’re going to blow her mind the next time you see her, or suggest you’re thinking about taking her on a trip and imply you’re looking at airline tickets. Every time you see her, drop one exciting tidbit in a nonchalant way. [8] X Research source If possible, combine your “creating uncertainty” moves and your “building anticipation” moves. The scrambler technique is all about using the ups and downs of a relationship to get her hooked on you! For example, if you two are parting ways after hanging out, you might say, “You better be ready for next time” and hit her with a sly smile as you leave."

      "title": "Trigger emotional responses",
      "content": "Trigger emotional responses It doesn’t matter if they’re good or bad emotions—just give her something to react to. You might playfully talk trash about her favorite movie or share a hot take about a popular food she likes being gross. You can also trigger emotional responses by flirting with her or telling her a really goofy joke at an unexpected or inappropriate time. [9] X Research source The goal here is to generate memories. By creating emotional responses, she’ll have a much more vivid recollection of you when you two aren’t together. This will keep you on her mind. As an example, if you two are watching a comedy and she laughs at something, you might playfully poke fun at her laugh and stop as soon as she gets a little riled up or her cheeks turn red. Then, you could randomly compliment her outfit during a quiet part of the movie to pull her in the other direction."

      "title": "Challenge her power",
      "content": "Challenge her power With the scrambler technique, the worst thing you can do is simp for her . Do not put her on a pedestal or act like she’s doing you a favor by hanging out with you. Women are attracted to confidence and self-assurance, so don’t bend over backwards for her or go out of your way to accommodate her. Just treat her like an equal. [10] X Research source For example, if she asks you to drive her somewhere at 10 pm, don’t hesitate to tell her you’re in bed and can’t help her out. Be kind . Just don’t be so kind that it ends up giving her the impression that you’re easy to walk over."

      "content": "The scrambler technique relies on a misunderstanding of psychology. It is true that people are more likely to be attracted to someone if they pique their curiosity and they appear confident. [11] X Research source However, the scrambler technique also encourages people to be misleading, inauthentic, and intentionally uninterested, none of which will make you an attractive romantic partner. [12] X Research source The scrambler technique wasn’t invented by psychologists, scientists, or even dating experts. It was just two normal guys who had a hunch that women respond well to uncertainty. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "The scrambler technique probably hurts your pursuit of a partner. There’s not even a little bit of truth to the adage that nice guys finish last. [14] X Research source Believe it or not, women like it when people are nice to them. The scrambler technique encourages emotionally messy behavior that can come off as cruel or disinterested, so it’s unlikely to win you any points with potential partners. [15] X Research source This makes intuitive sense when you think about it. People like people who make them feel good. Even if a girl is occasionally intrigued by a bad boy, she’s not going to want a partner who doesn’t treat her with kindness and respect."

      "title": "The scrambler technique will probably attract women you don’t like.",
      "content": "The scrambler technique will probably attract women you don’t like. Study after study confirms that you’re extremely likely to end up in relationships with people who are like you. If you’re an introvert, you’ll be attracted to other introverts, for example. The scrambler technique encourages you to be flighty, closed off, and deceptive—qualities that probably aren’t very desirable to you. If the technique does work, it’s unlikely to yield results you’re happy about. [16] X Research source As a fascinating little note, this principle applies to physical traits, too. If you’re tall, you’re likely to be naturally attracted to other tall people, for example."

      "content": "The scrambler technique encourages you to be kind of mean. It’s good to be kind to people. The scrambler technique requires you to be occasionally evasive and mean. This goes against the foundation of any healthy relationship . You cannot build a productive bond with someone if you’re not being fair to them by showing them basic kindness. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "The scrambler technique objectifies women.",
      "content": "The scrambler technique objectifies women. Women are not prey that need to be hunted down with your fancy seduction techniques. The scrambler technique is based on this premise that women can be deceived or convinced to be interested in you based on social hacks and trickery. This isn’t a particularly healthy or productive way to think about women. [18] X Research source The reality is that women are just like men when it comes to relationships. They want to be appreciated and respected ."

    {
      "title": "The scrambler technique requires you to be inauthentic.",
      "content": "The scrambler technique requires you to be inauthentic. If you started dating a girl and her personality radically changed after you slept together, you’d be reasonably upset. It’s unfair to hide who you really are when you’re courting someone, since you aren’t giving them an accurate picture of who you really are. [19] X Research source Just be yourself when you’re trying to date someone. You want your future girlfriend to like you for who you really are."
