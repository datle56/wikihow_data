      "content": "He threatens to dump you on a regular basis. If your boyfriend threatens to call it quits constantly, or says he'll break up with you to scare or control you, it's not a good sign. You should feel secure in your relationship, not afraid that he’s going to bail every time there’s an issue. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "He criticizes you, even in front of other people. Your partner should support and uplift you, not put you down. If he has a lot of bad things to say about you and doesn’t mind saying them in front of other people, it shows that he doesn’t respect or care for you. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "He blames you even when things aren’t your fault. Both people in a relationship should take responsibility for their own words and behavior. If your boyfriend always acts like everything is your fault, especially when it’s not, he’s probably just looking for a scapegoat. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "He doesn’t talk about the future with you.",
      "content": "He doesn’t talk about the future with you. If your boyfriend doesn’t want to make plans for weeks or months down the road, he probably doesn’t plan on being around then. Similarly, if he clams up any time you bring up commitments, whether they’re holiday plans or your desire to have kids, it’s a sign that he’s not interested in being together long-term.

      "content": "He doesn’t spend time with you or show that he cares. If you have a healthy relationship, you're probably friends with your boyfriend. You do things together and demonstrate your love and affection for each other. However, if each of you does your own thing and you rarely hang out and enjoy each other’s company, he probably isn't feeling you as much as he once was. [5] X Research source If he forgets your birthday or anniversary, it's a sign he might not be that invested in the relationship."

      "content": "He doesn’t want to be affectionate or intimate. When was the last time you held hands or cuddled? If it’s been a while since you two were affectionate or intimate, that’s a sign that your relationship is in trouble. [6] X Research source"

[7] X Research source You don’t deserve to be treated like this, and the best thing you can do is to dump the jerk! One instance of infidelity doesn’t necessarily mean you have to call it quits. But, it’s going to take some serious work to rebuild trust in him and repair your relationship."

      "content": "He is violent or abusive. It’s never okay for your boyfriend to put his hands on you! If he is physically aggressive or restrains or hurts you (shoves, hits, slaps, kicks, or chokes you, for example), you need to get out of the relationship now. We know this is a really scary situation, but the best thing you can do is leave. [8] X Research source Emotional abuse isn't acceptable, either. If your boyfriend is controlling, tries to manipulate you, frequently gives you the silent treatment or stonewalls you, or gaslights you, it's time to get out of the relationship.

If your man is under a lot of stress at school or work or is dealing with family issues, he might not be treating you badly on purpose. [10] X Research source You still need to talk to him and address what’s going on, but your relationship is probably saveable. Try approaching him when he’s in a decent mood. You might say something like, “I know you’ve been really stressed out about his merger and it’s really important to you. I feel like that stress is interfering with our relationship, though, and I want to talk about how we can make things better.” Hopefully, he’ll realize the error of his ways!"

If you forget plans you made together or don't return his calls or texts, he probably doesn't feel like he's important in your life. If you want things to get better, make him a priority and show how much you really care. [12] X Research source You could bring this up by saying something like, “I know I’ve been really busy with work lately and haven’t had a lot of time for you. I’m sorry.
