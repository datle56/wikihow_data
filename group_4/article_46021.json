      "content": "Select a type of enamel paint. Choose an enamel paint specifically made for stoves to ensure it is properly heat-resistant. Oil-based enamel paints can take between 8 and 24 hours to dry fully. Water-based enamels feel dry to the touch in an hour but may take up to a month to fully set, so unless you don't need to touch or use your stove for a while, select an oil-based variety. [1] X Research source Enamel paints are designed to last longer than other types of paint, and they withstand abrasion very well, which is why they're ideal for using on a stove. These days, most enamels are water-based, although you may still find some oil-based enamel paints available. [2] X Expert Source Andres Matheu Commercial Painter Expert Interview. 28 July 2020."

      "content": "Choose your application method. Enamel paint can be applied with rolls or brushes or by spray painting it onto the surface. Choosing paint you can brush on allows you to customize the color, as it can be mixed to your liking, as well as the finish (e.g., glossy or matte). If you choose spray paint, you'll have to pick from the colors available in the store unless you use a sprayer with the right gun tip, which will enable you to mix colors."

      "title": "Unplug and move your stove.",
      "content": "Unplug and move your stove. Unplug your stove from the outlet and move it to an area where it'll be easy to access all sides of the appliance. You may want to use masking tape to keep the oven door closed while moving the appliance. Lay down a drop cloth before moving the stove to this area to prevent paint drips or splashes from ruining your floor. Make sure your stove is completely cooled if you have used it recently before beginning to paint. If you have a gas stove, make sure that you turn off the gas and unhook it safely."

Dip a rag in a mixture of mild soap, degreaser, and warm water and scrub the surface of the stove. You can also use mineral spirits to remove stuck-on food or oil. [3] X Research source Before you paint any surface, it has to be completely free of any grease, dust, or dirt. Otherwise, the paint may not adhere properly.

Since you'll likely want to paint the stove inside your kitchen, open several windows and place a fan near a window to draw the fumes outside. [6] X Research source If possible, paint your stove outdoors so that the fumes can easily dissipate."

[7] X Expert Source Andres Matheu Commercial Painter Expert Interview. 28 July 2020. You can use 150-grit sandpaper or steel wool to get rid of rust and paint on the appliance. This is an essential step, and if you skip it, your paint job will likely not come out smoothly and cleanly. [8] X Research source You don't need to remove all the paint, you just need to scuff up the surface enough to remove the smooth finish. Wipe the stove down with mineral spirits after each sanding."

Use long, straight strokes to apply a thin coat. Be sure to allow each coat to dry before adding another coat. Two thin coats will ensure an even surface and appearance, while one heavy coat may peel off. [10] X Research source Hold the spray can 12-18 inches (30-46 cm) from the surface.
