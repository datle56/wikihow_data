You will need to appropriate device, of course. Almost all computers and laptops can handle DVDs now, and many can handle Blu-Ray without a hiccup. Most video game systems, too, can play Blu-Ray/DVD. If in doubt, check your players specifics and look for the appropriate designation (DVD, HDDVD, Blu-Ray, etc.) right on the disc. Most computers simply need a program to play DVDs . If one doesn't come with the computer, as it usually does, look up \"DVD Playback Program\" online."

      "content": "Search for an illegal stream of a movie. These streams are illegal to put up on the internet, but not strictly illegal to watch. That is, as long as you don't download the file or show it to many people. Streaming is what YouTube does -- showing you a copy of the video without having to download it. [2] X Research source While this is oversimplifying things a bit, the key point is that you won't get in trouble for streaming, though the website owners might. If that doesn't bother you, simply search online for \"[Your Movie] + Free stream.\" Even first-run movies are often uploaded, though the quality can be suspect. Since the sites get taken down often, you may have to do some digging to find your movie. Only click on the triangular \"Play\" button or the \"Close to Watch Movie\" buttons on these sites. Many pop-up ads are meant to trick you with fake \"Download/Play\" buttons and special offers to view the movie on another site."

You can write down anything that comes to mind, though many critics like to have small sections for the key subjects like \"writing,\" \"acting,\" and \"directing.\" No matter your style, taking notes as you watch will make it infinitely easier to write and talk about the movie later on. Don't worry about what to take notes on at first. Simply write out everything that comes to mind now, then work on shaping the review or writing later on."

      "content": "Focus your viewing on the connection between form and function. Form is how a movie is shot -- the lighting, scenery, sound effects, etc. Function is the story being told -- what information is the form trying to convey. The best movies merge these seamlessly. Think about Citizen Kane, whose message on the endless march of time and memory is bolstered by watery cuts, low, dramatic/weird angles, and flashbacks. Every aspect of the movie helps tell the story. If you hit pause, what does this \"photograph\" tell you? What is the mood? How is the shot designed to be interesting (or not) even when the movie is paused? What do you think is the theme or point of the movie? What evidence do you have to back it up? Are there any original or weird artistic choices throughout the movie? Why do you think the director chose to use something unique or different in the movie?"

      "content": "Take a few minutes in the movie to focus on each aspect of production. Movies are enormous, collaborative efforts. Each department, even the small ones, must work together to make the entire movie a reality. As such, good critics and movie watchers take time to point out all of the parts of a movie, not just the obvious ones like acting and directing. When watching, take a few notes on: Production Design: What do the sets look like? How were props and scenery chosen, and how do they add or subtract from the movie? Sound and Music: This is easy to see when movies get it wrong, but ask yourself how the best movies get it right. Amazing sound effects and music pull you seamlessly into the picture. Editing: When are long takes used? What about short, choppy editing, where the image changes 2-3 times a second? Each time an editor cuts, it is to give you new information -- are they succeeding?"

      "content": "Consider your own opinion, but be ready to back it up. How you feel about a movie may be the most important, but most neglected, part of any early review. Your opinions are important -- you just need to find ways to back them up with facts. Whenever you have a gut feeling about something -- \"that actor ruined his lines,\" \"the cinematography was incredible,\" \"the movie was 30 minutes too long\" -- don't just dismiss it as a personal preference. Find a way to support your opinion with fact: \"That actor ruined his lines.\" Maybe he made too much of a joke out of serious lines. Perhaps he didn't change his facial expressions, he seemed uncomfortable or out of place, etc. \"The cinematography was incredible.\" Talk about the lighting in certain scene. Find unique camera angles, or how several key shots commanded your attention. \"The movie was 30 minutes too long.\" Think about the scenes or sections you would cut. Consider the part of the movie that should have been highlighted instead, or why you wanted a certain ending instead of the one presented."

      "content": "Read up on the film's background. Movies are not made in a vacuum. They are based on true stories, have complicated creation tales, and interact with current events. While reviews should focus on the films themselves, good critics tap into the real-life context of a movie. Is this movie making some sort of commentary on current or historical events? Look up the director's, writer's, and cinematographer's other movies. How does this one relate to the other? [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Read the script along with the movie, or before watching. The script is the blueprint of any film. That said, a filmmaker's job is to turn words on a page into a story with cinematography, sound, lighting, actors, costumes, and much more. A director starts with only the script as well. They try to find the best way to keep the spirit of the words intact (funny, politically-charged, dramatic, etc.) while still telling a unique story. When reading the script, think about: How would you set up a scene? What kind of props, lighting, and music would you use in the background? What is the key image or idea of the screenplay? How would you show it on film? What sort of tone would fit the dialogue? Fast, bright, and witty, or slow and dramatic? Are there places the movie breaks from the script? Would you have made the same choices?"

At what point do you start to see things from the villain's point of view? Films have to fit in a small time frame, usually under three hours, and thus have developed a rhythm that you need to tap into as a director. Try to keep track of the push and pull of emotions in a good movie. How does timing make or break key moments, like big joke or climactic emotional catharsis? [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Think about how editing choices move the movie along. The easiest way to do this is to ask, \"what did that scene or shot accomplish?\" As a filmmaker, this is your fundamental question -- how do you make the images on screen meaningful? The easiest way to do that is to make sure that the audience is in a different place at the end of a scene or shot as when the begun. When watching great movies, try and find out the motivation between cuts and scenes that may seem unnecessary. There is no right answer here-- you're just trying to see other filmmakers in action. Even if you don't think a scene is useful, can you see why the director might think it is important?"

You already know the main action. You might see clues and bits of clever foreshadowing now that you know the ending. You can catch how certain shots were set up or filmed without focusing on the acting skills. You haven't watched the movie until you've re-watched it. [6] X Research source"

When you're on set trying to mimic that incredible dolly shot in The Shining, don't just describe it to your camera crew. Show them the shot in action. Just like great writers hold on to quotes and ideas in journals, you should \"quote\" and record great movies."
