      "content": "Check the femoral artery. You can check your cat’s pulse by placing your two fingers on the femoral artery, which is on the inside of the cat’s thigh, near its groin. You can feel for it in the natural divot created by the thigh muscles, right in the middle of the leg along the bone. Put some pressure on that area and wait for 15 seconds. If the cat is alive, you should feel a pulse. Use a watch or clock with a minute hand to count the number of beats you hear for 15 seconds. Then multiply by 4. This will give you the number of beats per minute. The cat’s normal, healthy pulse should be between 140 and 220 beats per minute. Check a few times, relocating your two fingers to different areas in the inner thigh. Sometimes it can take a few tries to find the pulse."
