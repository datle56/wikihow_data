      "content": "Learn basic breakdancing terminology. A breakdance routine is compiled of three basic types of moves: top rocks, footwork, and freezes. Learn the basic terminology, and how these moves fit into your typical breakdance routine. Top rocks incorporate the top half of your body. You would use your arms, hands, elbows, and chest when performing top rocks moves. Top rocks are used as an introduction to a breakdancing routine. You would start off your routine by engaging in some top rocks before moving on to more advanced moves. Footwork involves moving with the lower half of your body. This involves using your feet, legs, and hips to dance. Footwork usually looks far more complex than top rocks, so you would transition into footwork later in a dance routine. Freezes are an important aspect of a breakdancing routine. If you think of breakdancing as a work of prose, freezes are the periods at the end of each sentence. When you finish one move in breakdancing, you should do a freeze. This means temporarily stopping movement before moving on to a second move."

      "content": "Try a basic three step. One of the easiest form of footwork in breakdancing is a three step. You can use a three step to transition into many more complex moves down the road. If you're starting out as a breakdancer, learn the three step first. Start off in a crab walk position. This means you place your arms behind you and your legs in front of you, bending your legs at the knees. Lift your body slightly off the ground. [1] X Research source Move one foot forward, keeping the other leg down and supporting your body. Pull the leg that's down inside your body, using this leg to change your position. You should be standing on all fours, with your hands and feet on the ground. This is similar to the position you would be in to do a push-up, but your body is raised higher off the ground. [2] X Research source Now, you can begin your three steps. Take your left leg and kick it out to your side, so you're supporting your weight with your right leg and arms. This is step one. Then, switch which leg is stretched out. Pull your left leg back up to the knee and kick out your right leg. This is step two. Then, move your right leg back under your body, returning to the push-up position you were in earlier. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn the coffee grinder. A coffee grinder is another basic footwork move. It's also known as the helicopter or propeller. In this move, you'll spin around while crouching near the ground. The coffee grinder is a very common move in breakdancing routines. To start, crouch near the ground. If you've ever done crunches as part of a workout routine, this is the position you would be in at the bottom of a crunch. Then, swing your right leg out to your side, stretching your leg as far as you comfortably can. [4] X Research source Then, swing your right leg around to the front of your body. Keep your hands on the ground to keep movement steady, bringing your right hand up briefly to let your right leg through. Keep swinging your right leg until it's on the left side of your body. You will also have to bring your left hand up and down to let your right leg through. [5] X Research source Then, hop slightly with your left foot and pass your right leg under your left foot. Return to the original crunch position. You can repeat this spinning process until you feel comfortable with it. Try to increase your speed as people will be impressed if you're able to do the coffee grinder at a fast pace. You should also switch directions on occasion, spinning with your left leg instead.

As freeze moves are important to breakdancing, you should learn a basic freeze when starting out. The baby freeze is a common breakdancing freeze you can incorporate into any routine. This freeze involves elevating your body off the ground slightly. To start, get on your hands and knees. Press your right elbow against your right hip, bending your arm at a 90 degree angle. Reach your left hand out in front of you. [8] X Research source Lean forward and kick your legs up, transferring your weight to your hands and shoulders. Hold for a few seconds. [9] X Research source It can take awhile to get the baby freeze right, especially if you lack upper body strength. Do not worry if it takes you a few tries before you balance successfully. You may also have to work on building your upper body strength before you can do a baby freeze."

      "content": "Do a six step. A six step is a variation on the three step. Once you've mastered the three step, try incorporating a six step into your routine. You start off the six step somewhat similar to how you began the coffee grinder. Get into a crouching position. Take your right leg and loop it around your body, stopping when your right leg touches your left foot. Then, lean back with your right side and catch your weight with your right hand. [10] X Research source Now, stretch your left leg back diagonally. As you do this, place your hands forward, transferring your weight to your hands. You'll be in a position similar to the position you'd get in to do a push-up. However, your right leg would be turned inward slightly, weight resting on your knees. Stretch your right foot out at a diagonal angle, so you're in a normal push-up position. [11] X Research source Bring your left foot to where your right hand is on the ground. Raise your right hand in the air, moving your left hip into the air. Then, bring your right foot behind your knee. You should now be crouching, with your left hand on the ground and your legs crossed. [12] X Research source To complete the move, uncross your legs and return to the original starting position.

      "title": "Use baby freeze as a transition.",
      "content": "Use baby freeze as a transition. Now that you know some basic moves, you can start formulating a basic breakdancing routine. To start, learn how baby freeze can be used as a transition move. Transition moves are important in that they allow you to move from one breakdancing move to another. The baby freeze, which you already know, is often used as a transition move. If you're moving between, say, a three-step and into a coffee grinder, you can do the baby freeze in between. This alerts viewers you've ended one move and will be trying a new one. [14] X Research source When moving out of something like coffee grinder, you would return to the crouching position. You would then bend your right arm into a 90 degree angle and press it into your hip. Then, you could stretch out your other arm and elevate your legs. You are now in baby freeze. Hold for a few seconds. [15] X Research source If you're engaging in top rocks, which we will go over next, you can simply drop to the floor and quickly get into the baby freeze position. Moving into baby freeze after top rocks can be a great transition between footwork and top rocks. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Start off with top rocks.",
      "content": "Start off with top rocks. Top rocks are hand moves that usually begin a breakdancing routine. Top rocks are simpler than footwork and serve as a signal to viewers you are about to start breakdancing. Learn some simple top rocks to begin your routine. A basic beginning top rock involves standing with your feet hip-length apart. Move your arms and legs in sync. Step your left toe to your right side, waving your arms at the same pace. Then, return to the original position. Repeat with your right toe. After you feel comfortable with this move, speed it up and bounce slightly with your legs. Try to bounce to the rhythm of any music that's playing when breakdancing in public. [17] X Research source You can also try a heel-to-toe step. To start, get in the same opening stance as the beginning. Kick your right foot out onto your heel and then flatten your foot and bend your knees slightly. Move your left foot out, resting your weight on your toe. Then, kick your left foot forward onto your left heel. Bend your knees slightly. Then, step out with your right foot and repeat the process. As with the first move, do this quicker and move to the beat. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a simple formula. When you're beginning to breakdance, keep your routines simple. As you become more proficient in breakdancing, you can try longer routines with more complex moves. To start, try the two different form of top rocks we went over earlier. Try to do them at a fast pace, moving in time with the music. Then, fall to the ground and move into baby freeze. Hold for a few seconds before engaging in footwork. [19] X Research source For beginners, a recommended routine is two footwork patterns, baby freeze, and then some light freestyle moves. This means you simply go from one breakdancing move to the next, without transitioning in between. [20] X Research source To put it all together, you could start off with the two top rocks moves. Then, fall into baby freeze for a few seconds. Transition into the three step, baby freeze in between, and then do a coffee grinder. Baby freeze again, and then freestyle some more footwork. You could, for example, do a handful of six steps."

At first, you should only engage in strength training 2 to 3 times a week. Never strength train two days in a row. There is a basic exercise you can do to build strength specifically for breakdancing moves. Start off in a squatting position. Then, lean back on your right side and catch yourself with your right hand. Then, repeat this move on your left hand. Make sure to use the full palms of your hand when catching yourself, and not just your fingertips. [21] X Research source"
