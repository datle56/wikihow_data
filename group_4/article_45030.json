      "title": "Use an electronic tuner or a tuning app to tune your trumpet.",
      "content": "Use an electronic tuner or a tuning app to tune your trumpet. A tuner will help you recognize flat or sharp notes and adjust them as needed. Depending on your preferences, you can either use an electronic tuner or download a tuning app on your phone. [1] X Research source As you practice tuning your trumpet, you may develop an ear for what does or doesn't sound right over time. To make sure you have the right notes, however, a tuner is always a useful tool. You can buy tuners online or from most music stores. A basic tuner will do—you do not need to purchase specialty tuners for trumpets."

      "title": "Locate your trumpet's tuning slide.",
      "content": "Locate your trumpet's tuning slide. The tuning slide allows you to adjust your trumpet's sound. The tuning slide is located directly below the trumpet's bell and is shaped like a large, metal loop. [2] X Research source If you're unsure where your tuning slide is, ask a music instructor or a fellow musician for help."

    {
      "title": "Set your tuner to a C note.",
      "content": "Set your tuner to a C note. Although you can play any note to check the trumpet's tune, the C note is the simplest note to play and the easiest to check. Adjust your tuning app or tuner to C to make sure it analyzes the right note. [3] X Research source If you're not sure how to adjust the tuner's note, check its directions or contact its manufacturers, if needed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play",
      "content": "Play a C note on your trumpet and check its tune. To play a C note, blow on your trumpet without holding any of the valves (also called finger buttons) down. After blowing, check the tuner's readings—if it says your trumpet is too sharp or flat, you may need to adjust it. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Adjust the note as needed using the slide.",
      "content": "Adjust the note as needed using the slide. If your note is flat or sharp according to the tuner, you can easily adjust the sound. Pull the slider in to make the sound sharper, or pull it out to make it flatter. [5] X Research source Instead of saying flat or sharp, your tuner may use the symbols \"♯\" or \"♭.\" The first stands for sharp and the latter for flat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play the C note again and check your tuner readings.",
      "content": "Play the C note again and check your tuner readings. After adjusting the trumpet's sound using the tuning slide, play the C note again. Check the note on your tuner again and, based on the readings, pull the tuning slide in or out again as needed. [6] X Research source If you want, you can repeat this process with several other notes to make sure the trumpet is in tune, though this is not necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean",
      "content": "Clean your trumpet regularly. Cleaning your trumpet will keep it in good condition and prevent it from breaking or getting out of tune. At least once a month, disassemble your trumpet and wash off the pieces using a warm washcloth. Then, use a polishing cloth to dry the trumpet and give it an added shine. [7] X Research source Drying your trumpet after washing it will prevent rusting to keep your trumpet's sound clear."

      "title": "Test the tuning slide for suction while cleaning it.",
      "content": "Test the tuning slide for suction while cleaning it. Disassemble your trumpet and block one end of the tuning slide with your fingers. Suck on the other end of the trumpet to check for suction—if you notice any air leaking out of the tuning slide, your tuning slide may be broken or dented. A broken tuning slide can seriously affect your trumpet's tone. If you think your tuning slide is broken, hire a music shop or instrument repair service to inspect it for damage and make the necessary repairs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grease the tuning slide once a month.",
      "content": "Grease the tuning slide once a month. Remove the tuning slide from the trumpet and apply a thin coat of tuning grease around the exterior. Spread the tuning grease around with your fingers until the coat is even, then wipe off any excess grease with a washcloth. When you're done, place the tuning slide back on the trumpet. [8] X Research source You can buy tuning grease online or from most music stores. If you cannot find tuning grease, you can use petroleum jelly as a substitute. The coat should be thick enough that you can feel it with your fingers, yet thin enough that it stays transparent."

    {
      "title": "Avoid placing your trumpet in hot or cold environments.",
      "content": "Avoid placing your trumpet in hot or cold environments. Extreme temperatures can warp your trumpet's pitch and intonation, requiring it to be tuned more often. To prevent a frequent need for tuning, store your trumpet in a room-temperature environment and keep it away from extremely hot, cold, or humid climates. Cold weather tends to make trumpets go flat while hot weather tends to make them go sharp."
