It’ll also give your hair volume and make your hair easier to style. Many styling mousses will also protect your hair from the heat in your styling tools, which can cause damage.

      "content": "Dry your hair roughly while combing it with your fingers. If you have fine hair, dry it until it is about 80% dry. If you have coarse hair, dry it until it is 50% dry. When you’ve finished rough drying, let your hair air dry completely before using a curling iron. Finger-combing your hair while rough drying will help prevent tangles. [2] X Research source Start with your blow dryer’s medium or low heat setting to prevent damage to your hair."

If your hair is color-treated or processed, you’ll want to use lower heat to avoid damaging your strands or ruining your hair color. Thick or textured hair can withstand higher temperatures. [3] X Research source Use lower heat if you have fine or dyed hair. Lower heat won’t ruin your hair color or cause breakage. Use higher heat if you have thick or textured hair. If the temperature is too low, the curling iron won’t create curls."

For sections of hair around your face, wrap strands around the curling iron away from your face or shape your curls away from your face. If you wrap your hair towards your face, your hair will curl inward and cover your face. [5] X Research source You can use a curling iron, curling wand, or a flat iron to curl your hair. If you’re using a curling iron , you can wrap your hair around the barrel without using the clamp, similar to using a curling wand . Or you can use the curling iron clamp to help keep your hair in place. For larger curls, you can wrap 2 in (5.1 cm) sections of hair around your iron."

At 5 seconds, tap the section of your hair wrapped around your iron or wand. If it feels very hot, release it from the iron.

If you have bangs, finger brush them with pomade last. Doing them last ensures you don’t use too much pomade, which can weigh them down and make them look too heavy."

If you have bangs you want to keep straight, don’t braid them and let them air dry. Otherwise, you can include them in your braids. Don’t pull the sections of your hair into braids too tightly.

Check if your hair has dried by feeling different sections in your braids. If they’re still damp, give it more time to dry. If you’re short on time, blow dry your braids using medium or low heat. This could cause your hair to get frizzy. You can also let your braids air-dry overnight if you want. Use a hooded hair dryer for the best results."
