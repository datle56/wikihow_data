      "content": "Coordinate the size with your hair style. If you want to wear a fascinator with your hair slicked back, then go with a smaller one. If you’re going to wear your hair loosely pulled up, then a medium size is probably best. Wear a large fascinator if you’re wearing your hair down and in a voluminous style. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick the material based on the season. If it’s warmer outside, you’ll want to go with a fascinator that’s made of a lighter, more breathable material, such as straw. In the winter time, wear a fascinator made of a heavier, thicker material, such as wool or felt. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick a color that matches your outfit. Your fascinator will give off a more subtle, classy boldness if it looks like it belongs with the outfit you're wearing. To ensure this, wear a fascinator that’s the same color as the clothes you’re wearing. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Complement your hair color with your fascinator.",
      "content": "Complement your hair color with your fascinator. Redheads look best with a fascinator that’s an earth tone, such as beige, brown, or deep green. If you have blond hair, try wearing a light warm color like coral or a neutral like taupe. Finally, opt for bright, deep shades such as hot pink or emerald if you have brown hair.

      "content": "Get a fascinator that complements your face shape. It looks best to create a contrast between your fascinator shape and your face shape. If you have a more round face, opt for a slightly taller fascinator. If you have a longer or thinner face, a spherical or disc-shaped fascinator looks best. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid headbands and complexity if you wear glasses. Since headbands are secured behind the ears and so are glasses, those with glasses will feel more secure and comfortable wearing elastic securing fascinators. Additionally, try to keep the style of the fascinator simple to avoid looking too “busy” in combination with your glasses. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Add stability and security with a headband. If you’re wearing a big, showy fascinator, you’ll most likely need to secure it with a headband. Headband fascinators are the best for creating stability. You can even add a headband to a comb fascinator to take security a step further. [9] X Research source In addition to comb pieces and headbands, fascinators can be secured with elastic bands or hairclips."

      "content": "Wear the fascinator on the side of your head. The best place to wear a fascinator is either on the right or left side of your head. Wearing it towards the front of your head correctly is sometimes acceptable, but try wearing it on the side a few times and getting comfortable with that before going for a bolder look. [10] X Research source The fascinator should be placed just above either your right or left eyebrow. [11] X Research source"

With a fascinator, less is often more. To stay stylish, avoid oversized, elaborate styles that are distracting and overwhelming. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Stay away from rhinestone fascinators. Traditionally, fascinators include several different materials, including feathers, flowers, and lace. Stick with these and stay away from rhinestones when you’re choosing a fascinator. This adds a glitzy flair to the look that ends up looking a little too over-the-top and out of place, especially in excess. As a good rule of thumb, less detail is more. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear fascinators to formal events. Fascinators can be a great accessory to add to an outfit, but make sure that you’re wearing it to events where it’s fitting. Garden parties, tea parties, and weddings are all great places to wear a fascinator. Leave the fascinator at home if you’re attending the cinema, the symphony, or any other event that has stadium-style seating. It’s rude to block the people behind you. [15] X Research source"
