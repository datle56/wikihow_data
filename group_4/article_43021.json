      "title": "Decide whether you really like the person you would like to tell your friends about.",
      "content": "Decide whether you really like the person you would like to tell your friends about. If you don't have real feelings for them, there's no point in telling anyone. Talk to the person you like and think about how you feel. If you've liked other people before, are the feelings you're experiencing similar? Consider what it is that has made you like this person. Have you always liked them? Are you just feeling lonely? These are some important questions to think about."

      "title": "Choose which friends you would like to tell.",
      "content": "Choose which friends you would like to tell. This can be the crucial step that affects the outcome of telling your friends who you like. Make a list of your closest friends, and then eliminate the one who are most likely to gossip. Leave only the people you trust the most on your list. Who have you told secrets to before? Use past experiences to judge who you can tell things, and who you can't. Don't make anyone mad, or announce to everyone that you like someone. Some people might get offended if you don't tell them or constantly hound you with questions, so only actually tell the people that you want to. Who would tell you who they like? These people can be trustworthy."

      "title": "Find somewhere private to tell your friends.",
      "content": "Find somewhere private to tell your friends. You don't want to tell them who you like in front of other people, as they might hear or try to join in with your conversation. You could invite your friends over to your house, or go to their houses, as they are the most private places you can find without being disturbed. Do not tell anyone who you like through technology or social media unless absolutely necessary. You should always tell them in person, since screenshots can easily be taken and posted anywhere, or could be shown to anyone (including the person you like). Try to avoid telling people at school, since once again, people will expect to know what you're talking about."

    {
      "title": "Tell your friend quickly, quietly, and get to the point fast.",
      "content": "Tell your friend quickly, quietly, and get to the point fast. If you act like it's not a big deal, they will make less of a fuss about it. Don't let what anyone thinks affect your feelings. It's your life, and they can't control it. If your friends ask you questions, give them simple, short answers. Don't reveal too much information as you might seem desperate. Always make sure you don't lie to your friends, though. Stay calm and collected. When you see the person you like, make a point to talk to them or smile at them in front of your friends. That way, they won't feel the need to talk to the person themselves, which can be embarrassing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay relaxed about it.",
      "content": "Stay relaxed about it. If your friends continually ask you questions, answer them politely and don't get angry. Sometimes, people can become annoying when they're constantly asking you things. Ask them to stop, and they probably will, considering they are your trusted friend. If anyone teases you about your crush, just laugh it off. They will most likely laugh with you, which can help you to bond within your relationship."
