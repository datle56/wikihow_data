Make sure to observe your feet as you stand and as you are walking. Ask a friend or family member to watch or photograph you for further reference.

      "content": "Walk on a treadmill. It may be easiest to help correct your walk by using a treadmill. This will allow you to gradually increase your speed as your gait straightens out. Start very slowly, at around 1.0mph to allow you to make sure you are placing your feet one in front of the other and in a straight fashion. From here, you can gradually increase your speed. If you do not have access to a treadmill, walk on a flat surface, such as a paved road or sidewalk. Ask a friend or family member to go with you and walk behind you to help make sure you are walking slowly and using a straight stride. Aim to walk every day for at least a few minutes to reinforce your gait training. This can also help strengthen your legs and feet."

      "title": "Reassess your walk.",
      "content": "Reassess your walk. On a regular basis, it’s important to reassess your progress and your gait. This can help you decide whether to increase your speed in your training or see if you need to make other minor corrections to your gait. Look at how you are walking once a week or once every two weeks, which could give you sufficient time to begin noticing changes. Use a mirror to look at your gait and ask a friend to take a picture to help plot your progress. Increase your speed if you notice that you are walking straight. Make sure to only increase slightly, no more than 0.5mph. This can help minimize the risk of you falling back into old patterns because you’re walking too fast."
