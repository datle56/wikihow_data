      "content": "Figure out what your specific niche will be. Since this will be your forum, it is best to pick something in which you are interested and knowledgeable. Since there are already so many forums out there, it is best to have a defined niche. Something well-defined will help your forum get noticed by the search engines and also help attract your audience. You do not want something too general or too common in forums. You can always add a \"general chit chat\" area for any off topic business."

      "content": "Choose a forum script. There are many different forum scripts available. It is best to start with a free forum script. Make sure that it is able to move information to another forum script should you want to change later. A good free script that does allow you to transfer your information is phpBB. This is the script that many web hosts offer as part of their packages as well. When you want to change to a paid forum script, vBulletin is a good one and it comes with a migration tool for phpBB, which will allow you to easily transfer all your forum information without losing anything. If you don't have much coding experience, you can select a forum provider that includes all the framework for you (like Jcink or ProBoards)."
