      "content": "Consuming pork is prohibited by the Quran (Islam’s main religious text). Muslims can’t eat pork because it’s considered “haram” (meaning “forbidden”) by the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad. There are multiple passages in the Quran specifically disallowing Muslims from eating pork (along with other foods considered impure substances). These include: [1] X Research source Surah Al-Bagarah (2:173). “He has only forbidden you to eat carrion, blood, swine, and what is slaughtered in the name of any other than Allah. But if someone is compelled by necessity—neither driven by desire nor exceeding immediate need—they will not be sinful. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” Surah An-Nahl (16:115). “The only things which are made unlawful for you are the flesh of dead animals, blood, pork and that which is not consecrated with the Name of God.” Surah Al-An’am (6:145) . “I do not find in what has been revealed to me anything forbidden for anyone who wants to eat unless it is carrion, outpoured blood and the flesh of swine, all of which is unclean.”"

      "title": "Pork is forbidden because pigs are considered unclean animals.",
      "content": "Pork is forbidden because pigs are considered unclean animals. Islam’s dietary laws are designed to encourage spiritual and physical health. Because pigs are scavengers and omnivores that eat just about anything they can find (and live in filth), they're \"unclean.\" So, the Islamic religion considers pork impure—harmful to your body and soul. It's forbidden on the grounds of preserving one's purity and spiritual growth. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Abstaining from pork is a form of religious worship.",
      "content": "Abstaining from pork is a form of religious worship. Spiritually, giving up pork is one way that Muslims obey the commands of their religion and, therefore, demonstrate their devotion to Allah and His will. Essentially, it allows Muslims to show commitment to their faith—which is why abstaining from pork is so significant. [3] X Research source The idea that Muslims don’t eat pork solely for health reasons is a misconception. There’s a clear spiritual component to it as well! It’s also important to remember that Muslims aren’t trying to alienate themselves from other cultures by abstaining from pork; they’re doing it out of religious devotion."

      "title": "Scientifically, pork poses more health risks than other meats.",
      "content": "Scientifically, pork poses more health risks than other meats. Improperly cooked pork can cause some health issues due to parasites and disease. For example, pork is more prone to carrying the Trichinella worm, which can cause Trichinosis. Pork liver is also the top food-based transmitter of hepatitis E. So, although pork is easier to keep clean by today’s modern methods, it’s still forbidden as a way to maintain personal health. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep in mind that when the Quran was originally written, it was likely considered more risky to eat pork (because the meat was harder to keep clean). Thus, pork is forbidden because of Islam’s dedication to ensuring its followers’ health and longevity."

      "title": "Muslims who eat pork may repent and ask Allah for forgiveness.",
      "content": "Muslims who eat pork may repent and ask Allah for forgiveness. As mentioned in the Quran excerpts above, a Muslim who accidentally eats pork won’t be held accountable for it as long as they repent and seek forgiveness since they weren’t trying to disobey Allah or the Quran’s teachings. However, purposefully eating pork and disobeying the Quran is considered more serious. [5] X Research source It’s believed that continually eating forbidden foods like pork can lead to estrangement from Allah and gradual spiritual corruption. Thus, Muslims are typically expected to follow Islam’s dietary laws to the letter."

      "title": "Islamic dietary laws are called “halal,” which means lawful.",
      "content": "Islamic dietary laws are called “halal,” which means lawful. Thus, halal dictates what Muslims can eat and drink, while haram specifies foods that are forbidden (like pork). Some countries with a Muslim majority have halal certification systems to guarantee that food products meet the necessary requirements. Halal also dictates how animals are slaughtered: a practice called Zabiha, intended to minimize the animal’s pain. [6] X Research source Although pork is forbidden, cow, sheep, lamb, poultry, and fish meat are all allowed. Islamic halal also advocates adding fresh fruit, vegetables, nuts, and seeds to your diet. In Islam, healthy living and a nutritious diet are considered highly important, which is why halal and haram are designed to keep Muslims from eating anything considered harmful."

      "title": "Many Muslims must take care to find halal-certified food.",
      "content": "Many Muslims must take care to find halal-certified food. Non-Muslim majority countries don’t have an official system for halal-certified foods, which can make it difficult for Muslims to follow their dietary laws. Muslims often stick to specific halal-certified products to maintain their diet; they may also opt for vegetarian or vegan options and eat out only at halal restaurants. [7] X Research source For example, at parties and other gatherings, Muslims need to be careful and make sure that anything they eat is halal—which can affect which events they go to. By being aware of their dietary needs, non-Muslims can better understand their Muslim friends and acquaintances—and, as a result, be more inclusive in terms of the food they serve at events."

      "title": "Muslims are permitted to eat non-halal food if there are no alternatives.",
      "content": "Muslims are permitted to eat non-halal food if there are no alternatives. Islamic dietary laws do contain exceptions; they specify that when halal food isn’t available, it’s okay to eat food that isn’t usually permitted or considered “pure.” If a Muslim eats non-halal food, however, it must be out of necessity for the sake of their health.

      "content": "Judaism In the Torah (the central Jewish religious text), Leviticus contains a list of animals that can be consumed. Leviticus 11:3 clarified that animals with divided hooves that chew their cud can be eaten, including cows, sheep, and deer. Because they don’t chew their cud, pigs (and pork) are forbidden to Jewish people. [9] X Research source This is also stated in Deuteronomy 14:8 . “And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.” Judaism and Islam are both Abrahamic religions, and their shared ban on pork may be influenced by the health issues caused by pork in ancient times."

Pork isn’t forbidden to most Christians; however, Seventh-day Adventists don’t consume pork, as well as the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Church. Seventh-day Adventists consider pork and other foods forbidden under Judaism to be unclean. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Ancient cultures There are several ancient cultures in which pork was either not consumed or not allowed in certain circumstances—including areas of ancient Iran and Lebanon. Greek historian Herodotus reported that Scythians had a taboo against pigs and didn’t offer them as sacrifices or keep them at all. Similarly, in Tyre (Lebanon), pork wasn’t allowed in the temple of the deity Melqart. [11] X Research source Scotland (particularly Scottish Highlanders) also had an aversion to pork—possibly stemming from an ancient taboo (although the exact source of the pork aversion is disputed). However, Scottish prejudice against pork began fading by 1800."
