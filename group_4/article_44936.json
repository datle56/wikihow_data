Take a 1 inch (2.5 cm) section of your hair and hold it in one hand. [1] X Research source It’s usually best to start on one side of your head so that you don’t get the sections of hair mixed up as you go along. If your hair is super thick, you might take a smaller section, and if it’s very thin, you might take a larger section. If you have very curly hair, it may be better to trim each curl individually rather than sectioning your hair."

      "content": "Trim the split ends that are sticking out of the twisted section. Examine the ends that are sticking out of the twist—most of them will likely be split ends. Use a pair of hair cutting shears to snip off about .2 inches (0.51 cm) of each split end. Start at the top of the strand and go down so you don’t miss any. [3] X Research source If you have shorter hair that’s more difficult to see, use a mirror when cutting off the split ends. Keep in mind that this will result in your hair being varied lengths."

To reach even more split ends, undo the twist you just formed, then start twisting it the opposite way—this will help reveal split ends that didn’t appear during the first twist. Use the cutting shears to snip off these split ends, as well. [4] X Research source For example, if you twisted the strand of hair clockwise first, twist it counterclockwise the second time."

      "content": "Style your hair so that it’s straight and dry. If you already have naturally straight hair, all you’ll need to do is brush through it thoroughly. If you have wavy or curly hair, it’s usually best to straighten it and brush it so that the split ends will pop up more easily. Make sure your hair is completely dry so that it’s less likely to break. [6] X Research source If your hair is wavy, you may only need to blow dry your hair instead of using a straightener. If you’re using a hair straightener, remember to apply a heat protectant to avoid even more split ends! Note: This method can be tricky if you don’t have experience doing hair. It may be better to have a professional hair stylist dust your hair."

[20] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you're using the blow dryer, put it on the lowest setting to cause less damage. To help further prevent split ends , always apply a heat protectant to your hair before using a heat tool. Tran says, “If you find a lot of split ends, maybe you’re using too high of a heat setting when you’re styling your hair, or you’re not using enough protection. I always start off with a primer for my hair. It helps style the hair, but it also has heat protection for when I style with any heat item."

Even if you’re trying to grow your hair , getting the ends trimmed every couple of months or so will greatly reduce the likelihood of damaged hair. [24] X Research source If you chemically treat your hair, then it's especially important that you get regular trims. Tran says when we get split ends with longer hair, “There’s always this thing about, ‘Oh, I’m not going to get a haircut if I’m growing my hair out.’ But if you don’t get those split ends cut, over time they go higher and higher. Now you have to cut off [more hair] because the split ends are so high.”"

      "content": "Split ends refer to when the hair shaft splits into multiple sections. Split ends often resemble a “Y” shape, though they may also have multiple splits, like a tree branch. They occur when the hair’s protective outer layer becomes damaged, causing the inner layer to unravel and become brittle. Some common causes include heat or chemical damage, excessive friction, or environmental factors like sun exposure. [25] X Research source Tran says, “Unfortunately, everyone gets split ends. It’s just the amount of split ends you get that is a little different from person to person. Preventing them depends on your lifestyle. Your hair is a living thing, so you have to be gentle with it.”"
