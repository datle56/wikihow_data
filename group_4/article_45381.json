      "title": "Lift the grate covering your drain with a screwdriver.",
      "content": "Lift the grate covering your drain with a screwdriver. If there are screws or fasteners holding the drain in place, remove them with the appropriate screwdriver. Otherwise, stick the end of a flathead screwdriver in between the openings of the grate. Bend the screwdriver back to pry the grate away from the drain. Set the grate aside while working inside your drain. Put on elbow-length rubber gloves before you begin if you’d like to keep your hands and arms clean. If the drain has a solid top, pry it up from the edge instead. If the grate is heavy, you may need to use a grate hook (aka a drain key) to lift it. Slip the end of the hook under the grate and lift it up."

      "title": "Remove the blockage from your drain by hand if you can see it.",
      "content": "Remove the blockage from your drain by hand if you can see it. If your hands fit inside of the drain and you notice any obstructions, reach into the water and see if you can break apart the clog. Scoop out any debris and throw it away in a trash can. Keep scooping out the clog until you can’t pick up anymore. [1] X Research source Leaves, twigs, and bits of trash are all easy to remove by hand. If the blockage is just barely out of sight or you don’t want to get your hands dirty, use a bent wire hanger to grab whatever is blocking your drain."

    {
      "title": "Use a drain auger",
      "content": "Use a drain auger to break apart clogs you can’t reach. Drain augers (aka snakes, or drain rods) are long flexible plumbing tools used to break apart blockages deep within the pipes. Feed the end of the auger into your drain, using short bursts to force it further down. Once the rod is in the drain pipe, spin it clockwise to break apart the clog. [2] X Research source If there’s a solid obstruction, pull out the rod and use the corkscrew attachment instead of the plunger. If you find branches or clumps of dirt, don’t be alarmed—that’s typical for exterior drains. Stuff just pours in over time, it doesn’t mean the drain is broken."

    {
      "title": "Pour water and bleach into the drain to rinse out any additional debris.",
      "content": "Pour water and bleach into the drain to rinse out any additional debris. Spray the drain opening with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water using your hose to test the drainage and to get rid of any loose material. Use 1–2 cups (240–470 ml) of undiluted chlorine bleach to neutralize any smells and to break apart any residual obstructions. If the drain still runs slow, use your drain auger until it works again. If you still can’t get it to work, you may need to call a professional."

    {
      "title": "Pour 1 cup (208 g) of baking soda into the drain.",
      "content": "Pour 1 cup (208 g) of baking soda into the drain. Remove the grate on top of your drain so the baking soda can get into your pipes. Measure out 1 cup (208 g) of baking soda and pour it directly into the drain. [3] X Research source If your drain is completely clogged, use a snake to break the clog apart first before you do this. This is a 100% natural way to clean and clear out your drain. Unlike chemical drain cleaners, this won’t put any strain on your pipes."

      "title": "Add 1 c (240 ml) of vinegar to the drain to start a reaction.",
      "content": "Add 1 c (240 ml) of vinegar to the drain to start a reaction. After the baking soda, pour white distilled vinegar in the drain. The vinegar will start to bubble and react with the baking soda as soon as they’re together. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Let the mixture sit in your drain for 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the mixture sit in your drain for 30 minutes. The baking soda and vinegar will naturally break down all of the material that’s stuck in your drain. You can wait even longer if you’d like, or add a second round of vinegar and baking soda if it still looks like your drain is a little slow to empty. [5] X Research source If there's a chance of rain, cover the drain with a rag or plug so the vinegar and baking soda don't rinse out."

    {
      "title": "Dump a pot of boiling water into the drain to rinse everything out.",
      "content": "Dump a pot of boiling water into the drain to rinse everything out. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil on your stove. Throw on some oven mitts and carefully carry the pot outside to the drain. Slowly pour the water into the drain. The water will lift any loose material inside your pipes and help clean everything out. [6] X Research source If you don’t have vinegar and baking soda, feel free to use boiling water on its own. The heat should be enough to break up some blockages."

      "title": "Cover the drain with a screen or dome to prevent large debris from falling in.",
      "content": "Cover the drain with a screen or dome to prevent large debris from falling in. Drain screens are protective grates or meshes used to keep leaves and other debris out of your pipes. Set the screen or dome over your drain so it collects any possible obstructions. Clean your drain screens after especially heavy storms to remove any obstructions and snake the drain lines at least once a year to remove any debris buildup."

      "title": "Clean out the drain once a month so clogs cannot form.",
      "content": "Clean out the drain once a month so clogs cannot form. Try to clean your drains frequently, even if they aren’t clogged. Either use a snake to break apart small obstructions or use a baking soda and vinegar treatment. With monthly maintenance, your outdoor drains won’t clog. [7] X Research source If you have severe storms, check your drains the following day to see if there is any debris stuck in the drain."

      "title": "Use a biological enzyme cleaner when your drain is running slow.",
      "content": "Use a biological enzyme cleaner when your drain is running slow. Biological enzymes use natural bacteria to break down organic materials in your pipes. Wait until a clear evening when you aren’t expecting rain in your area. Pour the entire bag of the enzyme into your drain and let it work overnight. [8] X Research source Enzyme cleaners are safe to use with septic tank lines since they won't harm the helpful bacteria. If you have a clog in a septic drain, try enzyme cleaners before any harsh chemicals."
