Not only is it fun, but it’s also easy to play and totally customizable. Kids love the game because they’re given 2 scenarios they have to imagine being in. Then, they have to choose which is “better” than the other. Follow these steps to play the game : [11] X Research source Think of a dilemma or scenario of two similar things. These options can be silly, goofy, good, or bad. Just try to stick to a theme. Insert the scenarios into this question: “Would you rather __ or __?” Give the child time to think about their choice. Better yet, talk it out! Let them imagine how they’d react if they had to live with one of the scenarios. Talk about their choice. Ask the child why they picked what they did. Asking them to explain their reasoning is a great way to teach rationalization and choice. Have the child ask you a question next. Keep the game going by switching turns of who asks a question. Be prepared for some wacky scenarios! Try playing with a group. Make things a bit more interesting by asking a group of kids one question. This approach is a great way to start a healthy debate and have the kids listen to other opinions."
