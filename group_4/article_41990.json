      "content": "Contact the school board. In most cases, you must work with the school district to resolve any problems before you can file a lawsuit. Check the district's website and look for a phone number or address you can use to file a complaint. [2] X Research source Most school districts have a specific number for parents or students to call if they have a problem with their school. Depending on the nature of the issue, procedures may differ if you are dealing with a private school as opposed to a public school. Talk to the administration at the school or read the school handbook to determine the procedure."

      "title": "File an administrative complaint.",
      "content": "File an administrative complaint. Typically, you must file a complaint or claim with the school district before you can sue a school. Most school districts have a specific form that you can download from the school's website. [3] X Research source Fill out basic information, including your name, the name of the student, and the name and location of the school. Provide a description of what happened, and what you want the school district to do about it. For example, if a teacher discriminated against your child, you would describe what the teacher did and why you felt it was discriminatory. Include as many specific details as possible. State what you believe the school district should do about the situation. For example, if a teacher discriminated against your child, you may want the teacher to be disciplined or fired. If your child was injured by a bully, you might want the school to pay for your child's medical bills."

      "title": "Gather documents and information.",
      "content": "Gather documents and information. You will need to provide evidence that the statements you made in your complaint are true. The more evidence you have, the more likely it will be that the school district will rule in your favor. [4] X Research source If any other students or teachers witnessed the incident, statements from them can be used as evidence. You may not have some types of evidence, but know how to get them. For example, if the incident occurred in view of a security camera, you can ask that the footage be taken from the camera and analyzed. Photos or diagrams of the part of the school where the incident took place also can be used as evidence. For example, if your child was the victim of a bully, you might use a map of the school to mark where the encounters with the bully happened. You'll also need documentation of any damages you've suffered. Include photos of injuries your child suffered, or any medical bills you incurred as a result."

    {
      "title": "Participate in the investigation.",
      "content": "Participate in the investigation. When your complaint is received, the district will undertake an investigation of the incident. They may interview you as well as others who witnessed the incident or who talked to you or your child about the incident. [5] X Research source At the conclusion of the investigation, the district will let you know what they've decided to do as a result of the incident. If you're not satisfied with the actions taken by the district, you may have the ability to sue the school and the school district at that point."

      "title": "Consult an attorney.",
      "content": "Consult an attorney. If you decide you want to sue a school, you must follow specific steps and meet deadlines that may be very short. If you don’t follow the right steps, your lawsuit may be dismissed – even if you had a valid complaint. [6] X Research source Finding out exactly what you need to do will require a lot of research, and you may overlook something. While you don't necessarily need an attorney, working with one can save you a lot of hassle. An experienced education or administrative law attorney will already know all of this information and be able to help you navigate the system. An experienced attorney can also analyze your case and give you their thoughts on whether you have a chance of winning in court. If you talk to several attorneys and they all say you're unlikely to win, you may want to reconsider your lawsuit."

      "title": "Identify your cause of action.",
      "content": "Identify your cause of action. The cause of action is your reason for suing the school. You can only sue the school if you can point to something the school did that violated the law. This can be difficult with public schools because they are considered part of the government, and are immune from many lawsuits. [7] X Research source Government immunity doesn't mean you can't sue the school, but the reasons you can sue are extremely limited. For example, if your child falls down and gets injured in the lunchroom, you typically can't sue the school. Schools can't be sued for simple negligence. However, if your child suffered heat stroke because they were forced to run outside on an excessively hot day, you may be able to sue. Generally, your cause of action will be based on some intentional act on the part of teachers or administrators. Most often, lawsuits against a school are related to the violation of a child's constitutional rights."

      "title": "Look for notice of intent forms.",
      "content": "Look for notice of intent forms. In most cases, if you're going to sue a public school, you must first send the school or school district a notice of intent to sue and give them an appropriate amount of time to respond, typically 30 days. [8] X Research source Many school districts have a form you can use for your notice of intent to sue. Using the form can save you some trouble and also ensure that you have all the information that is legally required to be in the notice."

This should be a formal letter that details your cause of action and states that you intend to sue the school for that reason. [9] X Research source Typically, you also must cite the law or policy that you believe the school has violated. If you can't find a form, it may be in your best interest to get an attorney to draft the letter for you."

      "content": "Send your letter to the school. Mail your letter to the school using U.S. certified mail with return receipt requested. That way you'll get a postcard in the mail when your letter is received. You'll need this postcard later to prove to the court that you sent the school your notice of intent to sue. [10] X Research source Without this proof, your lawsuit may be automatically dismissed. When you get the card, put it in a safe place."

      "title": "Choose the correct court.",
      "content": "Choose the correct court. You must file a lawsuit in a court that has jurisdiction over the school and the incident that took place. Typically this will be a court in the same city or county where the school is located. You also must choose between state or federal court. In most cases, you'll file your lawsuit in state court. However, if your lawsuit is based on federal law or on a violation of constitutional rights, you also have the option to file in federal court. If you have questions about jurisdiction, you may want to talk to an attorney. Someone in the court clerk's office also may be able to help you, but they can't give you any legal advice and may be limited in what they can tell you."

You could be asking to be compensated monetarily, or you could want the court to order the school to act in a particular way. For example, if your child was kicked off the soccer team and you believe it was due to racial discrimination, you may want the court to order the school to allow your child to play on the soccer team."

They may also file a motion to dismiss. The school and the school district will always have a team of attorneys. For this reason, if you haven't hired a lawyer yet, now is a good time to do so. If you represent yourself, your case may not survive a motion to dismiss. On the other hand, the school district may decide not to fight your lawsuit and offer a settlement instead. Consider the settlement carefully. You may want to get an attorney's advice on whether you should accept it."
