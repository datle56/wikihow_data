      "content": "Question your recruiter. When you've found a company you're interested in, you'll likely meet with a recruiter or another representative. Be skeptical during the recruitment process. Remember that your sponsor makes more money if you sign on, so they may not be as open with you as they could be. Don't get distracted by promises of how much money you'll make, and really think about what you're about to do. Ask direct and specific questions. If you find the answer too vague, ask for clarification. Ask exactly what the company will expect of you—how much are you expected to sell? How many people are you expected to recruit? Are you required to take part in training programs?"

      "content": "Draw up a business plan. When you have a few potential companies in mind, write out your plan for building and expanding your business. Even before you've officially aligned with a company, it helps to have this plan figured out early. That way you can hit the ground running when you do eventually start at a company. Keep these things in mind when designing a business plan: What product or service are you intending to sell? Who is your intended market? How much time will you dedicate to this? Will it be a part-time commitment or are you planning on working 7 days a week? What is your goal? Do you want to get rich or just make some extra money? Think long-term. Where will you be in 5 years? 10 years? What is your marketing strategy? Will you make cold calls? Use the internet or social media? Go door to door? You can update or change the plan as needed, but it helps to have a guide when you're just starting out."

Just because someone wasn't interested once doesn't mean they will never be interested. Be careful not to overdo it, though—you could easily get a reputation as a spammer, which can hurt your business."
