      "title": "Tie up your hair to keep it out of the way.",
      "content": "Tie up your hair to keep it out of the way. Use a spray bottle to wet down your longer hair, then pull it up on top of your head. You can use a clip or a hair tie to keep it up so it doesn’t fall down and get trimmed accidentally. [1] X Research source Since you already have an undercut, the demarcation line should be easy to find. If you need to, use a mirror behind you to make sure that the line is completely straight. If you do accidentally catch your longer hairs in the clippers, you may have to make your undercut higher."

      "title": "Put on a cape or plastic bag to catch any small hairs.",
      "content": "Put on a cape or plastic bag to catch any small hairs. Trimming an undercut leads to a lot of tiny, itchy hairs that can get caught in your clothes. Put a plastic garbage bag or a hair cutting cape on to catch them, or be prepared to take a shower after your haircut. [2] X Research source You could also put a thick towel around your neck to catch the hairs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set up one mirror in front of you and one mirror behind you.",
      "content": "Set up one mirror in front of you and one mirror behind you. Even if your undercut wraps around the side of your head, you’ll still need to see the back of your head at some point. Put one mirror in front of you and one behind you to make sure you can see what you’re doing the whole time. [3] X Research source You can even use a 3 way mirror. Practice by starting the separation lower than you want it. So that you have room for error. If you’re nervous about trimming the back of your head, get a friend to help you out."

    {
      "title": "Put a #000 guard on your clippers.",
      "content": "Put a #000 guard on your clippers. This is the shortest length guard you can use, so your undercut will be almost to the skin. If you don’t want your undercut that short, use a #1 or #2 guard instead. [4] X Research source If you go for a longer guard, you’ll have to trim your undercut more often."
    },
    {
      "title": "Press your clippers against the bottom of your undercut.",
      "content": "Press your clippers against the bottom of your undercut. With the guard facing your head, press your clippers against the nape of your neck. Starting at the bottom is easier, since you don’t have to worry about catching your longer hair in the clippers. [5] X Research source If you’re doing an undercut all the way around your head, like a men’s style, you can start at your sideburns instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swipe upward in small motions along the bottom of your undercut.",
      "content": "Swipe upward in small motions along the bottom of your undercut. Gently stroke your clippers upwards slowly to take off a little bit of hair at a time. Go around the bottom of your undercut to start taking off hair all over. [6] X Research source If it’s your first time trimming your undercut, it’s better to go slow. That way, you can correct any mistakes if they happen."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep trimming upwards until you hit the demarcation line.",
      "content": "Keep trimming upwards until you hit the demarcation line. Moving upwards in short strokes, keep trimming off your hair slowly. Go all the way up until you reach the demarcation line between your undercut and your long hair. [7] X Research source Double-check that everything looks even in the mirror behind you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Trim the demarcation line without a guard.",
      "content": "Trim the demarcation line without a guard. Keeping your longer hair tied up, take the guard off your clippers and press the blade against the line between your undercut and your longer hair. Gently swipe downwards, taking off the hair that separates your undercut and your long hair. Move from left to right until you’ve cut off all the hair in that small, 0.25 in (0.64 cm) section. [8] X Research source Trimming the demarcation line is optional, but it can help make your undercut look cleaner and more professional."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put a #2 guard on the clippers and swipe upwards in short strokes.",
      "content": "Put a #2 guard on the clippers and swipe upwards in short strokes. A #2 will be the longest length on your undercut, so you can use it all over. Start from the bottom of your undercut and go all the way up until you reach the demarcation line between your undercut and the rest of your hair. [9] X Research source If you want your fade to be a little shorter, use a #1.5 guard instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach a #1.5 guard to your clippers.",
      "content": "Attach a #1.5 guard to your clippers. Pick a guard that’s about 0.5 shorter than the one you used all over. You’ll be using this on the bottom part of your hair to create the fade look. [10] X Research source If you used a #1.5 guard all over, use a #1 guard for your fade."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swipe your shorter guard about halfway up your undercut.",
      "content": "Swipe your shorter guard about halfway up your undercut. Start at the nape of your neck and pull the clippers upwards. When you reach the center, pull the clippers up and away from your head for a gradual fade into the longer length. Do this all over the bottom of your hair to create a two-length look. [11] X Research source Try to get your line mostly even, but don’t worry if it’s slightly wobbly. The fade will help to disguise any imperfections."

    {
      "title": "Trim up the top section of your undercut with scissors.",
      "content": "Trim up the top section of your undercut with scissors. If you have an all-around undercut, like in a men’s style, grab some hair cutting scissors and a fine-toothed comb. Grab the hair near the top of your undercut with your comb, then use your scissors to trim off the ends of your hair. Do this all over to give your undercut a more polished look. [12] X Research source Make sure you use a mirror for the back of your head!"
