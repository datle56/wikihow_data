Do an activity to distract yourself, if you can't get the person or your negative feelings out of your head. Get some work done, listen to music, exercise, doodle or draw, write or journal, or read a book, newspaper, or magazine.

      "content": "Breathe slowly and deeply when you feel angry. Try relaxing and clearing your thoughts when you notice yourself getting angry or dwelling on the person. Inhale slowly as you count to 4, hold for a 4 count, then count to 4 as you exhale. Keep taking slow, deep breaths for at least 90 seconds, or until your mind has switched gears. [2] X Research source Focus on relaxing imagery as you breathe, like a beach or comfortable place from your childhood. Visualize your negative emotions passing away with each breath. When someone hurts you, it’s tough to get them out of your head. Taking a break to clear your mind can help you keep your cool and break a negative thought pattern."

      "content": "Write a letter to express your feelings, but don’t send it. Writing can help you release your emotions and order your thoughts. Describe what the person did or what bothers you. Tearing up or burning the letter could help you symbolically let go of your hate. [3] X Research source Sending the letter could escalate the situation, so keep it private. Destroying the letter will help make sure that someone else doesn't stumble upon it by accident."

      "content": "Vent to people you trust. Talking to a close friend or family member will help you blow off steam. Getting a fresh perspective can also give you a better understanding of the situation. Talk to someone you trust in private, and make sure they’ll keep your conversation to themselves. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Try to vent to someone who's removed from the situation. For example, if you're frustrated with a coworker, tell your sister who works elsewhere instead of another coworker. This avoids creating drama. Don’t vent about someone you hate at the place where you interact with them, like school or work. It might get back to the person, or you might end up getting labelled as a gossip or unprofessional."

      "title": "Ask an authority figure for help with problem situations.",
      "content": "Ask an authority figure for help with problem situations. If this person makes a habit of antagonizing you, it is best to seek qualified advice. You deserve a safe environment without someone harassing you. If they are repeatedly, intentionally upsetting you, then it's probably good to get someone to help. Talk to an authority figure. Explain the facts of how this person treated you, what you've tried to do to fix things, and how this is affecting you. Be tactful, clear, and as factual as possible. Then ask for help dealing with it. Bad example: \"Mark is an elitist pig, and I won't put up with it anymore! It's like he's trying to humiliate me on purpose! He's always criticizing me in front of everyone! I need you to do something about him!\" Good example: \"I'm trying to get along with Mark, and it's just not working. Often, when I show him my work, he loudly lists off criticisms, often in public. It leaves me feeling humiliated, and I dread going to work because of it. I've never seen him do this to anyone else. I've asked him to give me critique in private, but he refuses. I don't know how to handle this. I could really use some advice.\""

Seeing a professional is also best if you’re constantly angry or if your feelings of hate interfere with your daily life.

Limiting contact is especially wise if you’ve had a recent confrontation with them. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source You might find the person is easier to tolerate in small doses.

[7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For instance, if you hate them because they constantly criticize everyone around them, do your best to ignore it.

Don't make sarcastic remarks, insult them, or bring up your conflict. If they say something negative or annoying, ignore them and change the subject back to your work. [8] X Research source For example, if you're paired with them on a project and they say something offensive, don't respond. Say, \"Our deadline is coming up fast, so we should stay focused on finishing this.\" It might be tempting to engage them or correct an ignorant opinion, but it's not worth your time."

[9] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Spending time with someone you hate could be helpful if there’s something about them that irks you. You might find they do the thing you hate because they’re compensating for an insecurity or just don’t know any better. However, if they hurt you or if you morally object to their behavior, just try to avoid them. Spending time with them may be especially helpful if their behavior is similar to yours, or if the issue is really about you and not about them."

Emotionally disengaging can help you deal with a rude or irritating person without getting invested in their mess. Mentally acknowledge that their behavior is inappropriate, and that they have a tendency to do this. Then move on. Try responding to transgressions with ambivalence. When they act rudely, say \"okay,\" \"thanks for sharing,\" or \"that's interesting\" and change the subject."

They have a trait that you don't like in yourself (e.g. being too sensitive, clingy, or irresponsible). They do something that you think is morally wrong (such as being cruel or hypocritical).

Think about how they might be acting out of fear, insecurity, or pain. Seeing them as a human being with a story can help you empathize with them and take steps toward forgiveness. [12] X Research source For example, they might have been harshly criticized when they were young, so now they criticize others and boast about their accomplishments, to help them more secure. While someone’s past doesn’t excuse their behavior, seeing the bigger picture can help you put their actions in context.

Use \"I\" phrasing to describe what's bothering you and how you feel about it, without making accusations or judgments. Allow them to respond without interrupting them, and mention ways you could both improve the situation. [14] X Research source For instance, tell them, “I feel insecure and disrespected when you dismiss and poke fun at my opinions. We don’t have to be best friends, but I’d like to find a way to be cordial and respectful with each other.” Disengage if it goes bad.

Yes, your behavior bothered me, and I had reason to be upset. But it wasn't appropriate for me to embarrass you like that. I should have taken you aside instead of saying it in front of the entire room.\" \"I'm sorry that I called you a heartless jerk. I was upset with you, but that's no excuse for name calling.
