      "title": "Watch for symptoms of worms in your chickens.",
      "content": "Watch for symptoms of worms in your chickens. The most common symptoms of worm infestation in chickens are: abnormal, foamy looking droppings; diarrhea; pale comb/wattles; weight loss; dirty vent feathers; listlessness; gasping, head-shaking and stretching; decreased egg production; and sudden death. Keep an eye out for worms in your chickens' droppings and throat as well."

      "title": "Educate yourself on the different types of worms.",
      "content": "Educate yourself on the different types of worms. You only have to worry about a handful of worm types: cecal worms, roundworms, tapeworms, capillary worms, and gapeworms. But not all of them are equally dangerous. Once you notice one (or more) types, you can treat your chicken with the appropriate medication. For example, cecal worms are common but not typically damaging to chicken health. They are visible in droppings and about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) long. [1] X Research source Roundworms are common and visible in droppings with heavy loads. They can be as much as 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Tapeworms are rare and typically harmless. However, they can cause death in large infestations. They are anywhere from 0.157 inches (4.0 mm) long to up to 9.84 inches (25.0 cm) long. Capillary worms are thin and thread-like. They are not typically visible in droppings and are about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) long. Gapeworms are not common and have a red, fork-like appearance. They are visible in droppings and cause chickens to gasp, cough, open their mouth repeatedly, and stretch their neck."

      "title": "Test chicken droppings for their worm egg count.",
      "content": "Test chicken droppings for their worm egg count. Veterinarians use a worm egg count as a method of diagnosing worms. Although you can visit the veterinarian and have them determine this count, you can also purchase an egg count kit and microscope to determine it on your own. Products come with a chart that tells you if your count is light, moderate, or heavy. [2] X Research source Purchase worm count kits and microscopes from online suppliers. Make sure the kit contains the chemical flubendazole. If only some of your chickens appear to have worms, it is still likely that they will give the worms to the other chickens, so it is a good idea to treat the whole flock. Send the feces to a veterinarian if your chickens are losing weight or having other problems and you don’t see signs of worms in their feces. They could have larger internal parasites that don’t leave through the feces."

      "content": "Add food-grade diatomaceous earth to your feed to dehydrate worms. Diatomaceous earth is sold in the form of a fine white powder at most ranch feed stores and online. It is a natural dewormer that is believed to dehydrate the chicken's internal parasites and worms. Mix 1/4 cup (85 grams) of food-grade diatomaceous earth per 35 ounces (990 g) of feed. Make sure to mix it thoroughly and evenly into the feed. [3] X Research source Diatomaceous earth is food safe for pets. However, humans should not breathe in the powder."

      "content": "Feed your chickens apple cider vinegar for a cheap worming alternative. Add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of apple cider vinegar per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of your chickens' drinking water. In addition to the health benefits of its vitamins and minerals, apple cider vinegar is a mild antiseptic and mild antibiotic. This means it can kill germs and bacteria and prevent worms from living in your chickens. It can also raise the acidity of the water, making the chickens' guts less conducive to bacteria. [4] X Research source Only add apple cider vinegar to plastic water drinkers."

      "content": "Grind garlic cloves into your chickens' feed or water to boost immunity. Garlic makes chicken intestines less attractive to parasites. Grind up 3 to 4 cloves and mix them evenly into your chicken feed. You can also crush some garlic cloves and put them into your chickens' water. [5] X Research source Garlic can also boost your chickens' immune systems and respiratory systems."

      "content": "Repeat natural treatments for 4 to 5 days. Regardless of what kind of natural treatment you decide to use, it's important to conduct it consistently. This will create an unattractive environment for parasitic worms. [6] X Research source Repeat natural treatments every 3 to 4 months for the best results."

      "title": "Determine the appropriate medication based on the worm type.",
      "content": "Determine the appropriate medication based on the worm type. If you tested your chickens and determined the worm type on your own, select an appropriate medication. If you went to a veterinarian, they can tell you what type of worms your chickens have and the best medication for effective treatment. Otherwise, most medications can be purchased from pharmacies and online suppliers. Regardless, be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions. [7] X Research source Wazine-17 (Piperazine) is used to treat roundworms. However, it is not approved for any chickens laying eggs for human consumption. Safe-guard (fenbendazole) is used for roundworms, cecal worms, threadworms, and gapeworms. Ivermectin is used for roundworms, threadworms, and gapeworms. Albendazole is effective against tapeworms, capillary worms, roundworms, gapeworms, and cecal worms."

      "title": "Administer deworming medication to your entire chicken flock 2 times.",
      "content": "Administer deworming medication to your entire chicken flock 2 times. Medications are typically either poured into drinking water or injected. After the first administration, give it to your chickens again in 7 to 14 days or according to the product's instructions. Always clean the litter in the run and coop following the second administration. [8] X Research source Administer deworming products 2 times a year for healthy chickens. Re-administer medication every 3 weeks if worms recur."

      "title": "Rotate products to prevent drug resistance.",
      "content": "Rotate products to prevent drug resistance. Using the same medication can lead to drug resistance in your chickens and decrease their effectiveness. For this reason, you need to rotate 2 or 3 drugs into your worming program. For example, use drug A in the fall, drug B in the spring, and drug C in the fall or next spring. [9] X Research source Administer medication during the fall and spring."

      "title": "Clean your chicken coop regularly.",
      "content": "Clean your chicken coop regularly. The ground can quickly become full of bacteria and parasites, which creates a breeding ground for worms. Never let droppings accumulate and always keep your coop clean and free from waste. Place a droppings board underneath roosts at night to catch droppings."

      "content": "Contact your local agricultural program to discuss worming. Ask to speak with a poultry agent and inquire about the risk of worms in your area. Agents can recommend the best timeline and approach to a worming program. [10] X Research source Prepare to provide as much information as possible, including worm egg count, the type of worm(s) infecting your chickens, your location, and the dietary habits of your chickens."

      "content": "Limit treats to 5 percent of your chickens' daily diet. Too many treats can throw off your chickens' diet. Their nutritional profile often varies enough that an excessive amount can lead to health problems. You should also never add treats to a commercial ration, as this can also disrupt nutritional balance. [11] X Research source Never throw treats onto the ground to avoid contamination."
