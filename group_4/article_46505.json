      "content": "Add the recommended amount of water to the sterilizer. Steam sterilizers require the addition of a small amount of water to create steam. Consult your user manual to determine how much water to use. Too little water may not sterilize the bottles properly, but too much could cause the basin to overflow. Check the sterilizer's instructions to see if there is a specific type of water you need to use. Some sterilizers require you to use distilled water instead of tap water to avoid a buildup of mineral deposits inside the sterilizer. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Load the sterilizer. Place one bottle upside-down on each prong. Do not attempt to load more bottles into the sterilizer than there are prongs. Most only have room for about six bottles, so if you have more than that, you will need to clean the bottles in batches. If you are interested in sterilizing a larger number of bottles at one time, check the sterilizer’s capacity before purchasing. [4] X Research source Some sterilizers will only hold a couple of bottles, while others may hold 9 or more."

      "content": "Place the nipples, nipple rings, and caps inside. These pieces should be spaced apart enough that they do not touch. If the sterilizer has lower prongs, space the accessories in between these prongs to hold them in place. Make sure that nipples and caps are placed in the sterilizer with their openings facing down. This will allow the steam to enter and sterilize the inside of the nipple or cap more effectively. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the cover on.",
      "content": "Put the cover on. Electric sterilizers work by generating steam. This steam needs to be contained inside the sterilizer to clean the bottles properly. Make sure the cover is on securely before you turn on the sterilizer."

      "title": "Turn on the machine.",
      "content": "Turn on the machine. The sterilizer should automatically begin heating to a temperature high enough to generate steam and kill most of the bacteria in and on the bottles and nipples. For most electric steam sterilizers, the process takes about 10 minutes, although the time required is variable. [6] X Research source"

Dry the bottles with a clean dish towel or allow them to air dry. Many electric steam sterilizers will also dry and deodorize the bottles for you. [7] X Research source Some electric steam cleaners are designed to keep the bottles sterilized for up to 24 hours, as long as the lid is kept closed during that time. If you don’t want to use the bottles right away, consider leaving them in the sterilizer. [8] X Research source"

However, microwave sterilizers use heat from your microwave, rather than an internal heating element, to create steam. Consult your user manual to determine how much water to add to your model. [10] X Research source Many microwave sterilizers have a removable steamer rack on which to place the bottles and accessories. Remove this before filling with water, and then replace it. Check your user manual to find out if distilled water is recommended for your unit."
