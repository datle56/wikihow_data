      "title": "Store starting fluid safely.",
      "content": "Store starting fluid safely. Starting fluid is highly flammable and combustible. Store and handle them safely. For instance, do not place your can of starting fluid on a hot engine or spray it near a hot engine. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Do not use excessive amounts of starting fluid.",
      "content": "Do not use excessive amounts of starting fluid. Too much starting fluid can damage your engine. Consult your vehicle user’s manual and the user directions appended to the starting fluid in order to determine the appropriate volume of starting fluid for your vehicle. [2] X Research source Typically, a couple of short bursts of starting fluid should be adequate to get your engine started."

      "title": "Check to make sure you can use starting fluid with your vehicle.",
      "content": "Check to make sure you can use starting fluid with your vehicle. Starting fluid cannot be used with all vehicles. For instance, if your vehicle is equipped with glow plugs, or if your vehicle uses diesel fuel, you will not be able to utilize starting fluid. [3] X Research source Check your vehicle’s user guide to ensure starting fluid is appropriate for use with your vehicle. Starting fluid also cannot be used in two-stroke engines, such as those in lawnmowers. [4] X Research source If starting fluid is not appropriate for your vehicle, try an alternative like carburetor cleaner. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a quality starting fluid.",
      "content": "Choose a quality starting fluid. Only use trusted brands when selecting a starting fluid. A good starting fluid should start the engine quickly with a minimal application volume. Ask your local auto shop what sort of starting fluid they recommend for your vehicle."

      "title": "Locate your air intake.",
      "content": "Locate your air intake. Air intakes are devices on all vehicles that allow the engine to mix air with fuel, thus making combustion possible. While the air intake will always be attached to the engine housed beneath the hood, different manufacturers produce their vehicles to different specifications, and so air intakes are located in different locations on different vehicles. Consult your vehicle’s user guide to identify the location of your air intake. [6] X Research source Air intakes often look like metal tubes. They might be powder-coated or painted in the same color as the vehicle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray a small amount of starting fluid into the air intake.",
      "content": "Spray a small amount of starting fluid into the air intake. Keep the can of starting fluid upright. Aim the can’s nozzle at the air intake from about 12 inches (20 centimeters) away. Spray the starting fluid for about two seconds, then try to turn the engine over. If the engine still doesn’t turn over, spray another two-second blast. [7] X Research source You many need to remove the filter covering your air intake to do this. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Take your vehicle to a mechanic if it doesn’t start.",
      "content": "Take your vehicle to a mechanic if it doesn’t start. If the engine won’t start even with an appropriate application of starting fluid, the engine itself might not be the problem. For instance, your car’s ignition switch might be faulty, or some other system could be to blame. Talk to a reputable mechanic in your area and get their opinion on how to handle the problem."

    {
      "title": "Adjust the choke.",
      "content": "Adjust the choke. If your vehicle has a carburetor (a device that mixes air and fuel) and it will not start, check the choke. If your choke is closed when you try to turn the vehicle over, open it. If it was open when you try to turn the vehicle over, close it. [9] X Research source Adjusting the choke is also a good idea when your car has a carburetor and starts, but then turns off. If you cannot locate your choke, consult your vehicle’s user manual."

    {
      "title": "Check for moisture.",
      "content": "Check for moisture. If your car has a hard time starting on rainy days, look inside the distributor cap. If you see moisture inside the distributor cap, turn the cap upside down and spray it with mechanic’s solvent (or, if you have a bottle of solvent rather than a spray can, pour some of the solvent into the cap). Swish the solvent around, then pour it out. Use a clean rag to wipe out any additional solvent before replacing the cap. [10] X Research source The distributor cap is a small cover that protects your car’s distributor."

      "title": "Check your battery.",
      "content": "Check your battery. If you don’t even hear a sputter when you turn the ignition, the terminal cables to the battery are probably not connected properly. If the terminal connections look corroded, jam a screwdriver between the connector and the terminal post. Twist the screwdriver to tighten the connection. Try the engine. If it starts, clean or replace the battery cables. [11] X Research source When adjusting the connector and terminal post, use a screwdriver with an insulated or wooden handle."
