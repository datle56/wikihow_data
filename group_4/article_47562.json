      "content": "Wear a T-shirt to add a casual flair to most sweaters. Generally, wearing a T-shirt with a sweater is expected and even necessary. T-shirts work best with sweaters that have higher or more open collars, such as crew necks and turtlenecks. This is a great way to add layers to your outfit without hiding your sweater. However, T-shirts are also useful for preventing a rough sweater from irritating your skin. Even if your shirt collar isn't visible, the hem might be. Leave a little of the hem visible below your sweater to make it look thicker and brighter. Try wearing a lightweight merino wool sweater over a T-shirt for a look that's comfortable without being too hot.

Alternatively, use a brighter color like blue to emphasize contrast for more visual appeal."

      "content": "Put on a collared shirt and tie underneath a sweater to look professional. A collared shirt may seem unexpected, but it is often a valuable article of clothing to make a sweater look dressy. Choose a shirt with a buttoned collar, then tuck it neatly behind your sweater so only the top is visible. If you wish to add a tie, attach it to the buttoned collar and tuck it underneath your sweater as well. Try wearing your classy new look to a professional function. The collared shirt and tie combo works best with sweaters that have low collars, such as v-necks. Since you're generally trying to look classy when wearing a shirt like this, avoid using it with patterned sweaters. Stick with a light-colored shirt, such as white, so it stands out underneath your sweater. With ties, you could opt for more vibrant colors like red to stand out. You could also layer a sweater cardigan over a button-down shirt for a look that's cozy but professional.

      "content": "Use a jacket to cover and insulate thinner sweaters. Pair your favorite sweater with a nice sports jacket, blazer, or something entirely unexpected. Jackets don't work well with thicker sweaters like cable knit, but they serve as an additional layer for many other types. Wear an open jacket to show off your sweater and any layers you have on underneath it. [3] X Research source A jacket keeps you warm while you wear a sweater like a cardigan. It also enables you to style your sweater for specific occasions. Try a leather jacket, a bomber jacket, or even a denim jacket for a more casual look."

      "content": "Match your sweater with a pair of jeans for a casual look. Coordinate your sweater with some stylish, form-fitting jeans. Plain blue or black jeans go well with most sweaters, but match the fit according to the type of sweater you have. Stick to slim jeans in most cases. If you're wearing something bulkier like a cable knit sweater, you can get away with pants that are a little larger. [4] X Research source Your pants need to fit you as well as your sweater does or else your outfit won't look right."

      "title": "Use dress pants for a more formal outfit with a sweater.",
      "content": "Use dress pants for a more formal outfit with a sweater. Try a nice pair of chinos, dress pants, or even khakis to match with your sweater. These styles of pants go well with outfits that include a collared shirt and tie as well. You have plenty of color options to choose from, so you can mix and match colors to make your sweater pop. [5] X Research source For example, rock a pair of cream-colored dress pants to highlight a dark-colored sweater. If you don't wish to stand out quite as much, tone it down with light-colored chinos."

      "content": "Finish your outfit with a comfortable but matching pair of shoes. You have plenty of options when choosing shoes. Regular white tennis shoes work well in most cases, but use boots and dress shoes as well when the situation calls for them. The shoes you choose aren't nearly as important as shirts and jackets. As long as your shoes look clean and match the overall style you're going for, you don't need to worry about them. [6] X Research source For instance, white tennis shoes contrast well with sweaters. You could switch to a darker, more formal pair of shoes to put less emphasis on your sweater."

      "content": "Wear a sweater whenever you need to stay warm or dress up. Sweaters are far more versatile than people expect. Pretty much any time is a good time to include a sweater in your outfit. This depends on the type of sweater you're choosing and what you pair it with. A simple sweater is great for use outdoors on casual trips, but sweaters also work very well in formal settings. [7] X Research source If you're planning on slipping on a basic sweater with whatever you have in your wardrobe, take a more casual approach. Wear this kind of outfit when you're hanging out with friends or walking around in public. If you need to look your best, put on a nice sweater over a shirt and tie. Include a jacket if you wish. The look might be a little too formal for date night, but it's a valid choice for office work environments. Keep in mind the type of sweater you have. Some sweaters, like cable knits, are meant to be casual. Others, like sweater vests, are more adaptable and designed to be used as a layer with other clothing."

      "title": "Find a sweater that fits you comfortably without hanging off your body.",
      "content": "Find a sweater that fits you comfortably without hanging off your body. If a $300 sweater has sleeves that hang past your hands, you're not going to look great in it. The best way to look great in any sweater is to find the brands that fit you best, then stick with them. Make sure the fabric fits close to your body without feeling restrictive. Aim on having the sleeves end at your wrists and the hem end at your waist. [8] X Research source Unfortunately, all manufacturers have different fits. It depends on the model they use when making the clothing. You might find that a sweater from a high-end designer fits you much more poorly than one from the general store around the corner. Larger manufacturers tend to make sweaters that fit as many people as possible. That means you often don't get a great fit. To get a better fit, consider going to higher-end department stores and trying on different brands. Sometimes you can purchase a sweater and get it altered to fit better. The work is difficult, so most tailors don't bother with it. If you really like a sweater, though, you might be able to find an expert tailor that can help."

      "content": "Select a bulky sweater for warmth and outdoor use. Bulky sweaters generally aren't a good choice when you're trying to look stylish. A big, puffy sweater doesn't pair well with most clothing. You end up needing bulkier pants in order to match it, which makes you look even bigger. For that reason, save your big sweaters for the most casual occasions, including times when you're out in the cold. [9] X Research source For example, a thick cable knit sweater is a fine choice when you're at home or when you're sitting around a campfire. It's not recommended for date night or office work. You can't really put a jacket over a bulky sweater since it makes you look like a ball of fabric. Thick sweaters are meant to be worn as is with little adornment. Put on a thick pair of jeans and some boots, then brave the cold."

      "content": "Pick a fitted sweater when you need to look stylish. Fitted sweaters are far more versatile than bulkier sweaters and are a fashionable choice in most situations. Since these sweaters are thinner, they are a better choice for spring and autumn weather than harsh winters. However, there are a wide variety of fitted sweaters available, so you can always find something to customize into an outfit you're proud to wear in public. For instance, you might get a nice turtleneck to wear at semi-formal events. You could also put on a nice cardigan for a casual night out and then build upon it for a formal appointment."

      "title": "Wear colors that match the outfit and occasion.",
      "content": "Wear colors that match the outfit and occasion. Consider colors like dark blue, brown, and black to be formal. Colors like gray and white can pass as formal but are easy to wear in most situations. More vibrant shades like light blues and reds are trickier to find but work best in casual settings. For the most part, the color doesn't matter as much as the other clothing you choose to pair the sweater with. Dark colors often work well when you don't wish to stand out very much. Try using a dark-colored sweater as part of an outfit when you're going for a more subtle or professional style. Lighter colors work very well for fun, less serious events. Still, avoid wearing extremely bright sweaters unless you're planning on making a statement."

      "title": "Wear patterns if you plan on making them the focal point of your outfit.",
      "content": "Wear patterns if you plan on making them the focal point of your outfit. Patterns on sweaters are a lot like colors in that the more you have, the less formal your sweater seems. Everyone notices patterns, so match the rest of your outfit to compliment the one on your sweater. Go for an understated look with the rest of your clothing. Pair your sweater with clean jeans and simple, no-frills shoes. Argyle, which consists of colored, interlocking diamonds, is one of the most popular patterns available. Keep the rest of your outfit plain to avoid color conflicts. You could wear a plain sports jacket over it to keep it stylish. Houndstooth, checkered, and black and white patterns also tend to be popular and stylish."

      "title": "Select a warm fabric that feels comfortable against your skin.",
      "content": "Select a warm fabric that feels comfortable against your skin. The most expensive sweaters are made from animal fur like wool and cashmere, so you can expect they will keep you warm. Cotton is a more affordable option that gives you plenty of style options during cool weather. There are also synthetic sweaters made from material like polyester that are lower-quality but often more durable and comfortable against bare skin. You get what you pay for most of the time. Wool and cashmere tend to be expensive but of a high quality. Many synthetic sweaters attempt to mimic these qualities but are poorly-made, so always give your clothing a test wear before buying. The more expensive the sweater, the more delicate it is likely to be. Wool and cashmere, for instance, degrade with exposure to heat, water, stretching. Synthetic sweaters can often be thrown into the wash without a problem. Wool and cashmere sweaters are somewhat delicate. Heat, stretching, and soaking damages them over time."

      "title": "Choose a crew neck for versatility with any type of clothing.",
      "content": "Choose a crew neck for versatility with any type of clothing. Start your wardrobe off with a crew neck that pairs well with even the most basic T-shirt. A crew neck is a short collar that doesn't reveal much of what you are wearing underneath the sweater. This is the type of sweater you could wear both at an office and when you go out with friends in the evening. [10] X Research source Crew necks are often great for a casual look. Try pairing one with some plain jeans and a basic shirt for a modest look. You could switch to a formal pair of jeans or even a blazer for a more sophisticated look. Crew necks pair well with both button-down collared shirts and simple T-shirts. Keep the collar inside the sweater so your outfit looks neat. A similar but less common option is the scoop neck sweater. A scoop neck is a circular collar similar to a crew neck that exposes more of your skin. It's great for a casual, low-effort look with jeans and a T-shirt."

      "title": "Use a v-neck sweater to create a more formal appearance.",
      "content": "Use a v-neck sweater to create a more formal appearance. V-necks are a bit fancier than crew necks, mainly because you are meant to wear them with button-down collared shirts. A v-neck sweater exposes more of your neck and the top of your chest. These sweaters often have a slimming effect since the v-shape draws attention downward. [11] X Research source You could wear a crew neck T-shirt underneath the sweater to make it more casual, but avoid wearing a v-neck T-shirt. Exposed skin doesn't mesh well with the more formal aesthetic of the sweater. Put on a collared shirt and a tie to make your sweater look more formal. Use different tie and sweater colors for style. For example, you could use red or blue to give your outfit some brightness. As an alternative, look for sweater vests. Think of them as v-neck sweaters without the sleeves. Sweater vests are meant to be a compliment to anything else you're wearing instead of a cover-up like a full v-neck sweater."

      "title": "Pick a cardigan for a thin but balanced sweater.",
      "content": "Pick a cardigan for a thin but balanced sweater. Cardigans generally have zippers or buttons on the front. Most people leave their cardigans open, exposing the shirt underneath it. Pair a cardigan with jeans and a T-shirt during warmer months, or switch to something more formal for professional settings. You could wear a buttoned shirt and a tie underneath your cardigan to show off your respectability. [12] X Research source Cardigans are generally thin apart from the collar, so you have to compliment it with a shirt. The thin hem goes well with a white T-shirt over a pair of skinny black jeans, for instance. Many people think of a cardigan as something only a grandpa wears, but it is a stylish and versatile choice. Cardigans have buttons that make them easy to remove. Some even have pockets. Shawl collared sweaters are similar to cardigans, except with a bigger collar. A shawl collar is a rounded, turned down collar that goes down your front like a v-neck. It's great for adding even more sophistication and style to a basic cardigan."

      "content": "Pull on a turtleneck to make yourself look slimmer and taller. Wear a well-fitted turtleneck over a simple T-shirt and jeans. Your sweater will keep you warm while also showing off your figure. You could wear the turtleneck as is or add a sports jacket over it for more class. It works best in the fall and winter months when you're normally forced to wear bulkier clothing to stay warm. [13] X Research source Turtlenecks are versatile, but they aren't for everyone. Some people don't like the elevated collar. Make sure you get the correct fit and coordinate your sweater carefully with the rest of your outfit to ensure it looks great on you."

      "content": "Pick a cable knit sweater if you're cold and like designs. Cable knit sweaters are thick and great for withstanding the harshest winter weather. They have elaborate designs knitted on them. Show off your sweater by leaving your sports jacket at home. Most cable knit sweaters consist of a light-colored wool, but you can find colors like blue and green as well. [14] X Research source Casual knit sweaters look best in outdoor settings. Wear one when you're sitting around a campfire, for instance. Avoid it for dates or nights on the town. Aran sweaters are a type of casual knit from the coast of Ireland, so you can expect a good one to shield you from the dreariest weather."
