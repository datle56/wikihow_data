      "title": "In a relationship, your “stink” is like your boo.",
      "content": "In a relationship, your “stink” is like your boo. This isn’t a very common phrase, but if your partner calls you their “stink,” it’s sort of a sweet nickname, like “babe,” “love,” or, “sweetheart.” There’s a slight hint of teasing with “stink” that isn’t there with other nicknames, but it’s almost always meant in good fun. For example, your partner might say: “You know you’re my main stink, right? I could never love anyone else!” “This is Melissa, she’s my stink.” “Hey stink, you want to cuddle and watch a movie tonight?”"

      "title": "Use “stink” the same way you’d use any playful pet name.",
      "content": "Use “stink” the same way you’d use any playful pet name. If you want to use stink as a nickname, you’d use it the same way you’d use any cute, flirty name for you partner. Just keep in mind that this isn’t a crazy popular slang term, and your partner may not take it the right way if they’ve never heard it used this way before. You might say: “Hey there stink! What’s going on?” “You’re my favorite love bug, my cute little stink!” “Stink! Want to order a pizza tonight?”"

      "title": "Play along if they’re being flirty and cute about it.",
      "content": "Play along if they’re being flirty and cute about it. If it kind of seems like your partner was using “stink” in a fun way and you’re just a little confused at first, assume they’re using it in a sweet way. Play along and throw a little goofy, loving pet name back at them. For example: Them: “Hey you! What’s my stink up to?” You: “Not much, bub. Just getting ready. We still kickin’ it tonight?”"

      "title": "Ask your partner what they mean if you aren’t sure.",
      "content": "Ask your partner what they mean if you aren’t sure. If you can’t tell if your partner is trying to be cute and playful or if they’re actually saying you smell bad or what, just ask for clarification. Maybe they’re trying to let you know your new perfume isn’t working for them, or maybe they’re trying to be sweet and it’s just not working for you, but talking about it is undoubtedly the way to go. Them: “Oh, hey stink.” You: “What do you mean? Do I smell bad or are you just trying to be cute?”"

      "title": "A stink might refer to a tantrum or outburst.",
      "content": "A stink might refer to a tantrum or outburst. If someone is “raising a stink” or “causing a stink,” it means they’re making a lot of noise. This could be literal, like someone shouting at employees at a grocery store, or a little more figurative, such as a coworker who keeps quietly complaining about never getting any off time. Someone might say: “Daniel won’t stop raising a stink about how much homework Mr. Wilson keeps giving us.” “If you don’t stop causing a stink in front of my friends, I’m going home.” “I wasn’t trying to make a stink or anything; I was just being honest about my concerns.”"

      "title": "Giving someone a “stink” might refer to an attitude or mean look.",
      "content": "Giving someone a “stink” might refer to an attitude or mean look. Ever hear of the stink-eye? It’s a term for that look someone gives you when they’re annoyed and want you to stop whatever you’re doing? That’s the stink-eye. Some folks just abbreviate that to “stink.” For example, you could say: “Are you mad at me or something? You were giving me the stink from across the room all night.” “I feel like Sarah doesn’t like me. I always catch her giving me the stink.” “If you see me giving you the stink, don’t read too much into it. I have resting annoyed face.”"

      "content": "“Stinking” can be used to mean describe something as unnecessary. You’ve probably heard stinking used this way before, even if you didn’t notice it. When used as an adjective this way, it’s a way of expressing your belief that something is pointless and excessive. “Permits? We don’t need any stinking permits to put a fence up!” “I can’t stand all of this stinking homework.” “You won’t believe how much stinking time it takes to put a bookshelf together.”"
