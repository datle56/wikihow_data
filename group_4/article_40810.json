      "content": "Make an account. Simply go to https://www.youtube.com and click the \"create account\" tab. Choose a username and password to create your account. When choosing a username, you want it to be catchy, easy to read and related to your personality or the main category that you plan to discuss on YouTube. You will not be able to change your username in the future, however, you will be able to make new channels under your account that serve the same purpose."

      "content": "Make your first video. Choose a subject to talk about or make a creative, artistic video. You may want your first video to be an introduction to your channel and give people a taste of what you have to offer them. An introduction to your channel can help you describe what your channel is all about. Why did you start the channel in the first place? What are you here to do? You can also tell your viewers about future topics, give them dates on which your next videos will come out, and encourage them to subscribe."

      "title": "Plan out your videos in advance.",
      "content": "Plan out your videos in advance. Have a plan in place at least several months ahead. Draw one up and follow it fairly closely, with a bit of flexibility to meet viewers' requests and deal with the unexpected. Keep buffer space for the times when you're going to be too busy, too budget-crunched or even unwell or dealing with personal issues to be making a video. If you know you will not have time in the future to make or upload a video consider making it now and scheduling it in YouTube for a future date. Quality over quantity is often the best aim."

      "title": "Generate new ideas.",
      "content": "Generate new ideas. If you cannot think of something to talk about or do, watch other videos and gather ideas. After watching some videos you may be inspired to make a video response or even a spoof of their original video. Don't copy other people's ideas. Parody is usually okay, as it is a common form of artistic expression that is not considered copying. But pretending another person's video script is also yours, for example, is copying. Some great ideas that have worked in the past are; prank videos, product reviews, how to videos, reaction videos, gameplay videos, makeup & shopping haul videos, video memes, unboxing videos. If you want to make a video that does not require much editing and can be done in real time, for example, a video of you playing the latest computer game, then consider live streaming it. That way you will be able to interact with viewers which will help build an audience base, and YouTube favors live streams and will rank it higher in search results during the stream."

      "content": "Respond to what's going on in the news. Make video responses to well known or popular videos.

      "content": "Stay true to your core idea. Once you've cottoned onto an idea that works for you, don't embellish it or deviate from it too much. People like a certain style and brand when they start subscribing and will expect more of the same style as you add more. Of course, this doesn't mean you can't grow and change for the better; it just means don't leap from punk one week to preppy the next. (Unless, of course, that really is your channel's idea!)"

      "content": "Improve your filming techniques. Natural light is the best lighting you can use when filming for YouTube. Successful YouTubers use studio type lights or white lights, which also give you good lighting. But natural lighting is the best. Make sure you have the lights facing you and not behind you. Be aware of where shadows are and make sure they are not covering the main focal point of your videos. Backgrounds are also good to have. You can buy or make backgrounds. To purchase a cheap background, go on eBay or other selling sites to find a simple, white background. Alternatively, you can film you videos outside at places like the beach, your local park, or even your backyard. Consider purchasing a green screen, this way you will be able to make your own backgrounds for your videos."

      "title": "Invest in a quality camera or use your smartphone.",
      "content": "Invest in a quality camera or use your smartphone. Webcams are out. The video and audio quality are not very good on webcams, so try to invest in a good video camera. It doesn't have to be a $500 camera, it could cost $20 as long as the quality for audio and visuals are good your video will be good too. Many digital cameras now have excellent video capacity. Look for used options on auction sites or classifieds if you haven't a lot of money to spare. Some great sites to find used cameras are eBay and Craigslist. The latest mobile phones are also capable of creating good videos. Consider using a tripod to avoid having a shaking video effect."

      "title": "Record with a high-quality screen recorder.",
      "content": "Record with a high-quality screen recorder. This only applies if your video involves you recording your screen. HD videos are the norm nowadays, so make sure it can record at 720p or above. It is best to invest in one rather than download a free one as they often have a \"Free Trial\" or \"Demo\" watermark across the screen on export. If your screen recorder does not have options to record audio as well then you need to invest in a good quality microphone - or another screen recorder. One many YouTubers use is the \"Blue Snowball\" or \"Blue Yeti\", but any cheap, high-quality microphone will do the job."

      "title": "Tag your videos with relevant tags.",
      "content": "Tag your videos with relevant tags. Choosing tags is a pretty important step in the video upload process, and choosing popular tags will make it harder for people to find your video. Choosing unique but accurate tags should bring you more views. Use concise titles, descriptions, and tags. YouTube sorts videos out based on the title of the video, the description and then the tags, in that order. Consider which search terms you would like your video to be displayed under and also use those search terms in the title, description, and tags. Place tags in your description as well as it is more likely that you will get views on your YouTube video. For example: If you were uploading a video about what you thought of Lil Wayne's music career, you wouldn't just put \"Lil Wayne\" because there would be too many results to sort through. But if you were to put Lil Wayne, Cash Money, Music, Career, and History, you would probably end up with a lot more views; not because there are more tags than just Lil Wayne but because it really narrows the search results down."

      "title": "Describe your channel in the description box.",
      "content": "Describe your channel in the description box. On every YouTube channel there is a box, called a description box. Anytime someone views your channel they will see what you write there, so you may want to give clues about future videos or tell a little about yourself. This can be a great way to get subscribers. You can also encourage people to subscribe at the end of each video."

      "content": "Avoid posting spam on other people's accounts. While it may seem like a quick way to find followers, it may actually deter people from engaging with your account. Spamming includes constantly commenting on other peoples videos with the same message or something irrelevant to their videos."

      "title": "Stay confident in the face of negativity.",
      "content": "Stay confident in the face of negativity. YouTube can be a great place but can also be very demoralizing. The best thing to do when receiving a nasty comment is to delete their comment, block the commenter and never respond to them. Keep your head held high and don't let anybody bring you down. Decide whether you'll even leave a video open to commenting. Don't take any of the mean comments personally. Civility is the byword. Focus more on the positive comments, rather than the negative ones."

      "title": "Review relevant products or items.",
      "content": "Review relevant products or items. If you want to do reviews on your channel, keep up with the latest version that interests you. Keep your video simple to engage followers for longer. Try to compare it to other similar products. Talk about the differences and what you like about it and what you don't. If your review videos are already getting a lot of views, then consider asking brands to provide you with new or unreleased products for you to review. This will give your videos an edge. To promote interactions on your video ask people to comment with their thoughts on the product you were reviewing."
