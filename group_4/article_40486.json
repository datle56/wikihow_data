      "content": "Consider any cost concerns about this setup. If you don't already have a second monitor to make a stacked monitor setup, they can be expensive to purchase. You must also factor in the cost of a monitor stand that can hold multiple monitors. Add your current monitors to your setup, if they're still in good condition. This will help cut down on costs from having to buy three new monitors. If you have a working monitor that you don't want to include in your new setup, consider selling, donating, or giving away your old monitor(s). If you don't want to repurpose the monitor, bring it to an electronics recycling facility instead of throwing it in the trash."

Two monitors are on the bottom in landscape orientation, and the third monitor is floated above them with a monitor arm.

      "content": "Square This configuration also has two horizontal monitors and one vertical, but requires a monitor arm. This setup is a bit more aesthetic, but is still very functional. The two horizontal monitors are stacked one on top of the other on a monitor arm, and the vertical monitor is to either the left or right of the horizontal ones. If all the monitors are similar size, they will make a square-ish shape."

For example, if your monitor has a VGA port but your GPU only has HDMI and DisplayPort ports, you'll need either an HDMI cord and an HDMI to VGA adapter, or you'll need a VGA cord and a VGA to HDMI adapter."

      "content": "Plug each display cable into your GPU. Be sure to plug the cables into the ports on your graphics card, not your motherboard. If your motherboard has integrated graphics, you can plug one monitor into the HDMI port on the motherboard. It's best to plug your main monitor into the dedicated graphics card, however, for the best picture quality. Gamers may also notice dropped frames in their games if their side monitor is connected to the motherboard. If you're using a laptop as a monitor you will likely need a USB display adapter, unless your laptop has a display port. Many newer laptops have eschewed display ports (such as HDMI and VGA), but some models may still have them. If you don't have the space to plug each monitor into your computer, you can also try connecting them in a daisy chain . Daisy chaining only works if your GPU and all of your monitors have either DisplayPort or Thunderbolt ports."
