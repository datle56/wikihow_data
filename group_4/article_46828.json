      "content": "Locate a nearby ATM using map software. If possible, find an ATM that matches the bank that issued your debit card (like using a Chase debit card at a Chase ATM). Though you can use your debit card at any ATM, you may be charged additional fees for withdrawing money from an ATM that’s not affiliated with your bank. Some ATM services, like depositing cash, may only be available at ATMs that match your bank. You may also be charged additional fees by your bank and the ATM itself.

Make sure the area is well-lit; in most cases, you won’t have to worry about your safety, but be on your guard and stand in front of the ATM so that your screen and key presses are not visible to anyone around you.

      "content": "Insert your card into the ATM with the card’s chip facing forward. In most cases, your card will be a debit card. [3] X Research source Debit cards are most frequently used in ATMs and are linked directly to your bank account—so the money you withdraw will come from that account. [4] X Research source Some credit cards can also be used at ATMs, but the money comes from the card’s line of credit, so the ATM transaction will appear on your credit card bill. [5] X Research source If you accidentally insert the card incorrectly, simply remove it, flip it in a different direction, and try again. The ATM may also have a diagram or animation showing the correct way to insert the card."

      "content": "Withdraw cash from the ATM. Depending on the ATM, you’ll have the option for a “Fast Cash” withdrawal or a regular withdrawal. Fast Cash allows you to quickly select and withdraw a certain amount of cash from a list of common amounts—such as $40, $60, or $100. A regular withdrawal allows you to type an exact amount of cash to withdraw. [8] X Research source If you use your debit card at an ATM affiliated with your bank, you can select which account you want the withdrawal to come from. For example, if you have a checking and a savings account, you can choose to withdraw money from your savings account instead of the checking account that’s normally linked to the debit card. Be careful not to exceed your withdrawal limits. Most ATMs and banks limit how much cash you can withdraw at a time, or per day. The exact limit depends on your bank and the ATM you’re using.

Your deposit may not be immediately available, or only a portion of it may be available at first. It may take a few days before the full amount is made available. Most ATMs don’t allow you to deposit checks and cash at the same time. If you want to deposit both cash and checks, you’ll need to do two separate deposits.
