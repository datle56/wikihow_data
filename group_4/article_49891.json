      "content": "Put the date flush with the left margin. For formal letters, use a block letter format. In block format , everything is aligned to the left margin of the page to create a neat look. Different parts of the letter are separated by spaces, and there are no indentations.

      "content": "Place your date 1 to 2 lines after the sender’s address. After the sender’s address is written, skip 1 to 2 lines to leave a neat space before writing the date. If you’re typing your letter, hit enter once or twice. [3] X Research source Use the same formatting throughout the rest of your letter. For example, if you skipped 1 line between the address and the date, skip 1 line between the date and the recipient’s information . Consistent formatting will make your letter look neat and organized. If you’re using a professional letterhead that includes the sender’s address in the header, your date will be written first in your letter."

    {
      "title": "Write out the full date with no abbreviations.",
      "content": "Write out the full date with no abbreviations. For formal letters, don’t use abbreviated months or all numbers. For example, “January” should not be abbreviated to “Jan” or “01.” Be sure to write out the entire month. [4] X Research source If both you and your recipient of the letter are in the U.S., Belize, or Micronesia, write your date in month-date-year format. For instance, if your letter were dated 02/23/2019, you would write the date as \"February 23, 2019.\" [5] X Research source In much of the rest of the world, including Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, or most of Central America, the preferred format is date-month-year, which looks like \"23 February, 2019.\" If both you and the recipient live somewhere where this format is used, opt for this style. [6] X Research source If you live where one format is used and the recipient lives somewhere that the other format is preferred, you can choose which one you'd rather use. You can also sidestep the issue by using a year-month-date format, or \"2019 February 23,\" if you'd like."

      "content": "Place the date one tab right of center in semi-formal letters. Semi-formal letters often use modified block format. In modified block format, the sender’s address, date, sign off and signature begin to the right of the center of the page.

      "content": "Skip 1 to 2 lines after the sender’s address to write your date. Similar to a block format, you’ll want to leave a little space between the sender’s address and the date. Whether you skip 1 line or 2, do the same when spacing between different parts in the rest of your letter. [8] X Research source If you’re typing your semi-formal letter, an existing template in a word processing program can help you format your letter . If you're including the recipient's address, or inside address, as you would in a professional semi-formal letter, it goes 2 lines below the date. If you're omitting that, the next line will be the salutation, including the recipient's courtesy title."

You can choose to write your date in numerical form, like \"01-31-2019,\" or an abbreviated form, like \"31 Jan 2019.\" Pick any format you like. [12] X Research source There are a few ways to write the date numerically. You can separate the numbers with hyphens(-), slashes(/) or periods(.). For example, \"January 31, 2019\" might be written in the US format as \"01-31-2019,\" \"01/31/2019,\" or \"01.31.2019.\" [13] X Research source You can also shorten numbers in an informal letter. \"January 31, 2019\" might be written as \"1/31/19,\" eliminating the zero and part of the year."
