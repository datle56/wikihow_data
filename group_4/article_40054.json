      "content": "Boiling removes calcium carbonate from hard water. Fill a clean pot or kettle with water and place it on a stove burner set to high. Allow the water to boil for a few minutes, then turn off the heat. [1] X Research source Let the water cool, then use a spoon to scoop the sediment off the top of the water before transferring it to a clean container. The sediment will most likely be white and chalky. That’s the calcium leaving the water. [2] X Research source Boiling doesn’t get rid of all the impurities in hard water, just temporary hardness caused by calcium, magnesium, and other minerals.

      "content": "Some foods become tough and rubbery when cooked in hard water. While baking soda can’t soften water completely, it will help alter the pH level to a more natural state. [5] X Research source Fill up a pot of water and add 1 tsp (5.6 g) of baking soda when you’re cooking dried beans and peas for a better taste and texture. [6] X Research source Soft water also enhances the flavors and aromas in your cooking. Bathe in baking soda water to reduce itching caused by hard water. Sprinkle 1/4 cup (32 g) of baking soda into your bath, then soak in it.

      "content": "Apple cider vinegar removes mineral buildup on your skin and hair. Apple cider vinegar (ACV) may balance your skin’s pH levels. [8] X Research source It also contains chelating agents that bond to and remove excess minerals. [9] X Research source Add 1 ⁄ 2 US tbsp (7.4 mL) of ACV to 1 cup (8 oz) of water and pour it over your body as a final rinse after you finish bathing or showering. To remove more buildup from your hair, mix 3 to 4 US tbsp (44 to 59 mL) with 2 c (470 mL) of water. After shampooing, apply the mixture from your roots to tips. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then rinse and apply conditioner as normal. Try to avoid using ACV as a rinse if you have open wounds or cracked skin. The acidity might increase irritation. Relieve eczema by mixing 1 c (240 mL) ACV into a tub of lukewarm bath water, soaking the affected areas for 15 to 20 minutes, and rinsing with cool water."

Shower filters are also effective at neutralizing unpleasant smells, and they are specially designed to work with high temperatures and flow rates. To install one, remove the old shower head and follow the instructions provided to install the new one. [10] X Research source Some online shower head sellers may make misleading claims about how much they improve water quality. [11] X Research source Look for filters that include evidence to back up their claims. To know exactly what minerals your water contains, try testing it with water hardness testing strips. You can pick up testing strips at your local hardware store."

      "content": "Washing soda, or sodium carbonate, can temporarily soften your water. When you throw a load into your washing machine, sprinkle washing soda over your clothes to reduce calcium and magnesium in your laundry. Washing soda also helps lift dirt and grime from fabric, so it can lead to cleaner clothes. [12] X Research source The carbonate ions from washing soda dissolve the calcium and magnesium ions in hard water, leading to softer water. Try to only use washing soda in your laundry, not anywhere else. Long-term washing soda use can lead to limescale buildup, which can clog pipes in heating systems. You can also add ¼ cup (62.5 g) Epsom salt to your laundry to soften the water. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Descaling your faucets can extend their lifespan. Hard water can lead to limescale buildup, which reduces water pressure in faucets. To descale a shower head or faucet, fill a plastic bag with distilled white vinegar and attach it to the opening with a rubber band. Wait 1 hour, then remove the bag and rinse the area. [14] X Research source Hard water can also lower the efficiency and lifespan of appliances that use water, like coffeemakers and fridges. Consult each appliance’s manual to see how to descale it. House cleaning professional Andrii Gurskyi says you can remove orange residue in the shower from hot water by scrubbing it with white vinegar, hot water, and a toothbrush. Aim to descale your faucets, appliances, and other areas prone to buildup once a month."

      "content": "These kinds of softeners are usually installed by a professional. Ion exchange softeners have resin beads that water flows through and traps excess minerals. [15] X Research source For whole-house softeners, you may be required by law to hire a professional who can install it in your home. [16] X Research source Home ion exchangers are ideal for hard water rated medium to very hard. They are one of the most common choices for improving household water. You may want to run a hard water test first to note the kinds of minerals in your water. Some softening systems may be better at removing certain contaminants than others. Prices vary according to model and region, but these kinds of softeners generally run between $500 and $6,000. [17] X Research source"

The filter will separate the impurities from the water and leave only the softened water in your tank. [18] X Research source Most aquarium-sized reverse osmosis filters cost around $60. There are reverse osmosis filters that can fit on your home’s water supply—the average cost of these is around $2,200. [19] X Research source"

Over time, the humic acid and the tanning agents in the moss will soften the water and filter it.

Try not to lower the pH of your water for hard water fish species like guppies or mollies. [23] X Research source"
