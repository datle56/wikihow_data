Freezing heavy cream is a great option if you plan on making sauces, soups, or baked goods (cakes, biscuits, etc.). Note : Freezing heavy cream alters its texture, making it more grainy. This can make it harder to whip and churn, so it might not be a good option if you plan on making whipped cream or butter. [18] X Research source"
