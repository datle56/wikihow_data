      "content": "Sit up straight with your elbows bent at a 90-degree angle. Touch typing involves a lot of muscle memorization, but it also involves good posture, too. Find a comfortable chair that supports your back, where you can sit upright for long periods of time. Keep your elbows bent at right angles, and curl your fingers over the keyboard so it’s easier to type. [1] X Research source Additionally, try to keep your head about an arm’s length away from the screen, while keeping your wrists straight and your fingers curled. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have poor posture, you may have more difficulty typing. It may help to use a wrist pad to support your hands. Many typists also prefer to keep their feet propped up on a footrest."

      "content": "Curl your fingers on the “home” keys, or “ASDF” and “JKL;.” Meet the home keys, which are the most important keys used during touch typing. These will help you find your way around the keyboard. Keep in mind that there are different home keys for different fingers. You can identify the home row by finding the lifted ridges on the “F” and “J” keys. On your left hand, place your pinky finger on the “A” key; your ring finger onto the “S” key; your middle finger onto the “D” key; and your pointer finger onto the “F” key. On your right hand, place your pinky finger onto the semicolon key; your ring finger onto the “L” key; your middle finger onto the “K” key; and your pointer finger onto the “J” key."

Use your left pointer finger to touch the “V,” “B,” “R,” “T,” “5,” and “6” keys and your left middle finger to touch the “E,” “C,” and “4” keys. Try to touch the “W,” “X,” and “3” keys with your left ring finger, while using your left pinky to touch the “Q,” “Z,” “1,” and “2” keys. [3] X Research source"

Use your right pointer finger to touch the “H,” “N,” “M,” “U,” “Y, and “7” keys, then use your right middle finger to touch the “comma,” “I,” and “8” keys. Aim to use your right ring finger to touch the “O,” “9,” and “period” keys, while using your right pinky finger to touch the “0,” “P,” “backslash,” “apostrophe,” “minus sign,” “equal sign,” and both bracket keys.

After pressing on these upper keys, bring your fingers back to the home row. [5] X Research source Practice slowly moving your fingers up a row, and then moving them back to the home row. Your left pinky will touch “Q” and “1,” your left ring finger will touch “W” and “2,” your middle finger will touch “E” and “3,” and your left pointer finger will touch “R,” “T,” “4,” and “5.” Your right pointer finger will touch “Y,” “U,” “6,” and “7,” your middle finger will touch “I” and “8,” your ring finger will touch “O” and “9,” and your right pinky will touch “P” and “0.”"

[6] X Research source For reference, your left pinky will tap the “Z” key, your left ring finger will tap the “X” key, your left middle finger will touch the “C” key, and your left pointer finger will touch the “V” and “B” keys.
