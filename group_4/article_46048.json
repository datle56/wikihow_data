If you're connecting to a private server (such as to manage a website or upload documents for a project), you'll need a username and password to sign in. If you're using FileZilla to manage a website, the FTP username and password might be different than what you use to log in to your web admin panel. Check your web admin panel for an \"FTP Accounts\" section (or similar) to find your FTP username and password."

But some servers require SFTP (Secure Shell File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP over SSL) to encrypt all file transfers. Unless your provider or server host has told you otherwise, this is usually just FTP."
