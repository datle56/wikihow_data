      "content": "Sentence starters help maintain the flow and coherence of a paragraph. Sentence starters, or words and phrases that are meant to grab readers’ attention at the beginning of a sentence, are extremely important in connecting the various ideas throughout your writing in a smooth and coherent way. A good sentence starter lets readers know ahead of time what kind of content they should be expecting. For example, a transition word such as “additionally” hints to readers that you’re about to present them with new information. [1] X Research source Sentence starters are typically set apart from the rest of the sentence by a comma. Sentence starters also provide key details that provide readers with important context or background information. For example, in the sentence, “Gasping for breath, John trudged up the hill,” the sentence starter “Gasping for breath” provides readers with more details about John’s state. Using a variety of sentence starters is a great way to keep your writing from sounding too repetitive."

Phrases like, “In this essay…” “Below, you will find…” and “Here, I will discuss…” are all introductory phrases that will let your readers know that you’re about to state the main theme or argument of your overall essay. Some examples of a good introductory sentence starter include: [2] X Research source In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of using disposable plastic water bottles. Below, you will find a three-point argument that seeks to persuade you that smoking is bad. Here, I will attempt to argue for the continuation of standardized testing.

Sentence starters can help you wrap up all of your ideas in a neat and concise way, as well as let readers know that your writing is coming to an end. Use phrases like, “In conclusion…” “In summary…” and “Therefore…” to draw your writing to a close and give a brief summary of your main ideas. For example: [3] X Research source In conclusion, we need to stop using plastic bags for the sake of preserving wildlife. Therefore, I urge all of you to talk to your local politicians about this law. In summary, the experiment yielded extremely positive results.

This is especially helpful if you’re writing something like a recipe or listing out events in chronological order. Words like, “First…” “Next…” and “After that…” will help keep your overall writing coherent. [4] X Research source First, preheat your oven to 350ºF (176ºC). Next, lightly grease your cake pan with butter or oil. First, I met up with my friends at the nearby cafe. After that, we drove to the party.

This kind of sentence starter is helpful when you’re trying to emphasize the likeness of two objects, concepts, or pieces of evidence. For example: [5] X Research source Similarly, not getting enough sleep has also been linked to people feeling more stressed. Along those same lines, starting to study for an exam earlier will help you get a better score. Like fish, rats are extremely low-maintenance pets.

For example: [6] X Research source However, the movie also received some criticism from older viewers. On the other hand, nuclear energy might actually be better for the environment than solar energy. Then again, the exact opposite might be true. Unlike my sister, my brother enjoys studying math.

Use prepositions such as, “In…” “At…” and “Around…” along with specific times or locations to tell readers where and when the events within your sentence are occurring. For example: [8] X Research source At 6:00 p.m., he went to the dining hall to eat with his friends. In the middle of winter, a flower unexpectedly bloomed.

Use phrases like, “It’s possible that…” “However…” and “While debatable…” to let readers know you’re being cautious.

After your sentence starter, fill in your specific evidence by either using a direct quote or paraphrasing in your own words. For example: The author states that people with more hobbies tend to feel more fulfilled. According to research, people who are married tend to live longer than those who aren’t married.

An important part of picking the correct sentence starter is first deciding what the following sentence is going to be about and what you’re going to focus on. Are you trying to emphasize one specific action of a character? Are you going to provide specific examples for your readers? Before you think about your sentence starter, think about the rest of your sentence first. [15] X Research source For example, if your goal is to write a sequence of events in a way that’s easily understandable by your readers, you might choose sentence starters like, “First…” “Next…” and “To start…” Or, if you’re trying to emphasize a point to your readers, choose an adverb like, “Of course…” “Obviously…” or “Certainly…”"

      "content": "Examine the context of the surrounding sentences. In order to keep your writing flowing smoothly, it’s important that all of your sentences link together somehow to form a larger, coherent paragraph. For instance, you don’t want to be talking about the negatives of some idea and then suddenly begin talking about the positives without a good sentence starter to prepare your readers. As a general tip, look at the sentences directly before the one you’re writing to see which sentence starter you should choose. For example, if you want to talk about the negative effects of a certain medication, but were previously talking about the positive effects in the last sentence, use a sentence starter like, “However…” “On the other hand…” or “Conversely…” to show your readers you’re about to contrast the two. Or, if you think the idea you presented in the previous sentence could use some clarification, choose a sentence starter like, “In other words…” “For example…” or “To clarify…”"

      "content": "Determine the contexts of each individual paragraph. If you’re writing something like an essay or academic paper, transition words and good sentence starters between paragraphs are the key to making your overall writing smooth and comprehensible. As you write an outline for your paper , determine what the main point of each paragraph will be, then choose the appropriate sentence starters that fit best within each one. For example, your paper might start with your introduction and thesis (“In this essay…”), then move on to a paragraph comparing and contrasting two arguments (“Similarly…” “However…”). After that, you might have a paragraph that provides more specific examples (“For instance…”), and then end with your concluding paragraph (“To summarize…”)."

      "title": "Determine what information is vital to your readers’ understanding.",
      "content": "Determine what information is vital to your readers’ understanding. Sentence starters not only improve the flow of your writing, but they also sometimes provide key information that will help your readers better understand the plot or main message of your writing. For instance, if you’re writing a fictitious story, providing lots of descriptive details about the story’s setting or your characters at the beginning of your sentences will help readers better picture what’s going on. You can’t always assume that your readers know what you know or are picturing the scene exactly as you are. Good, descriptive sentence starters will keep your readers hooked and help them follow along with your story and logic. For example, instead of just writing, “The boy ran home,” write something like, “ Trying to hold back his tears, the boy ran home” to provide your readers with important information about how the boy is feeling."

      "content": "Use transition words only when they’re needed. Even though we’ve given you plenty of transition words that can act as great sentence starters, be sure to only use these words when they’re absolutely necessary to the context of your sentence. If you use too many, you risk overexplaining things to your readers and making sentences more complicated than they probably need to be. [16] X Research source Consider this example: “Dogs make great pets. Similarly, cats are also great to have as pets. Along those same lines, mice are also very easy to care for.” In this short paragraph, the overuse of transition words actually makes the writing choppier and a bit less understandable. Instead, write something like, “Dogs make great pets. Similarly, cats and mice are also great to have as pets and are easy to care for.” Be sure to also use a variety of transition words and sentence starters instead of choosing just one and using it 3 or 4 times within the same paragraph. Using different sentence starters will keep your writing from sounding repetitive."

      "content": "Adverbs Many sentence starters are conjunctive adverbs, which are transition words or phrases that modify an entire sentence. Phrases such as, “For example…” “In addition…” and “Therefore…” are all examples of adverbs. Words that end in -ly , such as “Certainly…” “Unfortunately…” and “Additionally…” are also adverbs that come at the beginning of a sentence, and you usually separate them from the rest of the sentence with a comma. For example: [17] X Research source In addition , I will also be staying for an extra 10 minutes to answer questions. Therefore , it’s extremely important to wash your hands. Of course , you might be more comfortable sitting instead of standing. Unfortunately , we don’t have enough books for each person. Similarly , we’ll also look at other works from the same author.

Starting a sentence with a gerund allows you to give your readers more descriptive details about the subject of your sentence. When forming your sentence, write your gerund first in a short phrase, then place a comma between that phrase and your longer sentence. For instance: [18] X Research source Running as fast as he possibly could, Jack rushed to find his friends. Smiling softly, she hugged her mother. Thinking about his past, Rob wondered why he chose the career he did."

      "content": "Past participles Past participles are verbs that typically end in -ed and indicate that an event has happened in the past and is complete. For example, “loved,” “completed,” and “managed” are all past participles. Place a past participle at the beginning of your sentence to give a more detailed description of your sentence’s subject. For example: [19] X Research source Loved by many, the King made sure to listen to each of his subjects’ problems. Injured after the fire, the man was unable to return to his job. Viewed by more than 1 million people, the group’s music video became a hit."

Some good adjectives to use include words like, “irritated,” “confused,” and “bored.” Place the adjective at the beginning of the sentence, then follow up with a comma and your main sentence. For example: [20] X Research source Bored , Jenny called her friends and asked them to hang out. Confused , Dave went to ask his teacher what he was supposed to do.

Starting your sentence with a simile is a great way to add some colorful descriptions to your writing and really catch your readers’ attention. For example: [21] X Research source As fierce as a lion , he charged into battle. Like a flower , the girl grew up to be a beautiful woman. Slow as a sloth , the man took forever to finish his work. Sleeping like a log , my brother didn’t wake up even when they started setting off fireworks."

      "content": "Prepositions A preposition is a word that connects a noun in a sentence to another element. Use prepositional phrases such as “after,” “on,” “beneath,” and “before” to provide details about the location or time at the very start of your sentence. The prepositions “with” and “without” are also great ways to start a sentence to better describe the state of something. For example: [22] X Research source Before we left, we went to go visit our favorite cafe one last time. Around lunchtime, Frank’s mother called him with good news. At 7 p.m., Christian left to go pick up his brother. In the small conference room, Amy waited anxiously for her coworkers to arrive. Near the lake, the friends set up their campsite and started building a fire. Outside of the arena, a fight broke out. With the help of my best friend, I was able to get really great concert tickets.

Infinitive verbs are usually preceded by “to,” such as, “to see,” “to eat,” and “to do.” Place the infinitive phrase at the very beginning of your sentence, then place a comma after it before writing the rest of your sentence. [23] X Research source To lose weight, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet. To get the highest score, you need to practice every single day. To find the restaurant, open the message I sent you and put the address into your GPS."

      "content": "Onomatopoeias Onomatopoeias are words that resemble the sounds they represent. Words like, “crash,” “boom,” and “splash” are all examples of onomatopoeias. When you start your sentence off with one of these sound words, you’re more likely to catch your readers’ attention while also adding a fun and creative element in describing the events taking place. For example: [24] X Research source BOOM ! The car erupted in a fiery explosion. Splash . The boy watched as the mermaid dove back into the dark ocean. Squawk ! Johny’s parrot let out a loud cry."
