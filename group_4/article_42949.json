Examining your crab for signs of dry skin can keep your crab from drying out and ensure it can breathe properly. Signs of dry skin in hermit crabs can include: Lack of water in the tank or on a sponge Matte appearance to the skin Excessive burrowing to get at moist spots in the tank"

If your hermit crab isn’t moving around much, the water in its habitat or even toxic paint on its shell could be killing it. [2] X Research source Lethargy can also be a sign of stress. [3] X Research source Recognize that most hermit crabs like to play and will move around their habitats a lot if they are not molting or sick. Make sure your hermit crab is moving regularly and not hanging out of its shell, which can be a signal that it is dying. Remember that lack of movement can also signal molting. [4] X Research source"

Be aware that there are “good” and harmless mites that inhabit crab’s spaces and bodies but that there are also “bad” and harmful mites. Watch out for the following types of harmful mites: Gill mites, which are light pink or red and bury into the gills of hermit crabs. These mites are often not visible until after a hermit crab’s death because a flap of skin protects the gills of live animals. Crab mites, which glue themselves to soft parts of hermit crabs’ bodies including the eyes, mouth, or joints. Crab mites range in color from white to cream, grey, pink, or red."
