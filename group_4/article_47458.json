Wax has a tougher time adhering to dirt and moisture than it does the spanking clean surface of a clean car."

      "content": "For dull, scratched, or otherwise damaged paint, consider using rubbing or polishing compound before waxing. Rubbing and polishing compounds are slight abrasives that actually remove a fine layer of clear coat from your vehicle in order to achieve a smooth layer and even coloring. Polishing compound is less abrasive than rubbing compound, making it better suited for pre-wax treatment. Use a damp microfiber cloth to rub the polishing compound lightly over the entirety of the car and then another microfiber cloth to remove the compound."

In very hot weather, the wax dries instantly as soon as you apply it to the car, making buffing quite difficult. This can also make the wax difficult to remove once applied. In colder weather, the wax is hard to move around and apply to the car itself. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Wax in a garage, preferably out of direct sunlight. Mostly for temperature reasons (addressed above), it's best to wax your car indoors so that the rays of the sun don't interfere with the waxing. Sunlight can heat up the car in addition to leaving waxy residue on the car which becomes difficult to remove. If you can, wax in your garage, where the temperature is more or less controlled and the rays don't penetrate. If you don't have a garage, find a spot in the shade of a tree or building to work, pick an overcast day, or work in the cool of morning or evening."

Ideally, the ones containing genuine carnauba prove to be the best products [ citation needed ] although they are usually a little more expensive. But there are other kinds of wax that you may also want to know about: \"Cleaner wax\" is generally a little less expensive, but also proves to be harsher. Cleaner waxes often remove clear coat from your car. [3] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If you're using this kind of wax on your car, consider removing the polishing step from your pre-wax maintenance. Spray waxes go on easier, but of course there's a downside: They don't last nearly as long. Tested varieties of spray waxes tended to last only a couple weeks before succumbing to the elements.

      "content": "Place some wax onto the foam applicator that came with the wax. A silver dollar-sized amount should work fine for each 2' x 2' (60cm x 60cm) section of your car. Just to be sure, check the manufacturer's directions as a reference. How much wax should you use? Err on the side of less , not more. Applying too much wax is a common mistake. It creates more waste, is harder to remove, and leaves gunky buildup. A thinner layer of wax actually bonds better with the surface of the car. [5] X Research source If your car wax didn't come with a foam applicator, try a damp sponge. It's not the greatest applicator, but it'll do the job in a pinch. It should go without saying, but if you decide to use a sponge, don't use it to clean dishes afterward."

This may require waxing or buffing in sections, stopping, and then wiping away wax. Here's a good way that you can tell whether the wax is ready to come off. Make a swipe in the wax with your finger. If it smears, the wax isn't ready to come off yet. If it's clear, you're ready to take the wax off."

This is another way of saying that each car is different, and that knowing when to wax again will depend on your eyes and touch, not on what the manufacturer says. Manufacturers have a financial incentive to overestimate how much you'll need to use your wax product. They'll often err on the side of applying more often, because it means you'll go through product quicker, and ultimately spend more money. On the other hand, some waxes won't have a long half-life on certain cars and may need to be reapplied with greater frequency."
