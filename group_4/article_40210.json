      "content": "Use yassass as a formal greeting to strangers. Yassass means \"hello.\" When you're greeting someone you don't know, it's more polite to use this formal version. This is especially true if the person is older than you, or in a position of authority. [2] X Research source For younger people or friends, you can say yassou instead. You can also just say yah , which equates more to \"hi\" in English. Yassass is also the plural form of \"hello.\" Use it if you are greeting a group of people generally."

Some of these phrases are used both coming and going from a place. [3] X Research source Kali mera means \"good morning\" or \"good day.\" It is typically used only before noon. Kali spera means \"good afternoon.\" Use it after noon, before nightfall. Kali nikta means \"good night.\" It isn't typically used as a greeting.

      "content": "Say herete only in extremely formal settings. This is a very formal way of saying \"hello,\" and as such it isn't commonly used among Greeks or within Greece. However, if you are in a formal setting or addressing someone of importance, it may be appropriate. If greeting someone who is a government official, teacher, member of the military, or member of the clergy, start with this greeting. If they are comfortable with you addressing them in a less formal way, they will let you know."

When you greet someone in Greek, they may say kalo sorisateh , which means \"welcome.\" In the afternoon, you may also hear kalo vrathi , which means \"wishing you a pleasant evening.\" [4] X Research source For example, if you were entering a shop and said yassass , the shop-owner might reply kalo sorisateh . Upon leaving, if you say kali nikta (good night), you may hear the response kalo ximeroma , which means \"wishing you a good dawn\" or \"wishing you a good tomorrow.\""

[7] X Research source To tell the person your name, you can either say to onoma mou (my name is) or my lenne (I am called), followed by your name. These phrases are interchangeable.

If you get these under your belt, you'll already be able to pronounce nearly half of the Greek alphabet. [14] X Research source The vowels a (alpha, Α α) and e (epsilon, Ε ε) are equivalent to the short version of these vowels in English. Alpha sounds like the a in the English word \"father.\" Epsilon sounds like the e in the English word \"pet.\" Both omicron (Ο ο) and omega (Ω ω) have an o sound, similar to the o in the English word \"got.\" The Greek letters zeta (Ζ ζ), kappa (Κ κ), mu (Μ μ), nu (Ν ν), and tau (Τ τ) look like the Latin letters z , k , m , n , and t , and share the same sounds. Lambda (Λ λ) does not look like the Latin l , but is pronounced the same. It sounds like the l in the English word \"lap.\" Pi (Π π) does not look like the Latin p , but is pronounced the same. It sounds like the p in the English word \"pot.\" Sigma (Σ σ/ς) does not look like the Latin s , but is pronounced the same.

While the Greek alphabet shares many commonalities with the Latin alphabet, there are letters that may have a different pronunciation than what you would expect.

[15] X Research source Eta (Η η), iota (Ι ι), and upsilon (Υ υ) are the 3 i letters in the Greek alphabet. They are all pronounced like the ee in the English word \"meet.\" You may be tempted to pronounce beta (Β β) the way you would an English b . However, this Greek letter actually has a v sound, as in the English word \"vet.\" Theta (Θ θ) has a th sound, similar to the th in the English word \"think.\" Delta (Δ δ) also has a th sound, but it is softer, similar to the th in the English word \"this.\" Ksi (Ξ ξ) has a ks sound, similar to the x in the English word \"fox.\" This letter is always pronounced the same, regardless of where it appears in a word. Phi (Φ φ) has an f sound, similar to the f in the English word \"fat.\" Chi (Χ χ) sounds similar to the ch in the Scottish word \"loch.\" If followed by either an e or an i , it sounds more like the ch in the German word \"ich.\" Psi (Ψ ψ) has a ps sound, similar to the ps in the English word \"lopsided.\" The sound of the letter does not change, regardless of where it appears in a word."

When followed by an a , o , or u , the letter g has a \"soft g\" sound. There is no equivalent sound in the English language.
