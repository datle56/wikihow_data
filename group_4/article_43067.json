That said, if you want to be sensitive about it, then you have to put some thought into finding the right time and place to tell her. You don’t want to catch her off guard if she’s in the middle of talking to her friends and you try to pull her away, or if she’s prepping for her math test next period. Instead, pick a place that will give you some privacy and a time when she’s not distracted, busy, or stressed out."

Though you don’t want to lead her on by telling her she’s the most beautiful girl you’ve ever seen, you may want to soften her up a bit before you tell her you don’t like her. Just say something like, “You know I think you’re an amazing girl” or “I always love talking to you” to let her know that you do care for her without saying anything that sounds too romantic. Choose your words carefully in advance so you don’t give her the wrong idea. [2] X Research source As you say it, make sure to keep your distance, so she doesn’t think you’re coming on to her. You should have closed body language and turn away from her a bit to let her know that you’re not looking to get intimate. You should keep eye contact to be respectful, but don’t stare into her eyes so intensely that she gets the wrong message."

Don’t dilly dally with too much small talk or she may be confused or she may even get her hopes up, thinking that you might ask her out. Just be as honest as you can without hurting her feelings. Make it clear that you’re telling her the news because you want to be honest and want to minimize the pain she’s feeling. Take a deep breath and come out with it. [3] X Expert Source Cher Gopman Dating Coach Expert Interview. 17 May 2019. You can say something like, “I know you have feelings for me, and I’m sorry to say that I don’t feel the same way. I respect you too much to not let you know and I didn’t want you to hear it from someone else.”"

However, the girl in front of you may be hurting a lot, and you should have enough respect for her not to walk away immediately. If she wants to share her feelings with you, let her do it, as long as things don’t get too heated and emotional. [4] X Research source You can say something like, “I’m really sorry you feel that way,” but you shouldn’t feel the need to apologize too much. After all, you can’t really help what you’re feeling. If she gets really upset, you can comfort a bit, but you should try to cut the conversation short. You don’t want to give her the wrong impression."

But if you’ve already been friends or she just seems like a cool girl, then you can tell her you’d like to be friends or that you’d like to still be friends. Of course, she may roll her eyes or be upset in the heat of the moment, since this is a thing so many guys say without meaning it, but if you really do mean it, then let her know you’d like to be friends, and this will be possible once she has some time to get over you. Just say something like, “I think you’re a really cool girl and would love to be friends. But I understand that it may not happen for a while.” You can also say, “I know everyone always says they’d like to be friends, but I really mean it.”"

You can thank the girl for talking to you, remind her you want to be friends if that’s the case, walk her back to where she was hanging out, or just try to say something positive. If it doesn’t feel too corny or false, you can even try to make her laugh, though it may not work in the moment. The most important thing is that you leave the conversation on a positive note, so the girl doesn’t walk away thinking you’re a total jerk. You can say, “I hope you feel better soon. I really do mean that.” You can also say, “I’m really flattered by how you feel.” You don’t have to say something corny like, “I know the right guy will come along soon” because she may roll her eyes at that.

If you really do want to keep being friends with her, then you should probably take some time off before you ask her to hang out with you or with you and a group of friends. She may need a few weeks, or even a few months or more, to truly get over you, and just the sight of you may make her heart ache a little bit. Though you should still be friendly when you see her, let her take the initiative to let you know when she’s ready to hang out with you again. When you do see her, just give her a wave and a smile and say, “How are you?” If she’s visibly cold and upset, then don’t push it. If she doesn’t ever want to be friends because she’s too hurt, then you should respect that too. If she still continues to pursue you after you've told her how you feel, you can be more direct about your lack of interest and set boundaries around your time together.

If you want to give the girl the respect she deserves, then you really should tell her you don’t like her in person. However, there may be some circumstances that may lead to you telling her how you feel a different way. Maybe she lives in a different town or you won’t have a chance to see each other for a while. Maybe you really don’t know her very well and don’t want to spend some solo time with her though you do want her to get the message. Whatever the case is, make sure you think long and hard about whether or not you really should tell her in person before you give her the news.

Just get her number from one of her friends if you don’t have it (without making it look like you want to ask her out!) and tell her the news as nicely and as sweetly as possible. Just say something similar to what you would tell her in person, something like, “I’m really flattered that you like me, but I thought you deserve to know I don’t feel the same way” and wait to hear what she has to say. Though this won’t be easy, you’ll feel better when you deliver the news and may find it just a bit less uncomfortable than telling her in person. Just say something like, “This isn’t easy, but I wanted to tell you that I don’t like you romantically. I’m sorry to break the news to you, but I really thought you should know.”"

However, if she’s really persistent and you just want her to get the message, you can send her a quick text to tell her the news so you both can move on. She’ll appreciate that you took the time to tell her yourself instead of leaving the dirty work to someone else.

Though email may not be the most personal way to tell her how you feel, it can be appropriate if you already have an email relationship and it can let you express your feelings a bit more thoroughly than a text message. Just keep it short and sweet and tell her that you don’t return her feelings while leaving the message on a positive note.

Simply tell her how you feel without spending too much time on small talk. If you chat with her for 20 minutes before breaking the bad news, then she may think that you actually want to get to know her or that you even want to ask her out. Just a simple, “Hi, how are you?” can get the conversation going and can quickly get you to say what you want to say. Come out with it quickly. When you’re online, you don’t have to craft a brilliant sentence. Just tell her you don’t like her while being as nice as possible. You can avoid directly saying “I don’t like you” and say something like, “I don’t feel the same way” to soften the blow."

This can feel a bit more personal than emailing or texting her, because she’ll see that you took the time to write it in your own handwriting and that you chose your words carefully. You should keep the note short and sweet and make sure to give it to her at the end of the school day so you know she won’t read it in the middle of class and won’t get upset in public. Just write 2 or 3 sentences telling her that you don’t have feelings for her and make sure to sign your name. Make sure you give it to her yourself so someone else doesn’t end up reading it."

Put yourself in her shoes — if you really liked a girl, how would it feel to find out that she doesn’t feel the same way from someone else?

Though it may be hard to get her completely alone, do the best you can to keep your news private so you cause as little pain as you can.

If you don’t mean it, then don’t say something like, “I’m just not ready for a relationship right now, but maybe we can date in the future” or “You’re the perfect girl for me but I just can’t let myself fall in love” or “I just need some time to get over someone right now.” Though you may think that this softens the blow, it actually will prolong her pain, and you should avoid making any declarations you don’t mean just because you think it’ll make the conversation easier. Make it clear that you don’t have romantic feelings for her and that you won’t have them at a future date, either. The sooner she knows this, the sooner she’ll be able to move on.

You should also avoid telling her you don’t like her because you like some hotter girl in your grade. Just tell her you don’t return her feelings and keep it at that.
