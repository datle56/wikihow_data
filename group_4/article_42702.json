Prove that you’ve taken the time to read her bio by mentioning something in it. [21] X Research source Feel free to make your message a bit funny and self-deprecating. For example, if her bio says she’s into karaoke, you can say something like, “I see you’re a karaoke star. Is horrible off-key singing a deal-breaker for you? Asking for a friend ;)” For example, if her bio says she likes to watch Friends, you could say, “So are you more of a Rachel, a Phoebe, or a Monica?” If it says she likes reading, ask her what’s her favorite book she’s read recently. If she doesn’t have anything specific in her bio, ask her a question on one of her photos. For example, “That view looks gorgeous! Where is it?”"
