According to color psychology, certain colors impact the way that humans behave, emote, and perceive other people and situations. Different colors may evoke a specific emotion or strong reaction in you‚Äîso when it comes to your favorite color, it can reveal something about what emotions you prefer to feel or what values you hold. In turn, this psychological information can reveal a lot of information about your personality! [16] X Research source For example, research shows that humans associate shades of blue, green, and purple with coolness, calm, professionalism, and confidence. If your favorite color is among this group, you may prefer feelings of serenity or tranquility and value tradition and respectability. Warm colors like red, orange, and yellow, on the other hand, are often perceived by the human brain as expressive, energetic, and passionate. If your favorite color is a shade of red, orange, or yellow, your personality may be more extroverted and you may pursue a lot of creative pursuits. Color psychology has a lot of applications outside of personality typing and testing. For instance, studies have shown that the color of a medication may impact how effective a patient believes it to be. [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Similarly, how brands and architectural designers use color can affect the trust we put in their product or the comfort we feel in their space. [18] X Research source It‚Äôs important to note that cultural context may sometimes impact how someone perceives color. In many Western cultures, for example, white is worn by brides because it‚Äôs seen as a symbol of purity and innocence. In some Eastern cultures, on the other hand, white is associated with death and mourning, making for two distinct psychological associations. [19] X Research source"
