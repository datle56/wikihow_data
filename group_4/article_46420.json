If there's an item you want to showcase in your scrapbook, but do not want to tape or glue down this item, try displaying it with a vellum pocket. Cut out a square or rectangle of vellum big enough to pocket your chosen supplies. Place the vellum onto your chosen page. Use a sewing machine to stitch around the edges of your vellum pocket. Do not stitch the top edge of the vellum. This is the opening of your pocket. Slide your materials through the top edge of the vellum. You can now display materials that are meant to be removed and examined more closely when someone pages through your scrapbook."

      "content": "Trace your favorite designs. As vellum is translucent, it is perfect for tracing existing designs or replicating a drawing that you are particularly proud of. Lay the vellum over the design and use ink or pencil to recreate the image. When tracing on vellum, you will be drawing on what is known as the \"hair side.\" This is the side of vellum that is hard and smooth. The \"skin side\" is softer and fuzzier, and should not be drawn on. Test different types of pencils on a vellum surface. You want to find a pencil that works with your chosen vellum. You want the trace marks to be thin and smooth, and you do not want lead piling up on the vellum and clogging the pores. Use tissue paper to cover areas you are not drawing on. Lead may smear during the tracing process, so tissue can help keep the lead contained."

      "title": "Paint on vellum.",
      "content": "Paint on vellum. Vellum may be used with certain painting mediums. Vellum can make a painting's colors appear shinier, and many people enjoy painting on vellum. Apply a neutral base color to the vellum before you begin painting. When dipping your brush in paint, you want to have enough to coat the vellum evenly, but not so much that you're leaving blobs of paint on the vellum. It may take a few brush strokes before you find the right amount of paint to add to your brush. Once your base coat is dry, you can begin painting you images on vellum. With vellum, you paint in layers. You add one layer of color, wait for it to dry, and then add another. Move from light colors to dark colors, and move your brush slowly over the vellum to prevent smearing and paint blobs. Use the type of brush your painting requires. To create thin lines, for example, you would need to use a thinner brush. You may have to switch between various brush types as you create your painting."

Read your printer's manual and see if there are any specific instructions for printing on unconventional types of paper. Ink can smear easily on vellum, so see if your printer has a \"draft\" or \"quick\" printing mode. These modes tend to use less ink. See if your printer lets you choose a paper type when printing. Most printers default to \"plain paper.\" Instead, select something like \"photo paper\" or \"fine art paper.\" After printing your vellum, set it aside to dry. Ink will take awhile to dry on a vellum surface, so it's important to set the paper aside to dry. Do not attempt to use vellum in crafts until the ink is dry to the touch."
