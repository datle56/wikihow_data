Squeeze the end of the loop to make it smaller and then push it through the handle. Pull the loop out on the other side of the handle until the edge of the pacifier is up against the strap. [1] X Research source The loop is often made from a thick material, such as leather, cord, or canvas. Warning: Do not pull the loop through the small holes in the pacifier, as this can be a safety hazard. These are ventilation holes that give your baby access to air in the very rare case they swallow their pacifier. So, obstructing the holes can be a choking risk.

      "content": "Find an unobtrusive spot low on your child’s clothing and pinch it. A good place is towards the bottom of your child’s shirt or sleeve of their onesie. This is also often where fabric is doubled up on onesies, so it may be a more secure place to attach the clip. Use your fingers to grasp a piece of the clothing where you want to attach the clip. [11] X Research source The clip is probably too strong for your child to undo, but it’s still a good idea to attach it somewhere they won’t be as tempted to mess with it. Warning: Do not place the clip close to your child’s neck. While the straps are kept short to prevent the risk of strangulation, there is a chance they could get wrapped around your child’s neck if placed higher up on their body."

      "content": "Attach the clip to sippy cups or snack containers instead of a pacifier. Most pacifier clips easily attach to other objects that have handles, holes, or openings. So, use the clip to keep your child’s other items easily accessible. For instance, loop the clip through sippy cups, snack containers, teething rings, toys, and even blankets. Don’t attach these items to your child’s clothing, as they’re much heavier than a pacifier. Instead, secure them to your child’s stroller, diaper bag, or your own clothes."
