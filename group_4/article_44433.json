The bone graft may be inserted into the holes drilled for a core decompression procedure.

[39] X Research source This may cause tiny breaks in the affected bone and lead to bone collapse. [40] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If AVN affects bones near a joint, the joint surface may collapse. [41] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Usually, the affected bone or joint area in AVN is the hip. [42] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source AVN occurs in bones with a terminal blood supply (meaning there is a limited blood supply), such as the femoral (hip) and humeral (shoulder) heads. Closure or interruption of this terminal blood supply will lead to death of bone tissue and, later, bone collapse. [43] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Although bone tissue regenerates or grows back again, the rate of bone destruction is faster than bone regeneration. If the bone collapses, the joint structure breaks down and leads to pain. Corticosteroids and radiation therapy may contribute to AVN.
