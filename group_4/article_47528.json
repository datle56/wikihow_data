      "content": "Go for dark neutrals if you want a balanced and stylish choice. Choose neutrals such as black, navy, and brown for a versatile sock option. These shades look great with nearly any outfit. Since the neutral is dark in tone, your outfit looks balanced overall, rather than potentially bright or loud. [1] X Research source Since your bottom choice is dark, both colored and neutral tops look great. You can also choose a charcoal grey or slate-blue colored sock for a dark, neutral choice."

This looks great for a fall or winter outfit, and you can throw on a pair of tights and slouchy beanie to keep warm. To test the length of your skirt, hold your arm to your side. If your skirt goes past your fingers, it should be an appropriate length. Use your best judgment based on the overall look of your outfit."

If you want a dramatic statement shoe, try wearing boots that are 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) shorter than the height of your socks. If you’d like, you can scrunch your socks down for a cute touch. This looks great with a stylish dress or skirt, for instance. You can go with a slightly A-line cut for a classic silhouette. Also consider wearing a pair of sheer tights underneath if you want another layer. While wearing knee-high boots is still a bold look, adding another layer keeps your look balanced and toned down."
