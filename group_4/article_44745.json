      "content": "Examine the area of the snakebite. Most snakebites occur on either the muzzle or leg of a cat. If a venomous snake has bitten your cat, her skin may have one fang mark or several fang marks at the bite site.Unfortunately, these puncture marks may be obscured Because snake venom can negatively affect the blood’s ability to clot, there will likely be bleeding at the bite site as well. [2] X Research source The closer a venomous snakebite is to the heart, the more quickly the venom will be absorbed into the body and spread through the lymphatic and circulatory systems. [3] X Research source If your cat has been bitten by a nonvenomous snake, you will see teeth marks, but not fang marks, at the bite site. Also, there will probably little to no swelling, redness, or bleeding at the site where the snake bit your cat. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Pay attention to your cat’s clinical signs. After a venomous snakebite, your cat will become lethargic and may start vomiting. She will probably start to become very weak and collapse. In addition, her muscles may begin to twitch and her pupils will start to dilate. As more time passes after the snakebite, she could exhibit even more serious signs, such as seizures, paralysis, and shock. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source Signs of shock include rapid shallow breathing, hypothermia, and a rapid heart rate. [7] X Research source Because of the amount of pain she is in, she may also be more vocal. Do not wait to see if your cat shows symptoms of a snakebite. If you saw the snake bite your cat, or if you see the bite wound, take your cat to the veterinarian immediately. The onset of clinical signs after a snakebite is usually rapid—within a few minutes to an hour of being bitten. If your cat shows no clinical signs after 60 minutes, then the snake's venom likely did not enter her system. [8] X Research source Veterinary Emergency Medicine Secrets: Rattlesnake Envenomation. Hackett &amp; Winfield. Hanley and Belfus. Your cat may not exhibit these clinical signs if she has been bitten by a nonvenomous snake. However, you should still take her to your veterinarian for treatment and monitoring."

      "content": "Try to identify the species of snake that bit your cat. In order to give the appropriate antivenin, it would be helpful for your veterinarian to know the species of the attacking snake. In the US, the most common venomous snakes are rattlesnakes, water moccasins, copperheads, and coral snakes. [9] X Research source If you witnessed the attack, stay calm and take note of the color, length, and pattern of the snake. For your safety, do not approach the snake to get a closer look. Do not try to kill the snake. You will put yourself in more danger of being bitten by approaching the snake and trying to kill it. Venomous snakes have slit-like pupils (similar to a cat), whereas non-venomous snakes have round pupils (like people). [10] X Research source The Illustrated Guide to Venomous Snakes. US Dept of the Army. Lyons Press. There are exceptions, however. For instance, the venomous coral snake has round pupils. If you are not able to identify the snake or do not know if it is venomous, assume that it is venomous. The negative effects on the cardiovascular system can cause your cat to go into shock."

      "content": "Keep your cat calm and quiet. For a snakebite from a venomous snake, keeping your cat calm and quiet is the best first aid that you can administer to your cat before she receives veterinary care. The more agitated and active she is, the more quickly the venom could spread through her body and make her even sicker. [11] X Research source It is actually recommended that keeping your cat calm and quiet is the only first aid that you should administer on your own. [12] X Research source Do not allow your cat to walk or run around as this will increase her heart rate and stimulate more blood circulation. Keep in mind that your cat may snap at you or try to bite you because of the amount of pain that she’s in."

      "title": "Do not administer first aid other than gentle pressure.",
      "content": "Do not administer first aid other than gentle pressure. Gentle pressure will help control the bleeding from the bite wound. An example of first aid that you should not administer is cutting the wound open to suck out the venom or drain the wound. [13] X Research source Not only is this ineffective, you would cause more pain and suffering for your cat. In addition, the venom could be venomous to you. Do not apply a tourniquet or compression bandage in the area near the bite wound. Do not apply ice to the bite wound. The ice does not slow the spread of the venom and can actually damage the skin. Do not wash the wound if the bite was from a venomous snake. Washing the wound could increase the absorption of the venom."

If possible, transport your cat in her carrier or a large box in which she can comfortably lie down. To help keep her calm and still during the drive to the veterinarian, loosely wrap your cat in a large towel or sheet. The effects of snake venom are usually irreversible and often begin immediately after the snakebite. [14] X Research source To increase the chances of your cat’s survival and treat the effects of the snake venom, your cat will need immediate veterinary treatment."

Your veterinarian may have a snakebite detection kit, which would allow him or her to identify what type of snake bit your cat. [15] X Research source However, in the event that your veterinarian does not have the kit, you will need to provide as much information as you can about the snake bite, such as a description of the snake, how much time has passed since the snakebite, and what clinical signs your cat started to show after being bitten."

      "content": "Allow your veterinarian to diagnose your cat. Although clinical signs and the appearance of the snakebite may seem like enough to start treatment, your veterinarian will want to run diagnostic tests to fully assess the severity of the snakebite. For example, your veterinarian will run blood tests to see how well (or poorly) your cat’s blood is clotting. He or she may also take a urine sample (snakebites can lead to blood being in the urine). Depending on how well-equipped the veterinary clinic is, your veterinarian may want to perform an electrocardiogram to assess your cat’s heart beat."

      "content": "Approve of your veterinarian’s recommended treatment plan. Because of how quickly snake venom can spread and cause damage in your cat’s body, your veterinarian may want to begin some forms of treatment immediately to stabilize your cat. Do not be surprised if your veterinarian needs to start treatment to stabilize your cat before he or she gets a more detailed history from you. One form of immediate treatment is intravenous fluids, which will bring your cat’s blood pressure back up (very important if your cat has gone into shock). [16] X Research source Antivenin works by neutralizing the snake’s venom and is most effective when administered within the first six hours of a snakebite. [17] X Research source It can help to prevent bleeding disorders and reduce the amount of swelling at the bite wound. Keep in mind that antivenin is not a vaccination and will not protect your cat from future snakebites. Your veterinarian will likely administer a steroid, which will minimize further tissue damage, control shock, and prevent a possible allergic reaction from antivenin administration. Steroids are usually given only in the first 24 hours after a snakebite. [18] X Research source Your cat may also need oxygen supplementation and additional breathing support, depending on her level of respiratory distress when you get her to your veterinarian. [19] X Research source If your cat is suffering from serious blood circulation problems (little to no clotting, low blood cell counts), she will need to be treated with blood replacement products and other appropriate treatments. [20] X Research source Antibiotics are usually not necessary, since wounds from snakebites rarely become infected. [21] X Research source"

The prognosis for your cat varies depending on how much venom was injected, the species of snake, and how time has passed since the snakebite happened. Fortunately, nearly 80% of pets will survive snakebites if they receive immediate veterinary treatment. [22] X Research source Provided that your cat has a good prognosis, she will likely recover in 24 to 48 hours. This recovery may take longer (at least several days) depending on the extent of tissue damage. [23] X Research source Your veterinarian may recommend that your cat stay at the hospital overnight for an observation. She would need stay overnight if she needs continued intensive treatment. Once your veterinarian is confident that your cat has recovered well from the snakebite, he or she will send her home with you."

      "content": "Learn how snake venom will affect your cat. Snakes use their venom most frequently to catch their prey. Keep in mind, however, that a snake would much rather flee than fight/bite if it encounters a human or a pet. If your cat has been bitten by a snake, the snake likely bit her in self-defense rather than as a predatory attack. Snakes have control over whether they inject venom with their bite. If they do not inject venom, the bite is known as a ‘dry bite.’ They may not inject venom if they have recently made a kill and used up their venom. Snakes can also control how much venom they inject when biting. For example, a smaller snake who fears for its life may inject more venom than a larger snake whose life is not in danger. Snake venom spreads rapidly via the lymphatic system and circulatory systems in the body and can eventually have a profound effect on all body systems. Typically, the venom targets the nervous and circulatory systems. [24] X Research source [25] X Research source"
