[1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Submerge the plunger fully in the water so that you can push and pull water through the opening, not air. Add water from the bathroom sink to the bowl if there isn’t enough water to cover the plunger. Running the plunger under hot water can soften it, which can help it create a better seal. Hopefully your plunger has an “extension flange.” This is the rubber extension after the bell-shaped part of your plunger and it’s designed to better fit the toilet opening.

[2] X Research source It may take 15 to 20 cycles before the toilet unclogs. Be patient. As long as you don't have a hard object (like a kid's toy) stuck in there, plunging alone often suffices. It might not work immediately but will often work after a few dozen plunge cycles."
