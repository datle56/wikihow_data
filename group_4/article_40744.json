You'll be paying for food, grooming supplies, veterinary services, and basic farming equipment on a regular basis, all on top of standard startup costs. [5] X Research source Consider taking out a business loan or seeking outside investors to supplement the capital you've already got. Keep in mind that you won't be making a profit right away, so you'll need to have enough money saved up to keep the business afloat through the early weeks and months."

At the very least, you'll need stalls and outdoor pens, a dedicated feeding area, restrooms, and one or two office buildings.

[7] X Research source If space permits, you could include other buildings like a separate storage room or gift shop. Once you're ready to break ground, hand off your plans to a team of specialty contractors to get construction underway."

The right atmosphere can make your petting zoo that much more inviting and memorable.

To give your visitors a wide variety of species to interact with, be sure to lease lots of different animals, both big and small. [9] X Research source It's vital that you go through a reputable, licensed dealer when stocking your pens.

      "content": "Take your show on the road. For traveling petting zoos, some means of transporting your animals from place to place will be a must.

With a strong team, you can keep your animals healthy and contented and your business thriving. [12] X Research source Advertise jobs at your petting zoo to students, farm hands, and other individuals who are interested in working with animals on a part-time basis. In addition to hourly employees, you should hire at least one or two experienced animal handlers to see to the animals' daily needs."

      "content": "Decide how much you'll charge for admission. Entrance fees are how petting zoos make their money. With this in mind, come up with a price per head that you think is fair. It should be enough to generate the revenue you need to turn a profit, but not so high that it discourages people from coming in. [13] X Research source $8-10 for an adult is average, with a reduced rate of $5-7 for kids. Offering special discounts for small children and seniors may help to attract more business. For appearances at birthday parties and other events, charge a flat rate somewhere between $100-200 per hour. [14] X Research source"

You can start admitting your first visitors as early in the morning as you like and let them come and go until daylight fades. Most commercial petting zoos remain open from about 10am to dusk. If you have lit indoor holding pens, you'll have the option of staying open even later. Post your hours near the entrance of the zoo where they can be seen easily by those passing by. If you've launched a website for your business, be sure to list the information there, as well. Remember to update your hours to reflect holidays, special events, and necessary closures."
