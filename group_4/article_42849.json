      "content": "Enunciate the nouns emphatically when greeting students to grab their attention . On the day you’re going to introduce nouns, change your tone as you greet the students. Take care to really emphasize any nouns that you use, perhaps by raising your voice. This will make your students naturally curious. [1] X Research source Try saying, “Good morning, KEVIN! I really like that SHIRT!” You can also do this while taking attendance: “Is JILL here? How is your new PUPPY, JILL?”"

      "content": "Explain what nouns are and how to use them. Once you have their attention, tell your students that they will be learning about nouns today. Let students know that grammar and knowing the parts of speech are important for becoming better speakers and writers. [2] X Research source Tell them that we use nouns to name people, places, ideas, and things. You can give examples like teacher, school, freedom, and pencil."

      "content": "Use objects in the room to help students understand what a noun is. To illustrate your point, ask students to look around the room and name objects. Then explain that all of those objects are nouns. You can say, “Nouns are the words we use for people, places, and things. So when you pointed out your desk, you were using a noun.” [3] X Research source If your students are already familiar with basic nouns, you can make this more advanced by having them tell the difference between basic and proper nouns. Tell them that proper nouns refer to specific people, places, and things. They must be capitalized, while common nouns refer to general people, places, things, and ideas. Ask them to help you turn the sentence, \"My sister went to a movie yesterday.\" into a sentence with proper nouns, i.e., \"Mary went to see Abominable on Tuesday.\""

This is especially great for students who learn best by listening. [4] X Research source Use your favorite search engine to look for songs about nouns. You can also check out popular song sites like School House Rock. After you listen to the song, ask students what they learned. You can also play it again and let them sing along."

      "content": "Hand out note cards with various words on them. Before class, write a bunch of different words on index cards. Some should be nouns and some should be other words. Distribute the note cards to students and ask them to decide where the words belong. [7] X Research source Say, “Max, what is your word? Is it a noun?” You can then place the notecard (or write the word) in the correct column. You can use any words that are appropriate for your students. If they’re still learning to read, basic words like “cat” and “happy” are fine. If you’re working with older students, you can also use this as a way to introduce more sophisticated vocabulary words."

You can create a very basic worksheet similar to the chart you created. [8] X Expert Source Courtney Copriviza Elementary School Teacher Expert Interview. 18 June 2021. You can also search online for a template to use. There are lots of free templates available. You could create a worksheet that has columns for common nouns, proper nouns, abstract nouns, and collective nouns. Include a word bank with lots of words at the bottom of the page. Collective nouns name a group or collection of things, like animals. For example, you could say, \"an army of ants\" or \"flock of birds.\" Abstract nouns describe items that are non-tangible. For example, you could use love, charity, or generosity to help students understand. Explain the different types of nouns to students, using examples. Then let them work in pairs to fill out the worksheet. If you want to work as a class, you can draw a chart to help students sort nouns into categories."

For example, they could say, “This is a policeman directing cars when the streetlight went out.” Ask them to point out the nouns.

For example, when it comes to the letter “d”, the student might say, “A is for apple, B is for bread, C is for chewing gum, and D is for donuts.” [11] X Research source Popular variations of this game include basing the words on a grocery list or a list of things they might take on a trip."

You can give them a specific category to help them focus. For example, ask them to list all of the nouns that can be found in a school. [13] X Research source To make this more challenging, you can require students to identify nouns for each category (proper, common, etc.) Consider giving a small reward to the winning team. This will make students even more engaged."
