      "title": "A star note is currency that was minted to replace a defective bill.",
      "content": "A star note is currency that was minted to replace a defective bill. That’s why they’re more officially referred to as “Replacement Notes.” These are made by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) to replace notes that were damaged during production, and have a star symbol at the end of their serial number to signify this. Star notes have their own unique serial numbers followed by the star—not duplicate serial numbers of the bills they replace. [1] X Research source Older forms of currency, like gold and silver certificates, often feature the star before the serial number."

      "title": "Star note rarity depends on the batch size.",
      "content": "Star note rarity depends on the batch size. Billions of notes are printed each year, but most years, less than 1 million of those are star notes. [2] X Research source Money is printed in “runs,” or batches, of varying sizes. The BEP commonly prints batches of 360,000 star notes at a time, but this number can increase if the BEP is also printing a higher amount of regular notes. [3] X Research source Star notes printed in batches of 640,000 or fewer are often considered valuable enough to collect. Also, star notes produced in special or older print runs are often more desirable. Star notes are, of course, less common than regular notes, but not every star note is considered particularly rare or valuable."

      "title": "There are two types of star note, and one is rarer.",
      "content": "There are two types of star note, and one is rarer. Star notes are issued in 1 of 2 circumstances. In the first, the printing error is caught before the notes are cut to size. In this case, an entire sheet of uncut notes is replaced by a sheet of star notes, which are then cut instead. This type is much more rare than the second type, since sheets often only consist of 18 uncut notes. [4] X Research source The second type happens when the error is caught after cutting, when bills are sorted into packs of 100, in which case the entire pack is replaced by star notes. It’s often impossible to tell which is which at a glance, but dedicated enthusiasts have built online databases that identify which type many star notes belong to. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Most star notes aren’t particularly valuable.",
      "content": "Most star notes aren’t particularly valuable. For the most part, star notes are only worth their face value—a $1 star note is usually only worth $1. What makes some star notes valuable are traits that also make them especially rare, like unusual serial numbers, such as 00000001 or 99999999, or significant print series, like those printed during major historical events or in extremely limited runs. [6] X Research source Depending on a star note’s rarity, it might sell for anywhere from a few dollars to thousands of dollars. Often, the physical condition of the star note will also affect how valuable it is. Notes in better condition tend to sell for much more."

That’s why the best way to find out the value of yours is to sell the currency on a site like eBay and let other people decide for you in an open auction. Currency collection is a bustling and popular hobby, and many enthusiasts frequent sites like eBay or Heritage Auctions to bid on notes put up for sale."

Some even catalog the batches and offer details on when and how many notes were produced, and why. Looking up your note’s serial number in one of these can offer clues to your note’s value. It’s hard, if not impossible, to know the precise value of a note until it’s actually sold, but resources like these can clue you into rarity.

After 1995, serial numbers begin with 2 letters, with the first denoting the note’s print series, and the second denoting the bank that issued it.

Notes also use a variety of inks, including black, green, and color-shifting inks, all of which are formulated by the BEP. [11] X Research source Color-shifting inks are also harder to counterfeit."
