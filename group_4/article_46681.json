      "content": "Wear goggles at all times when using the nail gun. As with any construction project, wear protective goggles whenever the nail gun is on. This protects your eyes and top half of your head if there is a malfunction — for example, a splintered piece of wood or a nail shot from a mishandled gun. [1] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 18 June 2021. Use safety goggles that are rated for nail gun protection. In the rare case that you accidentally shoot the gun towards your face, your eyes will be safe."

      "content": "Remove all combustible materials from the room. Power tools are infamous for producing a dazzling amount of sparks, any one of which could light up flammable materials in an instant. Remove oily rags, dry paper and sawdust, and any chemicals from your workspace before starting. As you work, sweep away pieces of your nailing surface if they chip away, as they can often cause accidental fires as well."

      "content": "Aim the gun away from people at all times as if you're holding a weapon. A nail gun can cause serious injury if not handled correctly. Only put your finger on the trigger and turn off the safety the moment you are ready to nail a surface. Point the gun towards the ground when not in use, and keep it unplugged as you move around. Most nail gun injuries are caused by distractions and not following basic gun handling procedures. Don't let others disturb you as you work and you reduce the chance of an accident by a lot."

      "content": "Unplug the nail gun when cleaning or performing maintenance. When cleaning the nail gun or performing maintenance, always keep it unplugged or remove the battery. This will prevent serious harm to your person in case the gun goes off or your finger gets trapped. Some maintenance requires the air compressor to be attached, so check your instruction manual to see specific guidelines for your nail gun."

      "content": "Use rust-free nails and discard damaged nail strips. Check your nails before loading them into the gun for rust or damage— never use a nail strip that is bent, rusted, or damaged in any way.[Image:Use a Nail Gun Step 5.jpg|center]] Rust alters the integrity of a nail, and it can break in the nail gun or cause jams. Keep damaged or rusty nails in your toolbox to either use with a hammer or discard later on."

      "title": "Check your surroundings and the nailing surface for hidden hazards.",
      "content": "Check your surroundings and the nailing surface for hidden hazards. Wires, pipes, and other hidden things in the wall can make a nail gun malfunction and you could shock yourself or destroy plumbing. If you are nailing into something other than a wall, check all around the surface for hazards, especially behind it, and figure out where metal parts may be located inside. Knock on the surface to determine if it is hollow or solid, and consult your home's plumbing and electrical layout to see if there is anything hiding behind the wall that could get in the way of your work. If it is essential that you nail a surface with wires or pipes behind it, consult an electrician or plumber to see if they can be moved out of the way. Otherwise, you will need to choose a different location."

      "content": "Check the manufacturer's guide to locate the magazine and coupler. Your user manual is the first thing you should read upon getting your nail gun. Locate the magazine, which holds the nails, and check whether your nail gun needs to be connected to a compressor to load nails. [2] X Research source Check your guide to locate the coupler (the hole you connect the compressor to) and the correct way to connect it. Every nail gun is different, but generally, the coupler is located towards the rear of the gun surrounded by a metal sleeve. The magazine is generally at the front of the gun connecting the handle and the tip."

      "content": "Remove the pusher and discard any unused nails with your fingers. Remove the pusher (the spring that pushes nails into the gun's chamber) and check to see if there are any loose or unused nails remaining in the magazine. [3] X Research source Do not use these; remove them with your fingers and put them back in your toolbox. You can use these nails with a hammer, but never use nails that aren't properly arranged for nail gun use. The pusher is always located on the magazine, generally taking up much of the lower half to push nails up towards the chamber."

      "content": "Choose a nail strip that is rated for your nail gun. There are a variety of nails to choose from, but check your user manual to see if there are any types of nails the nail gun isn't compatible with. Only use nails that are the correct size for your nail gun or you will cause a malfunction and possibly cause damage to yourself or your tool. [4] X Research source Nail guns can use a variety of different types of nails, but the size and shape are what matter. Check the minimum and maximum size nails your gun can handle and only use nails that are within those boundaries."

      "content": "Point the nail gun towards the ground and unplug it or remove its batteries. Whenever loading nails into the gun , point it away from people towards the ground. Unplug the gun or remove its batteries to ensure it doesn't turn on suddenly and injure you. It should balance on its own, but if not, use one hand to hold it in place as you load nails into the magazine. Keep the safety on while you load to further prevent the chance that you hurt yourself. If your gun doesn't have a safety mechanism, removing its source of power should be enough to prevent injury."

      "content": "Load the nails into the magazine with the tips pointed forward. Once you have a nail strip, place it into the magazine with the tips pointed forward and slot it in. Most magazines have a groove that allows for easy loading, but don't worry if there isn't one. Slide the nail strip with the sharp end pointed slightly towards the tip of the gun until it clicks into place. [5] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 18 June 2021. Some models of nail guns have different requirements for the angle and method of loading.

      "content": "Replace the pusher so it touches the bottom of the nail strip. Put the pusher back into the magazine so it touches the bottom of the nail strip. It should click back into place with ease. [7] X Research source The pusher holds the nails in place securely so they don't fall out during use of the nail gun. If at any point a nail falls out of the nail strip, discard the strip and try a different one. It is not recommended to use a faulty nail strip, as it may have other defects that are harder to see."

      "content": "Plug in the nail gun or replace its batteries. After you have loaded the nail gun and performed a check for hazards and loose nails, plug the nail gun back into the wall or put its batteries back in. Turn the gun on but keep your finger away from the trigger until you are ready to use it. Keep the safety on to reduce the risk of an injury."

      "title": "Place the tip of the gun perpendicular to the surface and press it in.",
      "content": "Place the tip of the gun perpendicular to the surface and press it in. The majority of nail gun accidents are caused by not having the nail gun correctly angled into the surface. Always place the tip of the gun perfectly perpendicular to the surface, at a 90-degree angle, to avoid nailing diagonally or missing the surface entirely. Touch the tip of the gun directly to the surface before you shoot a nail to make it more accurate and reduce the risk of unnecessary damage. It can be useful to balance the nail gun on a block of wood or a surface to align your shot, but remove the block before nailing. Don't rest your chest or any body part on it for balance, as the kickback can hurt you."

      "title": "Turn off the safety and squeeze the trigger once you're all set up.",
      "content": "Turn off the safety and squeeze the trigger once you're all set up. The only time you will ever squeeze the trigger while using a nail gun is the moment you nail the surface. Once you have adjusted the air pressure to its desired level, and have angled the gun against the surface, turn off the safety, press the tip into the surface, and squeeze the trigger. The safety should be turned on whenever you are not using the nail gun. Only turn it off the moment you are ready to nail your chosen surface. Keep your free hand and other body parts at least 12 inches (30 cm) away from the tip of the gun at all times while nailing. [8] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 18 June 2021. Walk forwards as you nail in a straight line, so you can see where you are going and don't bump into something that could make you lose focus on the job at hand."

      "title": "Adjust the pressure as necessary to get through the surface.",
      "content": "Adjust the pressure as necessary to get through the surface. If the nail didn't go through, turn the pressure up slightly higher by turning the knob on top of the gun. If it damaged the surface with its force or was lost in a wall, turn the pressure down. It may take a bit of trial and error to figure out the correct configuration, so be sure to test the nail gun on a scrap piece of the surface before committing. If you are working with planks of wood, simply take a spare scrap of wood to practice shooting nails into. If you are working on a wall, it is harder to find the correct pressure while avoiding damaging the home. Look in your user manual or online to find the recommended pressure setting for nailing through your surface with your nail gun. You may find that pressing the gun harder into the wall adds a little extra pressure as well. Try pushing the tip into the wall with a little more force, as well as turning the air pressure up, to get through thick materials."

      "content": "Turn off the nail gun once you are finished and store it in a dry place. When you have finished your job, immediately turn the safety back on, unplug it or remove its batteries, and store it in a dry, cool place. Water can damage the nail gun's inner machinery, so keep it in a toolbox or in the garage to prevent any rusting or damage. Keep any extra nail strips in a very dry place to prevent rusting. You may want to store them separately from your other supplies in their own drawer or box."
