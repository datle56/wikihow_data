      "content": "Knot a large scarf around your waist to create a wrap skirt. Hold the scarf lengthwise in both hands and drape it behind your waist. Wrap the scarf around the front of your waist, then loop both ends of the scarf behind your back. Tie the 2 upper corners of fabric together, securing them in a double-knot so the skirt doesn't accidentally come loose while you're wearing it .

      "content": "Tuck in the dangling sections of a wrap skirt to make a crossover skirt. Grab 1 corner of dangling fabric from your scarf and fold it into the front waistband of your skirt. You can leave just one side tucked in, or you can tuck in the other end as well to create a more exaggerated, open look. [2] X Research source There should be 2 corners of fabric dangling in front of your waist whenever you create a scarf skirt. Always fold the fabric upwards. For instance, if the corner of fabric is dangling in front of your left leg, pull it up and tuck it into the left side of your waistband."

      "content": "Create a tulip skirt by tucking the fabric along the back of your waist. Form a simple wrap skirt as a base for your outfit. Once you’ve done this, tuck both ends of the scarf fabric into the back section of your waistband. Note that the back of this skirt will be longer than the front portion. [3] X Research source Tuck the fabric on the side that it’s dangling on. For instance, if 1 corner of fabric is dangling in front of your right leg, you’d wrap and tuck it behind your right leg."

      "content": "Wrap a belt around your skirt to secure it into place. Find an accessorizing belt that matches the color scheme or style of your skirt. Arrange the belt around your waist and tighten it into place to create a nice sense of division between your top and your scarf skirt. [5] X Research source For example, if you’re wearing a coral top with a light green scarf skirt, you could use a light brown belt as an accessory with the outfit. You can use a red scarf for the skirt. Red clothing, accessories, and shoes suit almost everyone. [6] X Expert Source Hannah Park Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 21 February 2019.

      "content": "Wear a slip to keep your midsection covered. Find a dark or neutral-colored slip that covers your midsection without showing through the fabric. That will help keep you covered in case the skirt shifts while you're wearing it. [9] X Research source Make sure the slip is a little shorter than the width of the scarf you're using. Otherwise, it may show under your skirt."

      "content": "Slide a large elastic wrap around your waist. Use a soft measuring tape to figure out the circumference of your waist. With this measurement, search online for a large elastic band that will comfortably fit around your torso. Arrange this band around your waist, or wherever you’d like the waistband of your skirt to go. [10] X Research source Make sure that the elastic wrap fits snugly without being painfully tight. Try to use a neutral-toned elastic band that won’t distract from your skirt, like brown, black or tan."

      "content": "Fold the scarf accordion-style into pleats. Hold your scarf fabric lengthwise in both hands and start pinching the material into pleats. Stack the pleats behind one another to create an accordion of fabric. As you fold, try to make each pleat around 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) wide, or however large you’d like your pleats to be. [11] X Research source Your fabric will look like a folded fan once you’ve arranged it into pleats."

Pinch and expand the scarf fabric along the circumference of the band to assemble the skirt and make the pleats more visible. [12] X Research source If you want your skirt to be shorter, fold a larger amount of fabric over the waistband."
