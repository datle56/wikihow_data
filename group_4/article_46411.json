      "content": "Make sure your computer meets the system requirements. Because you will be running an operating system from within your own operating system, VMware Workstation has fairly high system requirements. If you don’t meet these, you may not be able to run VMware effectively. You must have a 64-bit processor . VMware supports Windows and Linux operating systems. You must have enough memory to run your operating system, the virtual operating system, and any programs inside that operating system. 1 GB is the minimum, but 3 or more is recommended. You must have a 16-bit or 32-bit display adapter. 3D effects will most likely not work well inside the virtual operating system, so gaming is not always efficient. You need at least 1.5 GB of free space to install VMware Workstation, along with at least 1 GB per operating system that you install."
