Do this at least two times so your child can get used to hearing the numbers out loud. This will also help them learn the ordering of the numbers. You can then move on to saying “10” and having your child repeat after to you. Count up to 20 together. Do this at least two times. Draw a number line to help your child understand the relationship between each number. [1] X Expert Source Courtney Copriviza Elementary School Teacher Expert Interview. 18 June 2021."

If they do not seem to know the answer, you may say, “2.” You can then go through all the numbers again, counting aloud together. Then, try asking them “What comes after 1?” again. Work with them until they remember the right answer and respond with “2.” You can also take turns saying one number.

Generally, try to use something you have a lot of. [3] X Expert Source Courtney Copriviza Elementary School Teacher Expert Interview. 18 June 2021. Avoid sharp objects or objects with sharp corners.
