      "content": "The 🪽 emoji primarily represents flying (literally and metaphorically). Since the emoji depicts a white, feathered bird’s wing, it usually refers to flying. You might see it used to talk about flying animals (like birds) and the act of flying. It can also be used alongside metaphors, like “Time flies.” For example: [1] X Research source “Time to spread my wings and see the world! 🪽” “I wish I could fly up in the sky with all the birds 🪽🥹”"

      "title": "The 🪽 emoji also represents angels or something angelic.",
      "content": "The 🪽 emoji also represents angels or something angelic. Christian angels are often depicted with feathered white wings, so the 🪽 emoji is sometimes used to reference the angels. It can also be used when describing something as angelic—meaning you think something is incredibly sweet, pure, graceful, or heavenly. [2] X Research source “Look at these pics of your baby cousin—isn’t she angelic? 🪽” “I swear, Leah sounds like an angel when she sings!! 🪽”"

      "title": "The 🪽 emoji can symbolize the ideas of freedom and travel.",
      "content": "The 🪽 emoji can symbolize the ideas of freedom and travel. Because wings are associated with the ability to fly, the 🪽 emoji can be used in messages about travel plans—particularly if you’re flying to get to the destination. The emoji also generally represents feeling free or wanting more freedom, relating to the expression “Free as a bird.” “France, here I come! Time to fly! 🪽✈️” “I’m feeling free as a bird today! Spontaneous road trip, anyone? 🪽”"

      "title": "The 🪽 emoji is sometimes used to represent mythical creatures.",
      "content": "The 🪽 emoji is sometimes used to represent mythical creatures. Many mythical creatures are depicted with wings (such as a pegasus, phoenix, or griffin), so you might see the 🪽 emoji used to reference one of those flying creatures. You might also see it used to reference a fictional creature capable of flying, whether or not it has wings (like Disney’s Dumbo). [3] X Research source “Why aren’t pegasus real? I want one! 🪽” “I always thought griffins were the coolest mythical creatures! 🪽”"

      "content": "React to a story about flying (or flying animals). When someone texts you about a cool bird they saw, for example, react to the story and let them know you think it’s neat, too. On the other hand, when someone uses the 🪽 emoji metaphorically, your reaction may change based on what they’re saying and the metaphor they’re using. For example: Them : “Sometimes I wish I was as free as a bird, you know? 🪽” You : “Yeah, I get that. It’d be nice to have no obligations for a little while!”"

      "content": "Agree (or disagree) when something is described as angelic. If someone uses the 🪽 emoji to describe a person or creature as angelic, try offering your opinion in return—without being rude, of course. After all, “angelic” is a super positive way to describe something, so the person texting you probably isn’t expecting you to react badly to it! Them : “Don’t the kids look angelic in this photo? 🪽” You : “Aww, they do! Although we both know they’re plotting mischief under those smiles 😂”"

      "content": "Ask about someone’s plans if they tell you about an upcoming trip. When someone uses the 🪽 emoji to talk about travel plans, they’re probably feeling excited about it—so go ahead and show interest by asking more about their trip. For example, you could ask what they’ll be doing or if they have any other additional destinations. Them : “It’s official: I’m going to Japan next summer! 🪽✈️” You : “Wow, that’s amazing! Where in Japan are you going? 😀”"

Bring up the creatures you think are most fascinating or creative (if any)—and find a clever emoji combination for them, too! Them : “I always loved the idea of a pegasus 🪽🐎” You : “Same!

      "content": "The 💸 emoji typically represents earning or losing money. Although both emojis (🪽 and 💸) have wings, they have very different meanings. While the 🪽 emoji symbolizes flying and freedom, the 💸 emoji primarily represents losing money (like it’s metaphorically “flying” out of someone’s hands)—though it can also represent wealth and making lots of money. [4] X Research source “I spent waaaaay too much money at the casino last weekend 💸” “This new job is great! I’m making so much more money than I used to. 💸”"

The 🪽 emoji was added to Emoji 15.0 in 2022, alongside Unicode 15.0—so most devices with an emoji library and keyboard should have it! If your phone, tablet, or computer doesn’t have the 🪽 emoji, that may mean its software hasn’t been updated. Download and install any available software updates to get the emoji! For example, on iPhones and iPads, you can check in Settings > General > Software Update to see if there are any updates to install.
