The ice can help reduce the inflammation and pain by making the swelling go down.

Any heat should work, so try variations of moist heat, such as a bath or a hot tub, or dry heat like a heating pad or an electric blanket.

      "content": "Skip activities that make your hip feel worse. This advice may seem obvious, but it's not always the easiest to follow. Pay attention when your hip pain worsens so you can connect it to the activities causing the pain. Then try to limit those activities as much as possible. [4] X Research source For instance, if standing up and doing the dishes makes it hurt, try pulling a tall chair into the kitchen so you can sit while working to see if that helps."

However, place a pillow between your knees to decrease pressure on the hip joint. Ideally, your knee should be on the same level as your hip for best results.

      "title": "Use a cane or walker to take pressure off your hip if walking is painful.",
      "content": "Use a cane or walker to take pressure off your hip if walking is painful. You may feel pain while walking, since walking puts pressure on the hip which can worsen the inflammation in your bursa. If you experience this type of pain, try taking the weight off of your hip when you walk by leaning on a cane or walker, which may help to reduce the pain and pressure. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To walk with a cane, hold it on the side opposite of your affected hip. Bring the cane forward when you step with the side that's hurting, so it provides extra support and balance."

For ibuprofen, aim for 1 pill (200 milligrams) every 4 to 6 hours. Don't take more than 6 pills in 24 hours. With naproxen, take 1 pill (220 milligrams) every 8 to 12 hours.

Always read the directions, though, as typically you don't want to use a cream with a medication at the same time you're taking the same medication orally. For instance, you wouldn't want to take ibuprofen while using a cream with ibuprofen at the same time. These creams typically fall into 3 categories: ones with pain relievers, ones with anti-inflammatories (such as NSAIDs, the same category ibuprofen is in), and ones that have a numbing agent, like lidocaine. Talk to your doctor about the best option for you. Some of these come in spray or patch form, too. [9] X Research source"

The steroid will, in turn, reduce inflammation and swelling. You may need a shot every few months to continue your relief, especially if your bursitis is chronic. [10] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source These shots can have side effects, so talk to your doctor about whether this is a good option for you. If you're worried about the needle, ask your doctor for a local anesthetic to help numb the pain. Complications of a steroid shot can include nerve damage, bone death near the shot, tissue and bone thinning, and the weakening of tendons.

Because bursa are small balls of fluid that become inflamed to bursitis, sometimes draining them can help relieve the pain. After applying a local anesthetic for pain, the doctor will insert a special needle into your hip and withdraw the fluid. [16] X Research source The doctor will give you the local anesthetic with a small needle. After that, you shouldn't feel any pain during the session. The injection site will likely be sore for a few days. [17] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source"

Typically, it's not necessary, but if you continue to have symptoms, this treatment can provide relief. [18] X Research source This surgery is usually done on an outpatient basis, meaning you don't have an overnight stay. The least invasive option is arthroscopic surgery, where the doctor makes 2 small incisions, one for a camera and one with small tools to remove the bursa."
