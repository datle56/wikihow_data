If the lock sound is turned on but not playing when you lock your device, there are a few things you can try to resolve the issue: Make sure your iPhone is in Ring Mode. Move the Ring/Silent switch on the side of your iPhone to the Ring position, so that there is not a red background behind it. Go to Settings > Sounds & Haptics and turn up the \"Ringtone and Alert Volume.\" It's a slider near the top of the page. Toggle off \"Change with Buttons\" on the Sounds & Haptics page so that pressing the volume buttons doesn't change the ringtone volume. Now they'll only change the volume of app audio playing on your iPhone ."
