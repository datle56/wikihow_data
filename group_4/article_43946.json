Grab the knot or ball in your right hand to hold it in place. Keep in mind that you may need to rearrange or grab the other end of the bosal as you wrap the rope around it. [1] X Research source"

Pull it up against the bosal's knot at the bottom with the mecate's end hanging just under it. Hold it in place with your hand. You only need to leave a little bit of the mecate out, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) before the tassel. [2] X Research source Pull the edge of the mecate in tight to the \"V\" part of the bosal so it stays in place. [3] X Research source"

Wrap it right up against the knot as close as you can. [4] X Research source Make a second wrap around the bosal in the same way, going the same direction as the last wrap. Pull the loop up tight against the previous one, down toward the bosal's knot or ball. [5] X Research source"

Pinch the \"U\" through the bosal and pull it through to the front, over the wrapped ropes below. Keep pulling until it's long enough to act as reins for your horse, maybe 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 m) in length. [6] X Research source Make sure the reins are hanging straight and aren't twisted or kinked in any way. You can try measuring by holding the bosal in one hand and the loop in the other. Stretch them as far apart as your arms will reach."

Pull each wrap tight up against the rope below on the bosal so that it will hold the reins and knots in place. [7] X Research source Hold the reins in place with your finger as you start this wrap. You may need greater or fewer loops, depending on your horse's size. You can put it on to test it and take it off to adjust it."

Push the excess rope from the loops into the lead line and pull it tight again. Keep twisting and tightening until it's as tight as you can get it. [9] X Research source You can also pull the 2 sides of the bosal apart slightly to help push the ropes down towards the bosal's knot. When you put this on your horse, the lead line and tassel part should face toward the horse's chin while the reins will face to the back."

      "title": "Add the hanger to the bosal if it doesn't already have one.",
      "content": "Add the hanger to the bosal if it doesn't already have one. Untie the hanger so you have 2 pieces. Tie one side of the hanger in the notch on the right-hand side. Working from the back side, bring the loop at the end of the hanger underneath the notch, moving toward the middle. Pull the end of the hanger through the loop on the end of the hanger and then pull it tight. Do the same on the other side. [10] X Research source To tie the 2 ends together of the hanger together, pull the side with the flat end through the other piece, which should have a hole in it near the end. As you bring the end through the hole, wrap it around the side with the hole in it once, and then bring the end back up through the loop you just made. Tighten it up. This is called a \"halter tie,\" and you can make the end longer or shorter to adjust it for your horse. Some hangers may attach with buckles or buttons. The key is to attach it to the back side (the side without the tassel) so it will hold the bosal in place by hanging over your horse's ears."

However, your horse should be able to tell when you let the reins go slack, so don't make it too tight, either. [14] X Research source Adjust the fit by adding or taking off some of the wraps you made around the bosal. You can also adjust the fit of the hanger as needed by moving the knot up or down."
