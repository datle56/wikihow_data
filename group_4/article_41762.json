      "title": "Check the type of glasses you have.",
      "content": "Check the type of glasses you have. This method will only work on glasses with thinner plastic frames. This method should not be used on glasses with Optyl frames. This lightweight plastic bends very easily when heated and may warp out of shape."
    },

      "title": "Prepare a bowl of cold water.",
      "content": "Prepare a bowl of cold water. You will need this later to ‘freeze’ the frames of the sunglasses into the position you need."
    },
    {
      "title": "Heat the bridge of the sunglasses with a hairdryer.",
      "content": "Heat the bridge of the sunglasses with a hairdryer. The bridge is the point where the glasses sit on your nose. Use a hairdryer on a hot setting in 30-45 second bursts to heat the bridge. This will help avoid damage to the frames. Check regularly to see how soft the frames have become. To test this, try gently bending the frames. [1] X Research source Repeat this step as many times as necessary until the frames become soft and malleable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend the bridge of the glasses gently.",
      "content": "Bend the bridge of the glasses gently. Be careful to do this gently so that the glasses are not distorted too much. Push in on the bridge using your thumbs and gently pull outwards on the arms using the first two fingers so that the arms splay out further. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the glasses on a flat surface to test that they are even.",
      "content": "Place the glasses on a flat surface to test that they are even. If the glasses lie unevenly, reheat the arm which is lower down and push it up. Repeat this step until the glasses lie straight. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Soak the glasses in cold water or under a cold running tap.",
      "content": "Soak the glasses in cold water or under a cold running tap. This will help them set in the required position. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the arms of the sunglasses for cracks.",
      "content": "Check the arms of the sunglasses for cracks. Older plastic frames can become brittle and snap, especially if there are cracks in them. [5] X Research source This method should also not be used for glasses with Optyl frames, as these may warp out of shape if heated."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare some warm water.",
      "content": "Prepare some warm water. You can either use a bowl of warm water or a running tap. The water should be warm but not boiling- if the water is boiling, the frames may become brittle and snap. Test the temperature by placing your finger under the tap. If the water is too hot to touch, it's too hot for the glasses."
    },
    {
      "title": "Heat the frames in the warm water.",
      "content": "Heat the frames in the warm water. If you are using a bowl of hot water, immerse the glasses in the water for 30-60 seconds. If you are using a stream of water, hold the arms of the glasses in the water for between 20-30 seconds. The second method is normally better as it reduces the risk of damage to the lenses. [6] X Research source Repeat this step as necessary if the frames are not yet malleable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry the glasses with a microfiber cloth.",
      "content": "Dry the glasses with a microfiber cloth. It's important to dry the frames thoroughly so that your hands do not slip on the next step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend the ends of the arms gently.",
      "content": "Bend the ends of the arms gently. Apply gentle pressure with your thumbs on the ends of the arms. Bend the curved ends of the arms upwards and slightly outwards. This will help relieve pressure on your temples when you wear the sunglasses. Repeat this step as necessary until the glasses sit more loosely."
