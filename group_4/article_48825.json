If your girlfriend starts acting mean all of a sudden and she hasn’t done so before, chances are she just had a bad day or received bad news that’s making her irritated. Maybe she didn’t get that promotion or a relative had a medical scare. If she’s stressed, give her space until she’s comfortable talking about it and find other ways to make her life stress-free.

      "content": "Your girlfriend may be misdirecting her sadness and anger at you. We’re all often instilled with the false belief that certain feelings are bad (anger, sadness) so we try to hide them, covering them with more socially acceptable feelings (joy, peace). However, these “bad” feelings still need an outlet. Your girlfriend may be struggling to own her disappointment or resentment in the moments she feels them and accidentally directing them at you, because you’ve created an emotional safe space.

PMS (premenstrual syndrome) , which women go through once a month, has several symptoms that affect emotional regulation including: anxiety, mood swings, and depression. When you add on the several debilitating physical symptoms like cramps, joint and muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue, it’s no wonder she might react a little more intensely or hostilely to certain things during this time. [5] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Help ease her physical menstrual pains by bringing her a heating pad or giving her a massage.

      "content": "She might be hangry. After our bodies go a long period of time without eating, our blood sugar decreases, and we release other hormones to compensate for this, including cortisol (the stress hormone) and adrenaline. Both of these hormones in our bloodstream make us more agitated and overwhelmed, which can come off as meanness. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While the obvious solution for hanger is eating, it’s important to eat right. Make her a meal that includes protein (meats, eggs, dairy, tofu), complex carbs (brown rice, oatmeal, quinoa, vegetables), and unrefined sugars (fruits) to help get her blood sugar back to normal."

It’s common in relationships for us to (consciously or subconsciously) create a blueprint for what our dynamic should look like and how our partner should behave.

      "content": "She may have issues with boundaries. Setting healthy boundaries is essential in communicating to our partners what we are and aren’t okay with. If your girlfriend struggles with setting boundaries, she may feel triggered because you’re crossing lines with her and use antagonistic behavior as a defense mechanism. Consequently, if you haven’t clearly established your boundaries , she may be crossing a line of yours without realizing it. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Boundaries can be physical (your comfort being touched in certain places), emotional (being spoken to in a respectful way), mental (your values and belief systems), material (your comfort with certain items being used), or time-based (respecting your time by being prepared and present)."

      "content": "She doesn’t know how else to get your attention. For some people, bad attention is better than no attention. If your girlfriend behaves in a mean or disrespectful way, you’re more likely to respond (albeit negatively). Attention-seeking behavior is often a dysfunctional symptom we carry with us from childhood (especially for people with parents who didn’t praise or give their children positive affection). [9] X Research source If your girlfriend is lashing out to get your attention, it’s best to ignore her when she does this and, instead, shower her with more positive attention randomly and often."

If your girlfriend was raised by overprotective and authoritarian parents, it’s likely they set inflexible boundaries for her and then ignored or degraded her when she questioned these boundaries. They also likely told her they were hard on her because they loved her, and she now equates love with being hard on people. [10] X Research source"

If you and your girlfriend don’t have a lot in common: no real shared interests, different social batteries (i.e one of you is extroverted, the other is introverted), and different worldviews, that lack of connection is likely making both of you frustrated. This frustration can be triggering and she’s being mean as a response to that trigger. Try working on your incompatibility by learning from each other. Let her teach you about things you wouldn’t normally be interested in and vice versa. This helps celebrate and mend your differences instead of placing them against each other."

Other common symptoms of depression include irritability, insomnia (no sleep causes anger and stress), and agitation at even the smallest things.

If your girlfriend was in a dysfunctional relationship before you (be it romantic, platonic, or familial), she may have certain expectations that you’re going to cause her the same pain.

      "content": "Communicate that your feelings are hurt. Clear communication can be a lifesaver in relationships. It can eliminate animosity, promote intimacy, and give you a valid opportunity to stand your ground. Find a time to talk to your girlfriend one-on-one and tell her how her actions affected you. Use “I feel” statements, rather than “you” statements, and, if possible, offer solutions on how you two can work through this stress. Some examples might include: [14] X Research source “I feel small when you raise your voice at me like you did earlier. I understand you may be stressed, but that felt uncalled for and I’d like you to stop.” “I feel disrespected when you roll your eyes during a conversation. I’d prefer it if you were open instead of passive-aggressive.” “I feel helpless when I offer solutions and you shut them down. I know not every idea may be a winner, but I’d like you to consider them more thoroughly.”"

Sit down with your girlfriend and clearly but compassionately explain what you refuse to tolerate physically, mentally, and/or emotionally. Try not to make your boundaries sound like blame, but be firm that you will not be mistreated, even if her meanness is unintentional. You might say: [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source “I refuse to be insulted with demeaning names like ‘idiot’ or ‘moron.’ If you continue to throw those words around, I don’t think I can do this anymore.” “I can’t go to bed angry at you. It gives me insomnia, which is bad for my health and only makes me crankier for our next conversation. Let’s talk things out or find a natural way to pause our arguments.” “Complaining to my siblings about me is a violation of my privacy. I feel invaded and disrespected when you go to other people instead of talking to me first. Please stop.” If needed, record some instances where she was mean to you. Hearing the things that were said coming from your mouth might be enough to make her understand that she's being really mean."

If you feel like her anger is being caused by an external event (work stress, family, friends) or hormonal fluctuations, take care of chores and household activities you know will cause her extra tension.

Depression can bring out the worst in everyone, but it’s a common illness and there are a lot of resources available to help. Talk to her about how she’s feeling and look online for a therapist that specializes in the problems she’s dealing with.

If her depression is severe, remember it’s okay to distance yourself from time to time. While you can be there for her, her depression is not your responsibility. Practice mindfulness and take some space to nurture your own emotional needs."
