    {
      "title": "Learn their travel habits.",
      "content": "Learn their travel habits. Minks travel more than most furbearers, covering up to ten miles a night. They normally follow a definite route. They will usually visit the same spots near water areas every time they are near them. Learning a mink's travel habits will make it easier for you to trap it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide on a live or lethal trap.",
      "content": "Decide on a live or lethal trap. Live traps catch the mink without killing it. Lethal traps dispatch the mink. When selecting the type of trap you are going to use, decide if you want to deal with an alive and probably very irritated mink or if you want the trap to dispatch the mink. Check your state regulations regarding using lethal traps on minks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide on your set.",
      "content": "Decide on your set. The set is what you will use to lure the mink into your trap. The most common sets either lure the mink to a dark hole using bait (pocket set) or trap the mink on its pathways (blind set)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose your trap.",
      "content": "Choose your trap. There are different types of traps to choose from based on the environment. A body-gripping trap is designed to allow the animal’s head, neck, or torso into the trap’s opening. This trap holds the mink by compressing its jaws around the body. The foothold trap, such as the longspring or coilspring, is a steel-jawed trap that restrains mink by the foot. Use a No. 11 double longspring, No. 1 ½ coil spring, or a No. 110 Conibear body-gripping trap. These traps are the most effective in trapping and killing the mink."

      "title": "Use this technique to dispatch minks caught in traps.",
      "content": "Use this technique to dispatch minks caught in traps. The submersion technique is used to humanely drown the mink and prevent the trapper from dispatching the animal. This is the most common way to kill minks in your trap sets. This technique prevents the mink from resurfacing when it tries to escape from the trap."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a foothold trap.",
      "content": "Use a foothold trap. A foothold trap makes it unlikely that the mink will escape. Since the foothold trap gives the mink a limited amount of freedom to move, it is ideal for the submersion technique."

      "title": "Attach a sliding lock to the end of your trap chain.",
      "content": "Attach a sliding lock to the end of your trap chain. Make sure there are no obstacles that would prevent the lock from sliding freely down the wire. Sliding locks prevent the mink from heading back to the bank. Once the mink realizes that it cannot go any further up the bank, it will head towards the deep water. The lock will follow the mink and prevent it from surfacing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place an anchor deep in the water.",
      "content": "Place an anchor deep in the water. Make sure the anchor is deep enough to fully submerge the mink. Use a heavy object such as a rock or a stake as an anchor. Embed the anchor into the stream or riverbed so that it is secure and stable. You want it to be heavy enough to prevent the mink from moving the anchor and freeing itself. On average, the stake needs to be 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) underwater."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the anchor with wire.",
      "content": "Wrap the anchor with wire. Make sure the wire is wrapped tightly around the anchor so it doesn't unravel when the trap is sprung."

    {
      "title": "Find a suitable bank.",
      "content": "Find a suitable bank. Make sure the bank is straight up and down. The bank should also be steep so that the mink cannot reach over from the top and grab the bait while avoiding your trap."

    {
      "title": "Dig a pocket in the bank.",
      "content": "Dig a pocket in the bank. The pocket’s bottom will be two inches below the waterline. Extend the pocket 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61 m) into the bank, making sure it angles up towards the topsoil. The diameter of the pocket should be around five to six inches. Use a spade or small shovel to easily dig the pocket."

    {
      "title": "Place a large branch or small tree trunk above the pocket.",

    {
      "title": "Place the bait.",
      "content": "Place the bait. Your bait should be either be a fresh fish or a muskrat carcass. Place the bait deep into the hole towards the very back. Impale the bait with something small, such as a stick, and push the bait into the wall of the hole. This will make the mink go deeper into the hole to reach the bait. You can also use fish oil or raccoon glands as a lure."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the trap.",
      "content": "Place the trap. The trap should be at the mouth of the hole. Placing the trap at the entrance ensures the mink is trapped if it decides not to go all the way into the pocket. Use either a body-grabbing or foothold trap. If you use a foothold trap, it should be rigged to drown the mink instantly. If you are in an area where dogs go do not use meat bait or raccoon gland lures. Place the trap in the very back of the pocket. Make sure the pocket is under the cover of low-hanging branches or exposed tree roots. This will make sure that dogs avoid the trap."

      "title": "Eliminate your scent.",
      "content": "Eliminate your scent. While mink are naturally curious, they are also cautious. Minks have a very strong sense of smell and will avoid the trap if they catch your scent. You want to eliminate all human scent from the trap to make it effective. Pour mink urine around a set to eliminate human odor."

      "content": "Use this set to trap a mink along its runways. This set uses a trap placed along the traveling paths of the mink. The mink will unknowingly step into the trap while making its nightly rounds. Unlike pocket sets, a blind set does not use bait or a lure."

      "title": "Select a visible mink traveling spot.",
      "content": "Select a visible mink traveling spot. Look for tracks, scats, and other signs that minks move through the area. For a wet blind spot, this area is probably near a bank, under a leaning log, around a rock, or at the water’s edge. For a dry blind set, look for where the mink made an overland trail. While the overland trail might be hard to see, you can find it by looking for bent grass, mink smell, and tracks."

      "title": "Dig a shallow hole.",
      "content": "Dig a shallow hole. Place and set a foothold trap in a shallow hole and make sure it’s firmly embedded into the mud. Cover it lightly with leaves, grass, and soil. If it is a wet blind set, push the trap into the waterbed, keeping the trap near the surface of the water. A No. 110 Conibear trap works well for a dry blind set. A No. 1½ coil spring works well for a wet blind set."
