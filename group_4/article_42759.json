      "title": "Craft a fishing rod.",
      "content": "Craft a fishing rod. A fishing rod can be made with 3 sticks and 2 string which you can get from killing spiders. In the crafting table, place the sticks diagonally from top left to the bottom right and place the string to the left vertically."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go fishing.",
      "content": "Go fishing. Raw fish can be obtained by fishing. Put the fishing rod in your toolbar and equip it by pressing the corresponding number on the keyboard (or by pressing the right and left shoulder buttons on game consoles). Stand next to a body of water and click or press the right trigger button to cast a line. Click or press the right trigger button again when you see the bobber sink. You'll need at least five fish and maybe up to 20, to lure the ocelot to you. Do not cook the fish. Ocelots are only attracted by raw fish."
    },
    {
      "title": "Locate an ocelot.",
      "content": "Locate an ocelot. Ocelots are found in jungle biomes. They are yellow with black spots. In the newest version of Minecraft, taming an ocelot no longer turns it into a cat that you can keep as a pet. However, you can find stray cats in villages that can be tamed and kept as a pet. Cats can be tamed using these same steps. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wait for the ocelot or cat to approach you.",
      "content": "Wait for the ocelot or cat to approach you. This is an absolute requirement or taming the ocelot will not occur––if you try to approach the ocelot or cat, it'll assume you're chasing it and take off. Moreover, trapping or cornering an ocelot will not result in taming. The ocelot will possibly come to you when you are holding a raw fish. Do not be threatening in any way. Be in an area that allows for plenty of escape for the ocelot. Your character must be situated somewhere that has a 7x7 minimum horizontal block area. This will allow the ocelot to feel safe rather than trapped. Taming will not take place if hostile mobs are attacking at the same time. And never have chickens or other animals around."

    {
      "title": "Equip the raw fish.",
      "content": "Equip the raw fish. Place the raw fish in your toolbar and equip it by pressing the corresponding number on your keyboard or pressing the right and left trigger shoulder buttons on your controller."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get close to the ocelot with great care and stealth.",
      "content": "Get close to the ocelot with great care and stealth. The ocelot will be easily frightened away. Walk at normal speed if you need to move nearer to keep apace with the ocelot, but don't get too close while moving. Only use walking to get nearer, then cease moving. Never look directly at an ocelot when attempting to tame it. This means keeping the crosshairs off it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait for an approach.",
      "content": "Wait for an approach. If an ocelot turns around and faces you, this may be an opportunity for it to approach you. Stand still if possible. This is the best way to attract the ocelot. If you want to, try sneaking––this might work without disturbing the ocelot. (Try holding sneak, while the mouse sensitivity is set to yawn.)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay still when the ocelot is within 5 blocks of you.",
      "content": "Stay still when the ocelot is within 5 blocks of you. Keep holding the raw fish without moving or looking directly at the ocelot. Wait for the ocelot to stare at your character and approach timidly. If the conditions are right, the ocelot will slowly walk towards you."

    {
      "title": "Place the crosshair on the ocelot or cat and feed it the raw fish.",
      "content": "Place the crosshair on the ocelot or cat and feed it the raw fish. You can feed it by right-clicking or pressing the left trigger button on your controller. Use quick repeated right-clicks without jerking the camera or moving. Any movement can scare away the ocelot before it is tamed"

    {
      "title": "Repeat the feeding until you see hearts over the ocelot.",
      "content": "Repeat the feeding until you see hearts over the ocelot. When you see hearts appear over the ocelot or cat, it has been successfully tamed. It may take a few tries before you have successfully tamed an ocelot or cat. A tamed ocelot will not flee the player. A tamed cat ceases to be afraid of humans. It will meow and purr quite often. It will follow you around and sit on demand (simply right-click or press the left trigger button). Cats will sit on everything, including chests, which can be a nuisance as the chest won't open until the cat gets off it! Both cats and ocelots can ward off creepers. Taming two ocelots or cats in close proximity will cause them to breed."
