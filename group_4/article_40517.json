      "title": "Stand up straight,",
      "content": "Stand up straight, and roll your shoulders back. Straighten your spine as much as you can without feeling significant strain or tension. Hold your shoulders back and level with the top of your chest. [1] X Research source One common error is to raise your shoulders up towards your ears. If you notice this, shrug your shoulders down and try to relax them of tension. Don't worry if your lower back still has a slight curvature, as this is natural. Holding your back too straight can cause immediate strain and back problems over time."

      "content": "Point your feet at a 45-degree angle with your legs straight and heels touching. Keep your legs straight, and try to balance your body weight evenly between your right and left feet.

      "title": "Hold your head and neck erect.",
      "content": "Hold your head and neck erect. Look straight ahead and hold your head up so that your neck is directly parallel with the ground.

To prevent stiffness, try to relax the muscles in your neck and jaw while holding your head erect."

      "title": "Stay silent and unmoved until prompted.",
      "content": "Stay silent and unmoved until prompted. Standing at attention is just as much about your actions as your posture. Do not speak, look around, or make any movements until directed to by your drill leader. Moving or talking without being addressed while standing at attention is considered a violation and may result in apprehension, depending on the situation."

      "content": "Place your hand over your heart while performing a position of attention. Whether in military uniform or not, perform a basic stand of attention while the National Anthem plays.

    {
      "title": "Remove any non-military headdresses, if applicable.",
      "content": "Remove any non-military headdresses, if applicable. If you are in civilian clothes and wearing a hat or other headdress, take it off as the National Anthem plays.

[7] X Research source Unless directed otherwise by your superiors, you usually may wear military headdresses while the National Anthem plays."

      "title": "Hold your instruments perpendicular to the ground.",
      "content": "Hold your instruments perpendicular to the ground. While standing at attention, grasp the instrument firmly in your hands and hold it perpendicular to the ground with your arms out in front of you. The instrument should be held in front of you so that, when directed by your instructor, you can swiftly bring your instrument up to march or play. [9] X Research source Your arms should be straight and extended while standing at attention. Do not tuck your elbows in towards your chest while standing at attention. If standing without instruments, hold your hands at your side with your fingers slightly cupped, as you would while performing a military position of attention."

      "title": "Look down instead of straight ahead.",
      "content": "Look down instead of straight ahead. Because of the headgear worn by marching band members, looking straight ahead can block your vision while standing at attention. To keep your vision clear, look down the bridge of your nose instead. [10] X Research source As with military positions of attention, do not move your eyes around while standing at attention."
