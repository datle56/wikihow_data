  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Write a script for speaking instead of reading.",
      "content": "Write a script for speaking instead of reading. Reading a text and hearing someone talk are two very different ways to learn. Speaking is much less formal than writing, so unless you're looking for irony, you'll need to use more colloquial* language at a robotics conference. Using contractions is a simple but apparent way to accomplish this. For example, replacing \"I am\" with \"I'm\" and \"Have not\" with \"Haven't\" will make your speech sound more natural and fluent. (*) Colloquialism can be taken to an embarrassing level. For example, watch any Trump speech ever."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ensure that your script is easy to read.",
      "content": "Ensure that your script is easy to read. Given the previous point, this may seem counterintuitive, but bear with me as I explain. The first point was about how the audience would react to your speech. I mean that you should format your script so that it is easy for you to read while delivering it. While using all-caps increases the size of your speech on screen, it makes it considerably more difficult to discern between sentences. It is far better to follow standard capitalization norms. Putting more space between sections also helps you make your points stand out and move easily from one topic to the next."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a note if you intend to improvise.",
      "content": "Make a note if you intend to improvise. An impromptu anecdote can sometimes liven up your speech and drive home your argument. Keep in mind that, while your AMC teleprompter operator is experienced and bright, he or she is not (likely) a mind reader. Make a note in the script if you intend to improvise. As a result, the prompter operator will know to stop scrolling and you will both be on the same page!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw attention to page breaks in your script.",
      "content": "Draw attention to page breaks in your script. If you're giving a live presentation, keep a paper copy of your script on hand as a backup in the highly unlikely* event that the teleprompter malfunctions. If you've marked your pages in your script, you'll be able to find your place quickly and avoid the embarrassment of fumbling through your paper copy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Experiment!",
      "content": "Experiment! Practice! Practice! Teleprompter software is not computer-assisted. It is necessary for an operator to scroll over the text while you speak. It's often a good idea to practice with your operator prior to your shoot or event so that he or she is familiar with your pacing and speaking style. This will allow you to be more coordinated while filming or presenting."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep in mind that you control the pace.",
      "content": "Keep in mind that you control the pace. You decide the tempo; your operator isn't attempting to give you the impression that you have control. Only you are aware of your speech patterns and natural pace. If you have recommendations or concerns, address them honestly and gracefully (no one likes a diva!). Your operator will work with you to make sure you sound as professional as possible and that you are comfortable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep Eye Contact With Your Audience.",
      "content": "Keep Eye Contact With Your Audience. Eye contact is vital for connecting with your audience, whether you're speaking on camera or at a live event. Looking away from your audience can make you appear bored and arrogant, or frightened and hesitant. Neither is optimal for efficient delivery. When you look at the people in the room, it makes them more likely to take part in your presentation and with you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make use of nonverbal communication.",
      "content": "Make use of nonverbal communication. (*Slight hand motions) Your audience will not absorb the content if you are not interesting to watch, regardless of how interesting your speech is. Occasionally using hand gestures and altering position breaks up the monotony of speech. However, moderation is required here because excessive gesticulation is distracting, and shifting back and forth frequently gives the impression that you require the facilities. A solid balance is essential for optimal delivery."

    {
      "title": "Finally, display enthusiasm!",
      "content": "Finally, display enthusiasm! Unless you're presenting extremely awful news (for example, if you're a newscaster working somewhere other than Fox), you want your audience to be passionate about your message. Your audience will not be enthused if you do not appear enthused. Remember to smile and make your interest in the topic clear. Half the battle is convincing your audience that what you have to say is important. You must now slay!"

    {
      "title": "Use contractions.",
      "content": "Use contractions. Though contractions are often left out of formal writing, they sound more natural when you're speaking. So don't be afraid to change out \"I've\" for \"I have\" or \"don't\" for \"do not.\" [5] X Research source"

You can try a meditation technique before reading. [6] X Research source One way to meditate is to choose a simple mantra to repeat over and over. For instance, you could choose the traditional \"Om\" or try your own, such as \"calm and quiet.\" [7] X Research source Another way to meditate is to focus on your breathing. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath in, counting to four. Let the breath out, counting to four. Repeat this process for several breaths. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid PPMS (Ping-Pong Match Syndrome). Keep an eye on where your focus is directed. Presenters who use a presidential teleprompter system frequently worry that they are spending too much time looking at one panel and thus bounce back and forth quickly between the two. This gives the impression that the presenter is watching an intense ping-pong match, which is incredibly distracting. If you're new to using a presidential prompter system, look at one panel for a little longer than feels comfortable, then switch. Transitions between subjects can also be used to go over to the other panel."
