      "title": "Try lemon juice.",
      "content": "Try lemon juice. Lemon juice has been known to clear up dark spots on skin for some. This may be because it contains vitamin C and citric acid, which both act like exfoliating agents and remove the outer layer of the skin. Try using lemon juice and see if it has an effect. Apply the juice on the affected spots for about ten minutes then wash gently. Pat dry with a clean towel. Avoid using lemon to children who have scars as childrenâ€™s skin are known to be more sensitive than adults. Like many home remedies, the use of lemon juice to remove scars has not been medically tested. If it makes scars worse or causes skin irritation, cease use and talk to your doctor."
