      "content": "You were scammed into sending someone money. Scammers are extremely skilled and sophisticated at convincing people to give them money. They'll often offer a service (like anti-virus protection), claim the money will go to charity, or pretend to be your bank and ask you to pay a late credit card fee. [3] X Research source The best way to avoid getting scammed is to never transfer money to anyone you don't know, especially if they ask you to use Western Union or Visa Direct."

Their first step will be to shut your card off to prevent any other unwanted charges from coming through. They may also ask you some questions about your recent spending to make sure you didn't use Visa Direct and forgot. Some banks offer a mobile app where you can shut off your card yourself. If your bank offers this feature, log in and shut the card off yourself before calling customer service. That's the quickest way to stop any other fraudulent transactions from coming through."
