      "title": "Try a reusable menstrual cup.",
      "content": "Try a reusable menstrual cup. Silicone or rubber menstrual cups are reusable, flexible, bell-shaped devices that collect your menstrual flow. The cup should not leak if inserted properly and is one of the best alternatives to a tampon if you want to go swimming. Insert the cup before swimming, and leave it in until you can change out of your swimsuit into your regular clothing and switch to another method of period protection."

      "title": "Consider a disposable menstrual cup.",
      "content": "Consider a disposable menstrual cup. While they can be expensive compared to tampons or reusable cups, disposable menstrual cups are flexible, easy to insert, and work well for protection while swimming. Just as you would with a reusable cup, insert the cup before swimming, and leave it in until you can change out of your swimsuit into your regular clothing and switch to another method of period protection. Like reusable cups, disposable cups can be messy to insert and remove and require a learning curve to master placing them correctly in the vagina. Check out this helpful wikiHow page to learn the process of inserting and removing a disposable menstrual cup."

      "title": "Consider a sea sponge.",
      "content": "Consider a sea sponge. If you avoid tampons because you are concerned about the chemicals used in their production, a natural sea sponge might be a good solution for you. Sea sponge tampons are harvested from the ocean and contain no chemicals, and they are also reusable. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask your doctor about a diaphragm.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor about a diaphragm. A diaphragm is a dome-shaped rubber cup placed high in the vagina. It is a birth control device, designed to block sperm from entering the cervix. It is not meant as a menstrual device. [4] X Research source However, if you have a light flow you can use it while swimming as an alternative to a tampon. A diaphragm can be left in the vagina for up to 24 hours. If you have sex, you must leave your diaphragm in for at least 6 hours following intercourse to prevent pregnancy. Diaphragms do not protect against STDs. Diaphragms can increase the risk of urinary tract infections. You should not use a diaphragm if you have a latex allergy. Cramping or pelvic pain can result from the wrong sized diaphragm, so be sure to replace your diaphragm in the event of weight loss or gain of 10 pounds or more. To wash your diaphragm, remove it and wash it with mild soap, then rinse and dry. Do not use products like baby powder or face powder, as these can damage the diaphragm. Once again, using a diaphragm for regular menstrual protection is not recommended. If you're having a light flow and want an alternative to a tampon to swim, you can try inserting a diaphragm. You may want to test it out beforehand, however, to see how well it blocks blood flow. If you have sex after swimming, be sure to leave the diaphragm in place for six hours before removing it."

      "title": "Try a cervical cap.",
      "content": "Try a cervical cap. Much like a diaphragm, a cervical cap is primarily used as a contraceptive device. However, it does block menstrual flow so you can try using it when swimming if you want an alternative to your tampon."

      "title": "Refrain from full body swimming.",
      "content": "Refrain from full body swimming. If you're unable to find a tampon alternative that works for you, you can find a way to get involved in water activities without fully submerging. Sunbathing, wading, relaxing under a beach umbrella, and letting your feet hang in the water are all good options, and you can wear a menstrual pad while you do these things. Remember that menstruation is a completely normal part of your life, and while it might feel embarrassing to tell your friends you are on your period and don't want to swim, you should feel confident that your friends will understand. If you're uncomfortable telling them that you're on your period, you can simply tell them that you aren't feeling well or don't feel like swimming."

      "title": "Wear waterproof underwear.",
      "content": "Wear waterproof underwear. Waterproof underwear can be a safe, comfortable alternative to your period when swimming or doing other activities. Waterproof underwear looks much like regular underwear or bikini bottoms but has a hidden, leak-proof lining that helps absorb menstrual blood. If you plan on swimming in waterproof underwear, know that they will not absorb a heavy or moderate flow. They will only work towards the end of your cycle or on months when you're having a light flow."

      "title": "Wait until your flow lightens.",
      "content": "Wait until your flow lightens. As it can be difficult to find tampon alternatives that are effective and easy to conceal under a bathing suit; if you have a heavy period you may have to simply wait until your flow lightens to swim. Hormonal birth control pills, when used correctly, can result in a lighter period. Hormonal IUDs may also result in less bleeding during your menstrual cycle. If you're an avid swimmer and dislike tampons, you could look into these options to shorten your cycle overall. You might also consider Seasonale or other birth control pills that result in less frequent periods. Seasonale is designed so that you take \"active\" hormonal pills every day for three months before taking a week of \"inactive\" placebo pills, which activates your period. Although some women have light, breakthrough bleeding during their active pills, this method can help you predict when you will have your period so you can plan your swimming times around it. Try establishing a vigorous exercise routine. Regular, rigorous physical activities of any kind can reduce the length of your period and make it lighter. If you're an avid swimmer, you may find your cycle changes during warmer months when you swim frequently. However, if your period becomes abnormally light or stops altogether talk to your doctor to rule out underlying medical concerns or pregnancy."
