      "content": "Choose rollers according to how tight you want your curls. Depending on your hair length, thickness, and desired outcome, choose rollers accordingly. Smaller rollers will produce tighter curls and larger rollers will give you waves. Experiment with sizes until you find what works for you. [2] X Expert Source Steven Waldman Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 27 July 2021. If you are a first-time user, start with rollers that are all the same size. As you become comfortable using them, you can even mix and match different sizes for different looks. [3] X Research source The size and number of rollers you choose will also depend on the size of your head and the length and thickness of your hair. The more hair you have or the more curls you want, the more rollers you will need. Bendy rollers are very inexpensive and can be found online, in most stores, and even at the dollar store."

      "title": "Towel dry your hair",
      "content": "Towel dry your hair , making sure to squeeze out any excess water. Since the rollers are foam, you do not want a lot of excess water soaking into the rollers. If they are too wet when you roll them, they will take a long time to dry and the curls may not set properly. You want hair that is just damp and without any dripping."

      "title": "Comb your hair",
      "content": "Comb your hair with a wide-toothed comb to remove tangles. Beginning at the bottom of your hair and working your way up, comb your hair to remove any knots or tangles. Using a wide-toothed comb will prevent pulling and damage. If you have very thick or coarse hair, you can use a detangling brush that you can get at most beauty supply stores instead of a comb.

      "title": "Partition your hair",
      "content": "Partition your hair into four sections. Using a comb and claw-style hair clips, divide your hair into a back section, two side sections, and a top section. You do not need to be precise with your divisions, the sections are just to help you manage the rolling and keep it neat. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Roll your hair tightly around the rollers and bend them into place.",
      "content": "Roll your hair tightly around the rollers and bend them into place. Beginning at the back of your head and working forward, wrap the end of a small section of hair around the middle of the roller 3 or 4 times. Then, gripping the roller on either side, slowly roll it up to the root and bend the roller so the two ends overlap like a pretzel. Repeat until all your hair is rolled up tight. [7] X Expert Source Steven Waldman Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 27 July 2021. The more hair you put on each roller, the bigger the curls will be. For tighter curls, roll less hair on each roller. If your hair begins to dry while you are rolling, spritz with water to keep it moist. For a more natural look, twist your hair in random directions as you roll so your curls are not uniform. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap your hair in a satin scarf or pillowcase and sleep.",
      "content": "Wrap your hair in a satin scarf or pillowcase and sleep. Using a satin scarf or pillowcase to cover all of your hair will keep the rollers tight to your head and reduce pulling or falling as you sleep. Tie the scarf or pillowcase securely into place at the top of your head so the knot doesn’t bother you during the night. [10] X Research source Satin is best because it is smooth, but you can use cotton as well in a pinch. You just may have a little more frizzing without the satin wrap."

      "title": "Remove the scarf and check that your hair is dry.",
      "content": "Remove the scarf and check that your hair is dry. When you wake up, remove the satin wrap and feel around with your fingertips at the root of each roller for dampness. If you feel moisture, wait longer if you can to allow for the hair to dry or, if you are out of time, you can use a hair dryer on a low-setting to finish. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Unroll the rollers and release the curls.",
      "content": "Unroll the rollers and release the curls. Once your hair is completely dry, unbend the rollers from their pretzel shape back into a straight rod and unroll gently. Allow the curls to cascade around your face and resist the urge to touch them so you do not make them frizzy.

      "content": "Separate curls carefully using your fingers. Depending on how curly or how big you want your final style, use your fingers to gently pull apart the curls. The more you separate them, the bigger your hair will be at the end. Do not use a brush or comb to separate curls because it will blend the curls together and create frizz. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray with a finishing spray or hair spray to hold in place. It’s important to mist your final style all over with hair spray or finishing spray to ensure that it stays in place. A strong holding product will prolong the unfurling effects of gravity and time.
