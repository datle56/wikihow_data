      "content": "Undo any safety locks. Many TV mounts don’t have locks. If yours does, it could be any number of lock types. Search the mount for any signs of the lock, or check the mount's manual. Some locks require a special key that came in the packaging, while others have flip tabs or sliding bars to undo with your fingers. Whether you mounted a flat screen TV , LCD TV , or plasma TV, it should come with a safety lock."

      "content": "Lift up the bottom of the TV if possible. Grasp the TV by the sides and try to edge the bottom forward. The TV is hooked to the top of the mount, so don’t worry. It won’t topple over on you. Instead, you’ll be able to see the back of the TV and reach your hand behind it. If the TV doesn’t budge, don’t force it. A TV that doesn’t move either has safety locks or is held by screws."

      "content": "Locate the screws or pull strings. Depending on the mount you have, screws or strings secure the TV to the bracket on the wall. With the bottom of the TV tilted forward, you won’t have any problem seeing these components. If you don’t see any strings hanging from the mount’s sides, you’ll know you need a screwdriver right away. If you have the installation instructions for your TV mount, use those—simply reverse the steps."

      "content": "Unscrew the mount pieces. Different sizes of TV use different screws, so you may need to do some trial and error. An adjustable power drill cuts out some of the hassle. You’ll have to contort your hand to get the screwdriver behind the TV. The fasteners will be under the mount or on its sides, depending on the model. It's a good idea to have someone help you hold the TV as you do this."

      "content": "Pull on the mount strings. Mounts that have strings also feature a spring lock in the mount. When you pull the strings, listen for the sound of the lock disengaging. You need to prevent the lock from activating. While you can reach both strings by yourself, get someone else’s help to make it easier. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Gently separate the TV from the wall. If you don’t have someone to hold the TV out from the wall, you’ll have to improvise with wedging household objects to create a gap. All you need is a small amount of separation to prevent the lock from engaging. Pull the string on one side and move the side away from the wall. Stuff the wedge objects behind the TV and let go. If done right, you won’t hear the lock engage again. Repeat this with the other side. [5] X Research source Movie and video game cases make for great makeshift wedges, but you can use whatever you have on hand."

If you choose to remove it, undo it the same way you did the rest of the mount.

      "content": "Patch up the drill holes. You'll need to purchase a small amount of spackling paste from your local hardware store. Use a putty knife to apply a quarter-sized amount of spackling over each hole. Slowly drag the putty knife over the surface of each hole to fill it. To remove excess paste, drag a clean putty knife vertically and horizontally to ensure a smooth, even application. Let it dry for at least an hour. Paint over the dried paste. If you don't have leftover paint for your walls, you'll need to purchase more. Be sure to get the same color. Let it dry completely."
