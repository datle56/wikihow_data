      "content": "Rinse the bathtub if it hasn't been cleaned recently. The ideal time to clean a tub is immediately following a bath, but if it's been a while, you want to make sure you won't be bathing with any dirt or mildew. [1] X Research source Spray your tub with a mixture of 1/2 warm water and 1/2 white vinegar. Allow the solution to stand for 15 minutes, then wipe with a cloth or sponge. Rinse with clean water, then wipe again. Alternatively, you can use a purpose made bathroom cleaning product, wipes and sprays are available. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Plug the drain and begin filling the tub with water. You may have to flip a lever near the faucet, or you may have a rubber stopper or bath plug that blocks the drain. If you're not sure if your plug is working, fill the bath with just a little water. The water level won't change if your plug is effective. If your plug is broken, missing, or ineffective, you can make a temporary stopper so you can still enjoy your bath: Use a flat rubber jar gripper--the thing you use to help open stubborn lids--and lay it over the drain. Wet a large hand towel and twist it, stuffing it into the drain. Just don't push it down too far. Place an unused single-cup coffee pod in the open drain. If it's a pop-up plug, get some plumber's putty and make a seal around the plug."

      "content": "Adjust the temperature of the water so that it is no hotter than 100째F (38째C). While you may find a scalding bath relaxing, too-hot water actually agitates your nervous system and can cause a drop in your blood pressure. Your heart will start pumping harder, and you may feel dizzy or sick. On top of that, it can actually make it more difficult for you to relax and fall asleep after a hot bath.

      "content": "Fill the tub until it is about 2/3 full, then turn off the water. Remember that once you step into the tub, the water level will rise. If you fill it to the very top, water is going to spill over the sides and create a spillage and water could go everywhere. Place a bath mat or towel on the floor to catch any water that might slosh out while you bathe or drip off your body when you get out. This will help prevent you from slipping and falling when you step out of the bath."

      "title": "Bring something cool to drink and a washcloth soaked in cold water if desired.",
      "content": "Bring something cool to drink and a washcloth soaked in cold water if desired. As you soak in the warm water, your body will start to try cooling you down by sweating. You can quickly become dehydrated, so make sure you are replacing those fluids by drinking plenty of water. Applying a cold washcloth to your forehead can keep you from overheating. Drink lemon or cucumber water and skip the diuretics (like soda, coffee, alcohol, or caffeinated tea), as these will further dehydrate your body if liked. If you find you get a headache after a bath, drinking water and releasing heat by cooling your forehead, hands, or feet should help."

      "content": "Create a soothing environment. If the purpose of your bath is to relax, then bright, overhead lights and the sounds of arguing neighbors shan't help you unwind. Dim the lights or light a few candles in the bathroom. Turn on calming music, like a classical station or some ambient noise, such as ocean waves or bird calls. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your bath has a curtain, draw it all the way or part-way to trap steam and heat. Just make sure the curtain is not in the bathtub with you. If you have a heater in the bathroom, turn it on to make sure the temperature outside the bath water isn't jarringly cold. Running the bath with the bathroom door closed can also help create a warm environment. Ensure the heater doesn't get wet. Don't use electronics in the tub. This can be dangerous (and potentially deadly). And while your phone or e-reader probably won't electrocute you if you drop it in the tub, it will be ruined. Be careful if you use candles. They could fall over during your bath and burn something. Don't put unsecured candles near the tub. Bring a magazine or book to read. Paperbacks are easier in the bath than heavy, hardback books.

      "content": "Give yourself a massage. Bring a small ball into the bath and place it between your body and the tub. Move your body around on top of the ball to massage your back muscles. You can control the pressure by allowing your body to float up if it's too intense. Try a relaxing face massage , too. Massage your temples with the tips of your fingers, using a circular motion. This can help relieve tension and reduce headaches. If you have a cold, try massaging the bridge of your nose to open up your sinuses . Pinch the bridge of your nose and slide your fingers down toward your nostrils."

You run the risk of severely drying out your skin if you stay in too long. Wrinkled fingers is a good indication that you should start wrapping things up.

      "title": "Skip the soap or save it for the end.",
      "content": "Skip the soap or save it for the end. Hot water can dry your skin, but it's actually soapy water that can do the most damage. Soap can strip the natural oils from your skin, so you may want to use a body wash or gel instead. Otherwise, just wait until the end of your bath so you're not sitting in soapy water for at least another 15 minutes. Look for bubble bath that includes a hydrating oil, or add oil to your bubble bath to keep your skin from drying out. Use a superfatted soap, which contains a lot of oil and will moisturize your skin."

      "content": "Take a quick shower before or after your bath. (optional) Again, there is a dispute over whether it's better to shower before or after bathing. Showering beforehand makes it easier to exfoliate and means you're already nice and clean when you soak. A post-bath shower will help you rinse off any oils, masks, and conditioner that may linger on your body."
