      "content": "Use your basketball shoes to make a bold statement. If you really want to turn heads, cop a vibrant pair that promises to hog the spotlight no matter what else you’re wearing. [2] X Expert Source Veronica Tharmalingam Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 6 April 2021. Neon, reflective stripes, lifted heels, oversized tongues, animal patterns, faux fur—it’s all fair game. Fortunately, basketball shoes aren’t known for being subtle, so you have plenty of options to choose from. [3] X Research source High-tops will draw even more notice than low-tops, since there’s more of them to look at. In addition to color, features like lace type, sole shape, accent details, and limited-edition artwork can make an already fresh pair of sneakers stand out even more."

      "content": "Choose something simple if you want your shoes to go with anything. Simplifying your chosen shape and color palette is the best way to make your sneakers feel like an integrated part of your ensemble rather than the main attraction. Tones like black, white, gray, and navy blue go with just about everything. Red, tan, and army green are also easy shades to work into any number of outfits. [4] X Research source Similarly, the fewer unnecessary details your shoes have, the greater number of other items they’ll harmonize with. Although they’re rarely thought of as basketball footwear anymore, Converse’s Chuck Taylor All-Stars are the quintessential no-frills hoop shoes. Their slim silhouette, modest construction, and almost unlimited number of colorways makes them endlessly versatile and effortless to pull off. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "You can never go wrong with old school kicks. If you’re not sure whether you can pull off some of the wilder designs out there, play it safe and snag yourself a set of perennial favorites, like Air Force 1s or basically any entry in the Air Jordan line. [6] X Research source These shoes tend to have simpler silhouettes and fewer accents, allowing you to keep a low profile even as you elevate your shoe game to new heights. [7] X Research source Reebok Questions, Converse Weapons, and Adidas KB8s are also worth mentioning as part of the “who’s who” of basketball shoes. As far as modern styles go, Nike Kyrie 5s, Converse All-Star Pro BBs, New Balance OMN1S, and Puma Clyde Hardwoods are examples of newer basketball shoes that have retained some of the simplicity and versatility of their retro ancestors.

      "content": "You can find inexpensive choices if you look. If you’re looking to add some basketball shoes to your footwear collection but can’t afford the kind you want, search for a similar pair that’s a little closer to your price range while you save up. Selling clothing and accessories you no longer wear to consignment stores can also give you a little more money to put towards a big purchase. [9] X Research source Basketball shoes are notoriously expensive, since the most sought-after models are usually pumped out by giant name-brand companies and designed in collaboration with celebrity athletes."

      "content": "Don't worry about how “in” your sneakers are if. Instead of fixating on what everyone else is sporting, spend some time browsing shoe stores, online retailers, and fashion blogs and simply see what catches your eye. [11] X Expert Source Susan Kim Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 30 April 2019. Let your sensibilities dictate your style, not the other way around. Whether it’s the season’s hottest release or an old-school staple, finding a pair that looks good to you is just as important as finding a pair that looks good on you."

      "title": "Most basketball shoes are a bit on the bulky side.",
      "content": "Most basketball shoes are a bit on the bulky side. When worn with pants that are a tad too snug, their size can become even more pronounced. Unless you’re okay with this kind of chunky, bottom-heavy look, you’ll be better off choosing trousers that don’t create as much visual contrast. [16] X Research source [17] X Research source Feel free to go as tight as you want in the leg department if you’re modeling a pair with a slimmer silhouette, such as Jordans or Air Force 1s. [18] X Research source Another exception to this guideline is wearing compression pants underneath a pair of shorts, which can actually contribute nicely to a sporty aesthetic."

      "title": "Go for a color contrast to make your shoes pop.",
      "content": "Go for a color contrast to make your shoes pop. Whereas the right jeans will lock down that laid back athleisure vibe you’re going for, the wrong ones can totally sabotage your outfit. As a general rule, contrast is your friend. That means that if your shoes are lighter in color, your jeans should be darker, and vice-versa. [19] X Research source Denim on either end of the brightness spectrum will typically help brightly-colored shoes pop. Putting medium washes with neutral midtones like pale blue or slate gray, on the other hand, may cause both colors to run together. When in doubt, remember your complementary colors—blues go with reds and oranges, purples go with yellow and greens, and so on. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Joggers have elastic cuffs at the bottom. The cuffs cinch the material on the lower leg close to your ankles. The result is a clean, trim fit, with no annoying fabric to conceal your prized footwear. [21] X Research source Joggers come in a wide range of cuts, styles, materials, making it easy to find a pair for almost any occasion."

      "content": "You can show off your shoes even if you don't favor slim-fitting styles. This is a good compromise if you want to rep your favorite display pieces proudly but don’t want to have to update your wardrobe to do so. Just grab that fringe of fabric encircling your ankle, fold it up a couple of times, and prepare to be showered with compliments. [22] X Expert Source Veronica Tharmalingam Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 6 April 2021. For best results, make sure the resulting cuff starts no higher than about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the top part of your shoes. Try not to get too carried away, or you could end up looking like you’re expecting a flood."

      "content": "Consider muting your main wardrobe if your shoes are extravagant. That way, all the glory will belong to your treads. Fancy patterns, elaborate detail work, or overabundant branding elements could put you at risk of going from techy to tacky. [23] X Research source To avoid clashing, make it a point not to display too much of the same color or pattern on both your shoes and clothes. This goes double if your uppers and lowers are almost the same shade, but not quite. If what’s on your legs is too flashy, it may distract from what’s on your feet."

      "title": "Shorts are a great go-to if pants don't work with your sneakers.",
      "content": "Shorts are a great go-to if pants don't work with your sneakers. Sometimes, you just can’t find a shoes-pants combo that works, despite how many you try out. When this happens, you may have no choice but to ditch longer bottoms altogether in favor of shorts. Not only will this solve the dilemma instantly, it will also likely make your outfit look a little more natural, since this is how most people are used to seeing basketball shoes worn on the court. [24] X Research source Shorts also present you with a wider range of options in terms of fit and color, since they don’t run directly into your shoes the way pants do. The only downside of making your shoes shorts-exclusive is that you’ll only be able to break them out when the weather is warm, or when you’re actually playing basketball."
