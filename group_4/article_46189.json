Tables: This is the main way that data is stored in your database. Tables can be compared to spreadsheets in Excel: the data is organized in rows and columns. Because of this, importing data from Excel and other spreadsheet programs is a relatively straightforward process. Forms: You can create and use forms to add, view, and edit any data in a table. Reports: These summarize and display the data in your database. Reports are for analyzing data and returning answers to specific questions, such as how much profit was made, or where customers are located. These are usually designed to be printed or shared with others. Queries: Queries are used to retrieve and filter your data. You can use queries to display specific entries from multiple tables. You can also use queries to create and update data."
