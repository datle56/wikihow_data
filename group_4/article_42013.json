He was worshiped by the Phoenicians, whose city Tyre was said to be a center of wealth in the ancient world.

      "content": "Summon Furcus for power or enlightenment. Some demons are believed to give summoners certain powers like invisibility, great knowledge, or excellent communication skills. [3] X Research source Furcus (also spelled Forcas) can make the summoner invisible and can find lost items and treasures. He can also make you a genius, or a great speaker. Furcas is said to appear as a man with a long beard and white hair who rides a horse and carries a sharp weapon. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Summon Buer for good health. Some occultists find that their health improves after summoning certain demons that are told to heal illnesses, diseases, or other health conditions. Buer is said to heal all illnesses. He can appear as a wheel with five arms or branches. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose something specific to ask the demon for.",
      "content": "Choose something specific to ask the demon for. Although many demons are believed to bring pain and misfortune, some occultists believe that demons can also assist in improving your health, career, or financial situation. [6] X Research source Before you try to summon a demon, decide what you want to ask them for and make sure it’s specific. For example, if you want to make more money each month, be specific about how much more you’d like to earn–whether it’s $500 or $5,000. Not only is this important for helping you choose which demon to summon, but many occultists believe it’s disrespectful to try to summon a demon just for entertainment. Many Western occultists are drawn to “Satanic” rituals like demonic summoning because of stories that represent the Devil as a punisher of criminals. [7] X Research source Some also use black magic as a way to study forces outside of traditional faith and practice magic for personal gain. [8] X Research source Some religions don’t view demons as strictly good or evil. Ancient Mesopotamians believed that most demons caused ailments but that they could be beneficial when canceling out another demon's harmful acts. Many Christians believe that demons are angels who have fallen from heaven and follow the evil Satan. [9] X Research source However, some texts mention good-natured demons who want to help others and grant favors. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a quiet place where no one will disturb you. Although many summoners have different methods, it is believed that demons can be reached through meditation by reaching a trance-like state. [11] X Research source Find a quiet place outside, a graveyard (make sure you don’t perform rituals on graves or private property!), or a closed room with a lockable door. Many ancient Iranian tales believe that demons live deep inside caves in mountains or in deserted castles. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw a pentagram or a large circle. Whatever you use is optional – some summoners prefer chalk or ash, while others use elements like water and soil. Place and light five candles of the same color at each corner of the star in the pentagram or equally distributed around the circle. [13] X Research source Incense can also be used to attract demonic spirits. In some cases, demons can be seen and communicated with through the smoke. Choose a pleasant scent and use an incense holder to safely collect ash."

      "content": "Use the demon’s summoning sigil. Each demon has its own sigil that binds them to the mortal world for a short period. [14] X Research source After you choose which demon you’d like to summon, draw its sigil on a piece of paper. Mammon’s sigil varies, but the most common one used to summon him is a pentagram with an infinity symbol in the center. Draw a second circle around the pentagram, and in the space between write the letters of Mammon’s name. View Furcus' sigil here . View Buer’s sigil here"

      "title": "Bind the demon to the mortal world.",
      "content": "Bind the demon to the mortal world. Some summoners believe that demons have to be bound to the circle or pentagram to prevent them from going into the physical world. To bind the demon, place objects that the demon would not like around the circle or in smaller circles around the pentagram. For example, if you’re summoning a demon who loves wealth, you can place the ashes of a dollar bill, a bent coin, or a check written in nonsense words around the summoning circle.

      "content": "Enter a trance by meditating. Sitting in front of the pentagram or circle, close your eyes and visualize the sigil on your piece of paper to the best of your ability. Feel free to look back at the paper during the meditation to keep the image in your mind. Meditate by taking deep breaths and clearing your mind. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Call out to the demon.",
      "content": "Call out to the demon. While in a meditative state, repeat the demon’s name over and over. State exactly what purpose you summoned them for. For example, if you summoned a demon to help your health, announce exactly what sickness you’d like to be healed from. [17] X Research source “I invite the forces of darkness to bestow their infernal power upon me. I invoke thee (name of demon).” Some believe that you can also repeat a mantra or address the demon through Satan directly: “I entreat thee to inspire (insert name of the demon) to manifest before me that he/she may give me a true and faithful answer, so that I may accomplish my desired end, provided that it is proper to his/her office.” [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Communicate with the demon.",
      "content": "Communicate with the demon. Demons can manifest in different ways – through mirrors, the smoke of the incense, or by using a physical form if you’re in a deep enough meditative state. Some demons can communicate through the summoner’s thoughts or by tapping or moving an object. Communicating with a demon takes lots of time, energy, and practice, so if you don’t get a response immediately, take a break and try again later. [19] X Research source Speak to the demon directly and state clearly what you’d like them to help with. Some summoners also write their requests in coded ciphers on a piece of paper and burn it on the candle to get their message to the demon. [20] X Research source You can also use a Ouija board or a spirit box to communicate with the demon. These spiritual devices let you talk more openly and casually, which might get you more meaningful answers to your questions."

      "title": "Treat the demon with respect.",
      "content": "Treat the demon with respect. Never command them, demand from them, or try to trick them into giving you what you want. Some summoners believe that if you disrespect a demon, they can harm you or make the situation you want them to help with even worse. To build trust and respect, consider offering them something in return for their help that both you and the demon agree on. [21] X Research source"

After you’re sure that the demon is gone, scratch or smudge out the summoning circles so they can’t be used again. [22] X Research source \"Thank you for making yourself known to me this evening. You must now return to the realm you came from, you cannot stay here.\" [23] X Research source"
