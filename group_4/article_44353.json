If the question is written like this, learn how to understand the question. T {\\displaystyle T} means translation.

The right side of the coordinate plane is positive (from 0 to infinity), and the left side is negative (from 0 to negative infinity). For the x-coordinate, move the shape left if it is negative. If the number is positive, move the shape right. For the y-coordinate, move the shape down if it is negative. If the number is positive, move it upwards. You may encounter translations presented as a column vector in the form ( x y ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}}} The same rules for moving left, right, up and down depending on the x and y values still apply. For example, ( − 2 3 ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}}} represents a translation of two boxes left and 3 boxes up. [3] X Research source"

[4] X Research source Another example: T ⟨ − 2 , 5 ⟩ ( △ A B C ) = ( △ A ′ B ′ C ′ ) {\\displaystyle T_{\\langle -2,5\\rangle }(\\triangle ABC)=(\\triangle A'B'C')} If the point was ( 4 , 3 ) {\\displaystyle (4,3)} , move the point to the left 2 boxes.
