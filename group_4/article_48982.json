You can first get a freelance gig or part-time job when your character is a teenager (though the age may vary depending on what country your character is in). Freelance gigs are the fastest way to get money. Get a full-time job. After graduating high school, you can get a full-time job. The job you get depends on your stats and level of education. Go to the casino or horse races. If you already have a little money, you can gamble at the casino or at the horse races to get even more money. Commit a crime. Several crimes will get you some money, but you also have a risk of getting caught and going to jail . Sue someone. If you have a valid claim to sue someone else, you could get paid some money from the lawsuit settlement. Get an inheritance. If one of your character's parents dies and they have a lot of money, your character may inherit some of that money.
