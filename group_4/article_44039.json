      "content": "Sleep with your neck straight. This is a simple trick that can help keep your neck wrinkles from becoming more pronounced. When you sleep with your neck contorted to one side or the other, your skin is more likely to stretch and become loose. Try to sleep on your back with your neck straight instead.

      "title": "Try skin-firming cream.",
      "content": "Try skin-firming cream. The skin on your neck is thinner than in other areas of the body, and it tends to dry out and wrinkle more quickly. Use a moisturizing lotion every day to keep it firm and elastic. If you want to give it an additional boost, try a skin-firming cream that contains retinol or an anti-wrinkle formula. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source You could also consider adding collagen and hyaluronic acid to your routine. These ingredients help hydrate the tissue, which can minimize some of the looks of loose skin, though they wonâ€™t fully tighten it back up. This will help repair the skin and keep it looking young. Apply cream using a gentle circular motion, working from the bottom of the neck toward the chin. Avoid pulling at your skin and dragging it down, since stretching it every which way could make matters worse. In addition to cream, you should also wear sunscreen on your neck. Sun damage can lead to wrinkles and skin damage."

      "content": "Cover up with makeup. This is a quick, nonsurgical option that will reduce the appearance of turkey neck. Just choose a foundation that matches your skin tone, mix it with a little moisturizing cream, and apply it to your neck. Evening out the skin will reduce the appearance of wrinkles and dark shadows that make loose skin look more pronounced. You could also cover up with a turtleneck, a high-collared sweater, or a scarf.
