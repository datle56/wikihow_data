      "title": "Build a solid work history.",
      "content": "Build a solid work history. Although where you have worked is important, the amount of time you have spent in a given job is important as well. Try to stay with a job for at least three years. Staying with an employer for three to four years shows commitment and stability. Build a solid yet related work history by starting at entry-level hotel positions like technical support, accounts payable, or even dishwashing. Commitment and stability are desirable traits employers look for in hotel workers, especially since hotels like to invest in their employees."

      "content": "Obtain the necessary skills. Customer service skills are essential in the hotel industry. Secretarial jobs, sales jobs, and restaurant jobs are just a few examples of jobs that can help you develop great customer service skills. However, try to develop specific skills that are relevant to the position you are applying for.

      "title": "Get a hospitality degree if you plan to work in upper management.",
      "content": "Get a hospitality degree if you plan to work in upper management. Obtain an associate's or a bachelor's degree in hospitality from a college or a university. If your goal is to be a manager, or if you want to get into the business side of the hotel industry, then get a bachelor's degree. If you plan to stay on the operational side of the industry, then an associate's degree may only be necessary. However, a hospitality degree isn't necessary for all hotel positions. Some positions may only require solid work experience and/or training such as health and safety training, food safety training, CPR training, or other related training. For example, if you are applying for a lifeguard position, make sure you have CPR training."

      "content": "Identify potential references. Choose current or previous bosses and superiors who you have developed a good relationship with as your references. Make sure your references can speak to your skills. This way they will be able to sell you to the employer.

    {
      "title": "Create your resume.",
      "content": "Create your resume. A great resume doesn't just list what you have done and accomplished, but it convinces the employer that you are the best fit for the position. Create a great resume by outlining the skills, education/training, and job responsibilities that are relevant to the position you are applying for. For example, if you previously had a bartending job and you are applying for a concierge position, then mention your ability to serve and communicate with a wide range of customers."

      "content": "Rehearse your answers to interview questions. Interviewers typically ask questions to understand their applicants’ behavior. They want to know how a potential employee will react to different types of people and handle different situations. Write down your answers to these questions. Your answers should be truthful and to the point. Use relevant examples to support your answers as well. Rehearse them in front of the mirror. Some examples of typical questions are: [6] X Research source “Where have you worked previously?” “Why did you leave your previous job?” “What were some obstacles you faced in your last job and how did you handle them?” “Do you tend to solve problems on your own, or ask for help?” “Why would you like to work at this hotel?”"

This way, you will have a better understanding and appreciation of the entire industry. [11] X Research source"
