    {
      "title": "Inspect your welder before beginning.",
      "content": "Inspect your welder before beginning. Look at all the wires, hoses, and connections on your welder. Replace any damaged or worn components before using the welder. Some welders require calibration at regular intervals. Always be sure that the calibration is up to date; there is no grace period."

    {
      "title": "Scrape any paint and rust off the metal before welding.",
      "content": "Scrape any paint and rust off the metal before welding. Use 80-grit sandpaper, a wire brush, or an angle grinder with a flap disc and go over the surface of the painted metal. You can purchase the sandpaper or wire brush or rent an angle grinder at a hardware store or online. Continue to grind off the paint and rust until your metal is metallic and shiny looking. If you’re using an angle grinder, be careful not to distort thin metal. If you’re working with thick metal, bevel the edges with an angle grinder to ensure the weld can fully penetrate. Paint and rust will inhibit the electrical connection created by the welder, and can also cause the weld to have porosity in it, which is unwanted"

    {
      "title": "Wipe down the metal with acetone.",
      "content": "Wipe down the metal with acetone. Your metal must also be free of any dust, dirt, or debris because they can inhibit your ability to make good welds. Saturate a cloth in acetone and wipe it over the entire surface of the metal. The acetone should remove any contaminants that could mess with your ability to weld."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry the metal with a clean rag.",
      "content": "Dry the metal with a clean rag. Rub over the surface of the metal, making sure to remove any of the acetone that was left over from washing it. Let the metal fully dry before you start to weld."

    {
      "title": "Clamp your ground clamp to the table you're working on.",
      "content": "Clamp your ground clamp to the table you're working on. Your MIG welder should have a grounding clamp that you clamp onto your table. This will prevent you from getting electrocuted if you end up touching your table. Ensure that the clamp is touching bare metal and not a coated material. Proper connection assures a complete circuit and allows a continuous weld. If the circuit is broken by a non-conducting layer such as paint or another coating, the weld will not be continuous and will lack integrity. If necessary, hook your ground clamp directly to the part."

      "title": "Make tiny circles with your gun as you weld.",
      "content": "Make tiny circles with your gun as you weld. Work your way down the metal, making tiny circles as you move the welding gun. As you move down your piece of metal, you'll start to see hot metal start to pool behind the tip of your welding gun. Once you’ve reached the end of your weld, let go of the trigger and turn off your welding machine. If you move the weld gun too slowly, you may create holes in your sheet of metal. If you move your weld gun too fast, you may not heat the metal hot enough to melt it and your weld will be very thin."

      "title": "Set the welding machine to DC positive.",
      "content": "Set the welding machine to DC positive. The polarity on your machine will determine if you’re welding with an alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC). The DC setting on your machine will have DC negative and DC positive. DC positive provides a large amount of penetration and is the setting that you should use if you're just starting out. The AC setting is used when your power supply only has an AC output. DC negative results in less penetration and should be used on thin sheets of metal."

      "title": "Set the amperage on your stick welder.",
      "content": "Set the amperage on your stick welder. Take a look at the instructions or packaging of the “rod” or electrode that you plan on using for welding. They will have a recommended amperage on them depending on what material they are made of. Use the knob on your welding machine to set the machine to the amperage that it recommends on the electrode’s packaging. If the rods provide an amperage range, split the difference. For instance, if the range is 100 to 150, use 125. The most common electrodes for steel include the 6010, 6011 and 6013."
