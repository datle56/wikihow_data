Reading this was the best part of my day (besides talking to you) 🥰. \" A positive, flirty good morning text will be so appreciated by your Sagittarius crush. “Good morning 🤩. I slept so well.

If you ever wanted someone to talk to, I'm always available. 😊\" Or, if you're proud of your sense of style, send her an outfit-of-the-day text. A quick mirror selfie with a message like, \"What do you think of these shoes with this shirt? Too much?\" will show off your style in a casual, fun way. Being totally real with your Sagittarius crush will have her head over heals for you!"

Barista: What? 🤨🤨...Why am I like this.” Instead of going for a serious, emotional question, try asking her about her favorite movies as a kid.
