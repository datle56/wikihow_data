      "content": "Find the right beard length for you. Everyone has a different standard of what looks good in facial hair. The best way to find the length that works for you is to completely shave your face and let your facial hair grow out . Then, once you’ve reached the desired length, think about what kind of trimmer you need to maintain it. [2] X Research source Take note of your desired length. If you like your beard to be fuller and have a nice fade as it goes down your face and neck, then a powerful trimmer with three guard settings will work great. If you like something shorter and more cropped, or even a 5 o'clock shadow, you don’t need a trimmer with a lot of options or tons of power. You’ll mostly be shaving without a guard using just the blades on the razor head. If you like having a specific facial hairstyle such as a goatee or a chinstrap, you may want a trimmer that has several different trimmer heads and guards. You need something that allows you to swap out your standard trimmer head for a smaller set of blades to get more precision."

With beard trimmers, you usually get what you pay for. This doesn’t mean you have to spend a lot of money, but buying a trimmer that boasts plenty of attachments and features for a smaller price tag might not yield great results.

A trimmer that boasts variable speeds, long-lasting battery, several guard and trimmer head options for $20 probably won’t keep your beard looking trim very long."
