      "title": "Strengthen your forearm muscles by rotating the ball in your hand.",
      "content": "Strengthen your forearm muscles by rotating the ball in your hand. Bend your elbow so that the Powerball is in front of you, roughly 6–12 inches (15–30 cm) above your waist. Then, turn the rotor so that it’s facing inwards on its side. Rotate your forearm in a half-circle like you’re turning a door knob while keeping your wrist locked and your biceps still so that you’re only moving your forearm. Spin the Powerball like this for as long as you can to strengthen your forearm muscles. [1] X Research source This is often used as a soothing exercise for tennis elbow. Consult your physician before using this as a form of physical therapy for tennis elbow, though. Angle your arm upward and hold the ball with the rotor facing up to target your biceps. This is essentially a form of resistance training. Your forearm is working against the centrifugal force inside of the ball."

      "title": "Work your arm and shoulder muscles by holding the ball at your side.",
      "content": "Work your arm and shoulder muscles by holding the ball at your side. Stand straight with your legs under your shoulders and hold the Powerball in the arm you want to exercise. Rotate your wrist in a circular motion with the rotor pointing down. Keep your elbow, forearm, shoulders, and chest entirely still to transfer the isometric force to your muscles and work them out. [2] X Research source Hold your arm higher to focus on your shoulder muscles, or lower to focus on your arm muscles. If your muscles start to hurt, stop. This should feel like a firm massage as your arm and shoulder muscles absorb the vibration."

      "title": "Spin the Powerball in your wrist to strengthen your hand muscles.",
      "content": "Spin the Powerball in your wrist to strengthen your hand muscles. To improve your grip and strengthen your wrist muscles, start spinning your Powerball. Point the rotor downwards and rotate your wrist while moving your arm around in a figure-8 pattern at your side or in front of you. Keep the ball spinning for as long as possible to strengthen your wrists and remove muscle soreness. [3] X Research source This is commonly used as a therapeutic exercise to relieve carpal tunnel syndrome. Consult a physician before doing this to see if this is a good exercise for you. Grip the Powerball with only the tips of your fingers to improve your grip and finger strength."

      "title": "Use the digital screen to track progress if your ball has one.",
      "content": "Use the digital screen to track progress if your ball has one. Some higher-end Powerballs have digital screens that you can use to monitor your progress and set challenges. When using the ball, the screen will monitor the speed of your ball and record the highest and average speed after each session. You can also use the buttons to set a timer if you want to work your wrist for a predetermined period of time. [4] X Research source Digital Powerballs have different screens and buttons based on the model and brand. Read the instruction manual carefully to get acquainted with how your digital Powerball works."

      "title": "Use a Powerball for 5-15 minutes at a time.",
      "content": "Use a Powerball for 5-15 minutes at a time. There are no limitations or requirements for how many repetitions you can do. In general, if you’re using the Powerball as a therapeutic tool, start small with 5- to 10- minute sessions to see what your muscles can handle. If you ever experience pain, strain, or soreness while using a Powerball, stop using it and rest the affected area. [5] X Research source Using your Powerball for 15 minutes a day is a great way to work your arm and wrist without applying too much pressure if you aren’t injured or in physical therapy. Build your duration and speed up over time as you continue practicing with your Powerball."

      "title": "Hold the Powerball up with the exposed rotor facing you.",
      "content": "Hold the Powerball up with the exposed rotor facing you. Grip the Powerball in your nondominant hand with the rotor facing up. The rotor is the exposed section of the interior ball that spins. Inside of the rotor, there’s a gyroscope that perpetually spins so long as you rotate your wrist after starting the ball. Hold the small length of string in your other hand. [6] X Research source Cord-start Powerballs use a length of string to wrap around the ball and wind it up."

      "content": "Move the rotor around until you find the small opening for the cord. The rotor is on a track and can only move in 2 directions—forward and backward. Move the rotor in either direction until you find a small hole in the center of the rotor. This is where you insert the string to wind the Powerball up. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Insert the cord into the hole and hold it in place with your thumb.",
      "content": "Insert the cord into the hole and hold it in place with your thumb. Take your cord and carefully slide it into the opening in the rotor. Once you’ve pushed the cord 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) into the hole, put your thumb on top of the opening to keep it in place. [8] X Research source There is no locking mechanism for the cord. You have to hold it in place with your thumb to keep it from sliding out of the hole. It doesn’t matter which thumb you use to hold the cord in place."

      "title": "Rotate the rotor away from you to wind the ball up.",
      "content": "Rotate the rotor away from you to wind the ball up. With your thumb holding the cord in the hole, slide the rotor away from you with your free hand until the cord slides underneath the case. Then, use one hand to continue spinning the rotor away from you while holding the cord firmly in your other hand. Continue turning the ball by spinning the rotor in the same direction. [9] X Research source The case will hold the cord in place as you rotate your ball and wind it up. It doesn’t matter which hand you use to hold the cord while you rotate the rotor."

      "content": "Stop winding the ball up once you have 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) of cord left. As you wind the ball up, the cord will layer on top of itself along the grooved track. Stop winding the rotor once you have 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) remaining. Then, grip the cord with your nondominant hand and hold the ball in your other hand. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull the cord out quickly to start spinning the ball.",
      "content": "Pull the cord out quickly to start spinning the ball. Turn the ball over so that the rotor is facing downwards. Then, quickly rip the cord away from the ball with your nondominant hand until you’ve totally removed it from the ball. The harder you pull, the faster the ball will spin. Once you feel the Powerball rumbling and vibrating in your hand, the gyroscope inside of the ball is spinning and you can begin moving or turning the ball as you please. [11] X Research source Transfer the Powerball to your nondominant hand after it starts spinning, if you’d like. All Powerballs will stop on their own after a period of time if you stop moving them in your hand or put them down."

      "content": "Grip the Powerball in your nondominant hand so that the rotor faces up. Hold the ball in your nondominant hand. Rotate the ball around until the rotor, the exposed section of the ball inside of the case, is facing up. Try moving the rotor with your finger to find the direction that it travels. Orient the ball so that the rotor’s track is perpendicular to your body. [12] X Research source The rotor is the exposed section of the internal ball that you use to start the Powerball. It takes up roughly 1/5 of the ball and is fairly easy to identify. The Powerball’s rotor only moves forward and back, so you need to toy with it a little to find the direction of the track."

      "title": "Use your fingers to spin the rotor by brushing over it quickly.",
      "content": "Use your fingers to spin the rotor by brushing over it quickly. Raise your dominant hand and stick your fingers out flat like you’re going to perform a karate chop. Then, quickly brush your fingers along the top of the rotor like you’re wiping the surface of the rotor off. Repeat this as fast as you comfortably can to start spinning the rotor. [13] X Research source You’re essentially forcing the rotor to start by striking it with your hand at an angle. This is kind of the same motion that you use to spin a roulette wheel or fidget spinner . Swap the Powerball into your other hand if you’re more comfortable moving the rotor with your nondominant hand. If you can reach the rotor with the thumb of the hand you’re using to hold the ball, you can spin it with that thumb once you get some practice!"

      "title": "Rotate the ball in your hand with the rotor facing up to start it.",
      "content": "Rotate the ball in your hand with the rotor facing up to start it. With the rotor spinning, use your nondominant hand to move the ball in a circular motion. Keep the rotor facing up and maintain a consistent speed. Once you find the right cadence, the gyroscope inside of the rotor will start spinning. When the ball starts rumbling or moving, the gyroscope is spinning and you can stop turning the ball in your hand. [14] X Research source This requires a little bit of practice since this process requires the right cadence and speed based on your Powerball’s weight and size. Theoretically, you can keep rotating your wrist to keep the gyroscope spinning forever. Swap hands after the ball has started spinning if you want to hold it in your other hand."

      "content": "Find the arrow printed on the ball’s exposed rotor. Turn the Powerball over in your hand until you find the exposed section of the interior ball, called the rotor. Turn the rotor in the direction in which it moves freely until you find the arrow that is printed on the ball. The ball is wound in the direction opposite of this arrow. [15] X Research source The rotor is on a track and can only be moved in 2 directions. The arrow indicates which direction the ball spins."

      "title": "Roll the rotor in the opposite direction of the arrow to wind it up.",
      "content": "Roll the rotor in the opposite direction of the arrow to wind it up. Once you find the arrow, hold the ball in both hands. Use your thumbs to pull the exposed section in the opposite direction. Once you feel some resistance, the ball is starting to wind up. Continue pulling the exposed section back until you can’t forcefully wind it up any further. [16] X Research source The further that you wind the ball up, the faster it will spin. There is no minimum or maximum in terms of how far you need to wind the ball up. It’s completely a matter of personal preference. It usually takes 3-4 turns to fully wind the ball up. It isn’t particularly hard to turn, so don’t worry about straining your thumbs."

      "content": "Release the exposed section of the ball to start it. Once you’ve wound the ball up, release both of your thumbs. The rotor will start spinning in the opposite direction, which will turn the gyroscope in the middle of the ball. [17] X Research source Once the gyroscope is started, you’ll feel the ball rumble and move around in your hand. This is a sign that your Powerball is operating correctly."

      "title": "Choose a cord-start Powerball if you want to make starting the ball easier.",
      "content": "Choose a cord-start Powerball if you want to make starting the ball easier. Cord-start Powerballs use a ripcord to initiate the gyroscopic motion inside of the ball. They’re easier to use than other models, and you won’t need to use a ton of force to get the ball spinning. Get a cord-start Powerball if you want to exercise your wrist since you won’t strain your wrist muscles when you start it. [19] X Research source Powerballs come in different weights and sizes. Get one that fits comfortably in your hand and feels easy to hold."

      "title": "Buy a cordless Powerball if you want to control the speed.",
      "content": "Buy a cordless Powerball if you want to control the speed. Cordless Powerballs need to be spun around by hand to start them. They require more effort to start, but a lot of people enjoy manually starting the ball and trying to get it spinning as fast as they can. Buy a cordless Powerball if you don’t mind putting in a little more effort and want more control over the speed of the gyroscope. [20] X Research source Like cord-started powerballs, these items come in a variety of weights and sizes. Get a Powerball that feels comfortable to you."

      "content": "Buy an automatic Powerball if you’re using it for physical therapy. Autostart Powerballs are the easiest version to start. These balls don’t require any physical pulling or turning to spin, which makes them ideal if you’re treating carpal tunnel syndrome or strengthening your wrist after a strain. [21] X Research source Like other models, there are different sizes and weights of automatic Powerballs. Get one that fits your palm and feels comfortable to hold. If you’re trying to track your rehabilitation progress, get an automatic Powerball with a digital screen. These balls can be set to run for a predetermined amount of time, which makes it easy to control your therapeutic sessions."
