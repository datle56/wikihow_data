      "content": "Tear the rib from fresh leaves, then add them to your dish. First, fold your fresh kaffir lime leaf in half along the rib, which is the woody part running lengthwise down the leaf. Then, pinch the tip of the rib and pull downward to tear it from the leaf. Once you've removed the rib, toss the remaining leaf pieces into a dish as it's cooking to impart a bright, citrusy flavor. Tearing the leaf helps release some of its fragrance and flavor. You can also crush the leaf to bruise it for a stronger flavor. Fresh kaffir lime leaves can be used in a variety of recipes, including soups, curries, and noodle dishes."

      "content": "Store fresh leaves in the refrigerator for 2 weeks. As with any fresh herb, you'll need to refrigerate your fresh leaves to help them retain their color and flavor. Place them in a resealable plastic bag or an airtight container, then put them in your refrigerator for 14 days, or longer if they still have a firm texture and deep green color. If you don't think you'll use the leaves in time, you can freeze them for up to a year. Just put them in a freezer bag and squeeze out as much air as you can without crushing the leaves. Then, label the bag and place it in the freezer until you need it. You can defrost the leaves by leaving them at room temperature for 20-30 minutes. [3] X Research source"
