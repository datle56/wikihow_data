      "content": "It means you’ve traded Snaps with someone for at least 3 straight days. A Snapchat Streak (Snapstreak) means you have exchanged (both sent and received) Snaps with a person on your Friends list for at least 3 consecutive “days” (24-hour periods). As long as you keep exchanging at least one set of Snaps each “day,” your streak will keep growing! [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Exchange photo or video Snaps with a friend within a 24-hour period. It’s super easy to get started toward a Snapstreak! Just Snap a friend and make sure they Snap you back within 24 hours. There are a few things to keep in mind, though. [2] X Research source Only Snaps count, not Chats. Group Snaps don’t count, only those sent to an individual Friend. Only regular photo or video Snaps, not those with Memories or Spectacles content, count. If you’re brand-new to Snapchat and need help getting started , don’t worry—with a little help, you'll get the hang of it in no time!"

      "content": "Snap back and forth over 3 straight days to officially start a Snapstreak. “Day 1” of your potential Snapstreak starts as soon as you exchange Snaps back and forth with a friend—say, for example, at 2 pm on January 1. You have to exchange Snaps back and forth again before 2 pm on January 2 (“Day 2”), then do it again between 2 pm on January 2 and 2 pm on January 3 (“Day 3”). Once you hit Day 3, your Snapstreak is official! [3] X Research source As long as your streak continues, each “day” (24-hour window) will begin at the same time of day (2 pm, for example) as your original Day 1."

      "content": "🔥 = You’re on a Snapstreak. If you see a flame emoji show up next to your friend’s name, congrats—you’ve begun a Snapstreak! That flame will stay there for as long as your streak continues. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "52🔥 = Your streak has lasted 52 days. Don’t worry about keeping track of how long your Snapstreak has lasted—the number is right there for you, just to the left of the flame emoji. If you make it to 100 days, you’ll even get a special “100” emoji (💯) to celebrate your achievement. [5] X Research source"

Otherwise, you’ll have to start a new one. [6] X Research source Snapchat doesn’t reveal exactly when the hourglass emoji shows up—such as 4, 3, or 2 hours before your streak will expire. Their advice is to act right away when you see the hourglass."

Instead of trying to come up with something new and creative each day, create a simple Snap that you can send everyday without putting any thought to it. One common choice among high-flying Snapstreakers is to Snap an image of the word “streak” at the same time every day. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Give someone you trust access to send streak-saving Snaps for you. If you’re worried you might lose a long Snapstreak because you can’t find your phone, it may be worthwhile to designate a “Streaksitter.” This is someone, like a friend or sibling, that's designated to use your account to send a Snap in order to keep a streak going. If you choose to go this route, make sure to choose someone reliable and trustworthy. Remember, you’re giving them access to your account."

      "content": "Appeal to Snapchat if you think a Snapstreak unfairly ended. It can be devastating when a long-running streak ends—especially if you feel like there’s been a mistake. If this happens to you, contact Snapchat support ( https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/requests/new ) and explain your situation. It’s possible that your Snapstreak will be restored and you’ll see that little 🔥 again! [9] X Research source Some long-time Snapstreakers have resorted to starting online petitions in order to get a lost streak restored, but that’s wishful thinking as opposed to a viable strategy."

      "content": "Take a step back if you feel huge pressure to keep a Snapstreak going. Seeing that little number beside the flame emoji grow bigger and bigger can get really addictive. Instead of a fun little game to play with your friend, it can feel like a huge responsibility that you simply have to keep going. You may end up going to extreme lengths like designating a “Streaksitter,” interrupting important events, or changing your schedule just to ensure you can keep a streak going. [10] X Research source If your streak feels less like a fun activity and more like an obligation, talk to your Snapstreak friend about it. They might be just as eager as you to let the streak end and just get back to having fun on Snapchat."

      "content": "Steer clear of thinking Streak = Friend , so No Streak = Not a Friend . A long Snapstreak can become a powerful emblem of friendship, a sign that proves that you and your fellow streaker are true BFFs. But, if you load all of that importance onto a streak, it can make it feel as though your friendship will end if the Snapstreak ends. In other words, you might think to yourself, “How can we really be friends?—we don’t even have a Snapstreak!” [11] X Research source Take a moment and consider this: If Snapchat went bankrupt and shut down tomorrow, would this person still be your friend? If so, then your Snapstreak is just a fun sign of your friendship, not its defining characteristic."

      "content": "Be wary of “friend hierarchies” based only on Snapstreak lengths. Especially when you have multiple Snapstreaks happening, it’s easy to conflate the length of a streak with the strength of a friendship. That is to say, if you have a 134🔥 with Zoey but only a 71🔥 with Anna, you may be tempted to feel like Zoey is twice as important of a friend—even if Anna is actually the more positive and supportive friend. [12] X Research source In this case, you may want to try really hard to ignore the little numbers next to the flame emojis on your Friends list. Enjoy having streaks with your pals, but avoid putting stock into the actual length of each Snapstreak."
