People who exercise frequently or play sports, especially sports where your feet and toes endure trauma like soccer and ballet, are more prone to developing an ingrown toenail. After these activities, take off your shoes and socks and let your toes breathe for one to two hours. Do this by wearing sandals or by walking barefoot afterwards. Also, by thoroughly cleaning and drying your toes and feet after strenuous, physical activities, you may be able to reduce your risk of developing an ingrown toenail. Using socks made of cotton instead of synthetic material may help your toes and feet breathe better."
