      "content": "It is completely normal for your cat to breathe heavily during labor . Your feline friend is exerting a lot of energy during birth and is likely pretty uncomfortable. Once it’s over, she’ll be noticeably calm, so if she continues to pant after the first couple of kittens are born, there are likely more on the way. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source Cats are pretty self-sufficient during the birthing process and require very little assistance , so if your cat is panting, restless, and licking for more than 24 hours without any signs of straining, it’s best to contact a veterinarian for advice on how to proceed."

      "content": "Feline labor, much like for humans, is painful. So cats in active labor are pretty vocal, but there’s usually no need to worry. As the kittens move through to the birth canal, your cat may make a chirping or yowling sound. [3] X Research source If your cat is screaming for longer than an hour without any sign of delivery, get in touch with your vet, as Punt agrees this could be a sign of distress."

      "content": "Cats bear down in the second and third stages of labor. This probably looks like she’s trying to use the bathroom. Kittens may seem tiny, but serious force is required to push each through the cat’s birth canal. In between births, your cat will likely clean and tend to her kittens and then push for at least 10-15 minutes. [4] X Research source After the first birth, kittens should come every 10 minutes to an hour. Contact your vet if your cat is straining for longer than 25-30 minutes, as this could be a sign of an obstruction. Feline labor usually lasts between 4 to 16 hours . If your cat is in labor but hasn’t given birth to any kittens within 16 to 24 hours, visit your vet immediately. [5] X Research source A cat can sometimes deliver her kittens days apart , which is called interrupted labor. She typically stops straining and laboring, tends to her kittens, and rests for 24 to 36 hours. So keep monitoring your cat even if it appears like she is done laboring. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Yep, that’s a kitten. It’ll look like a dark patch poking through your cat’s vagina. However, if the fetus is not delivered within the first 10 minutes of crowning, or emerging from the birth canal, it might be stuck. If this happens, it’s best not to wriggle the kitten free on your own, which could lead to more discomfort for your cat and further difficulties for the kitten. Contact your vet for more information on how to proceed. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Licking dissolves the thin membrane surrounding the kitten. The double-layered sac is filled with a slimy liquid, which allows the kittens to move smoothly through the birth canal. As the cat senses the kittens shifting, she’ll lick the area repeatedly. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "You can expect placentas to pass approximately 15 minutes after each birth. However, if you’re waiting longer for the placenta (rust-colored, fleshy mass) to pass after a kitten is born, there’s a chance you’re also waiting on more kittens. [9] X Research source Sometimes 2 or 3 kittens are born before any of their placentas are passed. It’s not a perfect science, but try to keep track if possible. Cats will also eat the placenta after it has passed. This is totally normal! [10] X Research source If 1 or more kittens are born without the placenta passing shortly after, contact your vet. Placentas remaining in the uterus may lead to infection. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "This may be unsettling, but it’s not permanent.",
      "content": "This may be unsettling, but it’s not permanent. Especially as she’s giving birth, your cat’s main priorities are to protect herself and her newborn kittens. The process of labor is a bit of a shock to her system, and she’s only getting adjusted. She’ll begin to calm down after she has finished delivering her little ones. [12] X Research source Do not raise your voice or correct this behavior using tools like spray bottles. This may only escalate her protectiveness. Aggression sometimes continues for 3-4 weeks after kittens are born as her hormones regulate. This is especially true if your cat developed this behavior during her pregnancy. Make note of these mood changes and talk to your vet about what you can do to make your cat feel safe during this time. DeVoss says cats can also act aggressively when they “are experiencing pain,” as they “typically don’t want to be touched.” So while it’s okay to stay in the room while she gives birth, try not to touch her or invade her space."

      "content": "Cats will briefly tend to their kittens after they’re born, then resume pushing. This bonding time between the mom and newborns is precious, but she won’t be able to rest and care for her newborns until she delivers the rest of her litter. Depending on how many kittens she’s expecting, you might notice her develop a rhythm: pant, push, lick the kitten, nudge the kitten to nurse, and repeat. [13] X Research source If you notice your cat withdrawing from her kittens completely, like not cleaning or nursing them, contact your vet for the next steps. Make sure to give your cat some space to bond with her kittens, so she feels relaxed and comfortable. There will be plenty of time later on for you to snuggle the new arrivals. It’s also best not to leave the room at any time during the birthing process, as your cat may be tempted to follow you. [14] X Research source Care for your cat properly once all the kittens are born. Punt advises keeping the room quiet and warm so she feels safe and can bond and nurse her babies. Change out her bedding and provide her with food and water when she’s ready to eat."

The discharge might even be tinged with blood, but this is also normal. [15] X Research source Contact your vet immediately if your cat is bleeding excessively, as this is almost certainly a sign of distress. [16] X Research source Inform your vet if your cat is experiencing bloody discharge for longer than a week after giving birth. [17] X Research source"

While cats don’t usually look for food immediately after giving birth, they’ll likely start to have an appetite in the hours that follow. However, this varies and may take up to 24 hours. Talk to your vet about specific dietary needs and requirements to make sure both cat and kittens are getting all their necessary nutrients. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "A soft and slightly deflated belly is usually a sign she’s done giving birth. A large, firm belly is one of the clearest signs that your cat is pregnant . Once she delivers all of her babies, her stomach may be slightly smaller (but still large) and loose-looking. If she still has kittens to give birth to, her belly typically still appears firm. [19] X Research source You might even notice movement inside her stomach, which is another sign that she has more kittens to deliver. Signs the kitten(s) inside may be dead: If you stop seeing movement inside your cat’s stomach while she’s pregnant, this might be a sign that the kitten(s) passed away. Visit your vet immediately if you suspect this is the case. Some other signs include lethargy, lack of appetite, foul odor, and trouble using the bathroom. Note : Your cat’s stomach may still appear larger than normal even after she’s done giving birth. It usually takes 3 weeks for her belly to return to normal. [20] X Research source"

If a prior X-ray or ultrasound revealed more kittens than were ultimately delivered, seek veterinary advice on how to move forward. An emergency C-section may be required. [21] X Research source You can expect your vet to do more imaging to see how many kittens are left in the cat’s uterus. Vets may also want to do bloodwork to make sure the mom’s calcium and blood sugar levels are normal. Finally, an ultrasound may be done to check the kittens’ heartbeats. [22] X Research source"
