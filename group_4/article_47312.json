      "title": "Turn your clothes inside out to protect the rhinestones.",
      "content": "Turn your clothes inside out to protect the rhinestones. Pull the sleeves or legs through your clothes until they are inside out and protected. This will keep the rhinestones from snagging on anything while you wash and dry them. [1] X Research source Some garments, like bras or bandanas, can’t be turned inside out, which is fine."

      "title": "Avoid using pre-wash sprays, as they could soften the rhinestone glue.",
      "content": "Avoid using pre-wash sprays, as they could soften the rhinestone glue. Some laundry sprays, like stain remover or pre-treatments, can dissolve or even remove the glue that binds your rhinestones to your clothes. Try not to use any sprays before you wash your garments so your rhinestones stay intact. [2] X Research source If your clothing does have any stains on it, gently rub the area with warm water and laundry detergent to get the stain out before you wash it."

      "title": "Put small garments into a delicates bag.",
      "content": "Put small garments into a delicates bag. Pick up a mesh bag made to hold delicates, like bras and underwear. Put any small rhinestone garments, like bras, tank tops, or bandanas, into this bag before you start washing them. [3] X Research source These mesh bags provide an extra layer of protection between your garment and the washing machine so that the rhinestones don’t snag on anything. You can find delicates bags at most home goods stores."

      "title": "Wash your clothes on a delicate cycle in cold water.",
      "content": "Wash your clothes on a delicate cycle in cold water. Set your washer to “delicate” or “gentle” to protect the integrity of your rhinestones. Make sure your washer is using cold water, not hot, so the glue that binds your rhinestones doesn’t melt. [4] X Research source Delicate cycles are more gentle because they don’t spin your clothes as much."

      "title": "Turn your clothes inside out to protect them.",
      "content": "Turn your clothes inside out to protect them. Even when hand washing, the rhinestones on your garment could snag on something and harm your clothing. Turn the legs or sleeves of your garment inside out so the rhinestones are protected on the inside. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Fill a bucket or sink with cold water and mild soap.",
      "content": "Fill a bucket or sink with cold water and mild soap. Choose a bucket or sink that’s big enough to fit your garment inside fully. Then, fill it up about halfway with cold water and add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of mild laundry detergent. [6] X Research source Try to find laundry detergent that is free of extra dyes and chemicals."

      "title": "Swish your garment around in the water for about 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Swish your garment around in the water for about 5 minutes. Put your garment into the cold water and the soap and make sure it is fully submerged. Agitate the garment with your hands and turn it over a few times to wash it all over. [7] X Research source Try not to squeeze or wring your garment as you wash it, or you could damage the rhinestones."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the garment until the water runs clear.",
      "content": "Rinse the garment until the water runs clear. Take your clothing out of the soapy water and bring it to the sink. Run it under cold water until all of the soap is gone and the water runs clear. [8] X Research source Make sure you get all of the soap out of your garment so it doesn’t dry with a film of detergent on it."

    {
      "title": "Squeeze the excess water out of your garment gently.",
      "content": "Squeeze the excess water out of your garment gently. Turn off the water from your sink and carefully press your garment in between your hands. Squeeze your garment until the water stops dripping off it to remove the majority and make it dry faster. [9] X Research source You can pat it dry with a towel if you’re having trouble getting a lot of the water out."

      "title": "Keep your rhinestone clothes inside out.",
      "content": "Keep your rhinestone clothes inside out. As you take your clothes out of the washer or the sink, keep them inside out so the rhinestones don’t snag on anything. Don’t turn them right side out until they are all the way dry. [10] X Research source Your clothes will be easier to turn right side out after they are dry."

      "title": "Hang up garments to air dry if they are delicate.",
      "content": "Hang up garments to air dry if they are delicate. Don't toss your dance or ice-skating costume in the dryer! They're often made of delicate materials like spandex, so hanging them to dry is your best bet. Drape your outfit over a flat surface and flip it over every few hours until it's completely dry. You'll be back on the ice or dance floor looking great in no time. [11] X Research source Bras and costumes usually don’t do well in the dryer. Check the care label on your garments to double check how they should be dried."

      "title": "Dry your clothing on a gentle cycle with low heat if you can.",
      "content": "Dry your clothing on a gentle cycle with low heat if you can. If you are drying normal clothing like denim, cotton, or linen, put it in your dryer while it is still inside out. Then, set your dryer on a gentle or delicates cycle with the heat on low to rock your rhinestone clothing again in just a few hours. Try not to use high heat, or you could melt the glue that binds the rhinestones to your clothes. If the care label on your garment has a circle with dots inside of it, it’s safe to tumble dry."
