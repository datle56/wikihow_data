      "content": "Protect yourself. Even a dog which is normally kind and docile is more likely to behave in a hostile way if injured. If you suspect a dog is injured, always take care not to be bitten or otherwise injured. To the extent that you are able, avoid the dog's face and mouth. While your first impulse may be to comfort the animal, do not hug or squeeze it. Approach the dog slowly and calmly, to avoid frightening it any more than it may be already. Covering the dog's head gently with a towel or other piece of fabric can sometimes lessen its anxiety during examination. [2] X Research source"

If you already have a muzzle for your dog, carefully put it on him or her. If not, you can wrap the dog's mouth using a towel, stockings, a roll of gauze, or any similar strip of fabric. Wrap it over the dog's snout and under its chin, being careful not to cover its nose or obstruct its breathing. Never muzzle a dog that is vomiting. This can cause it to choke. Never muzzle a dog with chest injuries or a short-snouted dog such as a pug or bulldog. [3] X Research source"

Speak gently and calmly to the dog as you examine to help it stay calm. Stop the examination if the dog becomes obviously agitated. If the dog has a cut or similar wound, you may need to clip away some of the dog's fur to get a clear look at how bad it is. Spreading a little petroleum jelly over the wound can prevent hair clippings from getting stuck in it. [4] X Research source"

There is a good chance you will need to move the injured dog, whether you are bringing it home, taking it to a vet, or just trying to get it out of a busy street. An injured dog must be moved gently and with great care. If you are able to, splint, bandage or otherwise stabilize wounded areas before moving the dog to reduce the risk of further harm. Confine the dog while moving it so it can't hurt itself more. If possible, use a pet carrier, but if you don't have one, punch some holes in a box. Larger dogs can be moved using a makeshift stretcher. You can use a board, a door, a rug, or a large blanket, carried by at least two people."
