It's the most attractive trait that you can have.\" Embody it by: maintaining good posture ; making eye contact ; taking care of yourself . Dating coach John Keegan notes how self-care can take a nose dive when you have low self-confidence, warning that if you \"aren't consciously working on [yourself], most women would find that very unattractive.\" \"Not that it has to be any one body shape or size,\" Keegan advises. It's just about presenting yourself in such a way that you look as though you look after your health and take care of yourself."

      "content": "Loyalty Ultimately, women are looking for a ride-or-die. If you're going to be a life partner, that means you're willing to share all of the ups and downs that come and that you'll be by her side no matter what. This doesn't necessarily mean that you have a monogamous relationship (that's between the two of you), but it does mean that you stay loyal to whatever dynamic you have and never betray her trust in you.

When you care about someone very deeply, it's natural to pay close attention to them. [13] X Research source This is why women tend to look for a partner who shows that they're attentive and cares about the little details. Embody it by: taking note of something small she likes so you can get it for her later as a treat; following up on something she mentioned in an earlier conversation; anticipating her needs through her body language (for example, bringing her a blanket if she's shivering)."

Women look for a partner who is willing to let down their walls and be vulnerable with her because that tells her that she's safe letting down her walls and being vulnerable with them.

When you're self-aware, you can spot patterns in your own behavior and recognize when you're doing something that might be irritating to your partner.

[17] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Women want partners who are constantly curious about their lived experiences rather than acting based on stereotypes and assumptions about how they're likely to react. Curiosity shows that you're aware you don't know everything or have all the answers. Embody it by: asking questions rather than making assumptions; seeking more information when you disagree."

      "content": "She wants you to respect her boundaries. All healthy relationships are built on consent. Women tend to feel safer and more comfortable in relationships where their boundaries are clearly respected. Ask her what she's ok with and what she wants you to ask about first. When she asserts a boundary , stop what you're doing immediately and don't push it any further. [19] X Research source Danker notes that \"the majority of women, just in general, on a day to day basis, don't feel safe.\" She recommends showing that you're \"willing to protect her and help her feel safe.\" This means that not only do you respect her boundaries, but when the two of you are out in public, you're keeping an eye out to make sure that everyone around is respecting her boundaries as well and no one is making her feel unsafe or uncomfortable. She might have a different set of boundaries for you than for other people, but that doesn't mean you can ignore them completely. For example, if she doesn't normally enjoy hugs but she likes them from you as long as you ask first, make sure you ask every single time (even if she always says yes). Just remember: if she says no or tells you to stop doing something, that's the end of the discussion. Simply stop and change the subject or move on to something else."

A woman wants her partner to always feel as though they can discuss whatever's on their mind—and she also wants to feel comfortable bringing anything up with you. Being honest with her is a great way to help her feel safe and secure . [20] X Research source If you've been together for a while, set aside a regular time—say once a month—for the two of you to sit and have a talk about the relationship. This gives you an opportunity to clear the air about anything that's been bugging you before it grows into a bigger problem."

      "content": "She wants you to listen to her . \"Women like to vent,\" Danker explains. So it's best to allow her \"to vent without having to problem-solve it or fix it for her.\" Often, when she's talking about a problem, she \"really just wants to feel heard and… know that [you] understand where she's coming from.\" Get in the habit of paraphrasing back what she's said to you—it shows her that you're listening and also allows her to clear up anything you might have misunderstood. For example, if she's ranting about work, you might say, \"I hear you saying that your coworkers are frustrating you with their inability to choose a time for the meeting. That must be really stressful to deal with.\""

In a relationship, she wants her partner to acknowledge and accept her feelings. [21] X Research source The best way to validate her feelings is simply to be quiet and let her talk. Reassure her that her feelings are normal and natural and that it's totally reasonable for her to feel that way."

      "content": "She wants you to show that you appreciate her and are grateful for her. Women love to feel appreciated, and it's so easy—all you have to do is thank her for all of the wonderful things she does. Expressing gratitude lets her know that you don't expect her to do things for you and keeps you from taking one another for granted. [22] X Research source This includes acknowledging when something is difficult for her or when she sacrifices something for you or for the good of your relationship. When she has to give something up, let her know that you see it."

That means if you're in a relationship with a woman, she wants to hear all of those sweet things that you think about her—all day, every day. She'll be over the moon if you get in the habit of sharing thoughts and compliments with her.

Healthy partners encourage each other to do whatever they can to improve themselves and become better and more fulfilled people. Women want partners who will go all in to cheer them on. It's also helpful to recognize when her goals might change, rather than trying to hold her to old paths that are no longer working for her. [25] X Research source Show interest in the things that she's interested in. Ask her what her goals are and what she gets out of it. This will help you better understand her journey. If you're not sure what would be the best way to support her, just ask! For example, you might say, \"I really want to support you in your bid for a promotion at work. How can I do that best?\""

Danker emphasizes that women \"want physical affection, without it having to be sexual, without it having to lead to sex every time.\" She notes that \"the majority of the women that I work with… feel like they can't be fun and flirty and touchy with a man because, if she is, then he automatically wants to have sex and if she doesn't… he gets upset.\" Danker acknowledges that this isn't always true, but that \"we have a way of getting in these negative mindsets about it.\" She recommends \"just knowing that you can be physically affectionate and playful and flirty for the sake of that, without it having to be sexual.\" There's an aspect of chemistry that neither of you can control or guarantee. But it's more likely that chemistry will stick around and get stronger if you're regularly physically affectionate with each other. [26] X Research source"

When you're living together and have a family together, life responsibilities can keep you from spending as much time together as you might like. You can fix this by scheduling regular date nights every week. Couples who spend more quality time together report greater relationship satisfaction overall.

      "title": "Meaning and fulfillment",
      "content": "Meaning and fulfillment Several studies determined that women tend to view their lives as meaningful when they feel that their lives matter and they're making progress working towards specific goals. This is most likely to happen when all the different aspects of a woman's life—including her romantic and platonic relationships—are in harmony with her purpose and goals. Of course, each woman has her own ideas of what she finds fulfilling and meaningful. [35] X Research source For example, a woman who feels passionately about animal welfare might run the social media accounts for a nonprofit animal rights organization and volunteer for a local no-kill shelter. Ultimately, women are more likely to choose a partner that they share a lot in common with—especially when it comes to things they feel very strongly about. This is likely because they get more fulfillment out of life if they can share those things with their partner. [36] X Research source For example, a woman who is committed to environmental causes might get along great with an environmental scientist, but she probably wouldn't have much in common with an oil executive. Women may also believe that it's impossible to truly trust a partner who doesn't agree with them on certain issues, such as women's rights."

While women have lots in common with each other, especially if they've grown up in similar circumstances, every woman is an individual with her own interests, values, beliefs, and goals. All women want respect, love, security, and companionship—but those words might have a slightly different meaning depending on the woman."
