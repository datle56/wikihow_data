In Word 2007 and 2010, click the \"Show Markup\" drop-down in the Tracking group of the Review menu ribbon and make sure the Comments option is checked. Selecting Markup from the View menu again in Word 2003 or unchecking the Comments option in Word 2007 or 2010 will turn off the markup feature, hiding the comments."
