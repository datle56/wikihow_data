      "content": "Ticket-buying bots usually use VPNs and proxy servers to hide their identities. Ticketmaster has a serious bot problem—people use bots to buy tons of tickets and sell them at a higher price on other websites, making it hard for real music fans to get tickets to their favorite artists' concerts. Because bots usually mask their IP addresses with VPNs, proxy servers, or services like Apple Private Relay, Ticketmaster often automatically blocks connections from these services."

If there's another Wi-Fi network near you that you can connect to, try that as well. If you can get to Ticketmaster on a different network, buy those tickets! This also means the IP address assigned to you by your ISP is blocked. If the problem persists, take a screenshot of the error , write down your public IP address , and share it with your ISP's support team so they can work with Ticketmaster to resolve the issue. If you have access to a reputable VPN (we tested this successfully with SurfShark ), try connecting to it and reloading the Ticketmaster site. If your VPN supports multiple regions, choose a region in the United States ."
