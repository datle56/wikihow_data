      "title": "On TikTok, “aura” describes someone cool and confident.",
      "content": "On TikTok, “aura” describes someone cool and confident. If someone has “aura,” they have the “it” factor—they’re who everyone wants to be! This slang term became popular with Gen Z on TikTok in 2024 and is used the same way as a “cool factor” or “vibe.” [1] X Research source Did you see Steph Curry’s shot last night? He’s got crazy aura. [2] X Research source Your aura >>> I don’t know. He lost aura points when he cheated."

      "title": "“Aura points” lightheartedly describe how cool someone is.",
      "content": "“Aura points” lightheartedly describe how cool someone is. “Adding or losing aura points is a way to describe the coolness factor (or lack thereof) of someone's actions,” explains Lizarraga. If someone has lots of “aura points,” they’re totally cool—they’re who you want to be. If someone has a low number (or zero) “aura points,” they’re totally lame. On TikTok, users award or dock points to each other based on their life experiences and awkward encounters. The more “aura points” you have, the cooler you’re thought to be. [3] X Research source For example, you might “lose” 100 aura points for dropping your lunch tray, but you may gain 100 points for rocking a new outfit. Users reward points in the comments of posts and videos, but the points don’t really mean anything. Remember, this trend is all for fun and doesn’t actually determine how awesome you are!

      "title": "“How many aura points did I lose?”",
      "content": "“How many aura points did I lose?” You may see this question popping up on your TikTok FYP, and that’s because it’s one of the most popular “aura” trends! Users share an embarrassing or awkward story and then ask their followers how many “aura points” they lost because of it. [4] X Research source For instance, walking to school with new shoes might earn you 2,000 aura points, but walking around with your backpack unzipped may cost you 600. Similarly, users might share red flags they’ve experienced while dating, asking their followers how many “aura points” the other person lost. How to join the trend: Post a video sharing a time when you felt uncool or embarrassed, and don’t forget to add the trend question with the text feature! For example, you might write “How many aura points did I lose when I replied all instead of forwarding the email.” Here’s an example from TikToker @alyssamckayyy."

      "title": "“Auramaxxing”",
      "content": "“Auramaxxing” If someone’s “auramaxxing,” they’re trying to maximize their aura or be cooler. As Lizarraga clarifies, “A key component of aura is having unspoken confidence, showing and not telling.” TikTok users will post videos about what they’re doing to improve themselves or their lives. This might include going to the gym, getting a new wardrobe, or talking less. [5] X Research source How to join the trend: Make a video about what you’re doing to improve your life! Maybe that’s eating a healthy breakfast every day or reading a self-help book. Here’s an example from TikToker @ratisupremacy."

      "title": "“Define aura”",
      "content": "“Define aura” Is there someone you follow that just radiates confidence? If so, it’s very likely they have a slew of “define aura” comments on their social media pages. This is Gen Z and Gen Alpha’s way of saying, “If I looked up ‘cool’ in the dictionary, I’d see a picture of you.” [6] X Research source How to join the trend: Comment “define aura” on a post of a friend or celebrity you think is killing the game. Here’s an example from TikToker @cosmitxs."

      "content": "It’s unknown where the term “aura” was first used. Unlike other popular social media trends, “aura” and “aura points” don’t have a specific origin or history; however, there are theories. Some speculate that it began on Twitter in 2023 amongst soccer and basketball communities. [7] X Research source On the other hand, with “aura” already being a definitive spiritual term for “energy,” many believe the term found its way onto social media with the influx of Gen Z and Gen Alpha’s interest in astrology and zodiac signs."

      "title": "In football, “aura” is an assertive energy a player lets off.",
      "content": "In football, “aura” is an assertive energy a player lets off. A player with a big or large “aura” radiates confidence. “Athletes with a commanding presence are said to have aura, which can include a self concept of ‘I am the best’ or ‘I dominate in this game,’” explains Lizarraga. All in all, if a player has “aura” or is the “most aura,” they give off an effortless confidence. [8] X Research source Football fans say Antonio Brown, Cam Newton, Stefon Diggs, Sauce Gardener, and Deion Sanders all have “aura.” “Aura” as slang doesn’t just apply to football—it be used go for any sport!"

      "content": "Spiritually, an “aura” is an invisible energy field around the body. It’s believed that the energy or vibrations you send out into the world move around you in what’s called an “aura.” Your aura changes color and shape depending on your mood, well-being, and experiences. The energetic frequencies your aura gives off reflect a color(s), which can say a lot about your personality and how you interact with the world. [9] X Research source For instance: A red aura depicts confidence, passion, and frustration. An orange aura relays creativity, sensuality, and uncertainty. A yellow aura shows happiness, leadership, and self-criticism. A green aura depicts love, peace, and jealousy. A blue aura relays honesty, calmness, and wisdom. A purple aura shows ambition, connection, and power. A white aura depicts compassion, reception, and spirituality. Want to learn what your color aura is? Take this quiz !"
