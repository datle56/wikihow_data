      "content": "No, a card cast with Flashback will always go to exile. There are a few niche scenarios where you can return Flashback cards to your hand or deck after the card has resolved (and we’ll cover them in detail), but even those are extremely fringe and semi-nonsensical situations. In general, if you cast a card for its Flashback cost, it goes to exile. There aren’t any consistent ways to prevent this. [1] X Research source There are ways to return or reshuffle exile cards into your library or hand, but nothing that allows a Flashback card to resolve and then not exile. If something was cast for its flashback cost, Note the wording of Flashback: “You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.” In other words, if you cast (not resolve!) a card for its Flashback cost, it is exiled. It doesn’t matter what happens after the cast part—if X, then Y. If you cast something for Flashback, it gets exiled."

      "title": "You can’t counter the spell to keep it in the graveyard.",
      "content": "You can’t counter the spell to keep it in the graveyard. Take a look at a card like Cancel , which can counter any spell. Normally, a countered spell will go to the graveyard. This is not the case with Flashback. As an example: You have a Lingering Souls in your graveyard. You cast Lingering Souls for its Flashback cost during your main phase. Your opponent casts Counterspell , targeting the Lingering Souls. Counterspell resolves. Lingering Souls is exiled; even though it was countered, you paid for it with the Flashback cost. Because you paid for it with Flashback, it goes to the exile pile—not the graveyard."

      "title": "You cannot bounce a Flashback card on the stack to your hand.",
      "content": "You cannot bounce a Flashback card on the stack to your hand. This was a popular “hack” with the Modern staple Remand , back when that card saw play. Remand sends the countered card to the owner’s hand. This is normally a downside for the caster of Remand, but if the card being countered was cast with Flashback, it won’t go back to their hand. It gets exiled. [2] X Research source If you ever find yourself asking, “Does this mechanic get around Flashback?” The answer is almost always, “Flashback wins.”"

      "title": "Cards with state-based effects can impact flashbacked cards.",
      "content": "Cards with state-based effects can impact flashbacked cards. The most obvious standout card here that will impact things here is Wheel of Sun and Moon , which sends cards that would go to the graveyard to the bottom of your library instead. [3] X Research source There are a lot of cards that turn the graveyard into the exile pile ( Rest in Peace is the big one), but there are no cards that turn your exile pile into your library."

    {
      "title": "Cards that interact with the exile pile can target Flashback cards.",
      "content": "Cards that interact with the exile pile can target Flashback cards. There are a handful of cards that can put cards from exile into your library or hand. To be frank, these cards don’t tend to be very good because they’re exceptionally narrow and not generally very pushed, but they exist! Examples include: Riftsweeper . Pull from Eternity . Runic Repetition . This is actually the only card in the game that specifically pulls exiled flashbacked cards back into your hand. Void Maw . All of the Eldrazi Processors. Cards like Wasteland Strangler and Ulamog’s Reclaimer throw exiled cards in graveyards."

    {
      "title": "No, but they can respond once the Flashback card is on the stack.",
      "content": "No, but they can respond once the Flashback card is on the stack. Flashback is not an activated or triggered ability—it’s an alternative casting cost. So, “using” flashback doesn’t require the stack and your opponents do not get a chance to respond. However, like any normally-casted card, your opponent can respond once the card is on the stack after being cast. [4] X Research source This is why a card like Scavenging Ooze doesn’t work with Flashback. Scavenging Ooze’s owner needs priority to target a card in a graveyard. Flashback is a casting cost. That means there’s never a point where the Scavenging Ooze’s owner can snipe a Flashback card. For example, Player A casts Past in Flames from hand. Player B gets priority and they pass. Past In Flames goes to the graveyard. Then, Player A can cast Past in Flames from flashback. Player B gets priority again, but Past in Flames is on the stack! It can’t be targeted with Scavenging Ooze now. However, Scavenging Ooze could “eat” a sorcery with Flashback if it’s still in the graveyard when it’s not the opponent’s main phase."
