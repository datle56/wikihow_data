      "content": "The <3 says she’s your friend. Not every girl uses hearts to say, “I love you.” More often than not, a girl will send you a <3 in a friendly way. But before you jump to conclusions, look for context clues. Does she call you “friend”? Did she pair the heart with a “thank you” or “you’re welcome”? If so, she could be using a <3 to show she appreciates you as a friend. “You’re such a good friend <3” “You’re welcome! I’m glad I could help <3” If a girl texts you a \"<3,\" it can be interpreted as a symbol of affection or love. Depending on the context of the conversation and the nature of your relationship with the girl, the meaning behind the \"<3\" may vary. If you have been dating or seeing each other for a while, the \"<3\" may be a clear signal of romantic interest or even love. However, if the \"<3\" comes from a friend or acquaintance, it could be a friendly or platonic gesture of appreciation or support."
