There are tons of cool effects, including fire-animation, neon, and anaglyph!"

Load up the page in your web browser—the browser will fetch the Google fonts and display them with the properties you specified. You can include more than one Google font in your CSS code at a time. Just be aware that since the fonts are being imported into your CSS, using multiple fonts can impact loading speed. If you want to include multiple Google fonts, you'll just need to copy the code for each font you want to use and paste it into your code the same way you did here."
