      "title": "Diabetes can often cause a change in gait.",
      "content": "Diabetes can often cause a change in gait. Because feline diabetes can often affect the nervous system, some cats who suffer from this disease end up walking differently. Most cats walk on their paws, but diabetic cats often begin walking on their back hocks (the part of the leg above the paw that runs up until the first bend in the cat’s leg). [1] X Research source Diabetes can cause nerve damage (or neuropathy) that changes the way a cat walks. Some diabetic cats will also change the way they walk because they’re in pain."

      "title": "Your cat may constantly seek out water to drink.",
      "content": "Your cat may constantly seek out water to drink. Diabetic cats aren’t able to absorb and use glucose properly, which leads to high levels of glucose being filtered out through the urine. When this happens, extra water is carried out of the body along with the glucose. This means that your cat is losing too much water and will start trying to counter this by increasing its water intake. [2] X Research source Watch your cat’s water bowl to see if the water levels are decreasing more quickly than usual. Be mindful about whether your cat is searching for alternative water sources, like drinking out of the sink, the toilet, or other unusual locations."

      "title": "Cats who drink more will also urinate more.",
      "content": "Cats who drink more will also urinate more. Since the glucose in its body is leaving via urine, you may notice that your cat is peeing more often than usual. Clean your cat’s litter box regularly so you can monitor this symptom. [3] X Research source Your cat may also start peeing outside of the litter box. If this is a new behavior, this could be a sign that it has diabetes or other health issues."

      "title": "Unbalanced glucose levels may cause your cat to shed weight.",
      "content": "Unbalanced glucose levels may cause your cat to shed weight. Without proper glucose levels, cats can’t fuel their bodies. You may notice that your cat has lost a lot of weight recently, even though it’s eating the same amount of food. You can even try weighing the cat at home to regularly monitor your cat’s weight.

      "title": "Diabetic cats often feel hungrier because they aren’t getting the proper nutrients.",
      "content": "Diabetic cats often feel hungrier because they aren’t getting the proper nutrients. You may notice that your cat is constantly hungry or eats more food than usual. This could be because it isn’t getting the glucose that it needs from its normal diet, so it’s eating more to make up for it. [5] X Research source On the flip side, some cats will actually experience a loss of appetite as a symptom of diabetes."

      "content": "Your cat’s liver may be enlarged, which can distend its belly. Take a look at your cat’s stomach and see if anything looks large or swollen. If you notice any changes or your cat’s stomach looks enlarged, it’s most likely because of a health issue. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Hyperglycemia can cause nausea and vomiting in cats.",
      "content": "Hyperglycemia can cause nausea and vomiting in cats. Hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar, happens when your cat has too little insulin in its body (or it can’t use its insulin properly). When this happens, your cat may feel nauseous or even throw up. This is a very common symptom of diabetes, especially if your cat has had undiagnosed diabetes for a while. Frequent vomiting can lead to dehydration, which can make your cat very sick. If your cat is vomiting for multiple days or can’t keep food and water down, take it to the vet right away."

      "title": "High blood sugar can form cataracts over time.",
      "content": "High blood sugar can form cataracts over time. This is a less common symptom for cats, but cloudy eyes can occur if your cat has had diabetes for some time now. If you notice your cat developing cataracts, talk to your vet right away. [7] X Research source Usually, you’ll see cloudy eyes as a symptom of diabetes in dogs, not cats. However, it can occur in both species."

      "title": "A lack of nutrients can affect your cat’s fur.",
      "content": "A lack of nutrients can affect your cat’s fur. It’s less common, but sometimes diabetes can be indicated by a change in your cat’s coat. If your cat’s hair looks rough or dull, it is most likely because of a health issue. [8] X Research source A change in your cat’s fur can also be caused by nutrient deficiencies that aren’t caused by diabetes. Either way, it’s a sign that your cat isn’t 100% healthy."

      "title": "See your vet for a definitive diagnosis.",
      "content": "See your vet for a definitive diagnosis. If you notice your cat having any of these symptoms or it’s just acting strange, take it to the vet for an appointment. Your vet will test your cat’s blood sugar levels and do some lab work to determine if it has diabetes or not. If your cat does have diabetes, you can care for your cat by monitoring its food intake or injecting it with insulin if your vet recommends it. [9] X Research source Depending on what type of diabetes your cat has, you may be able to keep it in diabetic remission by putting it on a diet and exercise regimen."
