If you're confused about something, raise your hand and ask for clarification. If you have a comment to make, chat with the person next to you. It's tough to fall asleep in the middle of a conversation, so it's a great way to keep yourself awake. [1] X Research source As the teacher speaks, take down notes and formulate questions about the material you're learning. If there's something you can't figure out, put up your hand and ask a question about it. When the teacher poses questions to the class, don’t be afraid to put up your hand and provide an answer. Some teachers may put you on the spot if they notice that you aren’t paying attention or falling asleep. If you’re feeling drowsy while reading a textbook, professional college prep tutor Jennifer Kaifesh suggests “stop[ping] after each paragraph and ask[ing] yourself to summarize it” so you retain the information better.
