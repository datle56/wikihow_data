      "title": "Cancer (June 21st – July 22nd)",
      "content": "Cancer (June 21st – July 22nd) Cancer signs are known for being caring and emotional—and occasionally codependent. They often seek out comfort in others and can be extremely emotionally sensitive. On most occasions, this emotional sensitivity allows them to be more intuitive and empathetic. In rare cases, it could explain Cancer-sign killers like Genene Jones, a former nurse who was nicknamed the “Angel of Death.” [1] X Research source Other serial killers with the Cancer sign include: Genene Jones Carl Panzram Robert “Hannibal the Cannibal” Maudsley Anna Marie “The Blonde Borgia”Hahn Samuel “Choke and Stroke Killer” Little"

      "title": "Pisces (February 19th – March 20th)",
      "content": "Pisces (February 19th – March 20th) This sign may be fishy in more ways than one, but its dominant traits include a rich inner life and vivid imagination. Pisces often struggle with boundaries and tend to fantasize or romanticize every aspect of their lives—“reality is a real turnoff for Pisces,” as Eyedealism puts it. In some cases, this disconnect between dreaming and waking may result in Pisces losing control of their feelings or grip on reality. This trait may explain why there are quite a few serial killers born under Pisces , including some of America’s most infamous and prolific: [2] X Research source John Wayne “The Clown Killer” Gacy Dennis “The BTK Killer” Rader Richard “The Night Stalker” Ramirez Aileen “Damsel of Death” Wuornos Christopher “The Beauty Queen Killer” Wilder"

      "title": "Sagittarius (November 22nd – December 21st)",
      "content": "Sagittarius (November 22nd – December 21st) Sagittarians are pretty infamous for their sense of adventure, (sometimes cruel) bluntness, emotional reasoning, and love of attention. [3] X Research source Since a Sagittarius is typically described as the friendliest and most outgoing person at the party, it may come as no surprise that the most notoriously (outwardly) charismatic criminals, such as Ted Bundy, were born under the Archer sign. [4] X Research source Here are a few of the most well-known Sagittarius serial killers: Ted “Lady Killer” Bundy Richard “The Torso Killer” Cottingham Edmund “The Co-Ed Butcher” Kemper Dennis “The Monochrome Man” Nilsen Raymond “The Lonely Hearts Killer” Fernandez"

      "title": "Scorpio (October 23rd – November 21st)",
      "content": "Scorpio (October 23rd – November 21st) Some may be surprised that Scorpio isn’t higher on this list, since they get a bad rap for their tendency toward possessiveness and paranoia. As Eyedealism describes it, this sign “is paranoid because they sense and see too much in people…They’re aggressive people that go out to get what they want…and they will obsessively pursue their desires.” So, when a Scorpio does turn bad, they may show more adeptness for manipulation and cult-like control—Charles Manson is an example of a Scorpio serial killer with such tendencies. Check out some of the most infamous Scorpio serial killers: [5] X Research source Charles Manson Carl Eugene “The Sunday Morning Slasher” Watts Nannie “The Giggling Granny” Doss Amy “Connecticut Borgia” Archer-Gilligan Belle “Hell’s Belle” Gunness"

      "title": "Aquarius (January 20th – February 18th)",
      "content": "Aquarius (January 20th – February 18th) Aquarians are exceptionally conceptual, “way independent, and way into thinking,” explains Eyedealism. They tend to follow their internal compass above all else, which can lead them to great success and garner the admiration of those around them. Some of their worldly traits, however, could easily swing them in the other direction if placed in the right (or rather, the wrong) environment. For example, their outsider mentality, greater good philosophy, and susceptibility to conspiracy thinking may be factors in the acts of Aquarius serial killers such as these: [6] X Research source Jerry “The Lust Killer” Brudos Robert “The Butcher Baker” Hansen Joel “Joel the Ripper” Rifkin Gary “The Green River Killer” Ridgway Luis “La Bestia” Garavito"

      "title": "Libra (September 23rd – October 22nd)",
      "content": "Libra (September 23rd – October 22nd) Libras can be incredibly magnanimous and fair-minded, largely born by a desire for everyone to like them. [7] X Research source On the flip side, however, this need for external validation can lead to incel-like behavior or cause them to lash out at those that they believe should be giving them attention or affection. Combine this potential personality trait with a flair for fantasy, and you get some of the Libra serial killers on the list below: [8] X Research source Angelo “The Hillside Strangler” Buono, Jr. Gerald “The Love Slave Killer” Gallego Patrick “The Freeway Killer” Kearney Bobby Joe “The Classified Ad Rapist” Long Carlton “The Stocking Strangler” Gary"

      "title": "Capricorn (December 22nd – January 19th)",
      "content": "Capricorn (December 22nd – January 19th) Capricorns are disciplined and methodical, as well as “very practical and incredibly ambitious,” says Eyedealism. All that considered, you might be surprised not to find them higher on this list! However, Capricorns also love to play by the rules, so they may have to form their own internal moral code in order to justify their cruel and criminal behavior. It is key to note that, despite having an average number of serial killers in Capricorn , Capricorns have a higher number of people killed per murderer than any other sign, making these names among the deadliest: [9] X Research source Joe “The Alligator Man” Ball William “Freeway Killer” Bonin Dean “The Candy Man” Corll Vincent “The Brooklyn Strangler” Johnson Harold “Doctor Death” Shipman"

      "title": "Virgo (August 23rd – September 22nd)",
      "content": "Virgo (August 23rd – September 22nd) Moving toward the bottom of the list, we find Virgo : a sign known for their attention to detail, love of control, and quickness toward irritation. [10] X Research source Similarly to Capricorn, these are traits that you’d probably associate with the Hollywood-inspired, American Psycho archetype. However, despite counting a few of the world’s most infamous serial killers among their signs, Virgos actually account for the fewest average victims per killer. However, that doesn’t make the crimes of these Virgo serial killers any less tragic and abhorrent: [11] X Research source Rodney “The Dating Game Killer” Alcala Richard “The Angel of Death” Angelo Albert “The Boston Strangler” DeSalvo Ed “Butcher of Plainfield” Gein Henry Lee “Confession Killer” Lucas"

      "content": "Leo (July 23rd – August 22nd) This lion-hearted Zodiac sign is famed for its vanity and attention-seeking behaviors—in a nutshell, a Leo wants to stand out. While this trait often manifests in genuine warmth, gregariousness, and creative spirit, it can also transform into an obsessive need for infamy. [12] X Research source In some cases, it may have contributed to some of the personalities that became associated with the Leo serial killers named below. [13] X Research source John “The Acid Bath Killer” Haigh Myra “The Moors Murderer” Hindley Anthony “The Cleveland Strangler” Sowell Jack “Vienna Strangler” Unterweger Elizabeth “Lady Dracula” Báthory"

      "content": "Aries (March 20th – April 19th) Aries are fiery, impulsive, and known to lose their tempers easily—they’re “an aggressive sign [that] doesn’t like weakness,” explains Eyedealism. Aries is also associated with the planet (and Roman god) Mars, which is largely synonymous with war and violence. [14] X Research source Despite this bloody connection and the Aries’ recognition-hungry drive, however, there aren’t too many Aries serial killers on our list: Joseph “The Racist Killer” Franklin Donald “Angel of Death” Harvey Keith “The Happy Face Killer” Jesperson Paul John “Casanova Killer” Knowles John Reginald “The Monster of Rillington Place” Christie"

      "content": "Gemini (May 21st – June 21st) Geminis have a reputation for being two-faced, but apparently, it’s fairly unlikely that one of those faces has murderous tendencies! [15] X Research source There aren’t too many Gemini serial killers, but the ones we do know of have a very Jekyll-and-Hyde quality to them, fitting for this twin sign. And, despite the small number of serial killers born under Gemini , some of history’s most prolific and famous killers occupy that short list, including Jeffrey Dahmer and “Son of Sam” Berkowitz: [16] X Research source David “Son of Sam” Berkowitz Kenneth “The Hillside Strangler” Bianchi John “The Michigan Co-Ed Killer” Collins Jeffrey “The Milwaukee Cannibal” Dahmer Danny “The Gainesville Ripper” Rolling"

      "content": "Taurus (April 20th – May 20th) The infamously bull-headed sign has a reputation for being possessive and uncompromising, but apparently, this stubbornness doesn’t translate to immensely violent tendencies. Tauruses can rest easy knowing that they share the fewest number of serial killers under their sign—and their emotional, tender, and homebody nature may be an influencing factor here. [17] X Research source However, there are a few Taurus serial killers with fairly notorious and grisly crimes, including the following: [18] X Research source Martha “The Lonely Hearts Killer” Beck Albert “The Moon Maniac” Fish H.H. “The Torture Doctor” Holmes Earle “The Gorilla Killer” Nelson Karla Homolka (One of the “Ken and Barbie Killers,” alongside Leo-sign Paul Bernardo)"

These four signs are Cancer , Pisces , Sagittarius , Scorpio , who all tie in at 46 killers each. Following close behind are Aquarius and Libra , with 44 each.

      "content": "Least Common Zodiac Signs of Serial Killers: Taurus & Gemini It’s a good day to be a Taurus or Gemini since these two signs share the least amount of known serial killers amongst their ranks. In fact, Gemini and Taurus combined account for only 11 percent of the serial killers included in our sources. Also in the latter half of the rankings are (in descending order) Capricorn , Virgo , Leo , and Aries . [20] X Research source Capricorn: 42 Virgo: 40 Leo: 39 Aries: 38 Gemini: 27 Taurus: 27"

According to the research we’ve consulted, serial killers who were born in the sign of Capricorn accounted for both the most total victims among them as well as the highest average of victims per killer of any other sign. Keep in mind, however, that these numbers only take into account officially identified victims of known, solo-acting serial killers . Below, you can find the rest of the signs and the total number of victims attributed to each sign: [21] X Research source Capricorn: 813 Aquarius: 622 Scorpio: 537 Libra: 485 Pisces: 461 Aries: 411 Cancer: 404 Leo: 351 Sagittarius: 350 Virgo: 269 Gemini: 218 Taurus: 204"

      "content": "Water signs claim the highest number of both killers and victims. While water signs are known for being intuitive, empathetic, and emotionally intelligent, the signs included in this grouping—Cancer, Pisces, and Scorpio—are actually responsible for the highest number of serial killers and the highest number of victims. [22] X Research source While there’s no scientific explanation for this correlation, it’s possible that intense emotional sensitivity (which water signs tend to have in spades) could influence someone to struggle in stressful or emotional situations, even to the point of taking out their hurt on others. [23] X Research source On the other side of the spectrum, Earth signs (Capricorn, Virgo, Taurus) account for the lowest number of serial killers, while Fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) account for the lowest number of victims. Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) fall somewhere in the middle, with neither the highest nor lowest numbers of victims and killers."
