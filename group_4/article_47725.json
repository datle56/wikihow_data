This isn’t always an option, but even the smallest bit of space can help you regather your thoughts and pave the way toward a meaningful conversation."

Ask yourself if continuing to critique and confront them is worth it. If they’re willing to listen and change, amazing! If they’re not, maybe you should stop trying to help."

Keep in mind that people with covert narcissistic tendencies may give you gifts or favors in order to manipulate you in the future.
