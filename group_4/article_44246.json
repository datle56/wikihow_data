Most outdoor cats are used to soil, so it might be a good idea to use something that is similar in texture. Start with something that is fine, sand-like, and unscented.

After a few weeks, you will be using just litter. Keep an eye on your cat whenever you add more litter to the soil. If your cat refuses to use the litter box, he or she might not be ready for the change. Add in a little bit more soil. If you don't know what sort of litter to use, consider buying a few different types and placing each one in a separate box. Choose the one that the cat uses. [8] X Research source Consider using a natural litter, such as wood bark pellet, ground corn, or walnut shell pellet. These may appeal more to an outdoor cat. You can also sprinkle a little bit of cat attract litter on top of your regular litter. This might get your cat to use the litter box.

      "content": "Put the box in the right place. The best places are quiet, such as a bathroom or laundry room. If you place the box in a busy, noisy area, the cat may feel stressed or anxious, and go to the bathroom elsewhere. If you notice that the cat has been going to the bathroom in a certain area, try to place the litter box there. Never place the litter box in the same room as the cat's food and water. Cats are clean animals and may refuse to eat if their food is too close to their bathroom area. Avoid placing the litter box near \"scary\" areas. If a cat has to pass a dog's kennel or a noisy washing machine in order to get to the litter box, he or she may find some other place to go. Consider placing the box near the door. That way, if your cat tries to go outside to go to the bathroom, he or she will see the litter box and may try to use it instead.

If the cat is too far away, wait until the cat is done, then move the poop into the box. Let your cat see the poop in the box. If your cat went pee, see if you can cut the pee out of the item and move the scrap to the box. If the cat went pee on the carpet or on something that cannot be cut, clean the area immediately using an enzyme cleaner. This will break down the cat urine. Do not use an ammonia-based product to clean cat urine. Ammonia smells similar to urine to a cat's nose. If you use that to clean, your cat may return to the same spot the next time they need to go."

For example, if the cat has a urinary tract infection, they may try to seek out a softer surface to urinate on. Cats are also attracted to their owners and will seek out their smell when sick, hurt, or frightened. If you find that your cat has been going to the bathroom on your bedding or clothes, there could be an underlying health problem. If your cat keeps avoiding the box, examine their urine and feces. A red or pink tint to the urine usually signifies an infection. If the poop is tarry or has black or red streaks in it, your cat could be very sick. You should take your cat to the vet immediately."
