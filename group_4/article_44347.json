      "content": "Make a specific and attainable goal for what you want to accomplish. When you start thinking about transforming your body, make sure to specify the end goal of your fitness routine. Choose whether your goal is to lose a specific amount of weight or to gain a certain percentage of muscle. Write the goal down so you’re more likely to stick to it. [1] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer & Nutritionist Expert Interview. 30 June 2020. For example, your goal may be to lose 10 lb (4.5 kg) or gain 5% muscle mass. Talk to your doctor about your weight loss goals to see if they have any comments or concerns. Different goals, such as running a marathon or powerlifting, require different body types and training strategies. Make sure you have smaller goals that work toward what you want to achieve overall."

      "content": "Give yourself a reasonable deadline to reach your goals. [2] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer & Nutritionist Expert Interview. 30 June 2020. Transforming your body can take some time to fully achieve, so set short and long term goals for yourself. As long as you work hard, you can usually burn 1–2 lb (0.45–0.91 kg) of fat or gain 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 lb (0.11–0.23 kg) of muscle per week. Set your timeframe to follow how many pounds you can burn each week. For example, if you wanted to lose 10 lb (4.5 kg), you can set your goal between 5-10 weeks. If you wanted to gain 3 lb (1.4 kg) of muscle, set your time frame for 6-12 weeks. Gaining muscles mass is easier when you first start training, but becomes more difficult over time. Your age and body type can affect how fast your muscles develop while you’re training. People who are younger can develop muscles faster than someone in their 40s or 50s."

      "content": "Calculate your BMR to know how many calories you need each day. Your basal metabolic rate, or BMR, is the number of calories your body burns on its own in order to function. Measure your height in inches and your weight in pounds and use an online calculator to find your BMR. If you want to lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than your BMR, but if you want to gain muscle, you need to eat slightly more than your BMR. [4] X Research source You can calculate your BMR with an online calculator here: https://www.bmrcalculator.org/ . Your BMR is also affected by how active you are during the day. BMR readings can be inaccurate since they're based on just your height and weight and don't take your bone structure into account."

Instead of having 3 large meals throughout the day, try intermittent fasting to help curb your hunger and control your caloric intake. Choose a 12-16 hour period of time each day where you don’t eat, such as overnight between 8 PM and 8 AM the next day. [5] X Research source For example, if your BMR is 2,000 calories, then aim to eat about 1,500 calories each day. Use a calorie-counting app to help determine what you can eat each day. Avoid overeating by only consuming the portion sizes listed on the food’s packaging."
