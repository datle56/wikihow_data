      "content": "Put dumplings and water in a microwavable bowl. Set your dumplings on the flat bottom of a large microwave-safe bowl so they’re spaced out evenly. Then, just pour in enough water to cover the bottom half of the dumplings. [1] X Research source Steaming in the microwave works great for cooking frozen dumplings if you don’t have a steamer."

      "content": "Cover the bowl with microwave-safe plastic wrap or a plate. Rip off a piece of microwave-safe plastic wrap and pull it tight over the top of the bowl to seal it completely. If you don’t have any plastic wrap at home, find a microwave-safe plate and set it on top of your bowl to trap the steam inside. [2] X Research source Avoid using regular plastic wrap in your microwave since it could melt on top of your dumplings."

      "title": "Cook the dumplings in your microwave for 2 ½ minutes.",
      "content": "Cook the dumplings in your microwave for 2 ½ minutes. Set the bowl in your microwave and let it run for the full time. Most of the water will evaporate and the trapped steam will cook your dumplings through. [3] X Research source Frozen dumplings may need to steam for an extra minute to cook all the way through. Tear open one of the dumplings and check if the filling is hot. If it still feels cold, keep heating your dumplings in 30-second increments until they’re warmed through. If you want crispy dumplings, put them onto a pan over medium heat for about 1 minute after you microwave them."

      "content": "Put 3 balls of aluminum foil in a pot with 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of water. Crumple up 3 pieces of aluminum foil so they’re about golf-ball-sized. Set the balls in a pot and pour in 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of water into the bottom. [4] X Research source The aluminum foil balls create a buffer between the bottom of the pot and a plate with your dumplings. If you don’t have any foil handy, a wire rack will do the trick."

      "content": "Set a heat-safe ceramic plate with your dumplings on the foil or wire rack. Use a heat-safe ceramic plate that just fits inside of your pot and prop it up on top of the aluminum foil balls. [5] X Research source Space your dumplings around the plate so they aren’t touching to help them all cook evenly. [6] X Research source If you’re steaming frozen dumplings, they may stick to the plate when you heat them. Line the plate with parchment paper or brush on some cooking oil so you can easily remove your dumplings."

Let the water come to a boil before putting the lid on the pot to trap the steam. [7] X Research source If you don’t have a lid for your pot, just cover it with another large pan. Condensation can build up on the lid if it doesn’t have a vent, and the water may drip down and make your dumplings soggy. Wrap a towel around the lid to capture the moisture. [8] X Research source"

After 10 minutes, remove the lid and take your dumplings out to serve them. [9] X Research source Frozen dumplings may take an extra minute or two to steam all the way through.

Leave your dumplings in the pot undisturbed while they’re cooking so the steam doesn’t escape from the pot. After 10 minutes, take the dumplings off of the chopsticks and serve them. [13] X Research source It’s okay if the lid doesn’t fit tightly over the pot since the steam will still rise up and cook your dumplings. Rip open one of the dumplings and check that the filling feels hot. If you’re making frozen dumplings and they still feel cold, put them back on the chopsticks and leave them to steam for another 1–2 minutes."
