      "content": "Look for natural ingredients such as witch hazel. Witch hazel is a natural astringent that also soothes and cleans your skin, making it a top-notch ingredient to look for in aftershaves. Other natural ingredients to look for are tea tree oil, aloe vera, chamomile, and lavender. [1] X Research source Natural ingredients are especially good to include in your aftershave if you have sensitive skin. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid aftershaves containing alcohol. Alcohol has been a prominent ingredient in aftershaves for a long time, but it tends to dry out your skin. To avoid dry, flaky, irritated skin, skip the aftershaves containing alcohol and aim for more natural ingredients."

      "title": "Select a balm if you have dry skin or live in a colder climate.",
      "content": "Select a balm if you have dry skin or live in a colder climate. Aftershave balms tend to be thick in consistency and help to lock in moisture. If you live in a cold or dry climate, or you just tend to have dry skin, balms will help moisturize your face. [3] X Research source Because balms are so much heavier and more oily than other types of aftershave, stay away from balms if you have oily skin. Don’t use a balm if you’re going to be sweating a lot. The thickness of the balm when applied to your face prevents sweat from getting through."

    {
      "title": "Pick a splash if you have oily skin.",
      "content": "Pick a splash if you have oily skin. Splashes are more watery, which is good if you have oily skin — you don’t want a thick aftershave that will clog up your pores. Splashes usually have a toner or astringent which helps get rid of dirt. If you live in a warmer climate and have oily skin, splashes are your best bet. [4] X Research source Aftershave lotions should also work well on oily skin, as they’re lighter and contain more water than other options."

      "title": "Opt for a gel if you typically have post-shave burns.",
      "content": "Opt for a gel if you typically have post-shave burns. If your skin tends to get irritated by razor burn, try a gel. These soak into your skin very quickly, making them a good choice if you’re going to be sweating or live somewhere humid. Gels are light and a great moisturizing option. [5] X Research source Gels are most appropriate for normal to oily skin."

      "title": "Decide on a tonic if you tend to get cuts when you shave.",
      "content": "Decide on a tonic if you tend to get cuts when you shave. If you find your face getting nicked by your razor, find a good tonic aftershave. These have antiseptics in them that help keep your cuts clean and uninfected. However, those antiseptics can dry out your skin if they contain alcohol, so look for natural ones if you have dry or sensitive skin. [6] X Research source Apply a moisturizer that’s safe for your face after applying a tonic aftershave to prevent dryness."

      "title": "Try different aftershaves to find your favorite if you have normal skin.",
      "content": "Try different aftershaves to find your favorite if you have normal skin. If you were graced with perfectly normal skin, then you’re able to try out whichever aftershave you want. While splashes tend to be the most recommended for normal skin, choosing a gel, lotion, or balm is also alright. It’s smart to still avoid aftershaves containing alcohol, and natural ingredients such as witch hazel or tea tree oil will always be best. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse your face with cold water post-shave to close your pores.",
      "content": "Rinse your face with cold water post-shave to close your pores. Washing your face off with plain, cold water will not only get rid of any excess shaving cream or hair, but it will also close off your pores so that dirt is less likely to clog them. After you’ve splashed your face with cold water, dry your face off gently with a towel — it doesn’t need to be completely dry, but it shouldn’t be dripping. [8] X Research source"

Pour or squeeze just 1 or 2 drops of aftershave into the palm of your hand, and rub both of your hands together. [9] X Research source Getting your hands a little bit damp beforehand can make application easier."

      "content": "Massage the aftershave gently into your face. Use your hands to apply the aftershave to your face, massaging downwards as opposed to upwards. Make sure the aftershave is applied evenly and rub it in gently until your skin absorbs it. If your skin still feels dry after you’ve applied the couple of drops of aftershave, massage a smaller amount than you first applied onto your face and see if that helps."

Apply enough aftershave to gently moisturize and treat your skin. If you’re unsure of how much this should be, start with a small amount — you can always add more. [10] X Research source"

Unless your aftershave specifically tells you to wash it off, you don't need to. Most aftershaves you simply leave on your face."
