      "title": "Stay positive even when circumstances feel difficult.",
      "content": "Stay positive even when circumstances feel difficult. Try to stay as positive as you can going into and through your jail experience. The fact is that being in jail is a miserable time, but it’ll be more miserable if you put yourself in a poor frame of mind. Tell yourself you’re going to be okay. Continually remind yourself of your expected release time. Think about how this will be a great story to tell to kids, grandkids, and friends. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Contact your lawyer before you go in if possible. Regardless of whether you’ll be staying in jail the night as a result of a pre-decided court decision or if you’re in jail because you were pulled over for driving drunk in the middle of the night, you need to be in contact with your lawyer or advocate before you enter jail. Having an attorney or someone else advocating for you will help make sure that your release in the morning (or whenever) will go as smoothly as possible. An attorney or an advocate working on your behalf will also make sure you’re not somehow forgotten and spend more time in the slammer than you need. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Obey the correction officers within the scope of the law.",
      "content": "Obey the correction officers within the scope of the law. Do whatever the correction officers tell you to do, as long as they’re not asking you to do something that puts you in harm or violates your safety. When you do comply, comply quickly, politely, and don’t show attitude. If they are trying to make you comply, and are rude to you, deal with it and suck it up. If you don’t comply, they’ll use physical force, and you may get hurt. It’s not worth taking a stand on something trivial or out of principle. The only time you should not comply is when your rights are being directly violated, as in the case of rape or abuse. If you don’t comply with a lawful order or request, you might face additional charges."

      "title": "Use the phone as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Use the phone as soon as possible. If you’re going to jail unexpectedly, you want to be able to contact someone who can bail you out. This is a little trickier than you might think. Oftentimes, cell phones can’t receive collect calls. You probably won’t remember most people’s home numbers. Collect calls, in some areas, now require people to set up an account with a prepaid amount in order to accept the call. Therefore, you need to be tricky yourself. Memorize a reliable person’s home number for these types of situations. Use the collect call system against itself. Oftentimes, you’ve got a couple seconds to record your name so it can be played back for the person you’re calling. Try blurting out “John jail Nashville help me” or something similar so the person will know what to do without talking to you. You are often allowed to make more than one call. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask for a single cell.",
      "content": "Ask for a single cell. Trying to get an empty cell will make your stay a whole lot easier and more pleasant, as you’ll eliminate coming into contact with troublemakers or bullies. Request one in advance of the walk into lockup. If you notice an empty one on the way in, request to be put in there. Don't talk about any special reason why, as this might get you shoved into a group cell anyway. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Never show fear to the other “guests.”",
      "content": "Never show fear to the other “guests.” For many people who frequent jail, fear is equated with weakness. If they sense your fear, they’ll know that you are weak and they’ll try to give you a hard time. Consider: Try your best to appear calm, collected, and cool. Don’t come across as a someone who is overly tough, as other inmates will try to challenge you. Make sure to control your emotions. While you might be a nervous wreck, crying or shaking typically won't help you. Such behavior will just mark you as someone that others might want to mess with.

      "content": "Avoid sleeping in a shared cell. While you might be exhausted, do your best to avoid sleeping in a cell that you are sharing with someone else. Falling asleep will leave you vulnerable, and if there is a troublemaker or a bully, they might mess with you or hurt you. Consider: If you’re trying to rest, sit on the floor with your back to the wall, preferably in a corner. Don't lie down, as you'll just be making yourself vulnerable. Stay mentally active by thinking about other problems you need to solve, such as fixing your transmission or bathing your dog. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Never remove clothes or shoes, unless you wish to risk them being taken away by the other inmates. Since you’ll be in the cell for a while, you’ll probably want to make yourself more comfortable by taking off your shoes, socks, or even your belt. Don’t do it. Taking anything off will make your more vulnerable to potential troublemakers. Someone might take them from you, or give you a hard time in general."

      "title": "Keep to yourself, if you can.",
      "content": "Keep to yourself, if you can. If at all possible, don't start a conversation with anyone else. Starting a conversation might open the door to someone harassing you or giving you a hard time. It will also draw attention to you, as other inmates in the lockup will notice you conversing with someone else. As a rule, try not to be noticed. Try as hard as possible not to be rude in any way. Answer questions with short responses that don't reveal any personal information about yourself. Don’t be too polite, as over politeness might be construed as weakness, too. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Refuse any favors, politely.",
      "content": "Refuse any favors, politely. Accepting or requesting favors can be seen as an invitation for harassment or bullying. Resist the temptation to ask for help from fellow inmates. Decline any offers of favors, as they might signal your vulnerability. Never ask for a seat. This could provoke a fight from someone looking for a fight. Don’t ask permission. If there is plenty of room available on a bench, and you won’t be getting into anyone’s personal space, take a seat. If not, don’t ask anyone if you’re allowed to sit there. Asking permission will signal fear or subservience to troublemakers. If someone offers to do something for you, politely decline. But don’t say “no thank you.” Try something like “I’m okay” or “That’s cool.” [9] X Research source"

If eye contact is made, turn away immediately, or look downward, but never take your eyes completely off of the other prisoners. Know where they are at all times. The less you do to engage the other inmates, and the less noticeable you are, the better. You don’t want to give anyone an excuse to give you a hard time. [10] X Research source"

It’s pretty likely that others sharing the cell with you or others in lockup feel the same. Other people there, though, might not feel the same. They might be proud of their crime or they might think you’re weak. If someone asks you what you did, be honest. Don’t give anyone any more information than you need to. Don’t verbally judge anyone else’s crime. [11] X Research source"
