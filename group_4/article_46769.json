      "title": "Hold the wrench so the arrow points in the direction you’re turning the object.",
      "content": "Hold the wrench so the arrow points in the direction you’re turning the object. Look for an arrow printed near the flat section at the top of your strap wrench. If you want to tighten the object and turn it clockwise, point the arrow to the left. To loosen the object, flip the handle over so the arrow points to the right. [1] X Research source If your strap wrench doesn’t have printed arrows, then position it so the flat section is on the left if you're tightening or on the right if you're loosening."

      "content": "Loop the strap around the circumference of the object. You’ll usually use a strap wrench on threaded plumbing connections or to change an oil filter , but you can use them for anything you’d use a standard wrench for. Hold the flat top of the wrench in front of the object that you want to tighten or loosen. Wrap the strap around the object to form a loop and hold it in place. [2] X Research source Nylon and rubber straps work best when you don’t want to damage or mar the surface of the object. Metal straps are heavy-duty and give you more leverage, but they tend to scuff the surface of whatever they touch."

      "title": "Pull the strap through the slot until the loop is tight around the object.",
      "content": "Pull the strap through the slot until the loop is tight around the object. Look for the channel or slot on the top of the strap wrench and slide the end of the strap through it. Keep pulling the end of the strap until the loop hugs the object tightly. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Move the handle in the direction of the arrow to tighten or loosen the object.",
      "content": "Move the handle in the direction of the arrow to tighten or loosen the object. Hold the end of the handle to get the most leverage. Slowly pull the handle in the direction of the arrow so the strap catches on the top of the wrench. If you’re loosening the object, turn it enough until you can unscrew it by hand. If you’re tightening the object down, screw it in until you meet resistance. [4] X Research source Hold the end of the strap tightly against the handle to help prevent it from going slack.

      "content": "Wrap an old belt around the object for a quick fix. Use a leather belt that has a large buckle since it will be the sturdiest. Loop the belt around the object and pull it through the buckle until it’s tight. Pull the loose end of the belt in the direction you want to turn the object to either tighten or loosen it. [6] X Research source Cheap belts or belts with small buckles may break when you pull on them."

      "content": "Try a strip of duct tape to remove tight bolts or nuts. Tear off two 12 in (30 cm) pieces of duct tape. Attach one strip of tape to the non-sticky side of the other piece to make a single strong strip. Stick the end of the strip to the nut and wrap the tape around clockwise to tighten or counter-clockwise to loosen. Leave 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) of the tape hanging loose, and pull on the end of the strip to screw or unscrew the nut. [7] X Research source Press the tape down firmly against the sides of the nut or bolt to make sure it doesn’t come loose when you’re trying to unscrew it."

      "title": "Use a nylon ratchet strap and wrench to get more leverage.",
      "content": "Use a nylon ratchet strap and wrench to get more leverage. Use a nylon ratchet strap that has a metal hook on the end since it’ll be easier to grip later on. Wrap the strap around the object 2–3 times in the direction you want it to turn, keeping the metal hook on top. Pull the loops tight against the surface, and position the handle of a wrench through the metal hook. Push the handle in the direction you want to turn the object until it tightens or loosens. [8] X Research source You could instead attach a piece of duct tape to the end of the strap and attach it to the object. Wrap the strap around the object a few times and then pull on the loose end of the strap to screw or unscrew the object. [9] X Research source"

Put the object through the middle of the serpentine belt. Pinch the sides of the belt with a regular wrench to make a tight loop against the object. Then, just move the handle of the wrench in the direction that you want to turn the object. [10] X Research source"
