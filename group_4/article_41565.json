      "title": "Apply shortening on the outside of the fondant to seal in the moisture.",
      "content": "Apply shortening on the outside of the fondant to seal in the moisture. Shortening is a type of fat that’s solid at room temperature, such as margarine, lard, or hydrogenated vegetable oil. Use a pea-sized bead of shortening and rub it onto your decorations until it’s clear. Try to work the shortening into any exposed fondant to make it less likely to dry out. [1] X Research source Shortening creates a protective layer that traps the moisture inside the fondant. Don’t leave large globs of shortening on your fondant or else it could affect the flavor."

      "title": "Put the decorations tightly in plastic wrap so they aren’t exposed to air.",
      "content": "Put the decorations tightly in plastic wrap so they aren’t exposed to air. Set one of your decorations on the plastic wrap, and carefully fold up the sides. Press the plastic wrap gently against the fondant to seal the moisture in and keep air out. Wrap up each of your decorations individually so you don’t accidentally ruin them. [2] X Research source You can leave the decorations unwrapped if you want, but it may cause them to dry out faster."

    {
      "title": "Keep the decorations in an airtight container or a resealable plastic bag.",
      "content": "Keep the decorations in an airtight container or a resealable plastic bag. Once you have the fondant decorations wrapped, set them in an airtight plastic or glass container to store them. You can also use a resealable plastic bag. Be careful not to stack your decorations on top of one another since the weight can cause them to deform. Put the lid on the container to preserve your decorations. [3] X Research source If you’re keeping the decorations in a plastic bag, try to push the air out of it before sealing it. That way, your decorations are less likely to dry out."

    {
      "title": "Store the fondant in a cool, dark area for up to 2 months.",
      "content": "Store the fondant in a cool, dark area for up to 2 months. Keep the container or bag with your decorations in a pantry or closet so they stay at a consistent temperature. Avoid putting the fondant anywhere in direct sunlight since it can speed up the drying process and cause the decorations to crack. Plan to use the decorations within 2 months so they don’t harden beforehand. [4] X Research source Don’t put your fondant in the fridge or freezer since it could form condensation when you take it back out, which can make the decorations wilt or sag. If your fondant does start to harden, you can form it back into a ball with a small bead of shortening to reactivate it."

    {
      "title": "Line a cooking sheet with parchment paper.",
      "content": "Line a cooking sheet with parchment paper. Use a baking sheet that’s large enough to hold all of your decorations. Set the baking sheet in an area out of direct sunlight so your decorations don’t develop cracks while they’re drying out. Cover the bottom of the sheet with parchment paper so the fondant doesn’t stick to it. If you don’t have parchment paper, you can also use wax paper instead. Make sure the waxy side faces up or else the fondant may stick to it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dust the parchment paper with cornstarch so the fondant doesn’t stick.",
      "content": "Dust the parchment paper with cornstarch so the fondant doesn’t stick. Sprinkle a pinch of cornstarch onto the parchment paper and spread over the entire surface with your hands. Make sure the cornstarch evenly coats the paper so your fondant decorations are less likely to get stuck while they dry out. [5] X Research source Since parchment paper has a non-stick coating, you may not need to use cornstarch if you don’t have any."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave the decorations on the parchment paper for 1-2 days to harden.",
      "content": "Leave the decorations on the parchment paper for 1-2 days to harden. Keep the fondant decorations out and uncovered on the baking sheet for at least 24 hours to let them harden. Carefully handle your decorations to see if they have a firm consistency on the outside. If they do, then you can put them away to store them. If they still feel soft, then leave them on the baking sheet for another 24 hours. Thin fondant decorations will dry faster than thick fondant. If you have large fondant decorations, the outside may feel firm after a day, but it may still be soft in the middle. Be careful not to poke or squeeze the decorations too hard or else you could deform them."

    {
      "title": "Put the decorations in a container with parchment paper between them.",
      "content": "Put the decorations in a container with parchment paper between them. Once your decorations or dry, line the bottom of a plastic container with more parchment paper. Set the fondant into the container, separating each decoration with a piece of parchment paper. That way if the fondant still hasn’t dried completely, your decorations won’t stick together. Put the lid on the container once you’re finished. [6] X Research source Since your fondant has dried and hardened, you can stack your decorations on top of one another. You can also use a plastic resealable bag to store your decorations."

      "title": "Keep the fondant in a cool, dark place for up to 3-4 months.",
      "content": "Keep the fondant in a cool, dark place for up to 3-4 months. Put your decorations in place that doesn’t get a lot of light, such as a cabinet, pantry, or closet. Make sure the container isn’t in direct sunlight or it could cause the colors to fade. Your fondant decorations will last for up to 4 months until they go bad. [7] X Research source Hardened fondant is difficult to eat and should only be used for decorative purposes."
