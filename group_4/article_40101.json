      "content": "Write the inequality in the standard form. The standard form of a quadratic is a trinomial that follows the structure a x 2 + b x + c < 0 {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c<0} , where a {\\displaystyle a} , b {\\displaystyle b} , and c {\\displaystyle c} are known coefficients, and a ≠ 0 {\\displaystyle a\\neq 0} . [1] X Research source For example, the inequality x ( x + 4 ) < 21 {\\displaystyle x(x+4)<21} is not in standard form. First, you need to use the distributive property to multiply x {\\displaystyle x} and x + 4 {\\displaystyle x+4} . Then, you need to subtract 21 from both sides of the inequality: x ( x + 4 ) < 21 {\\displaystyle x(x+4)<21} x 2 + 4 x < 21 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+4x<21} x 2 + 4 x − 21 < 21 − 21 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+4x-21<21-21} x 2 + 4 x − 21 < 0 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+4x-21<0}"

      "content": "Find two factors whose product is the first term of the inequality. To factor the inequality, you need to find two binomials whose product equals the standard form of the inequality. A binomial is a two-termed expression. [2] X Research source To do this, you need to complete the FOIL method in reverse. Begin by finding two factors for the first term of each binomial. For example, x × x = x 2 {\\displaystyle x\\times x=x^{2}} , so you can begin setting up your factors like this: ( x ) ( x ) < 0 {\\displaystyle (x)(x)<0} ."

      "content": "Find two factors whose product is the third term in the standard form of the inequality. These two factors must also have a sum equal to the second term in the inequality. You will likely need to do some guess-and-check work at this time, to see which two factors meet these two requirements. Make sure you pay close attention to the positive and negative signs as well. For example: 7 × − 3 = − 21 {\\displaystyle 7\\times -3=-21} -21 is the third term in the inequality, so these two factors (7 and -3) might work. Now you need to see whether the sum of these factors equals the second term ( 4 {\\displaystyle 4} ) of the inequality. Since 7 + − 3 = 4 {\\displaystyle 7+-3=4} , these two factors meet both requirements. So, your factored inequality is ( x + 7 ) ( x − 3 ) < 0 {\\displaystyle (x+7)(x-3)<0} ."

If, according to the inequality, the product of the factors is greater than zero, then either both factors will be negative (less than 0), or both factors will be positive (greater than 0), since a negative times a negative equals a positive, and a positive times a positive equals a positive. [3] X Research source If the inequality is greater than or equal to ( ≥ {\\displaystyle \\geq } ) or less than or equal to ( ≤ {\\displaystyle \\leq } ), one or both of the factors may be zero. For example, for the inequality ( x + 7 ) ( x − 3 ) < 0 {\\displaystyle (x+7)(x-3)<0} , the product of the factors is less than 0, and so the two factors will not have the same sign."

If, according to the inequality, the product of the factors is less than 0, then one factor will be less than 0, or negative, and the other factor will be greater than zero, or positive. This is because a negative times a positive equals a negative. Again, if the inequality is greater than or equal to ( ≥ {\\displaystyle \\geq } ) or less than or equal to ( ≤ {\\displaystyle \\leq } ), one or both of the factors may be zero. For example, for the inequality ( x + 7 ) ( x − 3 ) < 0 {\\displaystyle (x+7)(x-3)<0} , the product of the factors is less than 0, and so the two factors will have different signs."

[4] X Research source For example, you found that the factors of the inequality ( x + 7 ) ( x − 3 ) < 0 {\\displaystyle (x+7)(x-3)<0} must have opposite signs, so your options would be stated thusly: x + 7 < 0 {\\displaystyle x+7<0} AND x − 3 > 0 {\\displaystyle x-3>0} (That is, the first factor will be negative, and the second factor will be positive.)

If the valid values of x {\\displaystyle x} lie between the two roots, you will shade inside the parabola.
