    {
      "title": "Pick the right time.",
      "content": "Pick the right time. Hopefully, you’ll catch your boss in a good mood, but there’s no guarantee. Think about giving notice on Friday. This leaves the weekend for your boss to cool down and adjust to the news. If you have a formal relationship with your boss, you might need to schedule a meeting with his secretary. Tell the secretary you need to schedule a short meeting and that it’s important. Also give notice when you are coming to the end of large projects. You need to leave your job gracefully, which means wrapping up loose ends on any unfinished work. Try to give more than 2 weeks' notice if possible if you're in a senior position.

      "content": "Prepare what you want to say. You’re probably nervous about quitting your job. Accordingly, you should prepare ahead of time what you will tell your boss. You should follow these rules: Don’t go negative. Now is not the time to unload on your boss, even if you hated your job. The past is in the past, and you need to adopt a positive attitude. [2] X Expert Source Amber Rosenberg, PCC Founder of Pacific Life Coach Expert Interview. 26 February 2019. Keep it simple. You don’t need to go into a long, detailed story about why you are leaving. You’ve decided to make the switch—that’s all your boss is entitled to know. Identify something you’re grateful for. If possible, you should thank your boss for giving you the job. Mention one or two things you’ve learned."

      "title": "Start with small talk.",
      "content": "Start with small talk. When the big day arrives, walk confidently to your boss’ door and knock. Say, “Greg, can we talk for a minute?” Smile and shut the door behind you for privacy. As soon as you sit down, begin with some small talk about the upcoming weekend or any big event. [3] X Research source Hopefully, you haven’t told anyone else at work that you have accepted a new job. If you have, then your boss might already know. Also, your new employer might have called for a reference. If your boss says, “You’re leaving, right?” just roll with it. Smile and nod your head."
    },
    {
      "title": "Break the news.",
      "content": "Break the news. Screw up your courage and tell your boss that you’re leaving. Start by saying something positive before stating that you're leaving. Try ending the conversation on a positive note by offering to help or train employees. [4] X Expert Source Amber Rosenberg, PCC Founder of Pacific Life Coach Expert Interview. 26 February 2019. Use simple language so that you are easily understood, and avoid being overly apologetic. [5] X Research source For example, you can say, “I've had a great time working here and learning from you, and I'm ready for my challenge. I've accepted a new position at XYZ Company and begin in 2 weeks.

    {
      "title": "Rebuff any counteroffer.",
      "content": "Rebuff any counteroffer. If you were a good employee, you should expect your boss to try and keep you. They might make a counteroffer for more money or more time off. You should politely decline and explain that you’ve made up your mind. For example, you can say, “Thanks for the offer, but I’ve already made up my mind. It’s not really the money, but the opportunity to advance. They said they’d consider me for a promotion after three months and I’m excited to get started.”"

    {
      "title": "Thank your boss.",
      "content": "Thank your boss. Your boss is a future reference, as well as a potential business associate in the future. In fact, you don’t know where your paths will cross again. Accordingly, you want to leave on the best terms possible. To that end, thank your boss for the help they have given you. [6] X Research source For example, you can say, “I’d never have gotten this job if you hadn’t hired me right out of college. I really appreciate it. What I’ve learned here will be the foundation of my success.”"

      "title": "Check how you should tell others.",
      "content": "Check how you should tell others. Before leaving, you want to clarify how the rest of the office will be told. If it’s a big company, your boss might want to send an email. If you work in a small office, your boss might want to tell everyone at a team meeting. Ideally, you will tell people who are important to you in person. Ask your boss to hold off on the email until you’ve had a chance to speak to them."

      "title": "Ask if you need to tell Human Resources.",
      "content": "Ask if you need to tell Human Resources. [7] X Research source Every company is different. You might need to write a letter to Human Resources to make your resignation official. Ask your boss if you need to write a letter and who you should address it to."

    {
      "title": "Tell your mentors first.",
      "content": "Tell your mentors first. Identify anyone who has acted as an official or unofficial mentor. Also identify people who maybe helped you get the job in the first place or helped you get a promotion. You should tell these people that you are leaving your job. Stop by their office so you can talk in person. [8] X Research source You should also make sure they have your new work email address. Mentoring should continue even after you leave your job.

      "title": "Tell a consistent story.",
      "content": "Tell a consistent story. You aren’t obligated to tell others why you are leaving, but they will want to know nonetheless. Accordingly, you should settle on a story and stick with it. Your colleagues will talk to each other and compare notes. Don’t tell one person you’re leaving because you can’t take the stress but tell another person you’re leaving because the commute is shorter. Ideally, you should settle on a story that is non-controversial. For example, you can simply say, “They promised promotion opportunities which I want to pursue.” Everyone can understand why you would want to leave for that reason. Whatever you do, don’t badmouth anyone, not even over drinks after work. If you need to vent, then call up your parents or therapist."

[10] X Expert Source Amber Rosenberg, PCC Founder of Pacific Life Coach Expert Interview. 26 February 2019. Tell them your last day and ask them to contact you if they have questions. For example, other team members you work with occasionally should probably get an individual email. They might need to check about the status of a project. If you’re pressed for time, you can send one email and blind copy everyone on it. However, individual emails are better if you have time."

      "title": "Avoid a company-wide email.",
      "content": "Avoid a company-wide email. Never send out an email to people you don’t know. In larger companies, it’s particularly awkward to read a good-bye email from someone you’ve never met before. Let your boss or Human Resources inform these people that you are leaving.

This letter will go in your personnel file, and you don’t want to come across as ungrateful. [13] X Research source You can thank your boss for hiring you and for anything else that you’re genuinely grateful for. For example, you can write, “I can’t thank you enough for hiring me nine months ago as your marketing assistant.

You can write something like, “This company has been incredibly understanding. Even when I was going through chemotherapy and missing some time at work, I still managed to finish all of my work, thanks to the thoughtful staff at ABC Corp.” Remember to keep it brief and professional. You shouldn’t give a long-winded defense in which you go point-by-point and rebut every criticism ever made of you. Instead, explain away one or two of the major criticisms."
