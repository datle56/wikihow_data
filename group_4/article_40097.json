      "content": "Identify parallel circuits. A parallel circuit has two or more branches that all lead from point A to point B. A single stream of electrons divides to flow through multiple branches, then merge back into one stream on the other side. Most problems involving parallel circuits will ask you to identify the total voltage, resistance, or current across the circuit (point A to point B). [1] X Research source Components \"connected in parallel\" are each located on a separate branch."

      "content": "Understand current and resistance in parallel circuits. Imagine a freeway with multiple lanes, and toll booths in each lane slowing down traffic. Building a new lane gives the cars another path to take, so it will always speed up traffic even though you're adding a new toll booth as well. Similarly, adding a new branch to a parallel circuit gives current an additional path to take. No matter how much resistance that new branch has, the total resistance of the circuit will decrease, and total current of the circuit will increase. [2] X Research source"

To find total resistance R T across the circuit, solve for it in the equation 1 / R T = 1 / R 1 + 1 / R 2 + 1 / R 3 + ... where each R on the right-hand side represents the resistance on one branch of the circuit. [4] X Research source For example, a circuit has two resistors in parallel, each with 4Ω resistance. 1 / R T = 1 /4Ω + 1 /4Ω → 1 / R T = 1 /2Ω → R T = 2Ω. In other words, two branches of equal resistance are exactly twice as easy to get through as one branch alone. If one branch has no resistance (0Ω), all the current goes through that branch. The total resistance is 0. [5] X Research source"
