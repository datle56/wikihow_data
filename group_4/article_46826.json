You can select between a few arming modes: Disarm: Disarms the security system, regardless of which mode the alarm is in, and clears any previous alarms or faults. The keypad beeps once. Arm Stay: Arms the security system in \"stay\" mode. This enables all sensors except for motion detectors. The security system beeps three times. Night Stay: Arms the security system in \"night\" mode. This enables all perimeter sensors, plus a few motion detectors. The motion detectors armed in night mode are set by your installer. Entry Delay: Turns the entry delay on or off. If the entry delay is off, then opening any set entry/exit door before disarming the system will immediately sound the alarm. Arm Away: Arms the security system in \"away\" mode. This enables all sensors, including motion detectors, doors, windows, and glass break detectors. During the exit delay, the alarm will count down the amount of time until the alarm is fully armed, and beep rapidly within the last 10 seconds. Arm Custom: Arms the security system, but allows for bypassing of up to five zones. Bypassed zones will not trigger an alarm when they are opened."

If the keypad is equipped with a loud sounder, then that will be used to sound the alarm.

The security panel repeatedly beeps until the exit delay (time you have to leave the premises) ends, and beeps rapidly within the last 10 seconds. The delay resets if an exit door is opened within the last ten seconds of exit delay. STAY: Arms the security system in \"stay\" mode. This enables all sensors except for motion detectors. The security system beeps three times. NIGHT-STAY: Arms all perimeter sensors, plus a few motion detectors. To do so, press the stay button twice after entering your security code. The motion detectors armed in NIGHT-STAY is programmed by your security installer. INSTANT: Arms the security system in \"stay\" mode, but removes the entry delay. The entry delay is the grace period before the alarm sounds. The entry delay is set by the installer of the security system. The security system beeps three times. MAX: Arms the security system in \"away\" mode, but removes the entry delay. If the security system is not disarmed before entering the home, the alarm will sound."
