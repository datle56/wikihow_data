      "title": "Try the blazer on to get the most accurate fit.",
      "content": "Try the blazer on to get the most accurate fit. Putting the blazer on will allow you to check all of the important areas of the blazer, including the shoulders, sleeve length, hem, and buttons. Try the blazer on over a shirt or other piece of clothing to ensure that it will fit over multiple layers. [1] X Research source If you’re ordering the blazer online, always leave the tags on the blazer until you’ve tried it on and determined that it fits."

    {
      "title": "Check that the shoulder seams come to your shoulders.",
      "content": "Check that the shoulder seams come to your shoulders. The seam of the shoulders in your blazer should be right where your shoulder ends. If the seam is falling off of your shoulder, the blazer is too large, and if the seam doesn’t reach your shoulder, it’s too small. [2] X Research source If you’re trying on a blazer with shoulder pads, feel your shoulder under the blazer so you know where it ends."
    },
    {
      "title": "Button up the blazer to ensure it doesn’t pull.",
      "content": "Button up the blazer to ensure it doesn’t pull. When you close the jacket and do the buttons, look in a mirror to see how the blazer now fits. If the blazer is pulling in an ‘X’ shape due to the buttons, the blazer is too tight. The fabric should remain smooth if the blazer fits correctly when buttoned, and your arms should move freely. [3] X Research source If you move your arms around and feel a little bit of tightness, this is okay - just as long as the blazer isn’t constricting your movement."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for a sleeve length that hits right below your wrist.",
      "content": "Look for a sleeve length that hits right below your wrist. A classic blazer has sleeves that reach at least to your wrist, and many of them are even a tiny bit longer. With the blazer on, hold your arms to your sides as well as out in front of you to see where the sleeve hits your arm. [4] X Research source Some blazers have sleeves that are purposefully shorter, such as ones that are bracelet length so you can show off a bracelet that you’re wearing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a blazer that comes to your hip for a classic fit.",
      "content": "Choose a blazer that comes to your hip for a classic fit. Most blazers should have a hem that comes to about your hips, or right where the knuckle of your thumb is when you put your arm to your side. When you're trying the blazer on, look to see where the hem hits your hips. [5] X Research source Stretch out your fingers when your arms are by your side to measure where the blazer hits your thumb."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try out shorter or longer hems for a more unique blazer.",
      "content": "Try out shorter or longer hems for a more unique blazer. Blazers with hems right below your chest or longer ones that go past your hips are options that will give you a more dynamic look. When trying these blazers on, check to make sure the blazer doesn't pull and that the sleeve length works well with your needs. For example, a cropped blazer will have a hem that goes right below your chest. A longer blazer might go below your hand and have a tail in the back."

      "title": "Choose a linen or cotton blazer in warmer months.",
      "content": "Choose a linen or cotton blazer in warmer months. Linen and cotton breathe easily and are lightweight fabrics, perfect for hotter weather. Look for blazers made of these fabrics if you plan on wearing your blazer in the warmer months. [6] X Research source For example, put on a white linen blazer over a tank top and skirt for a great summer outfit."

      "title": "Opt for a wool or tweed blazer in the winter.",
      "content": "Opt for a wool or tweed blazer in the winter. These fabrics are a bit thicker and will provide more protection against the cooler weather. Select blazers made of wool or tweed to keep you warm. [7] X Research source Velvet is also a great fabric to wear in cooler weather."

      "content": "Pick out blazers in colors that are versatile to get the most use out of them. When you choose a blazer, you want to purchase one that you’ll wear often and that goes with many pieces in your wardrobe. Gray, black, and navy are the most popular color options when it comes to choosing a blazer as they go with lots of different colors and outfit options. [8] X Research source Brown and tan are good color options for creating a casual outfit, while maroon and blue are trendier choices."

      "title": "Purchase a patterned blazer to create a statement outfit.",
      "content": "Purchase a patterned blazer to create a statement outfit. Look for a blazer that makes a statement, such as a leopard print blazer or embroidered blazer. Pair the blazer with neutral-colored shirts and bottoms, and choose eye-popping shoes to complete the look. [9] X Research source Try on a leopard-print blazer with black slacks and a black V-neck.

      "content": "Choose a textured or patterned blazer for a bold outfit. If you want your outfit to make a statement, look for a blazer in a funky fabric, like velvet, or in a pattern such as plaid, florals, or chevron.
