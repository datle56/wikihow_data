      "title": "Find a slightly bent stick about 2 ft (0.61 m) in length for the bow.",
      "content": "Find a slightly bent stick about 2 ft (0.61 m) in length for the bow. The stick should be made of a rigid wood like oak, cedar, or hemlock. If you choose a more flexible wood like pine or spruce, it might break while you're trying to start a fire or the cord you're going to tie to it might slip off."

      "title": "Tie a shoelace or another long cord to either end of the bow.",
      "content": "Tie a shoelace or another long cord to either end of the bow. 550 Parachute cord is a great option to stow in your backpack in preparation for bow drilling a fire in the wilderness because of its durability. But in a pinch, you can also use a shoelace from an adult-sized shoe. Make sure the string is not taut, but don't leave a lot of slack, either. The string should not rebound if plucked."

      "title": "Find a second stick less than 1 ft (0.30 m) in length for the spindle.",
      "content": "Find a second stick less than 1 ft (0.30 m) in length for the spindle. The spindle is the stick you'll use to \"drill\" into the baseboard and (hopefully) set off a spark, while the bow and the cord act as the drill mechanism. Look for a stick made of hardwood (like cedar, hemlock, or oak) as thick as an average adult man's thumb. Carve one end into a point with a knife or another sharp-edged object (like a rock) and leave the other end flat across the top. If you choose a softwood stick (like pine or spruce) for your spindle, it won't hold up long against a lot of sawing. On the other hand, it will be easier for you to make a fire with softwood than hardwood. If that's all you can find, just gather up multiple sticks to use as backups just in case!"

      "title": "Choose a bearing block to hold down the spindle.",
      "content": "Choose a bearing block to hold down the spindle. Look for hard, palm-sized materials with a divot or hole in it that fits snugly over the blunt end of the spindle. You can use pieces of hardwood, bone, or antlers, as well as small rocks or shells. You'll use this object to keep the spindle upright while you saw it to make a spark."

    {
      "title": "Look for a flat piece of wood 0.5–1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) thick for the baseboard.",
      "content": "Look for a flat piece of wood 0.5–1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) thick for the baseboard. The baseboard is where you'll pile tinder and drill the spindle to make a spark. It should be made of the same wood as the spindle or just slightly harder, as well as long enough for you to put your foot across it on one end."

    {
      "title": "Cut a divot and a notch into the baseboard.",
      "content": "Cut a divot and a notch into the baseboard. Use a knife or a sharp rock to carve a divot into the center of the baseboard. This is where the pointed end of the spindle will rest as you drill it. After that, bisect the divot with a small notch where the coal dust will collect and start smoking. Before you start drilling, place a small leaf or piece of bark underneath the notch to catch any coal dust that falls through. The goal is to keep as much coal dust in the notch as possible to make a big enough coal to smoke."

      "title": "Prepare a tinder bundle and some kindling.",
      "content": "Prepare a tinder bundle and some kindling. Tinder is made of inner poplar tree bark or dry grass. It's used to transfer the flames from your coal or spark to a pile of kindling. Pick your tinder materials and collect them into a small pile you can easily pick up with your hands. Then gather up your kindling: small straight pieces of dry wood and bark that catch fire easily and will help catch bigger pieces of wood on fire."

      "title": "Twist the middle of the bow cord around the spindle.",
      "content": "Twist the middle of the bow cord around the spindle. Twist it until the cord is wrapped around the spindle once, with the pointed end of the spindle on the baseboard and the blunt end pointed skyward. The tension should be tight enough that the spindle would flip out on its own if you weren't holding it. Protect your hands from getting cut or burned. You can wear a pair of gloves or just put your sleeves over your hands."

      "title": "Place the pointed end of the spindle on the baseboard and saw.",
      "content": "Place the pointed end of the spindle on the baseboard and saw. Crouch down with your left leg bent. Position your left foot on top of one end of the baseboard. Press the inside of your left arm against the outside of your bent leg and hold the spindle to the baseboard with the bearing block. Then, with your right hand, saw the bow in a long, smooth back-and-forth motion. Saw slowly at first to conserve energy as you build up the heat."

      "title": "Saw until black dust fills up the notch and turns into a smoking coal.",
      "content": "Saw until black dust fills up the notch and turns into a smoking coal. The dust will be the main indicator of how well your technique is working. It should be dark brown or black in color. If it's light-colored, increase the pressure and speed of your bow strokes. Once the coal is smoking, it's ready to transfer to your tinder bundle."

      "title": "Hold the tinder bundle to the coal to set it on fire.",
      "content": "Hold the tinder bundle to the coal to set it on fire. The tinder bundle should start smoking along with the coal. Blow on the dry bark to encourage a fire to start."

      "title": "Move the tinder bundle to your kindling and start a larger fire.",
      "content": "Move the tinder bundle to your kindling and start a larger fire. Once the tinder is alight, transfer it to your kindling and blow on it again until the kindling is also in flames. From here, arrange larger pieces of wood around the kindling so they'll catch and keep the fire burning for several hours. Avoid blowing too hard or you'll risk blowing the coal dust all over the place! Instead, blow slowly and softly through pursed lips."
