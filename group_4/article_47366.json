Wet a sponge or clean cloth with soapy water, and wipe the inside and outside of your lunch box. Gently scrub any areas that have food spills or stains to work them up from the fabric. [1] X Research source If your lunch box doesn’t have any decorative embellishments, it’s okay to submerge the entire thing in soapy water for a deeper clean."

[7] X Research source If your lunch box has any decorative designs or embellishments, play it safe and wash it by hand instead. Most insulated lunch boxes can go in your washer, but you may risk damaging the material if the care tag doesn’t say it’s machine safe."
