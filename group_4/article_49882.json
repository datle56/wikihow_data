      "content": "Stick to the standard wedding card etiquette. While there aren’t definitive rules on writing wedding cards, there are a few things considered standard “dos” and “don’ts” to keep in mind. Generally, your wedding card note should be short, sweet, and thoughtful. Write it out ahead of time (not last minute) and keep it positive regardless of what you say! Other etiquette tips include: Spell all names correctly. It might sound obvious, but the couple’s names should be spelled right! They’ll notice pretty easily if something is misspelled. Only tell appropriate jokes. A wedding card isn’t the place to crack a joke about divorce or the probability of the marriage lasting. And, even with appropriate jokes, try not to get too cheeky; your note should be a balance between genuine and silly. Bring the card to the wedding. Often, wedding ceremonies will have a specific spot where you can leave cards (possibly near the guest book)—so bring the card with you, even if you send the couple a gift elsewhere. Give uplifting advice. As mentioned above, positivity is important! Yes, marriage can be hard, but a wedding card isn’t the place to emphasize potential difficulties. Focus on lighter subjects! Address the card without making assumptions. In other words, don’t assume your niece is changing her name (unless you know for a fact she is). You can address it to “The Newlyweds” or use just their first names instead."

      "content": "Personalize your message for the couple you’re celebrating. Let your relationship with the couple determine the kind of message you write for them! In a wedding card to a niece, the tone will likely be more casual, emotional, or joking—but if your relationship isn’t very close, you could opt for a message with a formal tone instead. Personalization also means finding ways to make the message specifically for the couple. Are there any inside jokes or memories you can share, for example?"
