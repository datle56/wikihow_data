If you have a dedicated 10-key numeric keypad on the right side of your keyboard, you're all set! However, most smaller keyboards don't have a separate numeric keypad—at least not an obvious one! Here's how you can find and activate your hidden 10-key numeric keypad: Look for smaller numbers at the bottoms or tops of these keys on the keyboard: m, j, k, l, u, i, o, 7, 8, and 9. If you see numbers on these keys, you can use these keys as your numeric keypad. If you don't see these (and this is becoming more common with small modern PC laptops), you'll need to use a different method—alt codes won't work for you. Turn on number lock to activate this keypad. Press the key called “NumLk” (or some other abbreviation of \"number lock\") at the top of the keyboard. To test it out, press the letter L after enabling NumLk—you should see a 3 instead of an L. If that doesn't work, you may have to hold down the fn key as you press NumLk to activate it."
