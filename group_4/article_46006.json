      "title": "Use a technique called Coiling, which makes your body loose and you need to use POI (Point of Impact), which means you are relaxed and stumbling, but at the moment you strike, you tense up and rocket your body forward using the strength from your feet through the body to the part of your body striking the opponent.",
      "content": "Use a technique called Coiling, which makes your body loose and you need to use POI (Point of Impact), which means you are relaxed and stumbling, but at the moment you strike, you tense up and rocket your body forward using the strength from your feet through the body to the part of your body striking the opponent. A good way to do this is to imagine a spring in your body, a spring is very flexible but maintains its shape, a spring often wobbles/bounces round. Put these kind of movements in to your body and you will find it easier to understand."

While using this style, you must always be aware of what you're hitting, where you're hitting, and hitting your opponent frequently. This drunkard style always hits his opponent in a small circle in front of the user. This style is considered very popular, since it involves using a lot of movement, a lot of hitting, and a lot of circular attacks. It is very effective, but also very tiring. So this style could be considered, as one of your last options."

      "content": "Drunken God with the double kicks is a great style for keeping your opponent at a distance. Like it's name, using double kicks keeps your opponent confused, (if he moves back) and if he doesn't move back, then it basically damages your opponent. This drunkard style has many Ariel kicks involved, so in order to make good use of this style, you must have strong legs, and a great base. Which means a neutral stance before attacking. It also inquires of extensive use of flexibility and balance. Balance is very important while using this style. If you lack balance, strong legs and a strong base, than this style will be hard for you."
