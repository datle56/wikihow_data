      "content": "Buy a receipt book to make writing receipts easier. You can purchase a 2 part carbonless receipt book online or at an office supply store or one that has several sheets of reusable carbon paper. These booklets are usually prenumbered and already have the receipt headings in place. Make sure to get booklets with 2 part forms so that you get a copy that you can keep for your records. If you don’t have a booklet on hand, you can simply handwrite receipts on a piece of paper and photocopy them. [1] X Research source Make sure that the carbon paper is between the original and the copy before starting to write a receipt. Use a pen when handwriting receipts, making sure to press down firmly so that the information transfers to the copy."

      "title": "Write the receipt number and date on the top right.",
      "content": "Write the receipt number and date on the top right. Write out the full date that you made the sale and a chronologically ordered receipt number under it. Each receipt should have a number so that you can keep track of each sale throughout the day. For the receipt number, start with 001 and go up one number for every receipt. You can do this ahead of time so you don't need to write it every time you make a sale. [2] X Research source For example, the top right of the receipt would look something like: January 20, 2019 004 You can reset the receipt numbers every day as long as you also write the date on every receipt. Most receipt booklets will already have a different receipt number for each receipt."
