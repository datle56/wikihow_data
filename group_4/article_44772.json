They can rinse the socket and give you an ointment that will help it heal properly.

      "content": "Stick to soft foods. This is especially important during the first 24 hours after surgery.

[18] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Yogurt and applesauce are great choices as you recover. When you eat, avoid chewing on the side of your mouth that you had surgery on."
