      "title": "Analyze the size of the letters.",
      "content": "Analyze the size of the letters. Visualize the paper you might have learned to write on as a child: horizontally lined paper with faint midlines down the center of each line. Small letters would fall below the midline, average letters hit the midline, and large letters take up the entire line. [1] X Research source Large letters: You may be outgoing, friendly, and enjoy being the center of attention. However, it can also indicate false confidence and a desire to be something you’re not. Average letters: You’re likely to be well-adjusted and adaptable. You occupy a nice middle ground between two extremes. Small letters: You may be more shy and timid. Small letters can also indicate meticulousness and intense focus."

      "title": "Observe whether the letters are rounded, pointed, or connected.",
      "content": "Observe whether the letters are rounded, pointed, or connected. The overall shape of written letters can reveal a lot about your interpersonal relationships and your general approach to the world. The most important traits to look for are rounded, loopy letters, pointed, angular letters, and letters that are all connected to each other. [2] X Research source Rounded letters: You may be more imaginative, creative, and artistic. Pointed letters: You likely tend toward intensity, aggression, and intelligence. Connected letters: You approach life in an orderly and methodical way."

      "title": "Look at the spacing between words, letters, and lines.",
      "content": "Look at the spacing between words, letters, and lines. Just as important as the writing on the page is the empty space between each piece of written text. Examine the space between words, as well as the space between each consecutive line. Any text that deviates between the standard spacing (i.e., one character-width between each word) may reveal someone about your handwriting personality. [3] X Research source Wide spacing between words and letters: You likely enjoy independence and open spaces. You may dislike being overwhelmed and place a high value on freedom. Narrow spacing between words and letters: You may dislike being alone and choose to be around others as much as possible. You may struggle to respect the “bubble” of personal space. Wide line spacing: You may have a high awareness of boundaries when it comes to yourself and others. Narrow line spacing: You likely have poor time management and struggle to stay organized."

    {
      "title": "Evaluate the slanting of each individual word and line.",
      "content": "Evaluate the slanting of each individual word and line. Observe whether or not each word has a slant to the left or right—almost like the letters are leaning against a wall. Identify a similar slant in the overall line, i.e., if the line appears to move “uphill” or “downhill.” [4] X Research source Words slanting to the left (or right for a left-handed writer) : You may keep to yourself and enjoy your solitude and anonymity. Words slanting to the right (or left for a right-handed writer) : You’re probably more on the easygoing side, always looking to try new things and meet new people. Words with no slant: Completely straight letters suggest that you’re very rational and level-headed. Lines slanting in an uphill manner: You’re likely very optimistic with great enthusiasm and ambition. Lines slanting in a downhill manner: Downward-sloping writing suggests that you’re experiencing disappointment, unhappiness, or even symptoms of depression. Lines with no slant: Your handwriting demonstrates a strong work ethic and a steadfast energy that’s both reliable and consistent."

      "title": "Examine the loops of lowercase “L” and “e.”",
      "content": "Examine the loops of lowercase “L” and “e.” Take note of each loop (or lack thereof) in the handwriting. Pay special attention to the lowercase letters “L” and “e,” both of which commonly feature loops in individuals with certain personality traits. [5] X Research source Narrow “L” loops: Suggests tension caused by limiting or restricting yourself. Wide “L” loops: Suggests that you’re more unstructured, easygoing, and relaxed. Narrow “e” loops: Indicates skepticism or suspicion toward others. You may be guarded and stoic. Wide “e” loops: You’re open-minded when it comes to new people and experiences."

      "title": "Check how the lowercase “i” is dotted.",
      "content": "Check how the lowercase “i” is dotted. Note how the dot is formed—is it more precise or on the looser side? Does the dot include a shape like a slash or a fully formed circle? Each of these handwriting variations may reveal something about your personality and spirit. Dot high over the “i”: You tend to be creative and free-spirited. Slash over the “i”: You may be overly critical of yourself and always in a rush. Circle over “i”: You have a carefree and childlike spirit. Dot right over the “i”: You’re very structured and pride yourself on your attention to detail."

      "title": "Study how each lowercase “t” is crossed.",
      "content": "Study how each lowercase “t” is crossed. The lowercase “t” can be written in numerous different ways. Observe both the length and height of the crossing line before conferring with the meanings of each writing style. Cross at the very top of the “t”: Your high cross may mimic your high goals and high self-esteem. Cross right in the middle of the “t”: A lower cross may indicate that you have low standards for yourself and struggle with your self-esteem. Long cross: You’re probably an extremely enthusiastic and determined person. Short cross: You may feel apathetic toward the topic at hand or feel a general lack of motivation."

      "title": "Observe the size of the capital “I.”",
      "content": "Observe the size of the capital “I.” Identify all of the times you use the capitalized letter “I” to refer to yourself. The size of the letter when talking in the first person can reveal your confidence level. Large capital “I”: You may be a bit cocky and overly-confident. Small or proportionate capital “I”: You’re probably self-assured and content with who you are."

      "content": "Analyze the shape of the lowercase cursive “s” and “y.” Not every writing sample you obtain will contain both printed and cursive letters, but you will get the most information if you can examine both. Cursive writing provides new clues that you cannot get from printed writing. [6] X Research source Round lowercase cursive “s”: You like to keep the people around you happy and prefer to avoid confrontations. Pointy lowercase cursive “s”: You may be curious, hardworking, and ambitious. Cursive “s” with a wide bottom: You might be limiting yourself from achieving the job or relationship that you genuinely desire. Skinny cursive “y”: Indicates that you’re picky when choosing friends. Broad cursive “y”: You likely approach friendships with a “the more than merrier” attitude. Long cursive “y”: You probably have a zest for exploration and world travel. Short cursive “y”: You prefer the comfort of your home over new sights and places."

      "title": "Examine whether the “O” is closed or open.",
      "content": "Examine whether the “O” is closed or open. When looking at each written “o,” identify whether the circle of the letter is completely closed or left slightly open. If the two ends of the “o” are left open and do not meet, it suggests something different about your personality than a tightly closed “o.” Open: You’re an open book who’s extremely expressive and willing to share your secrets. Closed: You treasure privacy and tend toward introversion."

      "title": "Look at which margin the text is aligned with.",
      "content": "Look at which margin the text is aligned with. Did you write all over, or did you leave spaces around the edges? Writing on one side of the page versus the other can reveal varying things about your personality and demeanor. [7] X Research source Left-hand margin: You tend to dwell on the past and be overly nostalgic. Right-hand margin: You might worry too much about the future and become anxious when thinking about what’s ahead. Writing all over the page: You may have a racing mind that’s constantly thinking of new ideas."

      "title": "Determine what amount of pressure was used to write the text.",
      "content": "Determine what amount of pressure was used to write the text. Examine the darkness and intensity of the ink on the page, or flip the paper over and see if there are indentations from the pen. [8] X Research source Heavy pressure: You’re very high-energy and take things very seriously, although you may be rigid and slightly unpredictable. Light pressure: You’re likely to be sensitive and compassionate, but you may lack energy and liveliness."

      "title": "Study whether the writing was done slowly or in a rush.",
      "content": "Study whether the writing was done slowly or in a rush. Consider whether the writing looks like it was done deliberately or if it looks like it was scribbled out hastily. While handwriting may vary between these two options depending on the situation, text that’s consistently written one way or the other may reveal something about your approach to life. [9] X Research source If writing appears rushed: You may be extremely intelligent and have so many thoughts in your head that your brain can’t keep up. However, you may also be a bit disorganized and impulsive. If the writing appears deliberate: You are probably a very conscientious person with great attention to detail. You prefer to focus on one task at a time rather than wearing many hats at once."

      "title": "Note the legibility of the signature.",
      "content": "Note the legibility of the signature. Signatures give a special insight into a writer’s personality, as each one is unique and specially selected. While some signatures are neat and practiced, others are indecipherable and rushed—both of which offer some insight into the signature-holder’s personality. If the signature is not legible: You may be more reserved and private. If the signature is legible: You’re likely a self-assured person who’s content with themselves."

      "title": "Look for sections of handwriting that stand out from the rest.",
      "content": "Look for sections of handwriting that stand out from the rest. Inconsistency in any aspect of your writing may indicate uncertainty or a shaky sense of self. This change could be a section of tiny, cramped writing that looks out-of-place in a document filled with large, spacey handwriting or a segment of writing that looks rushed while the rest looks meticulously written."

      "content": "Graphology is the study of handwriting. The handwriting analysis used in graphology is often used as a tool to determine what someone is like. Professional graphologists and handwriting analysts believe that handwriting can be a window into the mind of the writer, revealing their psychological profile and other traits such as: Personality style Intelligence level Style of cognitive thinking Natural or learned talents (e.g., music, art, problem-solving, interpersonal skills, etc.) Attachment style Unconscious motivations (e.g., guilt, people-pleasing, impulsivity, aggression, repression, etc.)"

      "title": "Handwriting psychology is considered a technique, not a genuine science.",
      "content": "Handwriting psychology is considered a technique, not a genuine science. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, isn’t backed by enough scientific research to assure its reliability and validity. However, the practice of handwriting analysis can allow for self-exploration and insight into someone’s personality once the context has already been given, similar to dream interpretation. If you’re searching for a professional graphologist, look for certified individuals who also have mental health training or credentials in a recognized healthcare discipline."
