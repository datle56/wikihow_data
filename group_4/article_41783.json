      "content": "Walk or bike for 10 to 15 minutes. A gentle cardio exercise such as walking or biking will get the blood flowing to your quads and make stretching more comfortable. Stretching cold muscles could result in injury. [2] X Research source If you're planning on exercising outside in cooler weather, add 5 to 10 minutes to your warm-up time before you start stretching."

      "content": "Do standing quad stretches before a long run. From a standing position with your knees together, lift one foot and grasp it with your hand. Gently press your foot towards your glutes until you feel a stretch along the front of your thigh. Hold for 10 to 20 seconds, then repeat with the other foot. This stretch can be done both before and after a long run or other physical activity, as part of your warm-up or cool-down. You can also do this stretch while lying on one side. Brace your core to keep your spine in alignment and help stabilize your pelvis. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Add kneeling stretches to target quads and hip flexors. Kneel on the floor on one knee. You may want to rest your knee on a folded towel or mat. Lean forward slightly, with your other foot flat on the floor and your knees at right angles. Lean forward, contracting your core and the glute of the kneeling leg. As you exhale, shift your body forward to stretch your quad and other hip flexor muscles. You can rest your hands on your front thigh for balance and stability. Hold the stretch for a 15-40 seconds, then switch and repeat the stretch with the other leg. Keep your spine neutral and your upper body posture straight. You also want to avoid arching, rounding, or flattening your lower back or pulling back against the lean."

      "title": "Use lunges for dynamic stretching.",
      "content": "Use lunges for dynamic stretching. Stand with your feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart and step one foot forward. Lower your body by bending at the knees until the back knee is nearly at the floor. Your front knee should be in line with your ankle so that your shin is perpendicular to the floor. Raise up and repeat with the other side. You can do a series of lunges where you gradually move forward, or you can stay in the same place. Start with 2 sets of 10 repetitions on each leg. If you have trouble balancing and feel wobbly, place your hands on your hips or extend them out to form a T-shape."

      "content": "Use active range of motion exercises to maintain knee mobility. To complete this stretch, bend and straighten your knee through its full range of motion, or as far as you can go without discomfort. You can do this stretch while standing, sitting, or lying down. [4] X Research source Choose the position that provides you the most stability and allows you to move your knee the most. This stretch is best soon after an injury, when your movement may be at its most limited. Try to complete 10 repetitions with each leg, but don't overdo it. Stop if you feel pain."

      "title": "Find a partner for passive quad stretches.",
      "content": "Find a partner for passive quad stretches. Either standing, sitting, or reclining, have your partner grasp your ankle or foot. Your partner will slowly bend and straighten your knee through its full range of motion. When your knee is fully bent, have them hold the stretch for a few seconds before slowly moving your foot back down. Passive quad stretches are a good way to stretch your quads if you don't have the control needed to do standing quad stretches on your own. If you're able to move on your own, passive quad stretches may be of little benefit to you. Communication is key with passive stretching. Don't let your partner push your leg to the point that you feel pain in the muscle. This could lead to additional tearing or re-injury."

Your other leg should be straight out in front of you with your knee at a right angle and your shin perpendicular to the ground. Push your hips backward as you press your raised heel towards your glute. [5] X Research source [6] X Expert Source Eric Christensen, DPT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 17 March 2021.

      "content": "Increase stability and control with supine squats. You will need a stability ball for this exercise. Sit on the ball, then walk your feet forward as you gradually lean back at the same time. When you are lying face up, roll forward and allow your knees to move over your toes until your knees are fully flexed. Then contract your quads and roll back until your knees are at 90-degree angles. [7] X Research source Try to do 10 repetitions of this exercise. Only go as far as you can without pain or discomfort."

      "content": "Open your hip flexors with pigeon pose. Start on all fours with your knees below your hips and wrists below your shoulders. Slide your right knee forward to the back of your right wrist as you pull your foot around to the left side. The side of your right shin should be lying on the mat perpendicular to your torso. Then slide your left leg back until it is flat on the floor. Exhale and raise up so you are in a sitting position with your right leg crossed in front of you and your left leg extending backwards. [10] X Research source Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. Then return to all fours and repeat with your left leg in front and your right leg extended behind you. There are many variations to this pose. For example, try folding over your front leg and resting your chest and forehead on the mat for a more intense hip opener. For a really deep quad stretch, raise your back foot towards your buttocks. Grab your back foot or ankle with your hand and press it towards your buttocks to further deepen the stretch."

      "content": "Bend into camel pose. Kneel with your legs about hip-width apart. Inhale and draw your elbows towards each other behind your body, allowing your sternum to lift and your rib cage to expand. Press your hands into your heels, maintaining the lifting in your sternum and keeping your shoulders back. [11] X Research source Hold the stretch for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. Avoid tightening your glutes. Camel pose helps lengthen and improve flexibility in your hip flexors and upper quads. If it is too much of a challenge for you to reach your heels, you might place a block between your feet or lean back over an exercise ball."

Once you're comfortable in camel pose, take it a step further by lowering your head until the crown of your head rests between your feet. Reach your arms forward to grasp your lower thighs. [12] X Research source Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. To come out of the pose, engage the core and slowly roll yourself back up to a kneeling position. Keep your glutes soft to avoid excess pressure on your lower back. This pose opens up your hips and quads. The practice of lifting up with your chest as you lower your torso backwards is an intense workout for your thighs."
