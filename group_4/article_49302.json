You can open Notepad by opening Start , typing in Notepad , and clicking the blue Notepad app icon at the top of the menu. Notepad is commonly used to convert text files into batch files, but you can write your batch file's text virtually anywhere."

Some of the more important ones include: ECHO - Displays text on the screen @ECHO OFF - Hides the text that is normally output START - Run a file with its default application REM - Inserts a comment line in the program MKDIR/RMDIR - Create and remove directories DEL - Deletes a file or files COPY - Copy a file or files XCOPY - Allows you to copy files with extra options FOR/IN/DO - This command lets you specify files. TITLE - Edit the title of the window. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Write the code to make a basic backup program. Batch files are great for running multiple commands, especially if you configure it to be able to run multiple times. With the XCOPY command, you can make a batch file that copies files from select folders to a backup folder, only overwriting files that have been updated since the last copy: @ ECHO OFF XCOPY c:\\original c:\\backupfolder /m /e /y This copies over files from the folder \"original\" to the folder \"backupfolder\". You can replace these with the paths to the folders you want. /m specifies that only updated files will be copied, /e specifies that all subdirectories in the listed directory will be copied, and /y keeps the confirmation message appearing every time a file is overwritten."

That's where the FOR/IN/DO command comes in. You can use that command to tell a file where to go depending on the extension: @ ECHO OFF cd c:\\source REM This is the location of the files that you want to sort FOR %% f IN ( *.doc *.txt ) DO XCOPY c:\\source\\ \" %% f\" c:\\text /m /y REM This moves any files with a .doc or REM .txt extension from c:\\source to c:\\text REM %%f is a variable FOR %% f IN ( *.jpg *.png *.bmp ) DO XCOPY C:\\source\\ \" %% f\" c:\\images /m /y REM This moves any files with a .jpg, .png, REM or .bmp extension from c:\\source to c:\\images"

If you want to know what is happening in your batch file but don't want to see all the commands, you could program the batch file to print some text that explains what the batch file does. You can print text with ECHO . For example: @ ECHO OFF MKDIR c:\\example1 ECHO Created directory example1 You can change the color of the output with COLOR bf , where b is the background and f is the foreground color, both a hexadecimal number. Following colors are possible: Number Color Number Color 0 black 8 dark grey 1 dark blue 9 blue 2 dark green a green 3 dark turquoise b turquoise 4 dark red c red 5 dark magenta d magenta 6 dark yellow e yellow 7 light grey f white For example, red text on a dark green background would be displayed with COLOR 2c You need run the batch file from the command line to see the text, because else the window will close too fast to actually read the text you printed."
