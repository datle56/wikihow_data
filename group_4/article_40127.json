      "title": "Understand the terms.",
      "content": "Understand the terms. There are three terms used to describe the individual pieces that make up each Pyraminx face: [1] X Research source Centers: Center pieces are located in the center of each axial piece. There are four axial pieces, which give us three centers on each side. Since there are four sides to the Pyraminx, we have twelve centers total. Centers do not move, as they cannot change positions to a different type of piece. Edges: Edge pieces are located to the left and right of the top centers and between the bottom two centers on each face. There are six edge pieces total as each side will share common edges due to the freely movable axial parts that can change each edge’s positions to a completely different side of the Pyraminx. Tips: Tip pieces are most outer points of the triangular pyramid. These pieces can be independently moved and are not as significant in solving the puzzle. However, these pieces must still be twisted into the correct positions to achieve the final solution."

      "content": "Learn the notations. To understand the actions and sequences performed, you must be familiar with the following notations used to describe the different rotations of the Pyraminx: R: R stands for the right part of the Pyraminx face you are looking at. When this notation is used, the right must be turned clockwise. R’: Again, for the right part, only this time it must be turned in the counterclockwise direction. L: L stands for the left part of the Pyraminx face in front of you. When this notation is used, the left part must be turned clockwise. L’: L’ represents turning the left part counterclockwise. U: U stands for the upper or top part of the Pyraminx that must be turned clockwise U’: U’ represents turning the upper part of the Pyraminx in a counterclockwise direction."

      "title": "Choose a face.",
      "content": "Choose a face. As a beginner, choosing to begin with the yellow-colored face is most common and highly recommended. Although you can solve the Pyraminx by starting with any color, yellow is highly recommended as it is similar to the white face of the Rubik's cube. It will also be less confusing since this guide uses the yellow face to begin solving."

      "title": "Align the Centers.",
      "content": "Align the Centers. Starting with the scrambled Pyraminx, we need to align our three centers until they all match colors. Find any side that has yellow as the top center. Perform the following actions: R, R, R, and L, L, L. Note: If you can get the other two yellow centers in less than three turns, then continue to the next step If you have performed the three turns for both the right and left pieces but have not gotten matching centers, turn the top piece counterclockwise(U’) and repeat the actions. Perform U’ once more if the centers still haven’t matched up on the second attempt. You will be guaranteed to get the yellow centers aligned on the third try because turning the top piece after this will place you back at the original side you began with."

      "title": "Align the tips.",
      "content": "Align the tips. This is a relatively simple step. Twist the three tips in any direction at the yellow face until they match the yellow centers. There is one more tip, towards the back of the Pyraminx, away from the yellow side. This tip will not have yellow since we have already solved our yellow tip pieces. Match the last tip colors with the other colored centers around it. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Solve the edges.",
      "content": "Solve the edges. At this point, your centers and tips must all be yellow. The only thing left to solve now is the yellow face's edge pieces. Turn the entire Pyraminx so that the yellow face is on the bottom side, now the base of the Pyraminx. Look at the three different colored sides of the Pyraminx and locate the unsolved yellow edge pieces. Now, look at the other color on the same edge as the yellow color. Depending on the other color, check if the center below it is the same color. If it isn’t, turn the top piece either clockwise or counterclockwise to get it lined up with the matching color. Turn the Pyraminx so that you are facing the side where the other color has been matched up with its colored bottom center. The yellow edge piece will either be on the left or right side from the front face. If it is on the left side: R, U’, R’ If it is on the right side: L’, U, L Repeat these steps to solve the remaining edge pieces. If done correctly, the first layer will be solved entirely. You will have the yellow face complete (which was on the bottom), and the bottom layer of the other three faces will be all blue, red, and green for each side. Special Case: When solving the edges, you may encounter an unsolved yellow piece in the bottom layer of the other three faces. If this occurs, complete all the edge pieces in the top layer FIRST. Once you have done that, and the edge piece is still in the bottom layer, we need to move it out of that position to get it in the top layer. You can do this by performing either of the moves listed above. Once the yellow edge piece is relocated, follow the normal steps to complete the first layer."

      "title": "Learn the five unique cases.",
      "content": "Learn the five unique cases. After successfully solving the first layer, keep the Pyraminx in the same position as in step 6, with the yellow side still on the bottom. Turn the top either clockwise or counterclockwise to match the top center color with the bottom two center colors, if the centers aren’t already aligned. [3] X Research source This action is important as it will allow you to see which algorithm needs to be performed to finish solving the last layer of the Pyraminx. [4] X Research source First Case: You will have two edge pieces remaining for this case. Looking at the unsolved pieces from the different sides, you will notice immediately that the two colors on both edges just need to be swapped with each other to complete the puzzle. To do this, find the side where two edge colors do not match with the rest of the face(The other two sides will only have one color that doesn’t match with the rest of the colors on that particular face) Perform the following algorithm: R’, L, R, L’, U, L’, U’, L Second Case: For this case, you will have three edge pieces that need to be solved. Looking at the three faces from different angles, you will notice that, unlike the first case, the colors cannot be swapped on each edge as it will not solve the puzzle. Instead, rotate the top piece clockwise(U), and you will see all the edges are solved and in their correct positions and match with the bottom centers of their respective colors. The only pieces that need to be fixed are the top centers to finish the puzzle. To solve the Pyraminx in this scenario, rotate the top piece back to its original state(U’). Choose any face to begin the algorithm (EXCEPT for the yellow face. This must remain on the bottom to ensure the algorithm solves the puzzle successfully) Perform the following algorithm: R’, U’, R, U’, R’, U’, R Third Case: This scenario is similar to the second case. You will still have three edge pieces that can’t be swapped to solve the puzzle. You will notice that rotating the top piece counterclockwise(U’) will match the edges with their respective colors. Like in case two, the top centers need to be solved. To solve it in this scenario, rotate the top piece back to its original state by turning clockwise(U). Again, choose any face to begin the algorithm, except for the yellow face, which will remain as the bottom face Perform the following algorithm: R’, U, R, U, R’, U, R Fourth Case: The following two cases are slightly trickier because the particular face will be critical to solving the second layer. So, after solving the first layer, make sure each top center color matches each bottom two center colors to determine whether the fourth scenario will apply. At this point, you will see there are three edges unsolved. Turn the top clockwise(U), and you will notice that only one edge piece solves, while the other two need to be flipped with each other. To solve the puzzle, locate the specific edge that solves after turning the top clockwise. Keep this edge piece as the right axial piece of the particular face you are looking at; this will be the face you use to perform the algorithm. NOTE: This part is essential, as not choosing the correct face will fail to solve the Pyraminx with the provided algorithm. Once you have the correct face, turn the top back to the original position(U’) Perform the following algorithm: L, U, R, U’, R’, L’ Fifth Case: Similar to the previous scenario, you will notice three edge pieces need to be solved after solving the first layer. (Make sure your centers are aligned). Turn the top counterclockwise(U’), and you will notice only one edge piece solves, while the other two need to be flipped with each other. Locate that specific edge that solves after having turned the top counterclockwise. Keep this edge piece as the left axial piece of the particular face you are looking at Once you have the correct face, turn the top back to its original position(U) Perform the following algorithm: R’, U’, L’, U, L, R"
