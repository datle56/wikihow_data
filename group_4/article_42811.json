She isn’t being stubborn for the heck of it, though—as a Taurus, she has a strong moral code and set of beliefs that she won’t easily budge from. Although it isn’t easy, a Taurus woman may change her mind if she’s faced with solid logic. [13] X Research source Taurus is a fixed sign—in other words, it occurs in the middle of a season (spring). [14] X Research source Fixed signs are known for being especially determined and even stubborn, so it makes sense that these traits would translate to a Taurus woman. [15] X Research source"

When it comes to air signs (like Gemini or Aquarius ), teamwork is key to a successful partnership, since the grounded and stubborn Taurus may not be comfortable with an air sign’s more fleeting and spontaneous nature. For a fire sign (like Aries , Leo , or Sagittarius ) and Taurus pairing, some arguments could be on the horizon—but it shouldn’t be difficult to talk things out and get into one another’s good graces again.
