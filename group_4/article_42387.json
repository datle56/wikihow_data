      "content": "Investigate your choices. Are you ready to be the owner of a land turtle? They live a long time, can grow quite large, are not great pets for young children, and their care and feeding can be quite expensive (special lights, enclosures, vet visits). Because of their longevity (80-100 years), you also need to realize that your tortoise, if well cared for, can easily outlive you.

[4] X Expert Source Audra Barrios Marine Biologist & Reptile Specialist Expert Interview. 18 August 2020. Tortoises are herbivores and are land-based. Both require appropriate outdoor and indoor environments and need good and attentive care if they are to thrive. Land turtles may have the reputation as an “easy” pet, but they actually require quite a bit of work."

      "content": "Visit turtle breeders and talk to other turtle owners online. Observe the pets, and look at photos of some possibilities. Which ones do you like? Which ones do long-time turtle keepers recommend? If it’s your first turtle, you also should ask which ones are easiest to care for and best for first-time owners."

    {
      "title": "Keep in mind the climate where you live.",
      "content": "Keep in mind the climate where you live. Land turtles, when cared for properly, need to be outside at least part of the time. Choose a turtle that can thrive where you live. This means if you live in a humid place, choose a turtle that likes those conditions. Get a turtle that thrives in arid places if you live in the desert. This will make it much easier to care for your turtle because you won’t have to create a new outdoor environment for the turtle and keep it regulated."

      "title": "Look for native land turtles.",
      "content": "Look for native land turtles. Just as choosing a turtle that thrives in your outdoor environment makes caring for it much easier, so too does choosing a turtle native to your country and region. Not all areas have native land turtles, but ask around for the turtles most likely to thrive in your area."

      "content": "Buy a turtle from a breeder or rescue organization. Turtles from elsewhere are often taken from the wild, leading to the depletion of native turtle and tortoise populations around the world. For the health of the environment and native turtles, domestically-bred turtles or rescued turtles are the best choice."

      "title": "Create the indoor enclosure for your turtle.",
      "content": "Create the indoor enclosure for your turtle. It needs to be watertight. There are many possible ways to make an enclosure, but it needs to be quite large, even for small turtles -- many sources say that you can start in a large and deep plastic tub, but will need to make much larger enclosures as your turtle grows. You can make a dedicated turtle table out of wood, repurpose an old bookshelf with the shelves removed, or use a plastic kiddie pool. Your ultimate choice will depend on the species of land turtle.

      "content": "Create the outdoor enclosure for your turtle. This will be just as important for many land turtle species as the indoor enclosure. Make sure yours is large and safe.

A roof for the enclosure is also typically a necessity. [15] X Research source"

Keep in mind that tortoises are herbivores, while box turtles are omnivores. You should give box turtles slugs, snails, crickets and other animal matter twice a week. The rest of the time they will eat fruits like melon, berries, and tomatoes. Greens are also a great addition to a turtle’s diet. Tortoises do not eat any animal matter, but their diets are quite varied. Please do the research to determine what diet is best for your particular species of tortoise. [19] X Research source"

Talk to your veterinarian to see if your land turtle should be hibernating. Keep in mind that turtles who do not have enough fat reserves can easily die if they are in hibernation. Hibernation is also not recommended for turtles who might be at all medically compromised. Some turtle experts caution against hibernation at all. [20] X Research source If you do choose to hibernate your land turtle, prepare your turtle habitat carefully. You might even need to build a special hibernation box, depending on the species. It needs to be in a place that is temperature-regulated and will not flood. Stop feeding your land turtle two weeks before planned hibernation, and start lowering the temperature in the habitat slightly. Hibernation can last from 3-5 months. Be sure to check the temperature requirements for your particular type of land turtle. [21] X Research source"

Keep in mind that infants and children are also not ideal companions for turtles. Many experts recommend that only children over 12 years old have contact with land turtles. Most small turtles are carriers of salmonella, an infection that can possibly be fatal to infants, the elderly, and the medically fragile. Even if your turtle is not in the “small turtle” category, there is still a risk of the turtle passing on infections to children."

This doesn't means you need to be attuned to the ways you will need to change their living environments, both inside and outside, and their feeding and possible hibernation. Turtles need 3 square feet of floor space for each 8 inches of turtle length. For tortoises, it’s even more -- a minimum of 3 square yards of floor space for each 12 inches of length.
