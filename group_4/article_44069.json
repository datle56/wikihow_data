There are a few ways you can test to see if your Tinder account is shadowbanned: The app feels glitchy, like you can't get verified, or can't change your profile pictures. You're swiping, but not getting any matches . You recently got a warning for your behavior. Your likes are stagnating, even if you have a subscription plan like Tinder Gold or Platinum. You're not getting any responses to your messages. Note that Tinder boosts new accounts for a little while. After a week or so, you'll notice that your likes and matches decrease, so don't confuse this with a shadowban! You'll see an alert if you've been permanently banned from Tinder, explaining that you can't use your account while a shadowban happens without warning or notifications."

      "content": "Disconnect any paired social media accounts. Tinder tracks your IP address, phone number, Wi-Fi, and SIM card. If you’re shadowbanned and you reuse any of these on your new account, they may reapply that shadowban to your new account. If your Facebook or Instagram account are linked to Tinder, remove their permissions in the relevant social media sites by logging on and going into the security settings. [4] X Research source For the best results, use a new phone and SIM card before downloading the app, if possible. This appears to dramatically improve the odds that you don’t get flagged as a banned member. Factory resetting your phone may help if you can’t use a new device. [5] X Research source If you’re using a computer or a web browser, use incognito mode or use a VPN to hide your IP address. Get a new IP address if you aren't using a VPN simply by turning off your computer and unplugging your router/modem for 5 minutes."
