      "content": "Once the bike is in gear, very slowly let the clutch out while applying throttle at an equal rate. This is often the hardest part for beginners. If the engine RPM suddenly drops, that either means you are not giving enough throttle, or you are releasing the clutch too rapidly, or perhaps both. Once in first gear and moving, shifting to the next gears is much easier. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "To shift to second, pull in the clutch lever, at the same time release the throttle.",
      "content": "To shift to second, pull in the clutch lever, at the same time release the throttle. Doing so in sync will keep the engine RPM from spiking. Lift the shifter lever until there is a firm click into the next gear. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Compress the clutch while letting off the throttle, shift down, then let the clutch out while applying little throttle. You will be in the top end of the gear most likely, and applying too much throttle will cause your RPM to spike."

      "title": "Hit neutral:",
      "content": "Hit neutral: In a bike with a shift pattern that is Down, Up, Up, you will need to get to first gear, and then raise the shift lever halfway between first and second. This is often hard to do for beginners. An easy way to hit neutral on most bikes is to shift to neutral while still moving. [5] X Research source"
