      "title": "Place the weed whacker on the ground, away from obstructions.",
      "content": "Place the weed whacker on the ground, away from obstructions. This will give you more leverage as you try to start the weed whacker. Additionally, you want to make sure any object that could get caught in the spinning line is kept well away. Make sure the gas tank is sealed before starting your weed whacker. Always use the right kind of gas mixture because most weed whackers are two cycle."

      "title": "Flip the kill switch on.",
      "content": "Flip the kill switch on. The location of this switch will vary depending on the weed whacker you’re using. You can usually find it somewhere on the shaft. The kill switch controls the flow of electricity to the motor. It’s also referred to as a the “on/off switch”; if it’s kept off, the engine cannot start. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Switch the choke to the “on” or “closed” position.",
      "content": "Switch the choke to the “on” or “closed” position. This is only something you need to do if cold starting your weed whacker. A cold start refers to any time you need to start an engine when its temperature is colder than the temperature it usually runs at. [2] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source The choke will restrict the airflow into the engine, making it easier to start it. If you’ve used the weed whacker in the past five minutes, the engine should still be warm enough. You won’t need to switch on the choke or use the purge valve."

    {
      "title": "Press the purge valve five to six times.",
      "content": "Press the purge valve five to six times. The purge valve is a bulbous piece of rubber, similar in shape and size to the tip of a finger. It’s also sometimes referred to as a “primer bulb”. Pressing this bulb will allow fresh gas to enter the carburetor. [3] X Research source This step is only needed when cold starting the weed whacker. If it doesn't start, keep pressing the purge valve. Sometimes if the weed whacker has been sitting around it needs more priming."

      "title": "Place your hand on the throttle lock and pull the cord.",
      "content": "Place your hand on the throttle lock and pull the cord. The throttle lock is a small lever usually found on top of the weed whacker’s shaft. You should only have to pull the cord two or three times before the engine starts to run. Be sure not to pull on the trigger below the shaft; you don’t need to give the weed whacker any gas for it to start. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stop pulling the cord once you hear the engine running.",
      "content": "Stop pulling the cord once you hear the engine running. If done correctly, you’ll then hear the engine stop working; it’ll essentially “burp”, running only for a few seconds. Make sure not to pull the cord after you hear the engine die down."

      "title": "Switch the choke to the run position.",
      "content": "Switch the choke to the run position. Now that you’ve been able to start the engine, you don’t need the assistance of the choke. Resuming proper air flow to the engine will keep it efficient. While the choke allows for a cold engine to be started more easily, it will lead to higher fuel consumption if kept on while you use the weed whacker.

[6] X Research source Keep pulling the cord until the engine starts. It should now keep running, rather than simply burping. The weed whacker is now ready to use! For a warm start, you should only need to follow this step. There’s no need to fiddle with the purge valve, and you should make sure the choke is on the run position."

      "title": "Plug the weed whacker into an outlet.",
      "content": "Plug the weed whacker into an outlet. Make sure to use an extension cord that’s long enough to cover the area you will be trimming. Some weed whackers have a clip on the handle where you can loop the extension cord. This prevents it from disconnecting if it gets caught as you use the weed whacker. Some electric weed whackers are battery powered. If this is the case, you’ll need to make sure you’ve charged the weed whacker before trying to start it. [7] X Research source Make sure the trigger isn’t held down when plugging in the weed whacker."

    {
      "title": "Pull the trigger.",
      "content": "Pull the trigger. The advantage of electric weed whackers is they’re ready to be used once they’ve been plugged in. The line will start spinning as soon as you pull the trigger. Make sure to keep the weed whacker away from you and any surface that could be damaged by it."

      "content": "Note the differences between electric and gas powered weed whackers. While a gas powered weed whacker demands several steps before starting, electric weed whackers are much simpler. You won’t find a kill switch or a pull cord on an electric weed whacker. You should only need to pull the trigger to get it working."
