      "title": "Respect your autistic partner’s self-sufficiency.",
      "content": "Respect your autistic partner’s self-sufficiency. While autism comes with some challenges, it doesn’t hold people back from taking care of themselves. Even if your spouse experiences some interpersonal or cognitive differences—such as with communication or executive functioning—focus on what they’re capable of. Concentrate on how they can hold down their job or handle their own schedule. Resist the urge to jump in to help with tasks. If your partner wants you for anything, they’ll let you know. [1] X Research source It's okay to offer help to your spouse if you think that there's a need for it. Just remember to let them make their own choices. For example, avoid telling your wife, “Let me take over.” Instead, try, \"You look stressed out by the noise - do you want me to take over so you can go somewhere quieter?\""

      "title": "Have empathy for how your spouse processes the world.",
      "content": "Have empathy for how your spouse processes the world. Your partner may perceive situations in a very unique manner. For example, they may find environments with loud noises or flashing lights exhausting. If they tense up or react negatively, remember—your spouse isn’t “misbehaving.” They’re just being themselves. If you seek to understand their tendencies, you’ll strengthen your relationship. Your spouse may not be as social as you are and require alone time. Focus on your partner’s body language. For example, if your husband seems uncomfortable, check in and ask something like, “Would you like to leave a little early tonight?” Your spouse may not prefer verbal communication. Some autistic people require AAC —assistive augmented communication—because they can't reliably verbally communicate, or lose the ability to speak when overwhelmed."

      "title": "Seek to understand your spouse’s everyday challenges.",
      "content": "Seek to understand your spouse’s everyday challenges. Since your autistic partner may experience anxiety due to the pressures of social norms or their reliance on routines, watch out for what adds stress to their life. Pay attention to the way your partner acts throughout the day. When you become more familiar with their habits and triggers, it’ll be easier to create a household dynamic that’s calm for both of you. Learn to interpret body language . For example, you may find that your spouse gives very intense eye contact to focus on you or very little eye contact because it makes them nervous. Consider how your spouse processes speech. You may find out they’re a literal thinker , so they don’t pick up on sarcasm or jokes very easily. See if your spouse requires strict routines. If they become distressed when routines are interrupted, reassure them that you’ll work with their schedule and habits. Ask if your spouse has different stimulation needs. You can help a hyposensitive autistic person by providing extra stimulation. Support a hypersensitive autistic person by keeping stimulation to a minimum and reducing sensory overload ."

      "title": "Discuss your spouse’s preferences and boundaries.",
      "content": "Discuss your spouse’s preferences and boundaries. Ask your partner what they need from you. For example, have them list the foods they don't like, then agree to have meals they will enjoy. Also request that they establish boundaries . For instance, if they ask not to be interrupted when they’re overwhelmed, make a calming down corner in the house where they can go for space. Coming up with solutions will help you both create a great system. [2] X Research source Avoid making assumptions about your spouse. Instead, let your partner directly communicate what they want. Make sure you have boundaries set for yourself, too. For a healthy relationship, it’s important for you to both voice your needs."

      "title": "Ask if your spouse wants to be openly autistic.",
      "content": "Ask if your spouse wants to be openly autistic. To be openly autistic , your partner would let other people know they’re diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)—check if they’re comfortable with this. Discuss the benefits and the drawbacks of disclosing this. Once your partner makes their decision, support them by saying you respect their choice. [3] X Research source Maybe they’d like to be openly autistic to increase awareness and understanding of autism. They may only want a select group of people to know about their diagnosis. If they don't want to be openly autistic, don't talk about their autism to others."

      "title": "Embrace your spouse’s talents and special interests.",
      "content": "Embrace your spouse’s talents and special interests. Practice active listening when your partner expresses intense fascinations with certain subjects. Be supportive about the way they spend a lot of time researching a topic. Also pay attention to your partner’s talents, which may range from athletic abilities to trivia. Use words of affirmation and praise your spouse, which will raise their self-esteem. [4] X Research source If your autistic partner shares a lot of information, use the moment as an opportunity to bond with them. When you understand autistic strengths, you’ll be able to appreciate your partner even more. Try to engage with your partner’s interests. For example, if your wife has a special interest in cooking, help them to research recipes that they'll enjoy making. Let your spouse have time to focus intently on things, whether or not those things are special interests. Deeply focusing can help your spouse unwind."

      "title": "Be aware of why your partner needs to “stim.”",
      "content": "Be aware of why your partner needs to “stim.” If your partner repeats behaviors like flapping their hands, playing with their hair, or rocking back and forth, realize that these habits are just ways for them to soothe themselves. When you put it in perspective that “stimming” helps your spouse regulate their emotions and handle sensory input, you’ll see it as a normal part of their lifestyle. [5] X Research source Stimming shouldn’t be stopped unless it can harm you or your spouse. If your spouse needs to avoid distracting others in settings like their workplace, talk about how to stim discreetly ."

      "title": "Emotionally support your spouse when they need it.",
      "content": "Emotionally support your spouse when they need it. Realize that adapting to an “allistic”—non-autistic—world can take a toll on your partner. Check in with your partner and see if they suffer from mental illness, such as depression or anxiety. Also ask how they feel affected by their circumstances. Validate your spouse’s feelings and tell them that you’re there for them. While your autistic spouse may not show it, they’ll appreciate your support. Share your schedules so you can make quality time to unpack what’s been going on. Make sure you have emotional support for yourself, too, especially if your spouse has a mental illness. Your spouse may be able to support you, but make sure you have friends and family that you can rely on, too. If you and your spouse are really struggling with your marriage, it's okay to look for marriage counseling."

      "title": "Respect their need to de-stress and decompress.",
      "content": "Respect their need to de-stress and decompress. Your spouse will need more quiet time than most people do. This isn't a reflection on your relationship or their love for you. Quiet time helps them de-stress and be their best selves. Sometimes, this quiet time needs to be alone. Other times, they might be okay doing a quiet activity together, like watching their favorite TV show. Ask what they need right now. They'll need extra quiet time after social outings or changes to routine. Plan ahead for this."

For example, they may have trouble starting a conversation, or others may not understand their speech patterns. When this happens, read everyone’s body language , stand by your partner’s side, and change the subject to bring the focus somewhere else. Your spouse will be glad you smoothed everything over.

      "content": "Avoid forcing your spouse outside of their comfort zones. Allow your partner to keep their routines and stimming habits so they can self-regulate. To avoid meltdowns or shutdowns, accept that your partner needs to prevent sensory overload. Let your spouse decide when to try new activities or break habits. A healthy marriage requires both partners to look out for their own interests and needs for balance. [7] X Research source If your partner’s habits impact their health, gently encourage a lifestyle swap. For example, ask them to bring snacks to their desk instead of studying for hours without eating."

Provide information about organizations that focus on the needs of autistic individuals, like Autism Self Advocacy Network and Asperger / Autism Network . To reduce everyday stress, find disability services and work accommodations. Also help your spouse find a support group or choose a therapist .

According to the American Psychological Association (APA): [8] X Research source Autism is a spectrum that affects each person differently. Each person will have a different mix of skills and needs. Autistic individuals often struggle with verbal and non-verbal communication. Routine and repetitive behaviors are typically very important to autistic people. Awareness of others’ feelings usually don’t come naturally to autistic people. Autism isn't always diagnosed during childhood; many people are diagnosed as autistic when they are teens or adults."

Rather than paying attention to how autism is portrayed in the media by non-autistic people—like the way a character talks in a TV show—prioritize information from medical professionals and autistic individuals.

However, others with autism report that they feel emotions very deeply. [9] X Research source Myth: autistic people can't be parents .

The difference between an \"autistic person\" and an \"Autistic\" person is that an autistic person has been diagnosed as autistic , while an Autistic person accepts their autism as part of their identity. Avoid terms that treat autistic individuals like \"victims.\" For example, do not say someone is \"suffering from autism.\" Steer clear of measuring the intelligence level of autistic people or categorizing them. For instance, do not group some autistic individuals as \"high-functioning\" and others as \"low-functioning.\" Do not use \"cutesy\" terms for a disability like \"diffability\" or \"specially abled.\" Many autistic individuals want to discuss the concept of a disability in order to seek support and advocacy.
