[2] X Research source These statements are the heart of Python programming, and allow you to create programs that do different things depending on input and conditions. The while statement is a good one to start with. In this example, you can use the while statement to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to 100: # Each number in the Fibonacci sequence is # the sum of the previous two numbers a , b = 0 , 1 while b < 100 : print ( b , end = ' ' ) a , b = b , a + b The sequence will run as long as (while) b is less than (<) 100. The output will be 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 The end=' ' command will display the output on the same line instead of putting each value on a separate line. There are a couple things to note in this simple program that are critical to creating complex programs in Python: Make note of the indentation. A : indicates that the following lines will be indented and are part of the block. In the above example, the print(b) and a, b = b, a+b are part of the while block. Properly indenting is essential in order for your program to work. Multiple variables can be defined on the same line. In the above example, a and b are both defined on the first line. If you are entering this program directly into the interpreter, you must add a blank line to the end so that the interpreter knows that the program is finished."

This is especially important when you are dealing with user input. The following example will use the if , elif (else if), and else to create a simple program that evaluates the user's age. [4] X Research source age = int ( input ( \"Enter your age: \" )) if age <= 12 : print ( \"It's great to be a kid!\" ) elif age in range ( 13 , 20 ): print ( \"You're a teenager!\" ) else : print ( \"Time to grow up\" ) # If any of these statements are true # the corresponding message will be displayed. # If neither statement is true, the \"else\" # message is displayed. This program also introduces a few other very important statements that will be invaluable for a variety of different applications: input() - This invokes user input from the keyboard. The user will see the message written in the parentheses. In this example, the input() is surrounded by an int() function, which means all input will be treated as an integer. range() - This function can be used in a variety of ways. In this program, it is checking to see if the number in a range between 13 and 20. The end of the range is not counted in the calculation."

      "content": "Continue learning. These are just the basics when it comes to Python. Although it's one of the simplest languages to learn, there is quite a bit of depth if you are interested in digging. The best way to keep learning is to keep creating programs! Remember that you can quickly write scratch programs directly in the interpreter, and testing your changes is as simple as running the program from the command line again. There are lots of good books available for Python programming, including, \"Python for Beginners\", \"Python Cookbook\", and \"Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science\". There are a variety of sources available online, but many are still geared towards Python 2.X. You may need to make adjustments to any examples that they provide. If you want to run python online but wish to run python 3, Repl [1] has a python interpreter that uses virtual linux machines. Another good online resource for a future \"pythonista\" (well-versed python programmer) is thinkfunctional [2] . For bigger challenges, \"Automate the Boring Stuff\" [3] and Project Euler [4] are also available. Many local schools offer classes on Python. Oftentimes Python is taught in introductory classes as it is one of the easier languages to learn."
