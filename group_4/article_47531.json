      "title": "Don't wear leggings that are too tight or too loose.",
      "content": "Don't wear leggings that are too tight or too loose. Your leggings should be tight enough to snugly cover your legs, but not so tight that people can see every dimple in your legs. Make sure that they aren't so loose that they start to bunch over your legs, because that isn't very flattering either. You'll find ones that fit well not only look better, but feel more comfortable. Though anyone can wear leather leggings, they tend to be unforgiving and can bunch and cause unflattering lines on some body types."

      "title": "Leggings are pants, essentially.",
      "content": "Leggings are pants, essentially. Some believe this not to be the case, and they are entitled to their opinion. You can comfortably step out of the house wearing pants and a shirt, as you can do the same with leggings, if you like. As long as you won't be revealing too much, wear what you wish. Pair leggings with a longer top or jacket. Even if the shirt hits below your butt, you'll still look like you stepped out of the house without putting everything on. Wear your leggings with a dress, a skirt, or even shorts."

      "title": "Don't wear your leggings with the wrong shoes.",
      "content": "Don't wear your leggings with the wrong shoes. Leggings look great with knee-high boots, sandals, flip-flops, or even low-cut boots. If you wear your leggings with heels or pumps, make sure that they match your shirt and that you don't look too trashy. Leggings can also look good with ballet flats or moccasins, as long as the shoes go with the rest of the outfit."

      "title": "Make sure your leggings are long enough.",
      "content": "Make sure your leggings are long enough. You may have looked great in your perfect black leggings once upon a time, but after you've run them through the wash about a hundred times, you may notice that they rise a few inches above your ankles or they've gone saggy at the knee. When you notice this unpleasant phenomenon, it's time to save those leggings for days when you won't be stepping out of the house, or for wearing under trousers or pants on very cold days"

      "title": "Don't confuse leggings with jeggings.",
      "content": "Don't confuse leggings with jeggings. Jeggings are jean leggings, which is a cross between jeans usually, or other pants and leggings. Tight, sleek jeggings can help spice up an ordinary outfit, and you can wear them as you could wear pants. Denim blue ones with a 'boyfriend' cream sweater and loafers is a classic look. While leggings and a top that falls to your waist is a big no-no in many people's opinions, you can pair a short shirt with jeggings. Just make sure you can rock the jeggings. They're really tight and not for everybody."

      "title": "Pair leggings with a cute dress.",
      "content": "Pair leggings with a cute dress. Put on a short summer or springy dress and pair it with cotton leggings that complement the color of the dress. The dress and leggings shouldn't be the same color, obviously, but they should coordinate. For example, if the dress has five different colors on it, just pick leggings that match at least one of the colors. If your dress is busy with designs, go for solid-colored leggings. Or do the reverse, you can even wear a solid-colored dress with a pair of patterned leggings and top your dress with a solid colored scarf."

    {
      "title": "Pair leggings with a skirt.",
      "content": "Pair leggings with a skirt. Pick a skirt that looks good with the leggings. Make sure the color of the skirt and the material don't clash with the leggings. If you're wearing a lose skirt, wear a tight shirt so you don't have too much flouncy material going on. If your skirt has a pattern, wear plain leggings. If the skirt is plain, wear patterned leggings or leggings that are of a distinct enough color so they don't blend in with the skirt."

    {
      "title": "Pair leggings with shorts.",
      "content": "Pair leggings with shorts. This can be a cute and casual look. Just put on a plain-colored pair of leggings and throw on some denim, white, or black shorts, and you're good to go. The shorts shouldn't be so tight that they blend in with the leggings. Wear casual shoes with this look. Flats, low boots, sandals, or even sneakers will do. Wear a long jacket or top and a tight tank top or t-shirt with this look. Remember that you already have a lot going on when you wear shorts with leggings, so either own it and wear lots of layers, or keep it simple, but don't go for something in between. If the sweater and boots are a simple, solid color, try some patterned leggings."

      "title": "Rock the patterned leggings.",
      "content": "Rock the patterned leggings. Leggings that are zebra or leopard striped or covered with hypnotic can give you a fun and flashy look. Make sure you wear them with an understated top, skirt, dress, pants or shoes. Let your leggings steal the show and avoid clashing by not having other patterns get in the way of your style. If you're wearing loud leggings and an understated top, pair them with some loud jewelry."

      "content": "Make sure your workplace dress codes allows you to wear leggings to work at all. Even nicer leggings can make a more casual and playful statement, so before you plan your next trip to the office with your brand-new leggings, check out your work environment to see if it's appropriate. Check out to see if other people in your workplace wear leggings or skirts that could be paired with leggings."

      "content": "Wear leggings that are made of fancy material. There's nothing wrong with cotton leggings, but if you need to dress up for work, you should try wearing leggings that are made of suede, leather, or even dark denim. Having a variety of leggings to choose from will help you mix and match more fantastic work outfits. Remember the rule about not wearing leggings instead of pants. If you wear leather leggings and just a top to work, you will look unprofessional and may embarrass yourself, depending on where you work. Try wearing black velvet leggings.

      "title": "Avoid patterned leggings.",
      "content": "Avoid patterned leggings. Stick to mostly black or at least solid-colored leggings in the workplace. If you wear patterned lacy black leggings, you may look too trashy for the workplace. Funky-patterned leggings can be fun for after work, but they are too playful for a work environment. If your leggings have subtle tiny polka dots running over dark material and they almost look solid, that can be an exception."

      "title": "Pair your leggings with a nice top.",
      "content": "Pair your leggings with a nice top. If you wear a fancy top, it can help play up your leggings and make them look more fancy and appropriate for work. Here are some tops that you can wear over the leggings: Wear a tailored jacket over a simple shift dress and pair it with cotton leggings. Wear a loose top and a solid-color skirt with your leggings. Make sure the skirt doesn't fall too high above your knee to avoid looking too provocative. The loose top should be fancy enough to tie the whole look together."

      "content": "Pair leggings with a long sweater. If you have a long, thick sweater that falls below your fingertips, you may be able to pull it off with leggings. Wear a belt around the sweater and high boots that match the sweater. To pull this look off at work, the sweater has to look really nice."

      "title": "Wear shoes that complement the leggings.",
      "content": "Wear shoes that complement the leggings. Sandals look great with leggings but aren't acceptable for most work places. Avoid sandals in a professional work environment, especially with leggings, which will look even more casual. Pair the leggings with low or high black boots. Pair them with close-toed shoes with a little bit of a heel."

      "content": "Switch over to denim-style leggings for casual Fridays. You can pair a flowing tunic top with denim leggings and ballet flats. To dress it up more for work, add a couple of long chain necklaces or a decorative scarf. You'll look trendy and casual at the same time. Avoid wearing leggings with shorts to work. Though this may be a cute look if you're out with your friends, avoid the look in the workplace even if it's a casual day.
