If there’s too much water in the sink, scoop the excess out with a bucket and dispose of it in another sink, pour it outside, or flush it down a toilet. [1] X Research source This is the best method to use if your sink isn’t draining at all. If there’s an overflow drain on the side of your sink, cover it with a wet towel to prevent air from escaping, which can decrease the plunger’s suction power."

If you have a double sink, stuff a damp washcloth into the unclogged drain to ensure that the plunger's pressure is focused on the clog. Push on the handle gently to release the air from the bell.

The air from the bell will push into the pipes, dislodging the clog. Continue for 20 seconds, then pull the plunger off the drain opening and see if the water starts to drain. [4] X Research source If the clog isn’t clear, plunge once more for 20 seconds. If the clog still doesn’t budge, try a different method in this list.

If the water in your sink is draining slowly, wait until it’s empty or until there’s only about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of water sitting at the bottom. Bring a kettle or pot of water to a boil, then pour it down the drain. The heat can help break up the grease and break up the clog. [6] X Research source Repeat 2 to 3 times, letting the pipes rest for about a minute between batches. [7] X Research source If the clog still doesn’t clear, keep reading for another way to get rid of it. If the standing water in your sink isn’t draining at all, adding more water will not unclog it.

Slowly add about 2 c (470 mL) of white distilled vinegar. Allow the mixture to dissolve the clog for about 15 minutes. [11] X Research source The mixture will bubble and fizz—this means the two ingredients are reacting, which can help break up the grease and dirt in your drain.

Secure the edges with painter’s tape or poke the hose through the end of a plastic bag so the air is less likely to leak through. Turn on the vacuum. The pressure of the suction can dislodge the clog, sending it into the vacuum. [14] X Research source If there’s an overflow drain on the sidewall of your sink, block it with a damp cloth or cover it with a piece of duct tape or painter’s tape. [15] X Research source If the clog is on one side of a double-sided sink, seal up the unclogged side with a rubber drain stopper first. Unscrew the P-trap underneath the sink and attach the hose to the pipe coming out of the wall if you suspect your clog is in the wall pipes. [16] X Research source"

An auger, or plumber’s snake , has a long coiled metal cable with a hook or sharp piece at the tip, which grabs onto the clog. Insert the tip into the drain that doesn’t have a garbage disposal inside it. Twist the hand crank to release the wire cable deeper into the pipes. [17] X Research source If your auger doesn’t have a hand crank, simply feed the wire deeper and deeper into the pipe until you feel a blockage. Home improvement specialist Allen Lee says the garbage disposal can get “in the way of running a snake down that drain.” [18] X Expert Source Allen Lee Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 10 June 2020. If you have a second drain in your sink, run the auger down that instead. If your sink only has one drain hole with a garbage disposal attached to it, try another method instead."

When you feel something blocking the path of the auger, preventing you from feeding it deeper into the pipes, carefully rotate the auger, pushing gently. [19] X Research source When there’s no longer resistance, or the auger gets tangled in the clog, reel it back up through the pipes. Try not to push or pound the auger deeper into the clog—this can potentially damage your connectors or pipes. If the sink doesn’t unclog, continue to the next method."

[20] X Expert Source David Balkan Professional Plumber & CEO of Balkan Sewer & Water Main Expert Interview. 29 April 2021. Place a bucket under the pipes to catch any water that drains out. [21] X Research source The P-trap looks like a large curve or dip in the pipes below the sink, and it’s often found not far from where the pipe connects to the wall. Place towels underneath the bucket to catch any extra water that may come out of the pipes. Since the pipes under your sink aren’t connected to the water that comes inside your house, there’s no need to shut off the water to your sink."

[22] X Research source As you unscrew the connections, inspect the rubber rings inside them for damage. If any of the rings are broken or worn, replace them. [23] X Research source Wear rubber gloves for this process to protect your hands from anything that may come out of the pipes.

[28] X Research source Once you feel the end of the auger catch on the clog, pull it straight out. If the auger meets resistance again as you pull it out, continue pulling and cranking the handle clockwise until the cable catches on the clog.
