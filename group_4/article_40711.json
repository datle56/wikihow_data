One of the quickest and easiest ways to find available land is to talk to people and ask them if they have heard of any farms or land for sale. Ask locals if they know of any land actively for sale or of anyone who is even thinking of selling. This may help you be the first to see something newly on the market. [1] X Research source If you don't live in a community with farmland, you need to find an area that does and talk to members of that community. Go to local feed stores, small businesses, and community events to find people to talk to about land that is available in the area."

      "content": "Focus on getting a piece of land that is large enough for your farm. This size should be determined by what you can afford but also by what your horses will need. This includes plenty of space to run and space to separate horses that shouldn't be breeding at particular times or who shouldn't be together, such as two horses that don't get along. Horses need approximately 1000 square feet (93 square meters) per horse, not including pasture and foraging area. More space is always better than less. If you want to let your horses forage for a lot of their food, you will need more like 1 acre per horse. However, most horse breeders don't have their horses forage for most of their food and a much smaller pasture is totally suitable. You'll need at least two separated areas of land, one for the stallion(s) and the other area for the mares. If you have more than one stallion, you'll need more separate areas, as keeping two stallions in the same pasture is not a good idea in most cases, especially since farm lots rarely replicate the wide ranges of wild horses. Moreover, there is a need for rotating pasture, to allow pasture to recover and to release the horses onto fresh pasture regularly. This means that you will need more pasture than you might think at first."

If the land is already being used as a farm, then it’s likely that you won’t have any zoning problems yourself. However, it doesn't hurt to check the zoning just to be safe. If you want to use land for a new use, talk to local officials before committing to buying. Getting permission to use land commercially that hasn’t been used that way in the past can be a lengthy and costly process, depending on local regulations."

Otherwise, your expenses will increase because you need to bring in lots of feed. If you plan on keeping horses on pasture all year round, the grass needs to be rich in vitamins and minerals and non-toxic to horses. It also needs to grow back quickly! On the other hand, if your climate means that the horses need to be kept indoors over winter, you'll need suitable barn accommodation with easy mucking out facilities and at least a small outside area for exercising during the warmest part of cold days. If you want most of your horse's food to come from grazing, you will need at least 1 acre of pasture land per horse."

Creeks, ponds, dams, and the like are good sources of water, but you'll need to ensure that algae growth isn't an issue in the warmer months. Ideally, you will have several sources, for example a pond and a well. It's a good idea to have the water supply tested for quality before buying land. Water will be so important to your operation that you want to know you can depend on your supply. [3] X Research source On the other hand, too much water can water log your land, so drainage is important. If the pasture is water logged, its feeding potential will be destroyed and there will be problems for the horses walking in puddles and muddy conditions."

You will have to immerse yourself in both working directly with horses and administrative tasks, such as marketing and keeping track of all your income and expenses. In addition to making sure the horses are cared for properly, there will be a lot of time spent on assessing the background of horses and learning breeding techniques and information. Having a list of all of the jobs associated with this business will help you assess whether you are up for the challenge. [4] X Research source If you've owned 1 or more horses before, then you should be aware that there is a lot of work involved with caring for horses and that it's a rather expensive undertaking.

Also, check for holes in the pasture. It would be best if there weren't any gophers or other animals that dig holes in the ground, because if a horse steps in these at a fast pace, there is a risk of severe injury. If there are holes, consider whether you can eliminate the cause of the holes, for instance if moles can be eradicated. [5] X Research source Areas with snakes need to be checked for snake habitats in the pasture. Snakes and horses don't mix, so by reducing the habitat preferences of snakes, you can reduce the potential for snakes hanging around. Some things that may help are not having wood/log piles, junk heaps, and any other such place that encourages rodent breeding, which attracts snakes."

However, as most people don't have the time to do this, a good quality wooden fence works just fine, as do metal bars. Wooden fencing comes in many styles, such as post-and-board, post-and-rail, etc. Good fencing costs money but it's not worth skimping because injuries and loss can amount to a lot more than money spent on suitable fencing from the beginning. [7] X Research source Using wood that is non-toxic and enduring, you should expect a good 15 to 20 years life from a well-cared for wooden fence. The trick is in maintaining it––borers can attack such fencing and bored horses like to chew it. Another option is electric fencing. Provided it is properly earthed and made with quality wire using at least three to four rows, it is a cost-effective and usually safe solution. Most horses will shy away from it after a few shocks. However, sometimes it can scare a horse enough to destroy the fence, so care needs to be taken with particularly wild or frisky horses. Do not ever use hog wire fencing for horses. Horses (and other wildlife like deer) can accidentally get their legs caught in it. Barbed wire should not be an option for keeping horses. Barbed wire was designed for cows, not horses. Horses can be seriously injured, perhaps permanently, if they get caught in barbed wire."

Know what your horse should be fed and get some supplies before you bring any horses to your farm. The basic components of a horses diet include: [9] X Research source Forage—Horses eat forage, mostly including hay, to keep warm. When buying hay, look at the quality. You want something that is nutritious but is not going to pass right through the horse. Try to get grassy hay or oat hay. If you do get alfalfa (lucerne) hay, try to get a second or, even better, a third cut, as the hay will be more stalky and will not be too rich. Concentrate—This is typically a mixture of chaffs, including alfalfa, oats, and wheat. The alfalfa chaff will provide high protein and calcium for your horse, and the wheat will provide a source of bulk food. This is what the horse will eat to stay full but it does not put on or take away nutrients. This is used when you want to fill a horse up faster without adding heat and energy to the food. [10] X Research source Supplemental foods—Pellets and grain are good ways to put on weight and maintain it. They are also handy when you require a boost of energy for a show or your horse needs a lift. Boiled grains are best as they help to put weight on and, during the colder months, help to keep the horse warm. The best thing to start with is a lucerne pellet or a cool pellet. These feeds add no additional energy and they provide a range of vitamins and minerals. After a while, you can try different products until you find the perfect fit."

Depending on what your customers want in a horse, you might consider breeding gaited horses, laid-back horses, or competitive horses. Don't simply rely on your own current knowledge. Do research into the current market. Find out who is selling good stock at the moment, which horses are renowned for which traits, the types of issues you're likely to be faced with in caring for that particular breed of horse, etc. Doing thorough research will ensure that you're well informed and that you're making the right decision about the breed that you're choosing. Don't jump into breeding rare, exotic breeds unless you've had experience with them. Start with a breed you know a lot about and have spent time handling. If you choose a very popular horse, such as a quarter horse, you will have to compete with more breeders to sell, therefore lowering the prices. However, if your aim is to provide quality in all respects, plot this out as part of your business plan. Breeding racing horses requires an enormous amount of money and expertise.

This means signing papers and checking contractual clauses confirming the ancestry of each horse you purchase. [14] X Research source It doesn't matter which breed you're breeding, but obviously some horses will cost you more, and some horses will sell for more. In terms of how many horses you start with, that should be determined by your research, your land space, and your budget.

Remember, your new horses are in an unfamiliar surrounding and everything is new and different. The water will taste different and the food will smell different, so let them adjust and have the food there just in case they are hungry. Find out what the horse was fed before you bought it.
