      "content": "Know what colors are best for you. Wearing a color that flatters your skin tone can really boost your confidence. Black is always a great choice, but if you want to wear something colorful, pick a color that makes you look great! If your skin has warm tones, try an earth tone like olive green, coral, or brown. If your skin has cool tones, try shades of blue, purple, or gray. People with dark skin look fantastic in neons, whites, and other very bright colors. If you’re very pale, try jewel tones. Tanned skin looks great in metallic colors. Try matching your bikini with your hair or eye color. You can even pick a pattern that has your hair or eye color in it."

      "content": "Pick a simple design. Don’t worry about what’s trendy this summer. If you’re worried about how you’ll look on the beach or at the pool, go for a bikini with a simple, classic design. That way, you won’t have to worry about whether all the straps are connected or if the fringe is tangled. Consider how much coverage you want from your bikini. This can range from very little (e.g. a bandeau) to a decent amount (e.g. tankini, high waisted briefs). There is no right or wrong choice, other than what you feel most comfortable wearing.

      "content": "Choose a cut that flatters you. Everyone’s body is different, so a bikini that looks amazing on your friend might not be the best choice for you. Try on several different styles and pick the most flattering one. If you have a large bust, make sure your top has wide, comfortable support straps. High-waisted bottoms look great on petite people or shoppers who want more stomach coverage. Try bottoms with adjustable ties if you’re pear-shaped. If you’d prefer to keep a little more covered, try a tankini or a bikini with boyshort bottoms or a matching sarong. If you want to accentuate a small bust, choose a top with ruffles. If you want to look slimmer, whether it's the top, bottom, or both, then choose darker colors. If you want to look curvier, choose lighter colors on top.

Many manufacturers don’t have a standard size, and different cuts can fit the same body very differently. Most stores require you to leave your underwear on to try on bathing suits, so make sure you're wearing undergarments that are visible around the edges of the bikini bottom.

Having to leave the fitting room to change sizes can be upsetting, so bring a range of sizes in with you from the start. If you’re shopping for mix and match bikinis, make sure you have multiples sizes in tops and bottoms. It's totally normal to have two different sizes—one for your top and a different one for your bottom. [5] X Expert Source Neepa Sikdar Personal Stylist Expert Interview. 11 February 2022. If you have a larger chest, you can look for bikini tops by bra size. This is recommended because that way you'll be certain that the bikini top will fit you correctly.

      "content": "Put on sunscreen. It’s hard to feel good about yourself when you’re sunburned! Make sure you put on sunscreen at least half an hour before you go out in the sun. Take advantage of the time to check your look one last time before heading out! You should reapply sunscreen every two hours, plus every time you go swimming or towel off. If you want to get a tan, choose a sunscreen or tanning oil with a low SPF. This will let you get some color while reducing the risk of burns. You can also try sunless tanning lotions or sprays."

Put on a big pair of sunglasses for a chic Hollywood effect. If you aren’t going to be swimming much, try some statement jewelry like a chunky bracelet or big hoop earrings. A cute beach hat will give you a classic look. If you can’t wear a bikini by itself, try a sarong or a crocheted shirt. Cover-ups that don’t look like cover-ups can flatter your body and make you look and feel confident. Finish your look with cute sandals or beach shoes."

You don’t have to join a gym or run a marathon. Start small by getting up and walking every hour, or doing ten jumping jacks every morning. The only way to reduce a body part's size or tone is to reduce your overall body fat, then exercise to tone that specific area. So if you want a smaller stomach, you can exercise to reduce fat everywhere, then do crunches or sit-ups to tone your stomach."
