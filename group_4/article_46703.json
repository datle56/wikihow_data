Most of them have similar steps, but you should always read the manual and confirm the instructions before using it. If you don’t know which pump to use, ask your doctor for a recommendation.

      "content": "Slip the constriction ring down to the base of the tube. Pumps come with a constriction ring that fits around the base of your penis to help you keep an erection. Take the constriction ring and slip it over the thin end of the penis tube. Slide it back to the base of the tube, where you’ll put your penis in. If you’re having trouble with the constriction ring, you can lubricate it with water-based lubricant to help get it onto the tube. Penis pumps might come with a few different constriction rings. To find the right size, slip them over your penis when you're not aroused. Use the one that fits snuggly, but is not tight enough to cut off circulation."

      "title": "Pump until you get an erection.",
      "content": "Pump until you get an erection. Once the tube is snug with your body, slowly start squeezing the pump. The pump is usually on the tip of the tube, opposite from your body. You should start gradually getting an erection. Keep pumping until you have a full erection, then stop so you don't over-pump. Pump very slowly to lower your risk for bruising or pain. Don’t pump it more once you have an erection, or you could hurt yourself. Some pumps use battery power instead of a hand pump. In this case, switch the pump on to create a vacuum seal."

The ring will be tight since you fitted it to your penis while it was soft. This is okay, and it’s supposed to be tight so the blood stays in your penis. The ring shouldn’t be painful. If it hurts when you put it on, then it’s probably too small."

For instance, you might feel some pain when you start pumping. This isn’t supposed to happen, so stop pumping and take the tube off right away. If the pain doesn’t go away, call your doctor. You’re more likely to hurt yourself if you pump fast, so always go slowly. You can also hurt yourself if you pump too much, so only pump enough to get an erection. If you can, get a pump with a vacuum limiter. This is a safety valve that releases the pressure if it gets too high, which helps you avoid injuries.
