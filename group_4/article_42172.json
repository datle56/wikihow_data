      "content": "Join sports or clubs. While it may feel like nobody likes you, you can try to join different clubs or teams to make friends that share similar interests as you. [4] X Research source This can be at school or outside of school. Look into different clubs at school such as drama club, yearbook, poetry club, and activities like music or sports. Outside of school you can join like karate, dance, and spiritual organizations. Think about what may interest you, then go check it out. You may feel weird or out of place at first, but give it a shot. Sometimes the hardest part is going to your first meeting. You might feel really anxious or tell yourself all kinds of stories that no one will like you or that you’ll be ignored. Don’t listen to any of it! Just go one time, and give it a try. Remember that all the people there share that same interest. Try getting to know other club members by asking them, “When did you first get into photography?” or, “How long have you done karate?” or, “Who’s your favorite poet?”"

[5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source There’s no need to replay negative situations in your head over and over. By focusing on the past on your negative experience, you actually empower the people that hurt you. Instead, empower yourself by creating positive thoughts about yourself. It may be easy to get stuck on a loop of when people rejected you. (“What did I do? What could I have done differently? Why were they so mean?”) but get off that loop as soon as possible. These people do not define who you are, and their opinion is only an opinion, not a fact. . Think about the positive qualities you possess (like being kind, compassionate, caring, and generous) and your unique abilities (such as being a great dancer and big brother)."

Look at someone at your school that is popular, gets along with people, and has lots of friends. What does this person do that makes him or her so likeable? Notice the way this person stands, body language, facial expressions, and the way he or she interacts with others, verbally and nonverbally. See the positive things this person brings to social interactions, and practice them in your own interactions. When you’re focused on yourself, you may miss the cues that other people give you.

Instead, make sure you communicate your openness by appearing open in your body: lean toward people, smile, nod your head, and maintain comfortable eye contact. Try and avoid crossing your body, but keep your shoulders open and not hunched. When making eye contact, it’s okay to look away; no need to lock eyes indefinitely. You can also look at different focal points such as the forehead, nose, mouth, between the eyes). If you’ve generally avoided eye contact in the past, it may be a difficult practice to adopt, but keep at it."

If you’re so wrapped up in thinking about what to think next, you may miss what the other person is saying. Listen to what the other person is saying, and ask questions that build on what is said. For instance, if someone tells you, “I like to garden”, ask “What kind of plants or flowers do you grow?” or “How did you get into gardening?” Active listening means you put your attention onto what is being said and show interest in it and the person. Don’t be afraid to nod your head, say “oh yeah” or “really?” or “Wow! That’s fascinating!” to show that you are listening along."

Find ways to respond to your negative thoughts in a way that makes them untrue. If you think, “I’m stupid”, think of all the things that make you smart, and it doesn’t have to be school. You may be smart in math, or in building things, or problem solving difficult situations."
