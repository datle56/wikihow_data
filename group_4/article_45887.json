Mix 1/2 a cup (110g) of baking soda with 1/4 a cup (68g) of salt and dump the mixture down your drain. Heat 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar on the stove until it’s simmering hot, then pour that down the drain. The baking soda will fizz and bubble as it reacts with the vinegar. Wait 15 minutes before flushing your drain with a stream of hot water from your faucet or a tea kettle. [3] X Research source Let the hot water run down the drain for at least 5 minutes to rinse away all the vinegar, baking soda, and grime.

If something gets spilled on your carpet, grab a clean, dry towel and blot up as much of the mess as possible. Make a paste with baking soda and a few drops of white vinegar, then rub it into the stained area. Let it dry overnight, then vacuum the dried paste out of the carpet in the morning. [6] X Research source If you’re worried about damaging your carpet, try the mixture out in an inconspicuous spot first, like an edge of the carpet that’s normally hidden under a piece of furniture. When you’re blotting up spills on a carpet, don’t rub with the towel—just press down or blot, instead. Rubbing will spread the stain around and damage the fibers. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a paste by sprinkling baking soda on a surface and spritzing on vinegar. A baking soda and vinegar paste is abrasive and can rub away stuck-on grime. Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda on the surface you want to clean (such as a grimy pot or dirty stovetop), then spritz on just a little bit of vinegar from a spray bottle. Grab a scrub brush or sponge and scrub hard to break down stubborn dirt and residue. When you’re done, rinse the surface with warm water. [12] X Research source The foaming action you get when you mix the baking soda and vinegar may help trap and lift away dirt and grime. [13] X Research source Don’t use enough vinegar to dissolve the baking soda completely, or you won’t get the benefits of its scrubby texture. Just use a light spritz or a few drops to make a gritty, foamy paste. Add a few drops of lemon juice instead of or in addition to vinegar for a fresh, citrusy scent. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrub the mug with baking soda, then follow up with a vinegar soak. Baking soda is great for breaking down coffee stains, and vinegar can help bust stubborn residue. If your favorite mug or carafe is starting to look a little gross, whip up a paste of baking soda and little bit of warm water. Put the concoction on a damp kitchen sponge and use it to gently scrub away the stains. If that doesn’t take care of the stains, fill the mug with a mixture of 1 part water and 1 part hot, white vinegar, and let it sit for 10 minutes. Then, wash it with dish soap and a scrubby sponge. [18] X Research source If none of that works, fill your mug with water and toss in a denture cleaning tablet. Follow the instructions on the denture cleaner to figure out how long to let the mixture soak. These tablets are made with (you guessed it!) baking soda, plus some extra ingredients, like citric acid and bleaching agents, to help break down stubborn stains."
