Pour in a small amount of mild detergent , and set the load size accordingly. Wash the laces on the coldest setting, then remove them from the rest of your load to air dry. Pro tip: Stuff the laces in a sock or small mesh laundry bag so they don’t get tangled in the washing machine. If the laces have caked on dirt or grime, gently brush them with an old toothbrush before tossing them in the washer."

      "content": "Scrub off excess dirt and grime with a soft-bristled brush. Over a trash can, tap the soles of your shoes together several times to shake off loose dirt and debris. Then, use a soft-bristled toothbrush to remove any remaining dirt and grime. If your shoes are muddy, let them dry completely before cleaning them so the mud comes off easily in clumps. [2] X Research source For caked on mud and grime, use quick, circular motions to scrub off stubborn spots. If you don’t have an old toothbrush to clean your shoes, use a small towel that you don’t mind getting dirty."

      "content": "Wipe your shoes with a soapy mixture of water and detergent. Mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of mild laundry detergent into 1 cup (240 mL) of cold water in a small bowl. Dip a clean cloth into this solution, then work it into the dirty areas of your shoe until you see a lather. Use small, circular motions to clean the insoles and outer parts of the shoe, and periodically rinse the cloth in clean water to remove any dirty water from cleaning. Alternatively, use dish soap, hand soap, or dandruff shampoo if you’re out of detergent. If you only see small stains, dip a soft-bristled toothbrush into the cleaning solution to spot-clean your shoes."

      "content": "Let your shoes dry overnight, away from direct heat and sunlight. Stuff them with newspaper to help keep their shape, and leave them in a room with good air circulation so they dry as quickly as possible. When they’re fully dry, put the insoles and laces back in. Pro tip: Deodorize your shoes by adding a dryer sheet or a light dusting of baking powder along with the newspaper stuffing. Do not leave your shoes outside or use a blowdryer to speed up the drying process—direct heat and sunlight can damage the glue in your shoes and cause them to fall apart."

      "content": "If you put your HOKAs in the washing machine, it may damage them. According to the brand, machine washing can loosen the glue and fastenings of your shoes (and cause them to age more quickly). Bleaching and machine drying your HOKAs can also damage them in the long run, so avoid using these methods if you want to preserve the lifespan of your shoes. [3] X Research source If you need to clean them for an event, give yourself at least 24 hours to hand wash your HOKAs and let them air dry."

Pad out the drum in your washer with towels to protect your shoes, then pour in 1 cup (240 mL) of mild detergent . Turn the load size to “small,” choose the cool water setting, and set the spin mode to “gentle.” Let your shoes air dry to avoid long term damage. [4] X Research source If you absolutely have to clean and dry your shoes in less than 12 hours, follow the steps above to wash them, then use the final “spin” setting on your washer to remove any excess water. Put your shoes in the dryer and use the “air dry” or “gentle” setting. However, try to save machine washing and drying for desperate times."

Follow the instructions from the first section to clean your mesh shoes , but use gentle dabbing motions when washing them with the soapy cleaning solution. Instead of scrubbing your shoes with a toothbrush, blot them clean with a soft towel. [5] X Research source Pro tip: After you unlace your shoes, stuff a microfiber cloth into your shoes to absorb any liquid that seeps in during the cleaning process."

To wash your sneakers, blot them with a towel to ensure they’re fully dried, and use a special suede brush to clean any dirt and scuff marks . Dip the corner of a clean cloth into distilled white vinegar to spot clean any stains, then blot your shoes with a clean towel and let them air dry. If your shoes are still dirty, purchase a suede and nubuck cleaning solution or suede shampoo to remove tough stains or caked on dirt. Do not machine wash suede or nubuck HOKAs—they can get damaged in just one cycle."
