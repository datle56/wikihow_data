      "title": "UPS SurePost is an economy shipping service for non-urgent needs.",
      "content": "UPS SurePost is an economy shipping service for non-urgent needs. Typically, when something is sent in the mail, UPS delivers the package from the sender to the recipient directly. This means that UPS delivers single packages to a single location, no matter the distance, which can uptick shipping costs. With SurePost, UPS works with the United Postal Service (USPS) to deliver packages more cheaply and effectively. UPS picks up the package, and the final delivery is made by USPS. [1] X Research source SurePost delivers Monday through Sunday, and packages take between 2 to 6 days to arrive once shipped. [2] X Research source This shipping service is ideal for packages that are less than 10 lb (4,500 g). Packages can be tracked using UPS’s online tracker ; however, deliveries may not be updated once transferred to USPS’s care. SurePost offers a carbon neutral shipping option; however, additional fees may apply. [3] X Research source"
