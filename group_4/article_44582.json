      "content": "Try a mixture of rubbing alcohol and vinegar. [1] X Expert Source Payam Daneshrad, MD Board Certified Otolaryngologist Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. Use 1 part light vinegar to 1 part rubbing alcohol. Mix them together then, use a plastic syringe or ear bulb to place a few drops of this solution into your ear. Let it sit for a moment, then drain it out. You can use the bulb or syringe to remove the solution, as well. Vinegar and alcohol mixed together will flush bacteria from your ear, and remove any loose debris (like dust, or bugs) as it cleans the inside of your ear. Don’t let this mixture sit too long, and don’t use too much of it. Let it sit for just a few moments, then drain it out. Make sure you get out any remaining liquid from your ears."

      "title": "Put a few drops of warm oil in your ear.",
      "content": "Put a few drops of warm oil in your ear. You can use olive, mineral, or vegetable oil. Place the oil container inside of a warm glass of water to slowly warm the oil. Before putting any in your ear, make sure you test it on the inside of your wrist to make sure that it isn’t too hot. Don’t put more than a few drops of warm oil into your ears at a time. Wait a few hours for the oil to absorb and moisten the inside of your ear canal before applying anymore. The oil will work as a moisturizer for the skin inside of your ear. But, you don’t want to use oil that is meant for your body, such as baby oil or scented oil. These could cause further irritation. You can also try a traditional blend of mullein oil and garlic. You can make your own by steeping mullein flowers and chopped garlic in olive oil over low heat for 4 hours, or you can purchase pre-made mullein garlic oil. Place a few drops into the affected ear 2-3 times per day. [2] X Research source When using oil to treat painful or itchy ears, you can also place a few drops of oil onto a cotton ball and tuck the cotton ball into your ear overnight to allow the oil to absorb into your ear more slowly."

Then, tilt your ear back down to drain the peroxide out. [3] X Research source Using this method too often could backfire and lead to your ears drying out, or cause an infection. If this remedy doesn’t help after 1 or 2 tries, cease using the peroxide and seek medical advice. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Identify where the itch is coming from. Is it coming from deep inside your ear canal, or does your ear itch on the outside on the cartilage or lobe? Internal itchiness could be an early indicator for a cold, for example, while external itchiness could be related to an allergic reaction to something in your environment. If you recently had your ears pierced and you are experiencing itchiness or soreness in the lobe, you may have a mild infection in the new piercing. Make sure you handle your pierced ears with clean hands, and treat them with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol a few times a day. If the infection worsens or persists, see a doctor. Dry skin on the outer ear can cause itchiness. If the dry skin appears on places like your ears, face, or scalp, it may be a common condition called seborrheic dermatitis. Simple over-the-counter dandruff shampoos or products with ingredients like salicylic acid, zinc, or coal tar can help treat this condition. Wash the affected area with a medicated shampoo or soap once or twice a day. [13] X Research source"

If you recently changed your hygiene routine or started using a new product, try eliminating that product or going back to what you did before. Read labels on all personal hygiene products. Make sure nothing you use contains any ingredients you have a history of reacting badly to. Your ears can react to allergens the same way as other parts of your body, so an allergic reaction could be causing your itchy ears. [14] X Research source"

If you wear either of these things regularly, take them out and clean them thoroughly. Allow them to dry completely before putting them back into your ear.

But, if you happen to live in a place with a high bug population, and those bugs are often in the same room where you sleep, then you might be at a higher risk for this to happen."
