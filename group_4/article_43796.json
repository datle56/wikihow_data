      "content": "\"This accessory may not be supported\" occurs when you plug an accessory into your device. The error simply means that the accessory (like a charging cord or headphones) is not recognized by your iPhone or iPad. The error itself won't hurt your device. There are a number of reasons this error occurs, so just seeing it doesn't mean your device has been damaged. However, if you're using a non-Apple certified accessory, that accessory could damage your device by overheating it. You also might be seeing this error if your device or accessory is wet, which can cause damage to your phone or tablet as well."
