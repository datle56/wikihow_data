      "content": "Pick the right menstrual cup for your body. Menstrual cups are becoming more popular, so you can find them in most drug stores and big box stores. Some are a bit smaller or larger, so it's always good to read reviews before deciding on one. In general, you can choose the correct size by using a small menstrual cup if you’ve never given birth before and a large menstrual cup if you have given birth before. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Popular menstrual cup brands include the Diva Cup , Soft Disc , and Lunette . Menstrual cups run $30-$40 USD, but keep in mind that you can use them over and over, so they eventually pay for themselves. However, you can get them cheaper, usually in the $7-$10 USD range on the low end, so look around if you just want to try one out. Menstrual cups are typically made of silicone or rubber. If you have latex allergies, make sure the cup you choose is made completely with silicone. [2] X Research source"

Folds include: [8] X Research source The c-fold: Squeeze the opening of the cup together, then fold the opening in half. The 7-fold: Fold the cup in half, then pull down the right side to make a “7” shape. Punch-down fold: Hold the cup between your thumb and middle finger, then press one edge down with your index finger, pushing it in toward the center of the cup."

If you're not sure, reach up and feel around the base of the cup. It will be round or oval, depending on your body shape.
