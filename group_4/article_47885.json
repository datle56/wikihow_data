      "content": "The 6-7 TikTok trend is based on the rap song “Doot Doot (6 7)” by Skrilla. While Skrilla’s song is about street life and the violent conflicts that can be part of that, the 6-7 TikTok trend has a very different meaning. The trend uses clips from Skrilla’s song but is associated with various other subjects—from basketball player LaMelo Ball to random comedic content. Overall, the 6-7 trend is an example of how song lyrics take on a life of their own when exposed to viral internet fame."

      "content": "Ultimately, “6 7” is nonsensical; it doesn’t have a specific meaning. For the most part, TikTok users include “6-7” in videos wherever they feel like making a reference or joke. You might see 6-7 in a wide variety of TikTok videos—and in real life, people sometimes even say “6-7” just to say it (because it’s a popular trend). 6-7 TikToks include lip dubs and references to test scores, heights, and other jokes. WNBA player Paige Bueckers referenced “6-7” at a press conference , saying, “I’ve been here for five years, but it felt more like ‘six, seven.’” TikTok influencer Mr. Lindsay went viral with a video of example conversations that his students have had in class. He says, “Yo, Mr. Lindsay, how tall are you?” and then answers, “Six-seven.” @more_ti06’s January 28th lip dub TikTok featured the caption, “I got 67/100 on that test what abt you,” and then, “Me bc I heard 6-7” (with the song playing). @jesse.jn7 posted a video with the caption, “When u randomly shout “6’7” throughout the day, but nobody knows what u mean,” joking about the trend and its lack of meaning. If you hear someone say “6-7,” they’re probably referencing the TikTok trend—but they may not have a specific intent or meaning beyond that (unless they explain after)."

      "content": "6-7 can refer to people who are tall (and NBA player LaMelo Ball). This goes back to one of the first known viral 6-7 TikToks , which features Ball—captioned, “I’m just realizing now that he literally moves like someone that’s 6’1”-6’2”, except he’s 6’7”. That TikTok led to a flood of new videos with footage of Ball (and “Doot Doot (6-7)” in the background). [1] X Research source Other TikTok users have used the song to reference their height—or just being tall in general. For example, @vianneyroddd’s TikTok plays “Doot Doot” in the background with the text, “How tall are you?” Then, the text “6’7 😈” appears right as the lyrics “6-7” play."

      "content": "Some claim that “6-7” means “so-so.” However, that’s less of an official definition and more of a possible meaning that some teens (or adults) use. The expression “6-7” is sometimes said with an up-and-down hand gesture, which can also be connected to the “so-so” meaning. This meaning isn’t used by everyone who follows the 6-7 trend, but some use it! “So-so” means neither good nor bad. It’s another way of saying “okay” or “fair,” especially when someone asks you how you’re doing."

      "content": "In Skrilla’s song \"Doot Doot,\" 6-7 may refer to Chicago’s 67th Street. East 67th Street is an area of Chicago known for its high crime rates and gun violence. More recent incidents include a shooting in June 2024 in which two people were shot—and later, in December 2024, when another two people were shot, with both occurring on 67th Street. [2] X Research source Skrilla himself is from Philadelphia, PA. However, 6-7 may still be a nod to his roots, even though he didn’t grow up around Chicago’s 67th Street."

The lyrics in “Doot Doot” include, “Shooters stay strapped, I don’t need mine / Bro put the belt right to they behind / The way that switch brrt I know he dyin’ / 6-7 / I just bipped right on the highway.” In the song, “brrt” represents the sound of gunfire, and “switch” is another word for a firearm. “6-7” is also said right after “dyin’,” tying into the song’s violent themes.

When the commentator says LaMelo’s height (6’ 7”), “Doot Doot” starts playing. The song kept spreading on TikTok (and Instagram) in January 2025. [4] X Research source For example, one January 7th Instagram Reel from atlsproductions features a standup comedian saying 6’ 7” before the video cuts to footage of LaMelo Ball. TikTok users also kept making “6-7” jokes throughout January—even in videos unrelated to LaMelo Ball. For instance, @ag.trippin’s January 26th TikTok was a compilation of other 6-7 videos and jokes that became TikTok-famous."

      "content": "“At sixes and sevens” is an idiom describing confusion or disorder. When you’re “at sixes and sevens,” you’re essentially in a state of confusion—you may not know what’s happening or what to do next. The idiom can also describe a state of disarray, meaning you’re all over the place and disorganized in the current situation. [5] X Research source For example: “Everyone in the office has been at sixes and sevens this week. This project was so badly organized!”"

While there are obviously other numbers in the code besides six and seven, many agencies (like the police) use the code “10-67” over the radio to report a death.

Thus, every verse is marked with the chapter and verse numbers, separated by a colon.

The song “Doot Doot (6 7)” has explicit lyrics referencing gun violence in a dark yet humorous tone. If you’re worried, you could talk to your child about what 6-7 means to them—but to many young people, the fun of saying 6-7 is that it doesn’t mean anything (but it provokes a reaction from adults)."
