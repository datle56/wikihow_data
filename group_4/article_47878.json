      "content": "Three dots could mean she’s speechless or exasperated. Sometimes we just don’t have the words to express how we feel about something, and so we resort to “...” to do all the talking for us. She may have sent those dots because whatever you’re discussing has gotten just too strange or wild to even formulate a response. You: “...So then Kelly told him that she didn’t ever want to see him again, then she stole his car!” Her: “...”"

      "content": "An ellipsis is a common response to a bad joke or pun. It’s like in real life when someone makes a bad joke and you just look at them blankly. The joke was too bad to even merit a proper response. It’s not a negative reaction, just one that says, “There you go again, you goofball.” You: “A pig that does karate is called a pork chop.” Her: “...”"

You: “Wanna go to the football game tonight?” Her: “...” Her: “I guess we could do that…”"

She wants you to reply, but she doesn’t want to come right out and say “Respond to me!” Maybe you’ve waited too long to text back, or maybe she’s just letting you know that it’s your turn to talk.

Her: “...” You: “So the cops arrested her and he got his car back.” Her: “This is the wildest thing I’ve ever heard, oh my gosh.” Her: “...” You: “...and a mouse that says bad words is a cursor!” Her: “Okay I did laugh at that one.”"

      "content": "Older people use ellipses to separate thoughts. It's a generational thing. Many older people are used to physical media like letters or postcards, where space is limited, and so they’d use an ellipsis to mark a new idea without having to move to a new line. The habit stuck, and now they do the same in text messages, even if they don’t have to. There are no negative connotations intended! “I talked to your brother yesterday… Did you read the newspaper?”"
