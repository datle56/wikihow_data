      "title": "Enter Undyne’s cave and wait for her to attack you.",
      "content": "Enter Undyne’s cave and wait for her to attack you. Undyne is the third boss in Undertale’s Neutral and True Pacifist routes, waiting atop Waterfall’s crag. When you first approach, she’ll make a speech and tell you to “Step forward when you’re ready.” Afterward, you can head into the cave, and the battle will begin. [1] X Research source Undyne also appears in the Genocide route and eventually turns into Undyne the Undying (but this doesn’t happen in Pacifist or Neutral)."

      "title": "Block each of Undyne’s attacks with your shield.",
      "content": "Block each of Undyne’s attacks with your shield. At the beginning of the battle, you’ll see a small heart in the white square Undyne is standing on; this represents the battle’s current “Soul mode.” It’ll be red by default, but Undyne will immediately turn it green before attacking. In this mode, you must use the arrow keys to move your shield and block six attacks in total. [2] X Research source While in Green Soul mode, you can’t move or attack; thus, you can only block the arrows she throws by aiming your shield in the direction each one comes from. After six attacks, Undyne will turn your soul to the Red Soul mode again. Undyne will use her spear to switch between Red and Green Soul mode."

      "content": "Run until Undyne catches you. Choose the “Flee” option to run away from Undyne— do not attack her . You’ll have a few seconds to run further into the cave! Be aware that Undyne will catch up with you, but that’s part of the process (you’ll have to flee from her multiple times to spare her). [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Block Undyne’s arrows again in the next Green Soul mode.",
      "content": "Block Undyne’s arrows again in the next Green Soul mode. After Undyne catches you, the second phase of the battle will begin. Much like the first, she’ll activate Green Soul mode, and you’ll have to deflect arrows with your shield—but you only need to block her attacks four times before re-entering Red Soul mode. [4] X Research source During the battle, pay attention to the arrow colors. White-blue arrows are far away, red arrows are near the soul, and yellow arrows can reverse. So, if a yellow arrow attacks from the top, it will hit you at the bottom. Undyne’s arrows can be swift or very slow in terms of speed. Luckily, blocking them isn’t super hard as long as you stay focused!"

This time, eight attacks must be blocked before you’ll go back to Red Soul mode and get the chance to flee again. We promise, this is the last round! [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Run to the Hotland area bridge. Once your heart changes to red and you’re in Red Soul mode, flee for a final time toward Hotland. This time, Undyne will be tired and struggle to catch you. Additionally, if you spare Papyrus , he’ll call you while you’re running on the screen that says, “Welcome to Hotland!” [7] X Research source Undyne will not move during this call. After that, keep running until you reach Hotland, and you will have successfully spared Undyne."

Undyne will pause to look at Sans, then stop chasing you and collapse from overheating in her armor. At this point, you can bring her a cup of water from the nearby water cooler, which will let you befriend Undyne. Otherwise, just keep going into Hotland. [8] X Research source If you’re on the True Pacifist route , you must bring Undyne the water so you can befriend her. If you’re on the Neutral route, you can decide to befriend her or leave her there without water. If given water, Undyne will get up and leave (but you’ll see her later on in the game)."

Undyne will throw arrows at your soul (the little heart) from all four directions. In this mode, your soul has a shield-like spear, given to you by Undyne, that can be used to block her attacks. [9] X Research source This mode only appears during the Undyne battle in Undertale ."

While in Red mode, Undyne launches spear volleys that deal 5 damage per hit; additionally, right after changing the Soul mode to Red, she throws one spear at you that does 4 damage. [10] X Research source In the Genocide route, Undyne the Undying uses other attacks, including summoning rings of spears (and individual spears) targeting your soul."

      "title": "Neutral route",
      "content": "Neutral route If you choose to defeat and kill Undyne instead of sparing her, simply choose to “Fight” (instead of “Flee”) when it’s your turn on Red Soul mode. When her health bar is completely depleted, she’ll acknowledge your strength and use her Determination to attack some more; however, she’ll get slower and slower until she disintegrates into dust. [11] X Research source You can defeat Undyne and maintain your Neutral route (whereas fighting Undyne isn’t an option for a True Pacifist playthrough). Many of Undyne’s Neutral route attacks are telegraphed, making them easier to get accustomed to and dodge or block."

      "content": "Genocide route If you’re following the Genocide route, you’ll meet the Monster Kid near the cave where you face Undyne in the Neutral or Pacifist routes. If you “Spare” him, you’ll switch to the Neutral route. If you “Fight” him, you’ll continue the Genocide route; Undyne will intercept the attack meant for him and appear to be mortally wounded. Then she’ll stand up and face you, changing to “Undyne the Undying.” [12] X Research source As Undyne the Undying, her attacks are faster and deal more damage (between 8 to 12 per attack). During the Red Soul phase, Undyne throws arrows rapidly. The best way to avoid them is to keep close to the walls as you fight. During the Green Soul phase, Undyne will throw flip arrows—so it may take a moment for you to adjust and start blocking them fast."
