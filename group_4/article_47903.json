      "content": "“DINK” is an acronym for “dual income, no kids” or “double income, no kids.” This term refers to a couple who are voluntarily childless and in which both partners work reasonably well-paying jobs. Because they have no children, they have more disposable income and are thus able to live a little more comfortably than many couples with kids. [1] X Research source “Kathleen wants to marry Johan, but they don’t plan to have any kids.” “So they’re gonna be DINKs?” The word DINK usually applies to a couple with no plans to have kids, or a couple of “empty nesters”—that is, a couple whose kids have grown up and left home. There are a number of variations on the acronym, including: DINKY : “dual income, no kids yet,” referring to childless working couples who plan to have kids eventually GINK : “green inclinations, no kids,” referring to people who choose not to have children for environmental reasons DINKWAD : “double income, no kids, with a dog”"

      "content": "DINK as an acronym started in the 1980s. The term was coined during the peak of yuppie (“young urban professional”) culture. It was used to refer to couples who preferred to focus on their careers and enjoy a higher income without having to worry about children. “Yuppie” was coined in the 1980s to describe a young professional working in the city. While it began as a neutral word, it gradually began being used pejoratively to describe people contributing to gentrification. The acronym gained traction on the internet during the Great Recession. Though the word originated in the ’80s, it took off during the Great Recession in the late 2000s, as more people opted to wait to have kids or forgo it entirely in order to save money."

      "content": "People on TikTok are in their #DINKera. The term DINK remains trendy on the internet in social media posts and videos (especially on TikTok) of couples claiming to be “DINKs” or in their “#DINKera.” The videos (like this one ) often feature partners in a couple saying, \"We're DINKS,\" and then describing an activity they're privileged to take part in because of their free time and extra cash (e.g., \"We go on 10 vacations a year\"). [2] X Research source It's unclear why the term is still popular more than a decade after the Great Recession ended, but it could be because not having children has become more normalized than it's ever been, and more couples are embracing the childfree life. Stats indicate fertility rates in the United States are at an all-time low, and the share of U.S. adults under 50 without kids who say they're unlikely to ever have kids rose 10% from 2018 to 2023 (from 37% to 47%).

      "content": "Many viewers support the DINK trend, but not all do. A lot of #DINKera videos are made playfully and garner viewers' support or comments about how enviable the childfree lifestyle can be. But the trend has been met with vitriol by anti-DINKs, who take issue with the tongue-in-cheek (and often very mild) boasts DINKs make in their videos, like \"We're DINKs, we spend our discretionary income on $8 lattes.\" [4] X Research source Anti-DINKs seem certain DINKs will regret not having children later on, and lament that the DINK trend is further normalizing and celebrating the childfree life. On the other hand, many DINKs see being childfree as an opportunity to embrace individualism and get to know yourself better. It's also easier on the wallet!"

Next time you’re observing a match or playing in one yourself, describe a ball falling just over the net as a “dink,” or describe someone performing a drop shot as “dinking” the ball.

Use this word to describe someone who acts like a jerk—but know it could be taken offensively, so use “dink” as an insult with discretion! Boy, Kevin is such a dink for talking to you that way."

A bass that isn’t legally large enough to fish is sometimes called a “dink.” Next time you’re out bass fishing, refer to tiny catches as “dinks.” Best to let that dink go; it looks pretty small. There are some bigger fish over there."
