      "title": "Look for the signature curve in the \"R\" in the Prada logo.",
      "content": "Look for the signature curve in the \"R\" in the Prada logo. Find the Prada logo on the bag (which simply says “PRADA”) and look for a slight upward curve in the right leg of the “R.” If the leg is straight like a regular \"R,\" you may have a counterfeit bag. Aside from the shape of the letters, look for the phrases “MILANO” and “DAL 1913,” both of which should accompany the Prada logo. [1] X Research source Find anywhere the word Prada is printed or engraved on the bag to make sure the curved \"R\" is present in each spot. This includes extras like the dustbag if there is one or the authenticity card."

      "content": "Examine the triangle logo for the correct font, spacing, and color. The inverted triangle logo on the outside of a Prada bag is easily recognizable. Ensure that the letters are evenly spaced on the plaque and that the font matches all printing on the bag. On a genuine bag, the background color of the plaque will also match the color of the bag itself. [2] X Research source The plaque should be fastened securely to the front of the bag and not be falling off or skewed at all. The logo on a real bag will be easily readable, no matter how small the font is. While you're checking the font around the bag, check that all words are spelled properly."

      "title": "Look for uniformly-colored hardware that’s engraved with “Prada.”",
      "content": "Look for uniformly-colored hardware that’s engraved with “Prada.” Prada only uses high-quality gold and silver for its hardware, and they’ll never mix metal colors on a big. So, check that all of your bag’s hardware (e.g., zippers, clasps, feet, etc.) are all the same color. Different colors or finishes may mean that the bag is fake . [3] X Research source Likewise, check that all of the hardware is branded with the Prada name—if the logo is missing from the buckles, zippers, locks, or metal feet, you may have a fake bag. Not all real Prada bags have metal feet on the bottom of the purse or special accents like locks. Check the Prada catalog online to see if your model is supposed to."

      "title": "Check for high-quality zippers from LAMPO, YKK, Riri, Opti, or Ipi.",
      "content": "Check for high-quality zippers from LAMPO, YKK, Riri, Opti, or Ipi. Prada only uses zippers from reputable brands like LAMPO, YKK, Riri, Opti, and Ipi, so one of these brand’s names will be engraved on the back or side of the Prada bag zipper. If one of these brand names is absent from the bag’s zipper, it may be a fake (or the zipper has been replaced, indicating a used bag. [4] X Research source Due to the high quality of these zippers, they should work fairly easily. Open and close the zipper to see if it runs smoothly. Any snags, catches, or broken zipper pieces may indicate a counterfeit bag."

      "title": "Look for lining printed with Prada branding in an altering orientation.",
      "content": "Look for lining printed with Prada branding in an altering orientation. In a genuine Prada bag, the interior fabric will either be embossed Jacquard nylon fabric or Nappa leather. The fabric will have a pattern that alternates between the Prada brand name and the image of an unwound rope. However, the “Prada” text inside the bag should be stitched so that every other line appears upside down—if all of the branding is facing in the same orientation, your bag may be a fake.

      "title": "Ensure the logo plaque matches the fabric and reads “Prada Milano.”",
      "content": "Ensure the logo plaque matches the fabric and reads “Prada Milano.” Some bags have an interior logo plaque on the inside of the bag, and the details of this plaque can reveal whether your bag is genuine or a fake. However, not all Prada bags have the logo plaque, so check if your model is meant to have the plaque before proceeding with this step. If your purse should have an interior plaque, it should also: [6] X Research source Have a rectangular shape with rounded corners (unlike the triangular exterior plaque). Feature the words “Prada Milano.” It may also say “Made in Italy,” although some bags are now made in China. Be made of ceramic or leather—not plastic or cloth. Match the hardware and lining color of the bag. Be securely attached to the bag. If your inside logo plaque doesn’t fulfill any of these requirements, your bag may be a fake."

      "title": "Look for meticulous, color-matches stitches that angle upward.",
      "content": "Look for meticulous, color-matches stitches that angle upward. Real Prada Bags will have straight stitching that runs parallel to the seams with small, tight, and uniform stitches. Prada stitches are also angled slightly upward, creating a distinctive pattern for the authentic bags, and almost exactly matched to the color of the bag material. [7] X Research source You should not see any fraying or loose threads, which are fairly sure signs of a fake bag."

      "title": "Examine the Authenticity Card and Quality Assurance Tag.",
      "content": "Examine the Authenticity Card and Quality Assurance Tag. Prada bags come with two key items that assure their authenticity: the Quality Assurance Tag and Authenticity Card. The former is a small, white, square-shaped tag on the bottom seam of the bag’s interior pocket. It should have a small number on it, known as the purse factory number. [8] X Research source The Authenticity Card is a sealed card that should arrive with the bag inside of a black envelope embossed with the Prada logo. It will contain the serial number and purse style information for your bag. Fake bags may still have the tag and card as described above. Signs of forgery, however, include uneven spacing between the letters and numbers, slanted lines, low-quality printing, or a printed (not embossed) logo on the envelope. You can also attempt to verify the serial number printed on the authenticity card. Contact Prada via their website and fill out the contact form, writing a subject line like, \"Please verify the serial number of my Prada bag.\" Include the serial number in the body of the form. Alternatively, search the serial number on Google to make sure it matches your bag’s style or use a third-party authenticator like Entrupy ."

Prada bags can cost thousands of dollars due to the high-quality materials and skilled craftsmanship used to assemble the brand’s products. Even if a bag is being sold second hand, it could still cost upward of $800-1000 dollars. Search on Google for the model of bag that you’re looking at to see what they’re selling for—if a bag seems heavily discounted, it may signal a counterfeit item. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Check for a white dust bag with the Prada logo printed in black on it. A dustbag is a cloth covering similar to a pillow sham that protects a purse from dirt, sun exposure, and moisture. The font that’s on the dust bag will match the font on the Prada bag itself (the logo or the interior fabric font) if it’s a real bag. It will also have a drawstring. [11] X Research source There should be a label stitched in the dust bag that says \"Prada\" and \"100% Cotton Made in Italy\". Not all Prada bags come with a dustbag. If there isn’t one, ask the seller or search online to see if the model usually comes with a dust bag. Older purses may have a navy dust bag with Prada printed in gold."

Prada is a luxury fashion house with a firm set of traditions, which includes the manufacturing practices and materials that they put into their products. As a result, the methods for spotting a fake Prada wallet are nearly identical to spotting a fake Prada purse. That said, here are the main things to look for in a real Prada wallet: [12] X Research source Look: Prada wallets have a minimalistic aesthetic with sleek lines. Material: Durable and supple Saffiano leather with a uniform grain. Interior logo stamp: May be stamped with “Prada” and “Made in Italy.” If stamped, letters will be clean and legible. Zippers: Engraved with Prada logo on one side and the zipper brand (LAMPO, YKK, Riri, Opti, or Ipi) on the other. Stitching: Forms a straight line parallel to the bag’s seams, with individual stitches being angled slightly upward. Packaging: Arrives in a sturdy and textured black box, accompanied by a white cotton dust bag."
