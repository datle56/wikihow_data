      "title": "Choose a wired strap to ground yourself.",
      "content": "Choose a wired strap to ground yourself. There are 2 kinds of ESD straps â€“ those that have a cord or wire you use to connect yourself to a ground, and those that are wireless. However, testing performed by NASA revealed that the wireless straps were ineffective to prevent potential discharges. [1] X Research source You may consider a wireless strap more convenient, especially if you're working on a project at home informally. However, they put you and your components at risk. If you are going to use a wireless strap, make sure you're taking all other precautions to protect against electrostatic discharge."

      "title": "Wrap the ESD strap around your wrist.",
      "content": "Wrap the ESD strap around your wrist. Before you come into contact with ESD-sensitive items, put the ESD strap around your wrist and snap it closed. All parts of the strap should be in direct contact with your skin at all times. [2] X Research source Tug on the strap to make sure the clasp will hold tight and not come apart if the cord is jerked or pulled."

    {
      "title": "Attach the other end of the strap to a common ground.",
      "content": "Attach the other end of the strap to a common ground. At the other end of the cord attached to your wrist strap is an alligator clip that you can use to connect yourself to a common ground. At a static-free work station, a common ground point will be noted by a symbol that looks like a black-and-white target. There may also simply be a sign that says \"common ground.\" [3] X Research source If you don't see a sign or label, you can also simply look to see where all other items in the work station are attached. When in doubt, ask a supervisor or someone else working in the area."

      "title": "Clip your strap to a metal part if no common ground is available.",
      "content": "Clip your strap to a metal part if no common ground is available. If you're working at home or in an informal environment, you may not have a common ground point. In that case, snap the alligator clip to a metal part of the computer you're working on, such as the chassis of the computer or the power supply. Make sure the metal part that you clip your strap to is clean and unpainted. Painted surfaces are ineffective grounds."

      "title": "Wear your ESD strap whenever you're around ESD-sensitive items.",
      "content": "Wear your ESD strap whenever you're around ESD-sensitive items. Any time you are holding or working with computer components, such as motherboards or video cards, that are not installed in the computer case, keep yourself grounded. Otherwise, electrostatic discharge could damage those components. [4] X Research source A single electrostatic shock won't necessarily fry a component immediately, but it can damage it and cause poor performance. Multiple discharges can also have a cumulative effect."

    {
      "title": "Test the resistance value of your ESD strap periodically.",
      "content": "Test the resistance value of your ESD strap periodically. To properly protect against electrostatic discharge, an ESD strap should have a resistance value in the range of 1 to 10 Mohms. You can test resistance using a multimeter, a relatively inexpensive instrument you can order online or find in computer tech shops. [5] X Research source In clean rooms or highly protective environments, ESD straps are continuously monitored or tested daily. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Cover floors and work surfaces with ESD protective mats.",
      "content": "Cover floors and work surfaces with ESD protective mats. In addition to ESD straps, protective mats on floors and work surfaces prevent those surfaces from building up static and protect against accidental discharge. [7] X Research source For example, the friction of your shoes against a floor can build up static electricity. If you're standing on an ESD mat, you don't have to worry about that buildup damaging ESD-sensitive components. You can buy mat kits online from general online retailers, such as Amazon. They're also available at tech shops or computer hardware stores."

      "title": "Connect all work surfaces and fixtures to a common ground.",
      "content": "Connect all work surfaces and fixtures to a common ground. When building a static-free or ESD-protected work station, all fixtures and surfaces are connected to the same common ground, typically a metal pole or bar in a central location. The location is identified with a sign labeling it a common ground, so any new materials can easily be connected to it. [8] X Research source Only use electrical tools and equipment in a static-free work environment if they have a 3-prong grounded AC plug."

      "title": "Wear ESD lab coats when working with ESD-sensitive items.",
      "content": "Wear ESD lab coats when working with ESD-sensitive items. ESD lab coats are available through uniform supply companies and can be purchased online. Wearing one of these coats ensures ESD-sensitive components won't come into contact with your clothes, which can also build up static electricity. [9] X Research source If you wear an ESD lab coat, make sure the entire lab coat is closed to cover your clothing underneath. Fasten all snaps or buttons."

      "title": "Keep ESD-sensitive items in antistatic bags when you're not using them.",
      "content": "Keep ESD-sensitive items in antistatic bags when you're not using them. When working with ESD-sensitive computer components, make sure you have a supply of antistatic bags handy to store components that aren't installed in a computer chassis. You can buy resealable antistatic bags online from office supply stores or large general retailers. [10] X Research source Store ESD-sensitive items in the bags with the component side up. You can also use an antistatic card rack."

      "title": "Maintain humidity between 45 and 55 percent.",
      "content": "Maintain humidity between 45 and 55 percent. While too much humidity can damage computers, dry air promotes more static electricity. Humidity between 45 and 55 percent is a happy medium that minimizes static discharge while providing a healthy environment for computer components. [11] X Research source Humidity can be measured using a hygrometer. This instrument is relatively inexpensive and can be found online. If you need to adjust the humidity, use a regular humidifier or dehumidifier, depending on the type of adjustment you need."

      "title": "Avoid letting ESD-sensitive items touch your clothes.",
      "content": "Avoid letting ESD-sensitive items touch your clothes. Your clothes build up static electricity, especially in cold or dry environments. Because clothes aren't in constant contact with your body, wearing an ESD wrist strap does not prevent static buildup in your clothes. [12] X Research source Never wipe a component or circuit board on your sleeve or shirt to clean it. Use an antistatic cloth. When working with ESD-sensitive components, avoid wearing loose or open clothing that you can't control the movement of. Your clothing may touch a component accidentally."
