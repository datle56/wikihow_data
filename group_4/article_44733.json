      "content": "Understand the different phases of surgical treatment and recovery. There are three phases of surgical treatment – acute, recovery and maintenance. The first priority when it comes to surgery is to rule out any other life threatening injuries and to stabilize the affected area. Acute Phase – surgical stabilization is necessary at this point as well as the restoration of limb alignment. Traction is administered for initial stabilization to take place. Inter-medullary nailing is the treatment of choice. Recovery Phase – the goal here is to encourage immediate weight bearing tolerance, improvement of hip and knee range of motion, and strengthening of the affected area. Gait training and crutch use is done in this phase. Low extremity aerobic training such as biking, swimming, and the use of an elliptical trainer is necessary for as long as it is tolerated. Maintenance Phase - in this phase, weight bearing is permitted once complete healing has been achieved. Activities that can be done here include 30 to 45 minutes of bike riding in a flat surface. Walking for 3 to 5 miles (4.8 to 8.0 km) per week is also encouraged. Running can be done after 3 weeks then gradual return to usual training regimen. After surgery, physical therapy, discussed below, is needed in order to gradually restore function to the thighs. Usually, range of motion exercises and stretches are done to give strength to the broken femur. Gradual increase in physical activity is also considered."

      "title": "Be aware of when surgery will occur.",
      "content": "Be aware of when surgery will occur. If you are suffering from closed femoral fracture, the surgeon will wait until you become stable before conducting the surgery. However, for open fracture, an emergency surgery is done immediately to prevent infection. Surgery for a broken femur can last up to three or four hours."

      "title": "Look into internal fixation.",
      "content": "Look into internal fixation. Internal fixation is the choice surgery done to treat a broken femur. In this type of surgery, a cut is made to open the fracture, then internal fixator or special metal devices are used to hold the bone in place. Afterwards, a rod or a large nail is placed in the center of the femur to support the bone until it heals. Sometimes a plate is also placed next to the bone which is attached using screws in order to frame the outside of the leg. [3] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Metal plates and screws will reduce the risk of further complications from occurring due to displacement."

      "title": "Investigate external fixation to promote healing.",
      "content": "Investigate external fixation to promote healing. For external fixation, the surgeon will cut an opening to surgically place metal pins and screws into the bone above and below the fracture site. The pins and screws are attached to a bar outside the skin. This bar holds the bones together, when the skin and muscles have been injured, to promote healing. [4] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Pins are generally used when joints are not involved."

      "title": "Consider intra-medullary nailing to stabilize the area.",
      "content": "Consider intra-medullary nailing to stabilize the area. During intramedullary nailing, metal rods are inserted into the marrow canal of the bones through a small incision. They are then screwed to the bone at both ends. This procedure keeps the bone in its correct position during healing. This surgery provides strong, stable and full-length fixation."

      "title": "Use NSAIDS to reduce inflammation.",
      "content": "Use NSAIDS to reduce inflammation. NSAIDS contain analgesic, anti-inflammatory as well as antipyretic properties. These drugs act upon certain body chemicals to prevent the progress of inflammation during injuries. [5] X Research source Health care practitioners do not encourage intake of this drug for the first 48 hours of injury, to let the body follow its natural course of healing. The most commonly prescribed drugs to manage pain and swelling includes Celecoxib (Celebrex), Ibuprofen (Advil), and Naproxen (Aleve)."

      "title": "Request prescription painkillers if the pain of your broken leg is intolerable.",
      "content": "Request prescription painkillers if the pain of your broken leg is intolerable. In the case of a broken femur, pain can be severe and NSAIDS and other light pain medications are often insufficient. During consultation, healthcare providers generally address pain and inflammation. Prescription drugs, such as stronger painkillers, can be given to ease the sensation of pain and lessen the degree of inflammation. [6] X Research source Examples of prescription painkillers are codeine and tramadol. These painkillers are only prescribed if simple painkillers do not reach the desired level of pain reduction. Stronger types of painkillers must be taken at their proper dosage to avoid addiction and dependence."

      "title": "Consider using antibiotics.",
      "content": "Consider using antibiotics. Antibiotics may be necessary to avoid infection. Especially in the case of open femoral fracture and directly after surgery, antibiotics may be used to prevent infection of the site. The physician will first obtain a wound culture by getting a sample of wound discharge and getting it analyzed. If an infection is found, the physician will prescribe the right antibiotic. Open femoral fractures may occur from trauma cause by skin opening in the wound area."

      "content": "Inform your health care team of your injury. Let your primary care physician and your dentist know that there are rods and pins in your leg. This will allow your doctor and dentist to take any possible metal in your system into consideration when they are treating you for other ailments. Note that antibiotics should be taken before any kind of dental work is done, to reduce the risk of infection. Antibiotics are a prophylactic therapy done for as long as pins and rods are inside your body."

      "content": "Immobilize the limb. Stability of the femur must be maintained to prevent additional damage to the area and its surrounding tissues. Immobilization can be achieved by putting a splint and bandage on the affected area. Extreme activities and the application of too much pressure in the injured area should also be avoided to prevent further damage to the affected area. Avoid massage and other manipulation of the affected area until healing is complete."

      "content": "Apply a cold compress to reduce the risk of bleeding and swelling. Cold compress can usually be placed over the injured area to promote constriction of blood vessels that reduces the risk of bleeding and swelling. Compression also aids in stimulating the flow of lymph fluid, which carries important nutrients to the damaged tissues surrounding the injury. Lymph fluid also removes waste from cells and body tissues which are an important part of the tissue regeneration process. [9] X Research source (Hansen, K., 2013, June 6)"

      "content": "Try static quadriceps contraction. This is a low-stress exercise that is good as a starting point for strengthening. Lie on a flat surface with a towel under the affected leg. Start by tightening the front thigh muscles (quadriceps) by pushing the knee in a downward motion into the towel. Hold for 5 seconds. Place the middle and pointer finger on the inner quadriceps in order to feel the tightening of muscles. This will make sure that proper tightening is accomplished. Repeat tightening the front thigh muscles and holding them for 5 seconds for 10 repetitions."

      "title": "Know that exercise will help the healing process.",
      "content": "Know that exercise will help the healing process. Exercise and muscle movement promotes good blood circulation and oxygen distribution to the affected area. This will speed up the repair of the damaged tissue around the femur. This is because oxygen is essential for maintaining cellular integrity, function, and repair when tissues are injured. [13] X Research source (Youn, B., 2000/2001) Most femoral fractures take four to six months to completely heal. Even with proper treatment, the length of recovery will depend on the severity of the fracture and the presence of other injuries to the body."
