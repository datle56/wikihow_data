      "content": "Come up with 2 to 3 things you feel comfortable chatting about. You don’t have to prepare a script, but try to make a short list of fun, easy conversation topics to fall back on. You could talk about your hobbies, your job, your travel plans, or your recent projects. [1] X Research source Then, if you find yourself stumbling or the conversation is lulling, you can steer the topic toward something you feel comfortable talking about. For example, if you’re super into a new board game, you could ask the person you're talking to if they’ve ever played it. Or, if you just adopted a new pet, ask them if they have a dog and tell them about yours."

Hold your head up high and tell yourself that you aren’t nervous at all (because there’s no reason to be).

      "content": "Make eye contact and stand up straight. Let people know that you’re ready and willing to talk, even if you haven’t said much yet. You don’t have to keep eye contact 100% of the time, but it helps to glance up at the person you’re talking to every now and then. [3] X Research source If you’re standing, try to plant your feet in a wide stance and roll your shoulders back to maintain good posture. Reader Poll: We asked 7000 wikiHow readers about the biggest tells that someone doesn’t want to talk to you, and only 6% said having a distant body position . [Take Poll] So, it can be okay to keep your distance, but definitely keep your body language open and relaxed so people know you’re interested in talking!"

      "content": "Starting a conversation can be tough. If you want to chat with someone but you aren’t sure how to start, try catching their eye and smiling. If they get the message, they might just come over and start talking to you!

      "content": "These lulls are your chance to get a word in. If the conversation stalls for more than a few seconds, you can say something related to the previous subject or something completely random. You can also find common ground that might provide a good opening remark, like similar interests in a certain type of music. [5] X Research source The other person might also ask you questions to keep the conversation going."

      "title": "Start with small statements, noises, or exclamations.",
      "content": "Start with small statements, noises, or exclamations. This works especially well in large group conversations where it’s tough to make extended statements anyway. Consider saying, “Yeah,” or, \"You’re right,\" if you agree with someone. If you are not sure or are surprised, you might comment, “No way,” or, “Really?” [6] X Research source In a group setting, even laughing counts as contributing. It also still signals to others that you are an active listener."

      "content": "Large, loud groups tend to be a little harder to interject yourself into. If you’re at a party or a gathering and you’re in a group setting, try to raise your voice to be heard over the other people or the music. Use gestures and open body language to make it clear that you’re speaking. [7] X Research source During large, loud conversations, the rules of social engagement are slightly different. You may have to interject quickly after someone finishes talking so you get a chance, or you might have to raise your voice and continue talking if you start talking at the same time as someone else."

Try to stick with it, even if there are a few moments of silence every now and then. [12] X Research source Sometimes, people will go quiet if they aren’t sure how to end the conversation. If you’ve been chatting for a few minutes and you feel like the conversation is over, feel free to wrap it up."
