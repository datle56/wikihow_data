      "content": "Consider the age, health condition, and behavior of the child or elderly person. For babies younger than 3 months, taking the temperature rectally is most recommended. This is because their ear canals are too small to use an electronic ear thermometer in them. [2] X Research source For kids between three months and four years, you can use either an electronic ear thermometer to take the temperature in the ear canal, or use a rectal thermometer to take the temperature rectally. You can also use any digital thermometer to take an underarm (axillary) temperature, though this is less accurate. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source For kids older than age 4 who are able to cooperate, you can use a digital thermometer to take the temperature orally. You will need to consider, however, if they must breathe through their mouths due to stuffy noses, because this can cause an inaccurate temperature reading. If this is the case, then you can also use an electronic ear thermometer, temporal artery thermometer, or use the digital thermometer to get an underarm (axillary) temperature. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Similarly, for elderly adults, you’ll need to consider any uncooperative behavior or medical conditions that could interfere with obtaining a temperature reading to determine which method you should use. If getting a rectal or oral temperature reading is impractical, then the tympanic method (using an electronic ear thermometer) or temporal method may be used."

If you plan to use a digital thermometer for both oral and rectal temperatures, then buy two and label them accordingly. Also, never use a mercury thermometer, which is the glass kind that used to be used.

Review usage of your specific thermometer. Familiarization of the thermometer will aid in preventing prolonged insertion into rectum.
