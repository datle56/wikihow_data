      "content": "Contact your local SNAP office. Typically you cannot close your SNAP case online. The office may be willing to mail forms to you, but usually you must go to the office in person to request your case closed. Call the office and explain that you are moving to a different state and want to close your case. Follow their instructions so your case is closed properly. If your case isn't closed in your old state, it may be difficult to get benefits in your new state. Try to get the process started a week or two before you move. Although they should be able to close your case immediately, this gives you some time in case an issue arises."

You can find the SNAP office nearest you by going to https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory and clicking on your state. You can also call your state's SNAP hotline. The USDA has a list of these numbers available at https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-informationhotline-numbers . It might be helpful to look up any specifics for the state you've moved to.
