This can help your hair stay in place and give you even more volume. [1] X Research source This technique works best on wavy or straight hair types."

Typically, the right side of curtain bangs fall to the right and the left side falls to the left, creating that classic framing swoop. Get this look by grabbing the right side of your bangs with your round brush and flicking the hair away from your face at a right angle. Repeat on the left using a left angle. [4] X Research source Make sure to curl the hair away from your face to achieve a soft and swoopy look. [5] X Research source Who says your bangs have to flick out?

Let the “C” curls rest and cool on your face as you move to the right side of your bangs. [10] X Research source Make the outer section of hair on each side looser than the first.

Try using a curl-defining cream or oil all over your head before you style your bangs to help your waves hold. The roller size you use depends on your hair type.
