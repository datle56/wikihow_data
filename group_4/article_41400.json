      "title": "Store your headphones in a small case.",
      "content": "Store your headphones in a small case. If you do not have a case for storage, put them in a small pouch in your handbag or backpack so they can stay secured. Next time you use them, the cord will be wrapped rather than tangled. Grab each of the ends. Starting from the earbuds, wrap your headphones around three of your fingers if you have larger hands, or four fingers if you have smaller hands. Stop wrapping when there is 3 inches (7.62 cm) left. Take out the wrapped part carefully, making sure that it doesn't come apart. Wrap the remaining length of cord around the middle of the headphones. There should be enough cord left to wrap it around the headphones at least twice. Tuck the end in. Once the entire cord has been wrapped around the headphones and you run out of cord to wrap, tuck the end of the cord into the part that’s already wrapped around. Check that it's secured tightly enough."

      "title": "Wrap the headphones around an object.",
      "content": "Wrap the headphones around an object. Take a small object, such as a pencil, a hairbrush, or a candle holder, and wrap the cord carefully around. This will hold the headphones in place so that they won’t tangle when not in use. [1] X Research source Tuck the end of the cord into the final loop while wrapping the cord around your object. This will secure the cord and will also allow for easy removal from the object."

      "title": "Put your headphones in a small container.",
      "content": "Put your headphones in a small container. If you don't have a case, you can use a small jar, prescription bottle, or other container to hold your wrapped cord. This way, the headphone cords will be unable to tangle since the small space will keep them in place."

    {
      "title": "Purchase headphones with an anti-tangle cord.",
      "content": "Purchase headphones with an anti-tangle cord. These cords are usually flat or braided. This material makes it hard for headphones to tangle, no matter what position they're kept in. Try to feel the headphones before purchasing them. If they're stored in an enclosed box, look for the material or type on the box itself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a cord organizer.",
      "content": "Use a cord organizer. You can purchase a dedicated cord organizer from most popular retailers. These cord organizers usually have a place where you can wrap the cords along with a strap or clip that fastens the end of the headphones securely in place. This way, it won't unwrap while you're on the go."
    },
    {
      "title": "Braid",
      "content": "Braid another material over the cord. You can use embroidery floss or knitting yarn to cover the cord. If the braid is tight enough, it'll help keep the wire's structure and make it less likely to tangle. Make sure not to braid over the cord if it's damaged."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the headphones hang to uncurl them.",
      "content": "Let the headphones hang to uncurl them. If your headphone wire scrunches up and tangles itself, you'll need to uncurl them. Some material is more forgiving than others, so it may take some time for the cords to straighten. Hang your headphones from a hook or doorknob. Use your fingers to gently pinch the wire downwards. Repeat as necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Unplug your headphones from your device.",
      "content": "Unplug your headphones from your device. This will make the untangling process much easier as you can freely move the cord. Be sure to take your headphones off your head. Locate the ends that you put into your ears, often called the earbuds."

    {
      "title": "Spread the cord out on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Spread the cord out on a flat surface. This way, you will be able to examine the cord and find out where it is tangled. Obtain a pen or pencil, as you may need this if the knots are so tight that you cannot untangle them with your hands alone."

    {
      "title": "Pull the loose end to loosen the closest knot.",
      "content": "Pull the loose end to loosen the closest knot. Pull the knot apart with your fingers, in order to loosen the cord and allow for easier untangling. If you cannot use your hands, use the tip of a pen or pencil to separate the cords that are knotted. Work from the bottom up, since it is easier to untangle knots using a loose end."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the loose end of the cord through the tangled area.",
      "content": "Pull the loose end of the cord through the tangled area. This area should now look like hoop, which you can bring the rest of the cord through using your hands. Run the loose end of the cord underneath the knot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat these steps until each of the knots is untangled.",
      "content": "Repeat these steps until each of the knots is untangled. You may have to loop the loose end of the cord through several different knots before the entire cord becomes untangled. Be as patient with yourself as possible, since rushing the process can make the knots even worse. [2] X Research source"
