      "title": "Check for a supersized Adidas logo.",
      "content": "Check for a supersized Adidas logo. Fake Yeezys have something in common: they don’t use the correct sizes on their designs. If you're an Adidas or Kanye aficionado, you'll notice the logo takes up more space on a pair of counterfeit Yeezys. The same goes for the “YZY” logo printed on the shoe. Check the side of the shoe for Adidas’ famous trefoil design!"

      "title": "Look for the phrase \"Sample Made in China\" on the size tag.",
      "content": "Look for the phrase \"Sample Made in China\" on the size tag. If the label includes this, along with some extra information, including the shoe name, it's not a real pair of Yeezys. If the shoe is real, it will simply have \"Made in China,\" along with a bar code and the usual size and gender specifications and serial code."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for white text on the insoles.",
      "content": "Check for white text on the insoles. If a pair is fake, the text on both insoles will be white, and the words won't be mirror images of each other. The text should read “adidas YEEZY” with the Adidas trefoil in between. The insoles’ text should not be pure white but a dark gray that almost blends in with the background color. Insoles should be mirrored images of each other."
    },
    {
      "title": "See if the lettering says \"SPLV-350\" and doesn't line up correctly.",
      "content": "See if the lettering says \"SPLV-350\" and doesn't line up correctly. This text is incorrect and a sign of a fake pair of Yeezys. On counterfeit pairs, they use the letter \"V\" instead of the correct \"W.\" The letters on the fakes curve up while the real Yeezys go straight across."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for messy stitching.",
      "content": "Look for messy stitching. On a fake pair of Yeezys, the stitching is a messy criss-cross. The real ones have neat stitching that creates an “X” on both sides with a square separating them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Count the red dots on the heel tab.",
      "content": "Count the red dots on the heel tab. Fake Yeezys could have any number of dots, but real Yeezys have exactly 9 in the center box. The dots outside the rectangle don't count."
    },
    {
      "title": "See how the stripes on the inside of the heel tab blend in.",
      "content": "See how the stripes on the inside of the heel tab blend in. On fake Yeezys, the stripes look like they've been printed on."

    {
      "title": "Check the material’s quality.",
      "content": "Check the material’s quality. A quick way to verify the shoe’s authenticity is by judging the material. A fake pair of Yeezys has a softer fabric, making it easy to identify as a counterfeit. [1] X Research source The shoe’s tongue is another dead giveaway regarding its realness. A fake pair of Yeezy's soft material makes the tongue slouchier, while a real pair stands straight up."

      "title": "Ignore new Yeezys that cost less than $200.",
      "content": "Ignore new Yeezys that cost less than $200. Yeezys are certainly a luxury item, and their price reflects that. If the cost seems too good to be true, be wary: they’re likely counterfeit. Yeezy 500s will be released on July 7, 2018 and are listed for $200. Authentic, two-year old Yeezys are being resold for $1,500. [2] X Research source If you find a pair going for $100 and it's not on sale or clearance, don't buy!"

      "content": "Buy from reputable places. Yeezys are made in collaboration with Adidas, so to ensure you’re getting the real thing, shop from places you know carry Adidas and follow the company for updates. Adidas offers visitors to its site the option to sign up for updates regarding Yeezys."

    {
      "title": "Check the details of the box.",
      "content": "Check the details of the box. Don't assume you have the real thing when you get your order - its packaging says a lot! Fake Yeezys come in a rougher looking box, while real Yeezys come in smooth packaging with no visible edges. A fake pair of Yeezys won’t have the correct serial number on the box. Verify the shoes’ number with what is on the box to make sure you have the real deal. [3] X Research source"
