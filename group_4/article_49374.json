If you have a grievance against an attorney, you may want to write them a complaint letter or file a formal complaint with the state they practice in. While some states limit your ability to file a complaint against an attorney you have not hired, most states will allow you to file a complaint against any lawyer you believe has acted criminally or unethically. For example, in New York, you can make a complaint against a lawyer even if you have not hired them. [3] X Research source Also, in Washington, you can make a complaint against your present attorney, your past attorney, or even opposing counsel. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Know the types of complaints you can make. In general, you can make a complaint about any action your attorney takes that you believe is unethical or improper. Attorneys have to abide by a certain set of state mandated rules that govern the ethics of the practice of law. If an attorney breaches any one of these rules while representing you, you may want to consider making a complaint. While it can be difficult to know if an attorney is following the rules or not, the following are common examples of legitimate complaints: Your lawyer is holding money for you and will not return it to you or provide you with an accurate accounting of how it was spent; Your lawyer consistently does not respond to inquiries about your case, inform you of court dates, or appear in court; Your lawyer does not tell the truth or asks you to lie; Your lawyer fails to do what they say they will do or does not perform their duties in a timely manner."

While there are endless amounts of complaints you can legitimately make against your attorney, there are some topics that will typically not be entertained by your lawyer, a disciplinary board, or a court. If your lawyer's conduct does not rise to the level of an ethical violation, your complaint will be thrown out. You may not like what your lawyer does, but that does not necessarily mean you have a legitimate complaint against them. Generally, the following types of topics are not cognizable: Your lawyer's personal life (e.g., disagreements with neighbors, creditors, or spouses). Your belief that your lawyer generally did a bad job. [5] X Research source Your belief that your lawyer was rude. [6] X Research source Your lawyer made a single, honest mistake.

Oftentimes, an attorney will be happy to work with you to resolve your issue so it does not reach the state bar. [8] X Research source Also, your attorney may not know about your dissatisfaction, and if you write them a letter before filing a complaint, they may be able to fix it quickly and amicably. While this is your first option, if the informal complaint letter does not lead to the outcome you desire, you may have to file a formal complaint against your attorney."

Furthermore, Your letter should include the following information: Your contact information, so your attorney can get in touch with you. Also, you should request a response from the attorney within a specified period of time. [9] X Research source A clear statement of your complaint. This should be towards the top of your letter and should lay out exactly why you are dissatisfied. For example, if you believe the lawyer has lied to you, clearly state that you believe they have been dishonest. An easily understood statement of facts that back up your complaint. For example, if you believe your attorney has been dishonest with you, walk them through the facts that lead you to believe this. Include as much information as possible, including times, dates, and places. A request for relief. At the end of your letter, you should request some sort of relief that will satisfy you. Make sure the relief you ask for is reasonable, as an attorney will be much more likely to oblige if you do so. For example, if you believe your attorney has been dishonest with you, you may want a written apology and then you may want to find a new attorney to handle your case. Note here that you never need your attorney's permission to fire them; you can do this whenever you want. If your complaint is about money (e.g., excessive fees or the return of unused funds), you might ask for the funds back."
