      "title": "Scroll down to something you want to like.",
      "content": "Scroll down to something you want to like. Scroll through the posts in your News Feed until you find something worthy of your attention and affection. If you have a specific item that you want to like, type the name of the person who posted it into the search bar at the top of the page, then select their name, select their profile, and scroll down to the post. You can also like pages or businesses."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select the Like button.",
      "content": "Select the Like button. Tap or click the thumbs-up icon below the thing that you want to like. Doing so will \"Like\" it, which alerts the person who posted it that you liked their post. To revoke your like, just tap or click the Like button again."

    {
      "title": "Review other \"Like\" reactions.",
      "content": "Review other \"Like\" reactions. There are other \"Like\" options, such as a smiling face or a heart, that you can use to \"react\" to a post rather than simply giving it a thumbs-up. To do so: Mobile - Tap and hold Like until a menu with reactions pops up, then tap the reaction you want to use. Desktop - Hover your mouse over Like until a menu with reactions pops up above the Like button, then click the reaction you want to use."

    {
      "title": "Like comments.",
      "content": "Like comments. You can tap or click Like below a comment on a post to like it. You can also use reactions on comments the same way that you can use them for posts."

      "title": "Know what to look for.",
      "content": "Know what to look for. The Facebook \"Like\" button is generally depicted as a white \"thumbs-up\" icon on a dark-blue background. You'll find this button on social websites, product pages, and countless other places online. The Facebook \"Like\" button is different than the \"Post to Facebook\" button that you'll see around blogs and other social websites."

    {
      "title": "Find a site with a \"Like\" button.",
      "content": "Find a site with a \"Like\" button. Sites that use the \"Like\" button are generally smaller brands looking to gain more followers, so you're not likely to find the \"Like\" button on larger business pages."

    {
      "title": "Click the \"Like\" button.",
      "content": "Click the \"Like\" button. As long as you're signed into your Facebook account in your web browser, this will automatically add the business for which the \"Like\" button exists to your \"Liked Pages\" section on Facebook. If you aren't logged into Facebook, clicking the \"Like\" button will prompt you to enter your login details (e.g., your email address and password)."

    {
      "title": "Try using the \"Share\" button instead.",
      "content": "Try using the \"Share\" button instead. Most sites that post any kind of content will have a Facebook logo on a button somewhere above, below, or to the side of the content; this button is normally used for sharing the content to Facebook rather than liking the page for the website itself. To share content: Click the Share button (or the Facebook logo). Enter your Facebook email address and/or password if prompted. Add a message to the post if you like. Click Post"
