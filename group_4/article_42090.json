      "title": "Self-evaluate.",
      "content": "Self-evaluate. Before you even try out for a color guard, you need to be aware of all that goes into it, and you need to decide if this is something that you will enjoy. Many people go into color guard without even knowing what it is all about. If you enjoy dancing, being a part of a team, and can endure long practices, this is perfect for you!"

      "title": "Gain endurance.",
      "content": "Gain endurance. Believe it or not, color guard is a sport. They go to competitions with the band, and even do competitions on their own as \"winter guard\". The best thing you can do before even trying out is to develop your endurance. You can do this simply by jogging and then running if you are not already in shape. Now, it is not required by most color guards that you are physically fit, but it will help you so much during all of the practices and games. Another thing to do is to strengthen your wrists. Without strong wrists, you could possibly get injured by all of the flag work and have to wear a brace for a while."

      "title": "Go to auditions.",
      "content": "Go to auditions. Before you are in color guard, you will obviously need to try out for it. Don't be afraid to audition if you don't know the basics of the flag. The typical way they do auditions is to take four days to teach you the basics of flag work and teach you a short dance routine. On the fifth day, they will have you audition with a few other girls by doing what they taught you to do. The main thing they are looking for is not if you do it perfectly, but if you are teachable and really care about being in color guard."

    {
      "title": "Go to practice.",
      "content": "Go to practice. So you made the team? Good for you! Now the hard part begins....practice. For the first few weeks, typically during the summer, you will be practicing basics and developing endurance. This is usually done separately from the rest of the band until much later in the summer. Be prepared for some yelling and try not to let it bother you. Counting during routine run-thus will help you a lot."

    {
      "title": "Go through band camp.",
      "content": "Go through band camp. This is like practice x 100. After you have basically mastered the basics and have as much endurance as you are going to get, it is time to learn the routine for the show. That is what is done at band camp. There will be times when you are just with the color guard and times when you are learning positions on the field with the rest of the band. Make sure that you always have water, sunscreen, and a light snack on you. Another little warning for you, the very first time you do part of the routine with the band, don't let the drums or other instruments catch you by surprise."

    {
      "title": "Perform at football games.",
      "content": "Perform at football games. This is where the fun begins! After marching in, you will be in your own section of the stands with the band. This is just a fun time for color guard people because they don't have to worry about playing an instrument. There are usually little dances that you do in the stands while certain songs are played. If so, the older members of the color guard will show you. Halftime is your time to shine, so enjoy it! Many people get nervous when they first see all of the fans in the stands when they are on the field. Just remember that all of those people are just family, friends, and fellow students. You have worked too hard to not enjoy this!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Perform at competitions.",
      "content": "Perform at competitions. In this, you are basically doing the same thing as you would for a halftime show, but you will need to pay a little more attention to details. Even things as simple as how you step or facial expressions will need to be considered. Many of these judges have been in the band world for quite a while and have an eye for details. Don't let this bother you though, just remember everything you have been taught. Also, if you run into some competition, don't be mean. Show some class by being nice to all of the competitors."

      "content": "Deal with drama. You may run into some drama along the way. Make sure you are not the one causing it. Even if you are really miffed at a fellow member, don't do something stupid like mess with their belongings. Not only will you get in trouble, but band directors like to punish the color guard as a whole so that the other members will make sure it doesn't happen again. If you are being bothered by someone else in the band and it is threatening you in any way, don't just allow it to continue. You need to either talk to the band director, the color guard instructor, or your parents."

      "content": "Breathe to self-calm. Anyone can learn how to spin a piece of equipment. However, when the breath is incorporated into the work you are given, it can make it much more consistent and graceful! Breathing also helps to calm you down, so whenever you have a chance to take a breath in between segments or right before a show, take deep and slow breaths to regain your calm. When you're nervous, you are much less likely to do well."
