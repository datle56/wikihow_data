      "title": "Arms",
      "content": "Arms Different parts of the arm represent different personalities, aesthetics, and spiritual meanings. Energetically, your arms represent what you want to embrace, so the arm may be a good place to tattoo something that you want to metaphorically hold on to. Arms are an incredibly popular spot for tattoos since this area hurts a lot less than other placements, and most arm ink can easily be hidden with long or half sleeves. [1] X Research source Small upper arm tattoos, for example, often mean that you have a pragmatic personality. You want something that you can both exhibit and cover when needed. The forearm, on the other hand, can’t be covered with short sleeves. You’re probably proud of your design work and want to show it off! Full and half-sleeves are a step up from your typical arm tat. A half sleeve is great if you have a balanced personality and want to both express creativity while considering how a tattoo may affect your environment and future goals. If you have a full sleeve , you’re probably a loyal person who likes to see things through. The exact arm you choose can also affect its possible significance. The right arm is spiritually associated with attacking, action, and impulsive energy. The left arm represents a protective shield that’s linked to the heart and emotions. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Ankles and feet",
      "content": "Ankles and feet Foot and ankle tattoos are a common choice since they’re both discreet and easy to show off whenever you feel like it (aka in some nice sandals when the weather’s nice!). Personality-wise, you may be relatively introverted, wise, and reserved if you choose one of these tattoos, as they don’t draw much attention. You might also choose an ankle placement to honor a person or pet that you’ve lost. Energetically, ankles represent balance and support, so they’re a great place to honor something or someone that keeps you grounded. According to many spiritual beliefs, the feet and ankles represent someone’s “root” that keeps them safe, stable, and grounded. They may also indicate your primary link to Earth and how you move through it. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Wrist Wrist tattoos are popular for a number of reasons. You may not be ready for larger pieces on more exposed body parts, but still want a tattoo that you can see regularly—thus, the wrist tattoo! Wrist tattoos often indicate a sentimental personality—the design may represent someone or something you love so that you can just glance down at it at any time. [4] X Research source If you’re a survivor of depression or self-harm, you might choose a wrist tattoo to adorn or cover up any scars. Transforming these scars into a work of art can represent how you’ve overcome hardship and fought to find yourself in a better place."

      "title": "Ears",
      "content": "Ears Ear tattoos are a stylish and decorative statement that can say a lot about your personality. Practically, ear tattoos are a popular choice because they’re easy to hide if you have long hair, but they’re also easy to show off whenever you want to. Ear tattoos may also show off your creative personality if you’re an artistic person who chooses to place a music note or other symbol around your ear. [5] X Research source However, it’s a great spot for other small and delicate symbols! Ear tattoos are also connected to hearing and communication. Spiritually, an ear tattoo may mean that you’re open to spiritual messages and are willing to understand others. Ears are often believed to energetically open you up to guidance and listening. So, the exact theme or symbolic meaning of your design may also represent what influences you’re listening to in life."

      "title": "Ribcage and stomach",
      "content": "Ribcage and stomach Your ribcage and stomach are very intimate and vulnerable parts of your body—plus, they’re some of the most painful areas to get tattooed. So, the designs you choose to tattoo on your ribcage and stomach may show your innermost and most intimate self. Symbolically, the belly and abdominals may exude an energy related to sexuality, gut instinct, or the things that nourish and energize you. [6] X Research source These tattoo placements are also associated with strong and creative personalities, as they show that you’re willing to endure a lot of pain for art that you love. Despite the pain level, however, the ribs and stomach are great for your first tattoos since they can easily be hidden and shown off at will."

      "title": "Back",
      "content": "Back The back is the largest blank canvas on the body, so it’s usually used for pieces of art that are very important to you. If you have a back tattoo, you may have a very stable and strong personality, but you still prefer a tattoo that can be hidden when needed. Back tattoos may be a way to tell a specific story with your tattoo, enhance your appearance, or even highlight muscles. Lower back tattoos, in particular, are a great way to express sensuality, confidence, femininity, and strength. [7] X Research source Back tattoos have a lot of important spiritual meaning, as they’ve been important to various cultures throughout time. For instance, large Japanese back tattoos have traditionally been used to show strength. [8] X Research source Other schools of thought argue that back tattoos energetically represent memories or values that you’ve moved past or want to leave behind. Tattoos on the spine, in particular, may symbolize lasting values or past experiences that still influence you."

      "title": "Chest and shoulders",
      "content": "Chest and shoulders Getting a tattoo on your chest or shoulders is a sign that this design is incredibly important to you—after all, the chest and torso is meant to be energetically linked to your most private self. If the tattoo sprawls across your whole chest, you’re probably very confident and aren’t concerned about the attention and power that this tattoo may bring you. If the tattoo is centered on the left side of your chest (close to your heart), it may represent something that’s close to your heart, like a symbol or name that belongs to someone you love. [9] X Research source In general, chest and torso tattoos can feel very vulnerable, so it’s a great place to get something personal, like an angel number or important date. Shoulders , specifically, may energetically represent the burdens you carry through your life. If you’re a breast cancer survivor, you might choose a chest tattoo to complement your mastectomy scars. In this case, these art pieces represent beauty, strength, perseverance, and bravery. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Legs If you choose to get a tattoo on your leg, you probably have a lot of body confidence or are aspiring to feel more comfortable in your own skin. You may feel like you shouldn’t have to hide that part of your body—especially if the placement is around your upper thigh—or maybe you even specifically designed the tattoo to enhance your leg muscles! According to their spiritual energies, legs are all about the journey that your life is on. Your right leg starts new journeys (sometimes impulsively) while the left leg follows behind the right leg with more experience and wisdom. Tattoos on the left leg may also symbolize the end of a journey, while the lower part of your leg (like the calf or shin) represents what you’re working or moving towards."

      "content": "Buttocks, hips, and genitals Tattoos on or around the buttocks, hips, and genitals often represent your playful or sensual personality. Traditionally, tattoos in these areas were believed to spiritually enhance the fertility and sensual energy of the wearer. [11] X Research source So if you have a tattoo between your lower torso and legs, you may be more filled with joy, playfulness, creativity, and sensuality than others!"

      "content": "Hands and fingers Hand and finger tattoos are pretty small, but they’re also hard to hide! Finger tattoos, in particular, became pretty trendy around the 2010s—however, they often fade fast so aren’t a great spot for meaningful tats. [12] X Research source When it comes to personality, hand and finger tattoos may show that you’re classy, elegant, or conservative with a hint of rebellion. Or, you want a way to express yourself without making a huge commitment. Symbolically, hands represent action, creativity, and the transformation of dreams into reality. Some people believe that getting tattoos on your hands can improve your overall well-being and health. [13] X Research source A tattoo on your right hand may also symbolize the things that you give to others, while tattoos on your left hand may represent what you receive. Similarly, each finger can actually have a different meaning and energy. In astrology, for instance, each finger aligns with a different planetary force—so if you’re an astrology lover, your tattoo may carry this meaning for you!"

Often, they indicate that you have an extremely bold and courageous personality and you don’t care about the judgment of others. Some people believe that the tattoos you put on your face show the energy that you're putting out into the universe. Face tattoos are also associated with intelligence and consciousness, so they may indicate your desire for personal growth and transcendence past life challenges. [14] X Research source Certain parts of the face may also have specific meanings. For instance, eye tattoos may symbolize insight, nose tattoos may indicate balance, and mouth tattoos may represent communication and mindfulness. In some cases, you may have a face tattoo due to gang or prison affiliations. While these face tattoo placements and their meanings can vary, some common ones include a teardrop or three dots near the eye. The teardrop tattoo under the eye can represent a long prison sentence or that the wearer has committed murder. The three dots around the eye also has various meanings—it may represent the Holy Trinity in the Christian faith, or it may indicate a general association with “gang life.” [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider how visible you want your tattoo to be. The visibility of your tattoo will also influence the potential size and location of your design. Start by considering how visible you want your tattoo to be—if you want a hidden tattoo, choose a concealed spot like your torso, upper thighs, back, upper arms, or feet. Then, consider how big or detailed you want a tattoo to be—if you want a small tattoo, it can’t be as detailed, but if you want a large tattoo, you’ll have to choose a larger area. A good tattoo artist will likely inform you if your tattoo design and placement aren’t compatible, but you can also follow the guide below: [19] X Research source Small tattoos can be simple designs with basic shapes. Possible placements include the wrist, back of the palm, top of the foot, fingers, ankles, behind the ear, above the elbow, and knee. Medium tattoos can be flash tattoos, script tattoos, and any relatively simple design that can fit on a long and skinny area. Possible placements include the forearm, calves, shins, neck, shoulder, upper arm, inner thigh, and sternum. Large tattoos can be more detailed tattoos with more elements. Possible placements include the upper thigh, upper back, lower back, chest, stomach, hip, and ribs. Extra large tattoos can be more expansive pieces of work designed with the tattoo artist. Possible placement options include a full arm sleeve, a full leg sleeve, a chest and stomach piece, and a full back piece."

      "content": "Consider how the tattoo will lay on your body. Some people like to take into account the shape of their body when choosing a tattoo, although this step isn’t at all required. Some people prefer larger designs that emulate strength and help to define their muscles. Often, these pieces require placements like an arm sleeve or a neck, calf, chest, or back tattoo. [20] X Research source Others choose tattoo placements that highlight their body’s natural curves. For example, a larger tattoo may wrap around the hip and thigh or curve around the chest. For smaller tattoos, some individuals opt for placements that make their ink resemble jewelry. For instance, wrist tattoos = bracelets, sternum tattoos = necklaces, ankle tattoos = anklets, and finger tattoos = rings."

If you have a low pain tolerance or are brand new to getting tattoos, you may want to stay away from large tattoos or particularly painful placements (e.g., the ribs, armpits, or other bony spots). Unless you really have your heart set on a certain placement, consider sticking to less painful areas like the thigh, outer bicep, or forearm. [21] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider your future with this tattoo.",
      "content": "Consider your future with this tattoo. You might have career plans, physical goals, or even future tattoo plans that can influence your current placement. For instance, despite the fact that mainstream attitudes toward tattoos are changing, “hand, neck, and face tattoos are ‘job stopper’ tattoos,” says professional tattoo artist Burak Moreno. As Moreno goes on to advise, “it’s very important to think about where you work or are planning to work in the future” before getting a high-visibility tattoo. “Job-stopper” tattoos may even affect the way you are treated by others, including security guards, police officers, and other authority figures. Alongside career goals, you might have future plans to make changes to your body. While all bodies naturally change over time, major changes like weight loss, pregnancy, or significant muscle gain may warp the tattoo design in areas like the stomach, hips, upper arms, and upper legs. Lastly, consider any plans you have for getting larger tattoo pieces in the future. If you want a full sleeve in the future, for instance, avoid getting smaller tattoos dotted on your arms. These tattoos will make it harder to get a cohesive sleeve later on."

      "content": "Get inspiration from common tattoo design and placement pairings. While you can definitely get your tattoo anywhere on your body that you like, you may be unsure about where your design will look best! For instance, a swirling vine design may look best wrapping around your thigh or on a long and narrow area like your forearm. If you haven’t decided what kind of tattoo you want or where you want it placed, check out this list of some of the most common combinations of designs and placements: Ear tattoos: Possible placements on the earlobe, behind the ear, or on the cartilage. Try delicate and tiny designs, like a music note or wrapping vine. Neck tattoos: Possible placements on the nape or front of the neck. Try small and dainty or large but moderately-complex designs, like geometric patterns or cursive script. Shoulder tattoos: Possible placement on the shoulder blade or draping across the shoulder. Try large floral designs or angel wings. Chest tattoos: Possible placements on one pectoral muscle, on the sternum, over the heart, or across the entire chest. Try a floral wrap or outstretched wings on the sternum, an animal face on the pec, or a special someone’s name over the heart. Arm tattoos: Possible placements on the upper arm or forearm. Try a sticker tattoo or geometric design on the upper arm and a large script tattoo or floral design on the forearm. Thigh tattoos: Possible placements on the upper or inner thigh. Try “wrapping” tattoos that work their way up to the hip bone, like florals, snakes, and other long and slender pieces. Finger tattoos: Possible placements on the top or side of the finger. Try tiny pieces of script or very small symbols. Ankle and foot tattoos: Possible placements on the top of the foot or side of the angle. Try flowers, quotes, and small characters."

      "content": "Research the cultural significance of a tattoo before getting it. Tattooing is an ancient art and tradition that traces its origins to many cultures across many centuries—the first recorded tattoo was done around 3300 BCE in the Ötztal Alps. [22] X Trustworthy Source The Smithsonian Institution Leading group of museums and research institution funded by the U.S. government Go to source Whatever your cultural or spiritual background and beliefs, it’s a good idea to thoughtfully choose an appropriate tattoo design and carefully consider the right placement for you. In particular, do your research before getting a tattoo that’s related to a culture you’re not connected to. For instance, you might be interested in a Buddha statue, African tribal print, or Native American totem symbol—if you have no cultural or ethnic ties to these cultures, their designs may not be appropriate for you to wear. It’s important to remember that there’s no one meaning for every tattoo design or placement. What a specific tattoo and placement mean to you may be very different to what it means to another person. People who have cultural or heritage connections to certain regions of Africa, for example, may view tattoos and their placements as a way to indicate tribal belonging. [23] X Research source In mainstream North American culture, however, tattoos are often imbued with less specific meaning, so silly tattoos like food, cartoon characters, and pop culture references are more common."
