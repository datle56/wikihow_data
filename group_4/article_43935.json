      "title": "Front knot",
      "content": "Front knot At the bottom center of the shirt, along the hemline, bring your index finger and thumb together to make an “O” shape. Slide the hem of your shirt through the O until the fit is snug around your waist. Tighten your thumb against the fabric, then wrap the tail around your index and middle fingers to form a loop. Pull the tail through the loop, then tug on it to tighten the knot. [1] X Research source Tuck the tail end under the knot to hide it, if you like. Use a baggy or oversized T-shirt. The longer and looser the shirt is, the more fabric you will have to work with. This will make tying the knot easier! Styling tip: Consider wrapping a scarf or bandana around your knot. Let the ends hang loose for some flair, or keep wrapping until the whole knot is hidden by the scarf."

      "title": "Smooth front knot",
      "content": "Smooth front knot You may have seen this T-shirt knot hack on TikTok recently. To make a knot that looks less “knotty,” cross your arms in front of your body and grab some fabric from the hemline of your shirt in both hands, keeping 2 fingers on both hands inside the shirt. Uncross your arms so that the bunches of fabric are pulled into an “X” shape. Twist the “X” so that the bunches cross a second time. [2] X Research source Then, use your fingers inside the shirt to “open” the bottom bunch of fabric and pull it over the twist and the upper bunch of fabric. The result is a “smooth”-looking layer of fabric on top of your knot."

      "title": "“Bunny ears” knot",
      "content": "“Bunny ears” knot Gather two sections of your shirt along the bottom hemline in front of each of your hips, one section in each hand. Cross the left “bunny ear” over the right one, then pull it under and up through the gap—just like tying a pair of shoes. Pull on both “ears” to tighten the knot."

    {
      "title": "Back knot",
      "content": "Back knot For this style, you’ll use the same process as a front knot—just in the back! Gather the T-shirt material along the hemline and bring it through the “O” shape made by your thumb and pointer finger. Then, tie your knot against your lower back. Yes, it’s a bit trickier working behind your back, but you’ll get the hang of it with a little practice! [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Side knot",
      "content": "Side knot Like the back knot, this is another variation on a classic front knot. Choose either hip and gather some fabric along the hemline just in front. Make an “O” with your index finger and thumb and pull the excess fabric through. Tie off the knot and you’re good to go! [4] X Research source Styling tip: For a more playful variation, try making 2 smaller knots on each side. This makes it easier to adjust the height of your hemline—the higher the knots, the more cropped the shirt will look. Belt loop variation: Instead of tying the gathered shirt material, feed it through the belt loop of your pants on that side, pointed toward your back. Then, bring the “tail” of material forward and tuck it into your pants near the front. This creates a classy knot feature right along the top line of your pants."

      "title": "Rubber band “knot” (no tying required)",
      "content": "Rubber band “knot” (no tying required) Gather the fabric along your hemline in one hand, like you’re going to do a front knot. Instead of tying the knot, though, just tighten a small rubber band or hair tie around the gathered fabric, right up against your body. Tuck the loose “tail” of fabric and the rubber band up and under your shirt. [5] X Research source You can do this knot in the front, to the side, or in the back. Styling tip: After adding the rubber band, tie your favorite silk scarf over top of it. Tuck the shirt fabric “tail,” the rubber band, and the knot of the scarf under your shirt, leaving the ends of the scarf hanging down. This adds a nice pop of color and visual interest to your look!"

      "title": "Ruffled front (visible knot)",
      "content": "Ruffled front (visible knot) Do a “bunny ears” knot here, but instead of gathering the material along the hemline, go part way up the shirt. Gather the two “ears” just about at the bottom of your ribcage on one side, then tie them off as normal. This higher knot causes the fabric to ripple out from an off-center spot in the front of the shirt. [6] X Research source This one definitely works best with a loose shirt made of a stretchy material. It’s harder to gather the “ears” higher up on the shirt than along the hemline."

      "title": "Ruffled front (hidden knot)",
      "content": "Ruffled front (hidden knot) Make an “O” shape with your thumb and index finger, then put your hand under your shirt, against your stomach to one side of your belly button. Put your other hand under your shirt and use it to pull some fabric through the “O” until the fit is snug. Tighten your fingers around the fabric, then wrap a rubber band or hair tie around it, right up against your fingers. Let go of the fabric when you are done. [7] X Research source The tighter you make the shirt, the further up from the hem you'll need to go. You don't want the “tail” (the material you pulled through the “O”) to hang down below your hemline."

      "title": "Pretzel knot",
      "content": "Pretzel knot The pretzel knot works great for oversized shirts that you want to hit just above your waist. Grab the bottom of your shirt by the sides with both hands (if it’s extra long, roll up the shirt a little bit first). Bring both sides to the center and cross one end over the other like you’re starting a knot. Place one of the ends through the loop you just made, then pull both ends in opposite directions to tighten the knot. [8] X Research source Leave the ends out or tuck them inside the knot for a more polished look."

      "title": "Criss-cross shirt tie (no tying)",
      "content": "Criss-cross shirt tie (no tying) This tucked-in look makes it look like your shirt is knotted when it actually requires no tying at all! Like with the pretzel knot, start by crossing your arms in front of you and grabbing both sides of your shirt at the bottom. Then, cross the sides over and simply tuck the ends underneath your shirt. Ta-da! If you’re struggling to keep the “knot” in place, try rolling the bottom of your shirt once or twice to help secure it. This works best with fairly baggy T-shirts. More fitted shirts with less excess fabric will tug and pull at the “knot.”"

      "title": "Crop top knot",
      "content": "Crop top knot It’s easy to turn a baggy T-shirt into a cute crop top with a simple front knot! First, roll up your shirt from the bottom and stop when you get to the length you want for your crop top. Then, gather the excess fabric in front and tie a front knot or use a hair tie to secure it in a knot or tail. [9] X Research source You can leave the knot showing front, or you can tuck it underneath your shirt (or into a sports bra) to hide it. You can make your crop top as low or high as you like! Generally, it looks best if the crop is just above your waist or higher."

      "content": "Open-back tuck and knot This is a great style to keep your back cool during the hot summer months. First, tuck the back of your T-shirt upward under your bra strap. You may need to fold the fabric once (or a few times) to get it to lay smoothly. Gather the loose fabric in the front and knot it on one side (like a side knot). Loosely tuck in the front of the shirt for an effortlessly chic look. Or, if it’s really hot out, make a front knot instead of a side knot and tuck it into your bra to make a crop top!"

      "content": "Classic bottom knot A sleek tie in front of a button-down is elegant enough to wear to work and stylish enough to wear during a night out on the town. First, put on your short- or long-sleeve button-down shirt. Then, image consultant Kalee Hewlett says to “undo the last few buttons on your long, oversized shirt and tie the ends into a knot at the front center.” She adds that this looks great with “a high-waisted denim jean or short.” [10] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 Mar 2021. Styling tip: “For a more summery look, wear a strapless bra underneath and pull the neckline of the shirt down over the shoulders and finish with a knot tied at the front,” Hewlett advises. “This creates a very cute off-the-shoulder summer look and works great with wide-leg palazzo pants and maxi skirts.” [11] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 Mar 2021. Alternatively, you can leave the top 1 to 2 buttons undone to show off some cleavage."

Use your right hand to hold the gap between your bottom 2 buttons open, then pull the left end of the shirt through the gap. Then, pull the right side of the shirt over the left side and through the same gap. [12] X Research source Pull the ends snug and let them hang down for an effortless style."

Starting at about the middle button of the shirt, button it both up and down—the button above the middle button, the button below the middle button, etc.—until the shirt feels snug. Wrap the sleeves around to your front, and tie them into a bow right under your bust. [13] X Research source You can leave the collar sticking out against your back or tuck it in. Tuck the shirt into a high-waisted skirt or a pair of high-waisted pants to complete the look."

This time, however, pull both sleeves up in front of your shoulders and behind your neck. Tie them into a sturdy knot. [14] X Research source You can leave the collar sticking out, or you can tuck it into the shirt, out of sight. To switch things up a little, position the knot over your left or right shoulder instead of against the back of your neck."

Then, rotate it so that the buttons are in the back and the collar is in the front. Pull the sleeves in front of you, right under the bust or over the stomach, and tie them into a double-knot. [15] X Research source Leave the collar out on top and folded over. It makes a nice design element along the neckline of the dress. You can use a regular-sized button-down shirt, but you'll end up with a mini dress instead because of how short it is!"

Tie-front shirts are great for accentuating your waist—especially when the knot isn’t super bulky or messy-looking. For a complementary tie, follow these steps: [17] X Research source Hold the left tie in your left hand and the right tie in your right hand. Cross the left tie over the right tie, then bring the tip of the left tie through the gap in the center. Pull the ties until they’re comfortably snug. Cross the right tie over the left tie, then pass it under the left tie and pull it through the gap. Adjust the edges of the knot until it lies smoothly, and let the ties hang down flat against your body."
