You want the touches that are more charged, and less \"friends.\" [1] X Expert Source Eddy Baller Dating Coach Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. Friendly pat-on-the-back touch means that he’s comfortable and friendly with you, but not necessarily flirting. Likewise, high-fives, fist bumps are more likely a friendly action than a flirtatious gesture. A lingering hand touch or a hug that goes on a little longer than with his friends are more likely to be signs of flirting, or that he's interested in you."

      "content": "Look at how he’s sitting or standing. People tend to subconsciously mirror the actions of those that they like. When you're with him, notice if he mirrors your actions, such as taking a sip of coffee a few moments after you do and so on. [4] X Research source Notice things like: is he seated facing towards you? Does he make sure to keep in your line of sight so he can look at you? Does he lean forward when you speak? If he’s facing away or looking elsewhere, turning away in a middle of the conversation, crossing arms or legs and pulling back, probably he’s not flirting with you."

      "title": "See if he teases you.",
      "content": "See if he teases you. Gentle teasing can be a big part of flirting, so a guy who is teasing you is probably trying to flirt with you. This means teasing you about something you're doing, or making jokes about your terrible sense of direction, for example. He might also make jokes around you more often than normal, because he's trying to get your attention by making you laugh. This could be anything from making bad puns to making gentle fun of himself (his bad sense of direction). Make sure that he isn’t saying mean or hurtful things. Teasing shouldn’t make you feel bad about yourself. He might be trying to flirt, but he's not doing it in a very kind way. Give this sort of guy a pass."

      "content": "See if he asks dangling questions. These are the kinds of questions that keep you talking, as well as see if he can hang out with you more, or flirt with you more. Pay attention to whether he drops these into the conversation. A couple examples of dangling questions are: “So you’re single because…” or “You’re doing what this weekend…” These questions indicate his interest in your relationship status or whether or not he can see you, but in a flirtatious manner."

He's not going to be busy all the time, he'll make time for you. Even if he's shows his interest by ignoring you, he'll make sure to be ignoring you in person. Remember, it's hard to flirt if he’s not even there. If he's never around, he's not likely to be flirting with you. Even if he's not physically around, he'll make his presence felt by sending texts, calling you, and making sure to show up at the same things you’re going to."

When he's doing or saying something \"cool\" he'll make sure to check in to see if you're paying attention to how awesome he is. See if he tries to outdo his friends when he’s around you. He outdoes them in terms of the cool things he's done, he wants to outdance them on the dance floor (and show you what a good dancer he is), he wants to try out that new bike trick."

      "content": "Pay attention to whether he laughs at the things you say. A guy who likes you is going to laugh at your hilarious comments (even if they aren't that funny, especially if they aren't that funny). Your flirty banter is going to make him laugh, if he's into you. Just remember, mean laughter is not a good sign. He can laugh at you when you're acting silly, but if his laughter hurts, run away from that guy. You don't want to flirt, or do anything else, with that guy."

      "title": "Notice if he is thoughtful towards you.",
      "content": "Notice if he is thoughtful towards you. Again, a guy who is interested is a guy who is paying attention. If he's acting very kindly towards you, doing nice things for you, helping you out, there's a definite chance that he might be interested (especially depending on the types of things). For example: if he brings you flowers, or a little something because he thought of you (even if it's something silly), that's a very good sign. He also might do something like bring you soup when you’re sick. It shows that he's thinking of you and it shows that he's willing to help you out, especially if it's out of his way."

      "content": "Observe how he treats you. This is a big one. A guy who has a flirty personality might be flirting with you, but that might be how he treats everyone. A guy who is looking to flirt with you because he's interested in you is going to treat you differently than he's going to treat other people, especially his friends. For example: even if he’s giving lingering hand touches and flowers, if he’s doing that for all the ladies or gentlemen, then he might be flirting, but that’s simply how he operates. It’s probably not specific to you."

If you're having an argument with someone, or someone is being mean to you, see if the guy takes this as his cue to help you out. If someone is hurting your feelings does he step in? Even if he was teasing you earlier? This is a good sign that not only is he interested, but it goes beyond simply flirting."
