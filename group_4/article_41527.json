      "content": "Store books long-term in plastic bins. If you've got more books than you know what to do with, the best place to store them is in opaque plastic tubs that you can seal and store in a cool location. Plastic tubs help to protect books from sunlight, rodents, and other conditions, and are easy to stack in out-of-the-way locations. If you don't need to access your books regularly, plastic tubs are a good choice. Most retailers sell a variety of storage bins, in various sizes. Try to get relatively small boxes, no bigger than 12 x 12 in., or the bins will become quite heavy. It's fine to store these books anywhere the temperature will be consistent and cool. Attics and garages will be fine in certain climates. Polyurethane plastic tubs should protect books adequately from insects and rodents who might chew up books."

      "content": "Find an appropriate space for storing your bins of books. Got more books than you've got shelves? Finding a spot for all those old paperbacks can be tough. But with the right storage techniques, you can find places for them. Store book bins underneath the bed, at the backs of closets, or in the basement. [1] X Expert Source Caitlin Jaymes Closet Organizer & Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 16 December 2019. Try to store books indoors, if you can. Exposed attic spaces, sheds, and garages can have drastic temperature swings, which can be rough on the binding and paper. Consider renting a storage space in your town for storing books. If you have a lot of books, an indoor storage facility might be temperature-controlled and appropriate for some old boxes of books, while outdoor garages might be fine for your old paperbacks."

      "content": "Keep books in rooms with relatively low humidity. In very hot climates, books can start to warp. Ideally, you should keep the relative humidity around 35%. Humidity causes binding to warp, paper to curl, pages to mould and books to suffer. Ideally, you want to keep your books stored long-term in a climate-controlled room, kept around 35% humidity. Good dry air circulation is good for books. Anything lower than 50-60% should be okay for most books, but rare or valuable books should always be stored around 35%, indoors. If you're really particular about keeping your books safe, though, Try to keep it even lower if possible."

To protect the binding of your books, keep them stored in relatively cool temperatures. In most climates, a room temperature of 60-75 degrees is perfectly fine.

      "content": "Reduce exposure to direct light. Soft room lighting won't affect the quality of books much. But hard, direct sunlight will always serve to bleach out and damage the binding and the page-quality of books.

If your books are very dusty, it may be good to use a small hand-vac, or the tube function on your regular vacuum cleaner to gently suck the dust out of the hinge in the binding. Run the vacuum over the top of the books while they're still stacked to get the most dust out of there, before you go back over them individually with a cloth.

Old milk crates or other boxes of various sizes can be reclaimed, then stacked in various patterns to fit the space that you have. Stack book crates on the side, rather than bottom-up, so you can stack your books as if they were in a bookshelf. This makes them easy to access and peruse. Think of it as a DIY bookshelf. Crates allow you to organize your books into micro genres, keeping your cookbooks in one crate and your novels in another, putting them in adjacent spaces and rooms if necessary. They're also movable."

[8] X Expert Source Caitlin Jaymes Closet Organizer & Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 16 December 2019. Get as specific as you want, for the books that you have. Within genre, you can specialize even further if you want to. In the history section, store your military history books together, but differentiate them from your natural history books, European history, and other sub-genres. If you don't have a lot of different genres, just split them into two big categories: Fun books and learning books. Put all novels, stories, and sci-fi in the first section. Put all your old school stuff in the other."

This may look a little more chaotic on the shelf, and you'll end up with some weird stuff next to one another, but you'll always know where everything is in the alphabet. Go by title, or go by the last name of the author when you're alphabetizing your books. Generally, titles are easier to remember, but you'll also end up with a lot of titles that start with \"The\" and \"A,\" which might be confusing."
