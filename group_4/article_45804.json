Grab hold of the handles and place your back against the pad. Inhale and push up without locking your elbows, then slowly bring your elbows back down. Repeat. [1] X Research source Details: The seated shoulder press machine is a variation of the dumbbell shoulder press that gives you the same exercise within a fixed range of motion. Targeted Muscles: Deltoids (shoulders) and other important stabilizer muscles in your back and shoulders like the supraspinatus muscles, rotator cuff, traps, and rhomboid muscles. Tips: Be careful not to lock your elbows while completing the motion, as it may cause injury."

Pull the bar toward you until it reaches your sides, squeezing your back simultaneously. Release and repeat. [4] X Research source Details: The seated row machine mimics the impact of rowing on the body without the need for a boat or water. Targeted Muscles: Latissimus dorsi or lats (back), rhomboids, and the middle and lower trapezius. Tips: Most rowing machines have different handle options for narrower or ride rowing, so switch up the handles you use to target different muscles in your upper body."

Because of the cable machine’s variety, you’re able to work every muscle in your upper body—from your shoulders to your back to your arms and chest. Here are just a few of the best cable machine exercises you can do to build your upper body: [8] X Research source Cable Row: Set the radial arms at their highest position. Stand facing the machine and use both hands to grab the handles with an overhand grip. Stand with one foot on the plate and one behind you, then lean back until your arms are fully extended. Keep your back straight and slowly pull the handles toward your chest, simultaneously squeezing your shoulder blades together. Pause, then slowly extend your arms back to starting position. Cable Chest Press: Set the cable pulleys just below shoulder height, then face away from the machine with one foot on the plate. Slightly bend the leg that’s on the plate, then step straight back with the other leg. Grab the handles with an overhand grip and bring your elbows to a right angle, level with your shoulders. Extend your arms fully and press the handles forward until your fists are in front of your chest. Squeeze your chest muscles, then slowly reverse the motion. Cable Bicep Curl: Set the radial arms at a 45º angle from the frame. Face away from the machine with one foot on the plate and one stepped slightly back. Grab the handles with your arms fully extended and palms facing forward. Slowly curl the handles toward your shoulders, keeping your upper arms stationary and your elbows tucked beside your ribs. Squeeze your biceps, then gradually lower the handles to the starting position."

      "content": "Understand the relationship between sets, reps, and rests. Repetitions (reps) are the number of times you repeat each exercise in a set. A set is a group of repetitions that you perform without resting. A rest is something you take between each set. For example, let’s say you’re doing three sets of squats with 10 reps each and a rest of 60 seconds. You’d complete 10 squats, then take a 60-second break—that’s one set. Repeat that three times to complete your exercise. [9] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 268 wikiHow readers how they liked to refuel after a workout, and 51% of them said protein shake.

For a more aggressive approach, use the “2 for 2” rule when deciding when to increase your weights. If you can do twice as many reps with a given weight than what you started with, increase the weight to the next level. [14] X Research source You may eventually stop improving or hit your limit as to how much weight you can support with a given exercise. When that happens, find a new machine workout to replace that exercise in your routine."
