      "content": "A confident Sagittarius will want to be open about intimacy. He may have specific words or names that he likes to hear in bed, and the key to successful dirty talk is tailoring it to your partner's needs. Listen to his desires, and use that knowledge in the bedroom (and outside of it) in the future. \"Is there anything you want to try? I want to make you feel good.\" \"Are there any names you like to be called? Let's have as much fun as we can with this.\""

      "content": "Sagittarius men cherish partners who know what they like and ask for it. Although they generally tend to be more dominant, these guys respond well to a little guidance. When you show him what you like, be patient (but not condescending). Keep the atmosphere light and fun as he figures out the best ways to please you, and use dirty talk to learn about and enjoy one other. [1] X Research source For example: \"I can't wait to feel your hands all over me.\" \"I love it when you touch my [body part] just like that.\" \"I want you to pin me against the wall andâ€¦.\""

      "content": "He loves to be caught up in the heat of the moment, so surprise him. Chances are, your Sagittarius doesn't plan bedroom encounters out anyway; he prefers to let whims and attraction guide him. Sagittarius men have a high sex drive and get bored easily, so the spur-of-the-moment dirty talk is a great way to keep him entertained and desperate for more. [2] X Research source \"I want you so bad, here and now.\" \"I've been trying to wait until tonight, but I need you too much.\" \"What if I told you that you could have me right now?\""

      "title": "Appeal to his spontaneous nature and play out fantasies over the phone.",
      "content": "Appeal to his spontaneous nature and play out fantasies over the phone. Steamy texting sessions and phone sex are great ways to keep the heat up in a relationship, and your Sagittarius will be quick to pick up any flirty vibes you put down. Encourage his imagination to run wild when you text him; give him a scenario and tell him that he can \"do\" whatever he wants with you next. \"I've been planning out what we'll do in bed all week. It's going to blow your mind. ðŸ¤¯\" \"I'm thinking about the last time we were together. It felt so good!\" \"If you get here in 20 minutes, we can do that thing you're always asking about.\""

      "title": "Your fun-loving Sagittarius doesn't want to take everything so seriously.",
      "content": "Your fun-loving Sagittarius doesn't want to take everything so seriously. He'll enjoy dirty talk if you relax, laugh, and show him your goofy side. That doesn't mean foreplay or sex can't be passionate between youâ€”on the contrary, fiery Sagittarius is known for his passion and enthusiasm. It just means that he thinks of intimacy as a fun pastime and not a deeply emotional, serious moment. [3] X Research source \"Do you like sales? Because clothes are 100% off at my place.\" \"Your body is 70% water, and I'm thirsty!\" Acknowledge when something funny happens and laugh it off. It won't spoil the mood! Sagittarius men are attracted to people with a sense of humor."

      "content": "Sagittarius men love to take control in the bedroom. If you're comfortable taking a more submissive role, use dirty talk to inspire his naturally dominant personality. Suggest positions that put him in the more dominant role, which he'll eagerly agree to. Let him know how much you enjoy it when he takes control, and he'll be happy to do it again next time. \"You can have your way with me tonight.\" \"It's such a turn-on when you dominate me.\" \"Tell me what you want me to wear tonight.\""

Rather than reserving your best dirty talk for the bedroom, show your Sagittarius that you're comfortable getting steamy elsewhereâ€”such as the shower, another room in the house, the car, or a private spot outdoors. Just the suggestion of getting intimate outside the bedroom will turn on your Sagittarius! \"Let's take a shower together.\" \"Wanna go for a picnic? I'll be the dessert.\" \"Take me right hereâ€”I can't wait until we get upstairs.\""

Keep things fresh between you by suggesting new toys, games, and activities to enjoy when getting intimate together. A Sagittarius man will be open to trying anything once, and he'll love having a partner who is just as active and fearless in the bedroom as he is. [4] X Research source \"Let's try a new position. I want to know what this one feels like.\" \"I got some sexy dice. Let's roll them and see what happens tonight!\" \"Ever tried role play? What if I called you \"sir\" for the rest of the night?\""

      "content": "Match his confidence with bold and clear language. A Sagittarius man wants your honest reactions without any indirectness. You don't have to be subtle or drop hints with him; dive in and let him know what you're thinking, whether you're teasing him or right in the heat of the moment. The more plainspoken you are, the more turned on he'll be. \"So that you know, I'm thinking about last nightâ€¦and wishing to do all of that again.\" \"I get so weak when I think about my skin against yours.\" \"I can't get enough of you in the bedroom.\""

Other signs might have limits with dirty talk or consider explicit language crass, but a Sagittarius man will love all of it. Be as vivid as you can with descriptions and scenarios. The raunchier the language, the more fun your Sagittarius man will have. \"What would you do if you were in a room with me, a single lit candle, a soft carpet, and nothing else?\" \"Tell me your dirtiest fantasy. I'll tell you mine.\""

Tell him when he's doing something particularly satisfying! If you're not used to doing this, work your way up from gasps and moans to a simple \"yes\" or \"that's good\" before getting more specific. \"Mm, I missed this.\" \"You feel so right.\" \"Keep going!\" \"It feels so good when you touch me.\""
