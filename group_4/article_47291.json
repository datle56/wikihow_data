      "content": "Place the knee pads in a mesh laundry bag. The bag will help to keep your pads safe and prevent them from getting tangled with other items in the washer. Make sure the bag is closed and any snaps or hook-and-loop fastener on the pads are secured. [1] X Research source If you’re not sure, check the care tag inside of the pads to confirm that your pads can be machine washed. It’s safe to wash most pads in the washing machine as long as they fit in the drum. If you don’t have a laundry bag, you can use a spare pillowcase as a makeshift protective bag for the pads."

      "content": "Wash them with a small load of laundry or other sports gear. Try to avoid doing a load of laundry with only your pads because they can hit against each other or damage the washing machine. Instead, put a small load of T-shirts or other clothing into the washing machine until it is about halfway full. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you use them for a sport, wash your pads with your uniform or practice clothes to keep all of the components together. Avoid placing delicate laundry into the washing machine with your knee pads."

      "title": "Add a small amount of mild laundry detergent to the washing machine.",
      "content": "Add a small amount of mild laundry detergent to the washing machine. Pour enough laundry detergent for a half load of laundry into the machine. This should be enough to get the pads and clothes clean without damaging the material. [3] X Research source Make sure the detergent doesn't contain bleach, which can remove the color from some knee pads. If your pads are particularly bad smelling, you can add a capful of white vinegar to the machine to neutralize odors."

      "title": "Select the “cold water” and “gentle” settings and press start.",
      "content": "Select the “cold water” and “gentle” settings and press start. Cold water helps to neutralize odors and kill sweat bacteria, and the gentle cycle will prevent the pads from getting damaged. Look for these options on the panel of the washing machine, and make sure they’re selected before starting the cycle. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you can’t find the “gentle” cycle, try looking for a “delicate” option on the panel."

      "title": "Remove the pads from the washer and hang them to dry.",
      "content": "Remove the pads from the washer and hang them to dry. Once the cycle is over, take the pads out of the mesh bag and hang them up to dry for at least 6 hours. If you can, let them dry in the sun, which helps to kill any remaining bacteria in the pads. [5] X Research source Alternatively, you can lay them on a flat surface to dry. If you lay them out to dry, make sure to turn them over at some point to ensure that both sides of the pads dry. Avoid putting the pads in the dryer because this can cause the material to shrink or warp, making them ill-fitting."

      "title": "Fill your bathtub or utility tub about halfway with hot water.",
      "content": "Fill your bathtub or utility tub about halfway with hot water. Make sure the water is hot but you can still comfortably put your hands in it. The hot water will help the pads release dirt and bacteria with less agitation. [6] X Research source This is a great technique for washing larger knee pads that won’t fit in the washing machine, like hockey pads. Using hot water when hand washing makes the job easier on your hands because the fabric will release stains more easily. However, if you’re worried about darker fabric bleeding color into the water, you can use colder water."

      "title": "Add laundry detergent and white vinegar to the water.",
      "content": "Add laundry detergent and white vinegar to the water. Use about 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of laundry detergent and a capful of white vinegar to help clean the pads. Then, swirl your hands around the tub to mix the detergent into the water. [7] X Research source If you don’t have white vinegar, you can use a capful of color-safe bleach instead."

      "content": "Put the knee pads in the water and swirl them around to saturate them. Push the kneepads into the water until they’re saturated with water. Once they’re completely submerged, move them around the tub to mimic the movement of the washing machine. [8] X Research source Don’t be alarmed if a lot of dirt seems to come out of the pads! Sometimes, they can absorb more sweat than you realize. If the pads still smell after swirling them for 5 minutes, add an extra capful of vinegar to the water."

      "title": "Let the pads soak in the mixture for at least 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the pads soak in the mixture for at least 30 minutes. After about 5 minutes of swirling the pads in the water, stop and let them rest in the water. This lets the cleaning agents soak into the middle of the pad and prevents bacteria from growing in harder-to-clean places. [9] X Research source For really dirty pads, you may need to drain and refill the tub with hot water after the dirt and bacteria are released. Leave the pads in the tub while you refill it, and be sure to add more detergent, vinegar, or bleach."

      "title": "Rinse each pad with running water.",
      "content": "Rinse each pad with running water. Once the pads have soaked in the water, drain the tub and run them under clean, hot water. Squeeze the pads frequently to expel water from the foam, and remove them from the tub once the water runs clear. [10] X Research source If it takes longer than 1-2 minutes for the water to run clear, you may need to soak the pads in laundry detergent and water for another 30 minutes to make sure they’re clean. Unless the pads still have a strong smell, you don’t need to soak them in vinegar."

      "title": "Blot them with a towel and hang them up to dry for 6 hours.",
      "content": "Blot them with a towel and hang them up to dry for 6 hours. Fold the pads into a clean towel and press on them a few times to remove any excess water. Then, hang them up on a clothesline to dry for at least 6 hours, preferably in the sun. The sunshine will help to kill bacteria, and the pads will dry faster. [11] X Research source If you don’t have a clothesline, you can lay the pads on a flat surface in a well-ventilated area. Make sure you flip them over after about 3 hours to ensure that both sides dry evenly. Don’t put the knee pads in the dryer. The extreme heat can cause the material to shrink or warp, making the pads unsafe."

      "content": "Wash your knee pads every 1-2 weeks. To keep them smelling fresh and free of harmful bacteria, try to wash your knee pads regularly. If you’re using them every day for vigorous activity, wash them more often, like every other day. [12] X Research source If you don’t use your knee pads regularly, wash them as needed when you use them."

      "title": "Turn the knee pads inside out after using them.",
      "content": "Turn the knee pads inside out after using them. To eliminate odors and help the pads air out, flip them inside out immediately after wearing them. If you’re using them for a sport, leave them outside of your gym bag so the smell isn’t contained. Let them dry for at least 6 hours before you place them in your bag or wear them again. [13] X Research source If you are putting the knee pads in a bag to carry them, be sure to leave an opening in the bag to act as a vent. This will keep air circulating and prevent them from becoming too smelly."

After you take off your knee pads, spray them with an anti-microbial spray, which can be found at most pharmacies or in the first aid area of the grocery store. [14] X Research source For pads that are coated with plastic or rubber, you can wipe them with anti-microbial wipes to prevent the growth of bacteria."

      "title": "Rotate between 2 sets of knee pads if you use them often.",
      "content": "Rotate between 2 sets of knee pads if you use them often. For athletes, it’s a good idea to invest in an extra set of knee pads to wear while your other pads are drying out. This can help prevent infections or rashes on your skin in areas that are sweaty, like behind your knee. [15] X Research source You should also rotate between washing the knee pads. Try to make sure that you don’t wash both pairs at the same time unless you don’t need to wear them for at least 1-2 days."
