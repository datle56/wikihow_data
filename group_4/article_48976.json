      "content": "At the very beginning The moment you hear of a competition you may wish to enter, this is when your training should begin. You should indicate your interest to your teacher as he is the one who will be your coach during the tournament, and handling most of the administrative matters. In most matches, Yellow, blue and red, and black belts compete in Taekwondo sparring tournaments. If you aren't at that level yet, don't despair, but train for the future such that once you are able to enter a competition, you will be better prepared than most."

      "content": "Build up your Stamina The fight in the ring will last three rounds of 1-2 minutes, depending on what competition you enter. In between, there will be rest periods of about half a minute. In order to sustain this kind of pace, you will need to build up your stamina. Run every other day, at 70% of your heart rate or do interval sprints. In order to do this, subtract your age from 220. This value is your maximum. Multiply this figure by 70%. The result is the number of beats your heart should make a minute as you run. In order to count this easily, divide it by 6 so that you only have to count for 10 seconds. As you run, press your finger against your carotid artery and feel the pulses, counting for 10 seconds. For example, if you are 16, your maximum heart rate is 220-16=204. 70% of your heart rate is then 204*70%= 142.8. You can thus calculate that in 10 seconds, your heart should beat 142.8/6=23.8. Therefore, as you run, feel to see if your heart beats about 24 beats a minute. If it is, you will be able to build up endurance this way.

You should practice the following kicks every day, at least 10 times each with both legs: Turning kicks, both with the front and rear legs Back kicks (Back thrust) Back hooks Sidekicks Slamming kicks (Axe Kick) Jumping back kicks Jumping back hooks"

For example, as you do a turning kick, the front of your body may be open, a good place to counter-attack. Ensure you are constantly blocking your head and your body with both arms, and be prepared to knock away kicks from your opponent."

      "content": "Practice your Counterattacks These kicks are the most likely to score points because many fighters let their blocks fall when they start attacking. When your opponent brings up their leg for a kick, you should immediately identify what kick it is and counter where they are open. A good counter should involve blocking or evading their attack and then striking quickly. For example: If the opponent does a turning kick, you can either lean back to avoid it or use your arm to block it, then go in with a turning kick of your own. Or, you could just attack quicker than your opponent, and strike with a suitable back kick or hook. As long as you hit them first, with power, you should be able to earn the points. If the opponent does a back kick, evade to the side and attack with a turning kick."

The following tips will ensure a better defense and better attack position: Stay on the balls of your feet so that you are ready to move when necessary, and move quickly. Bounce up and down as you do so so that you can hide your next move, and also such that you will be in a better position to perform jumping kicks. Your front arm should be up and protecting your head from attack. This arm should be primed to move sideways or downwards quickly to block off an attack. Your other arm should be close to your front and also ready to move."

If you are able to get the schedule of when your opponents fight, you can watch them and prepare for your match. Similarly, you should change styles in different rounds so that your strategy cannot be preempted. One of the great things about Taekwondo is that you do sparring in all styles. Sparring is like a controlled combat or fighting situation. You wear gear, people punch and kick you, and you punch and kick them. It helps you to understand and learn how to handle things coming at you quickly."

Your mind will be focused on attacking your opponent and taking him out, and it is important for your coach to remind you of your strategies. The process is as follows: The referee points to the ground with their right and left hands, saying 'Chung, Hung'. This means 'blue, red', and indicates where you should stand. The referee will then say 'chareot' to get you to attention, and 'kyueng-rye' to get you to bow to the judges and each other. The referee then says 'gyeorugi choonbi', upon which you enter your fighting stance. He then says 'shijak', and the fight begins! You should stop immediately if the referee says 'kuman' or 'kalyo'."
