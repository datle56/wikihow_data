      "content": "Start your day with affirmations. An affirmation is something you say to support or encourage someone--in this case, yourself. It may feel silly, and you may not believe it at first, but start and end your day by looking in the mirror and saying your affirmation out loud. Write your affirmation on a sticky note a post it on your mirror. Or write it on the back of a business card and keep it in your wallet to remind you throughout the day.

      "content": "Halt negative talk. When you make a mistake, what goes through your mind? Do you call yourself stupid, or a loser, or say any number of negative things about yourself? The moment you start having those thoughts, you need to stop yourself. Say it out loud or under your breath or in your head: Stop. Even if that means you have to say \"stop\" every ten seconds. Wear a rubber band around your wrist and snap it every time you put yourself down. [2] X Research source Acknowledge the thought, then imagine throwing it in a trash bin or physically getting rid of it in some way.

[7] X Research source Think about the people you love and admire. They're not perfect, either. They've all made mistakes, and have regrets.
