      "title": "Choose the right bean.",
      "content": "Choose the right bean. With dozens of beans available at local coffee shops and supermarkets, it can seem impossible to narrow down your search for the perfect coffee bean. Thankfully, a few criteria can help you choose the best bean for your preferred palette. [1] X Research source If you want a coffee with high caffeine levels, choose one that is a light roast. Contrary to popular belief, the darker a roast of coffee does not increase the amount of caffeine it has, but rather decreases it. The darker a coffee bean is, the longer it has been roasted, and the more of the beans’ natural caffeine has been burnt out. So, to help keep you awake longer find a light-roast coffee. [2] X Research source Decide on how rich a flavor you want. Although each roast differs, typically dark roast beans are known for a deep, full flavor. Light roasts are a little less bitter tasting and have sweeter undertones. If you are new to coffee and are afraid of the “burnt” taste of beans, choose a light roast. If you are a coffee connoisseur with years of experience, then a light or dark roast is a good option. Make sure your beans are a coarse ground. Unlike espresso and drip coffee pots which require a fine ground for coffee, you want to have your beans in larger granules. This means that instead of being the consistency of a powder, your coffee beans will be closer to the consistency of sand. Always use fresh beans. No matter what method of coffee brewing you use, it is imperative that you always use fresh beans. Old, stale beans lose flavor and give your cup of coffee a bad taste. Buy your coffee beans in two week batches (enough to last only two weeks at a time), and always grind your beans immediately before brewing."

      "title": "Get your French press.",
      "content": "Get your French press. [3] X Research source A French press is a type of coffee pot formed by a large glass cylinder with a flat filter attached to a long pull/handle on the lid. This allows you to place your coffee grounds in the bottom, place the filter over the top, and add hot water. Although some people complain about having a lot of grinds in their coffee as the result of a French press, this more likely has to do with the grind of the coffee itself. If it is too fine or of irregular size, it will go through the filter and into your hot water. French presses also go by the name of “Cafetiere.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a good grinder.",
      "content": "Get a good grinder. Nearly as important as the French press itself is a good coffee bean grinder. Find a conical burr grinder rather than going budget with a cheap version. The grinder is responsible for breaking up the whole coffee beans into the perfect size grains, and in revealing the coffee’s true flavor."

      "title": "Gather other supplies.",
      "content": "Gather other supplies. You will need boiling water to make the coffee and mugs to pour it in, otherwise the rest is up to you! Feel free to add your favorite sweeteners to your coffee whether they be sugar, honey, caramel, or chocolate in addition to half and half cream. [4] X Research source Or go purist and drink your cup of coffee black, for a rich, deep flavor."

    {
      "title": "Preheat your coffee press.",
      "content": "Preheat your coffee press. Although you don’t need to add any water at this point, it is good to run your press under warm water. Because the majority of your press is made of glass, pouring boiling water into it might crack the glass, ruining it. Just make sure the glass is slightly warm to the touch before brewing your coffee."

    {
      "title": "Grind your coffee.",
      "content": "Grind your coffee. It is imperative that you always grind your coffee right before you brew it, to get the best flavor and prolong how long it lasts before going stale. [5] X Research source If you want to make one cup of coffee, then you need to grind enough for one heaping tablespoon of grounds. Continue adding additional tablespoons of grounds for more cups of coffee. While you are grinding your coffee, begin boiling your water in a separate pot. You can do this in a regular stove-top teakettle or an electric teakettle. The perfect temperature for French press coffee is from 195–200 °F (91–93 °C)."

      "title": "Wait.",
      "content": "Wait. Leave the press with the plunger up so that the grounds can continue to interact with the hot water. You can set a timer to make sure you allow it to set for the right amount of time; 3-4 minutes is the perfect amount of steeping time. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Finish the coffee. Once the time is up, press down the plunger to separate the grinds from the water. Be sure to press down with a slow and steady pace to avoid mixing up the grounds or sloshing the coffee everywhere. Then, finish by pouring into your favorite coffee mug. Enjoy!"

    {
      "title": "Select your tea.",
      "content": "Select your tea. You can choose any loose-leaf tea with large enough leaves that it won’t sneak through the filter. Another option is to cut open a bag of your favorite pre-bagged tea and pour it directly into your French press. For every one cup of tea, add one tablespoon of tea leaves. Green teas are full of antioxidants and health benefits. For an energy producing cup of tea, choose a green tea or mix that includes green tea. For a simple, pure cup of tea, try a white tea. These are the least processed of all the tea varieties and offer a light, sweet taste. White teas also have ties to improved complexion and skin health. Black tea is a dark, rich tea with a full flavor. Traditional black teas include earl gray and English breakfast tea, but there are many other varieties available. [7] X Research source If you want a flower based tea, try a herbal tea. These are often caffeine free and aid in digestion. Popular herbal teas include chamomile and peppermint. [8] X Research source For an energy boost similar to coffee, try a mate tea. These give a cup full of good-for-you vitamins in addition to a great taste and bit of caffeine. [9] X Research source Oolong teas are a strong tea popular in China. [10] X Research source These are often likened to black teas, and can be found in a variety of flavors."

Make sure that your French press is warm to the touch before adding the boiling water, to prevent it from cracking with temperature shock.
