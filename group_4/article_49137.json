      "content": "Part your hair. Use a comb to part your hair from the crown of your head to the top of your neck. The crown begins at the upper back of your skull where your head begins to curve downward. Start here and make a straight part down to your neck to split your hair into two parts.

      "content": "Pin up the left side. Take the brush in your left hand. Place the outer edge of it along your part and on the left half of your hair. Brush the hair toward your left temple, keeping it smooth alongside your hair line. Slide a bobby pin an inch left of the nape of your neck and then again right above your ear. Continue placing bobby pins every 2 inches from here. [2] X Research source Incorporate the ends into the right hair section if you have long hair. If you have curly hair, use your hands instead of a brush to prevent extra frizz."

      "title": "Pin up the right side.",
      "content": "Pin up the right side. Take the brush in your right hand and place the outer side of it on your part with the brush over the right side of your hair. Brush up from here towards the temple gently. Be careful and try not to brush over the bobby pins. Once again, place a bobby pin 2 inches from the nape, again just above your ear, and every 2 inches from there to the ends. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Tuck stray hairs and secure wrap. If you have any stray hairs, tuck them into your wrap. If you don’t feel that your wrap is secure, bobby pin it in place. Sleep with your hair wrapped and wake to it frizz, tangle, and break free. Simply remove the wrap, take out the pins, and brush it a little to wear it the next morning."
