      "content": "Drink caffeine. A single cup of coffee contains about 75 milligrams of caffeine. This is enough to wake you up a little while driving, keeping you alert. Have one cup of coffee if you start to feel tired. This should give you an extra jolt that will help you keep going. [6] X Research source Keep your eyes open for filling stations and coffee shops along the road. When you feel tired, pull over at one of these places and have a cup of coffee.

A short fifteen to twenty minute nap can recharge your brain, giving you the stamina you need to keep driving. Find a safe place to pull over and nap for about fifteen to twenty minutes. [8] X Research source Choose a place far enough away from the main road you will not get hit by oncoming traffic. You should also choose a place that is not too isolated, such as car park near a filling station, for your safety. Set an alarm. You do not want a twenty minute nap to turn into an hour long nap."

This should be disruptive enough that your body will be jarred awake. [9] X Research source See if your car's radio measures decibels. If it does not, just try to estimate. Turn up the car's radio until the noise is loud enough that you feel awake. Only turn the radio or stereo up this high for brief periods when you're tired, however.
