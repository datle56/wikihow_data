      "content": "Decide what kind of race you want to participate in. For your first triathlon, you may want to stick with a sprint distance. It's still hard! When you go to sign up, know what you're going in for; the distance varies greatly. Sprint Triathlons : The shortest (though still arduous) varies in specific length, but many of them have around a 0.5-mile (0.8-kilometer) swim, 15-mile (24-kilometer) bike ride and 3-mile (5-kilometer) run. [1] X Research source The distances are not as concrete as longer triathlons that have set parameters. The Olympic Triathlon : This is the most common triathlon out there. It's a 0.93 miles (1.5 kilometers) swim, a 24.8 miles (40 kilometers) bicycle route and a 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) run. The Half Ironman : This one is a 1.2 miles (1.93 kilometers) swim, a 56 miles (90 kilometers) bike ride and a 13 mile (21 kilometers) run. The Ironman Triathlon : This 2.4 mile (3.9 kilometer) swim, 112 mile (180 kilometer) bike ride and 26.2 mile (42.2 kilometer) marathon is probably the most famous."

      "content": "Sign up. There are several websites and magazines that can use to search for and register for triathlons, including TriFind.com, Active.com, RaceTwitch.com, LAVA Magazine, and Triathlete Magazine (the magazines are great resources for finding out all sorts of interesting things about triathlons in general). Before you sign up for a race, you should look into the race details, which you can usually find on the triathlon’s website. For example, is the race extremely hilly or flat? Is the swim in a choppy ocean or flat lake? If you’re a new swimmer, you might want to choose a body of water that is easier to swim in. Some triathlons are off-road, which may appeal to you if you prefer to mountain bike rather than ride on a paved road"

      "content": "Get your gear. To do well in a triathlon, you need decent gear. You could go running, biking and swimming in an old Peter Frampton t-shirt and gym shorts, but 10 minutes in and even your skin is going to start putting up a fight. Do yourself a favor and get the right equipment. You'll need: Swim suit, goggles, and cap. If you will be swimming in cold water, consider a wetsuit. A wetsuit will help keep you warm in cold water temperatures. [2] X Research source Be aware that the tradeoff of wearing a wetsuit is that it may hinder your range of motion or swimming stroke. If you’re going to wear a wetsuit in a race, be sure you practice in it ahead of time. A helmet that fits you and bicycle that is reliable. Road bikes, mountain bikes, and hybrids all work swell. A special triathlon bike or time trial bike isn't necessary, though if you have one, by all means, use it. Cycling shorts for training. Worn without undies, these will keep your woes from piling up (your legs hurt enough as it is -- why add your butt and skin into the mix?) Cycling shoes and clip-less pedals have their purposes, but you can make do without them just fine. A water bottle. This will be your best friend. A nice pair of running shoes. Don't spend your entire paycheck on them, but do go to your local running store and get a pair that fit your feet properly. The folks will insist on helping you and let them. They know what they're doing. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Know the training stages for building an effective triathlon training plan. There are several training stages that will help you reach maximum success in your triathlon training. The stages are what an athlete Builds a training program around relative to where they are in their training progress. Based on your fitness level, the stages will dictate the kind of intensity and distance that you will engage in. Individuals who are new to triathlon training should at the Base stage and go from there. The training stages include: [4] X Research source Triathletes Training Bible (1988), Joe Friel p.34. The Base stage has increasing distance, low intensity The Build stage has distance maxing, moving toward moderate intensity The Peak stage has decreasing distance, moving toward high peak intensity The Race stage has decreasing distance, decreasing intensity from high toward moderate The Taper stage has decreasing distance, decreasing intensity from moderate to low There is some taper pre- and post-race, depending on the racing schedule."

      "content": "Plan out your timeline. Different types of triathlons require different training schedules and timelines. Your timeline is also dependent on your fitness level and personal lifestyle (for example, if you work a lot or you have a family to care for). Sprint distances may take 4-6 weeks to train for, while Olympic distances may take 3-6 months. If you are training for a 70.3 or 140.6 race, be sure to adopt the training stages (base through taper) to ensure that you train properly and safely. Training for these can take 6 months to a year."

      "content": "Train in amounts that are proportionate to your distance races. Swimming often constitutes 10-20% of a race, biking often constitutes 40-50% of a race, and running often constitutes 20-30% of a race. When you're training, keep this in mind. Also, think about the type of race you're running. What kind of water will you be in? Are you biking and running on hills? What kind of terrain? If you can train in a similar state, the race will be a lot less surprising."

      "content": "Practice some \"brick\" sessions about a month ahead of your event. A brick is where you do two disciplines back to back. An example of a brick session is a 45-minute cycle ride followed by a 15- to 20-minute run. This gets you used to changing muscle groups. Even if you can swim like a fish, run like you're being chased by wolves, and cycle like there's no tomorrow, if you can't do them back to back, you won’t do well in a triathlon. Doing brick sessions will teach your body how to cope when the actual race comes around. You can change what you’re doing based on the day of the week; you may want to devote one day to swimming, one day to running, one day to biking, one day to stretching, one day to rest, then two days to brick sessions that combine the types of exercise."

      "content": "Consider joining a Masters swim program to become more proficient in the water. These programs generally accept all levels of skill in the water. Having access to a pro instructor certainly never hurts. Ask your swim coach where he/she would train and what open water is available for you to practice in. Pools are good, but they're just not the same as a lake or river. If possible, swim in squares in the pool or do not push off of the walls; you won’t have the chance to rest ever 25 yards when you are in the open water. Becoming a proficient swimmer will help your triathlon performance overall, but keep in mind that the swim is the shortest (and some would say least significant) portion of the triathlon."

      "content": "Build practice triathlons into your training. You may spend a lot of your training time working on the sports one at a time, but you do not want your actual triathlon race to be the first time you bike, swim, and run all at the same time. You can work on transitions ahead of time by doing practice triathlons. It’s also a good idea to eat and drink while you are training. You can get a snack in after your swim and before your run. Stay hydrated and be sure to keep up your carbs while you are in training."

      "content": "Start with some sprint races. This is usually around a ~700 meter (765 yard) swim, ~15 mile (24 km) bike and a 5K (3.1 mi) run. You do not need to set a land-speed record, just use the races as a learning experience. You can use sprint races as a building block for longer races (international, half-ironman, and ironman), or you can choose to focus on sprint races. But you need to race to put all the training together. Sprints are a good jumping off point. You can never start at the top of the ladder for anything, so a smaller triathlon is a good place to begin. It's also safest for your body."

In the off-season, you can do a lot of long, steady distance work that will build a strong network of capillaries in your legs that will serve you well in the summer during race season. As soon as you can, get outside. You'll want to be able to get accustomed to the handle of the bike. Cycling outside is a very different experience than cycling indoors, stationery."

This will help ensure that you stay in good health and train safely. [6] X Research source Monitor your heart rate. As you get into better shape, your resting heart rate slows down. It should be its slowest in the morning right when you wake up. Try counting your heart rate for 10 seconds first thing in the morning. Keep track every day so that you know your normal rate. If your heart rate is higher than normal, you may be getting sick or your body may not have recovered from the previous day’s training. If your rate is too high, skip training for the day. Don’t exercise if you have a fever or other symptoms of illness such as muscle aches or chills. Pay attention to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fainting, lightheadedness or chest pain. These can be indicative of heart issues. Stop exercising right away and see a doctor if you are concerned. If you’ve been sick, make sure you return to training with patience and reasonable expectations until you are fully well."

It’s also one of the most overlooked elements. For an endurance race like a triathlon, you need to build muscle strength as well as muscle endurance. Strength training is also important for preventing injuries. Work in 15-20 minutes of strength training at least 1-2 times per week. Increase this frequency by 10% every week as you work through your triathlon training schedule. Decrease your strength training every 3 weeks for a week to allow your body time to recover."

To build muscle endurance, focus on doing higher repetitions with lighter weight or resistance. Do 5-10 repetitions of each of the following exercises at first, building to 20-30 reps as you get stronger: sit-ups, push-ups, squats, reverse lunge, side lunge, and plank hold. Do this circuit 10 times. To build muscle strength, try lifting free weights or machine weights. Perform 15 reps of the following: bench press, triceps dips, pull-ups, seated dumbbell shoulder press, seated dumbbell bicep curl, leg press, standing/lying hamstring curl, standing calf raise, and stability ball abdominal crunch. Try this circuit 2-6 times."
