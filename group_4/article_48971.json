If the total equals 5, then the only cards in that row are 1s and Voltorbs.

Subtract the values of the flipped cards from the total sum to see how many points are left over and determine their potential values. [5] X Research source Example : If a row has 6 points and 2 Voltorbs, and you’ve already flipped a 2 over, you know there are 4 more points leftover. Because the Voltorbs take up 2 cards, you know the other 2 cards either have to be 1 and 3, or 2 and 2. Once you determine what cards could potentially be, use the memo feature to mark them."

As you flip over and mark the different cards, check the column and the row to determine how the points and Voltorbs are split up between the cards. If a card can only be a certain value for a row, but it can’t be that value for the column, then it’s most likely a Voltorb. [6] X Research source Example: A row has 4 points and 2 Voltorbs, and a 2 is revealed. A column has 7 points and 2 Voltorbs, and a 1 is revealed. The unflipped squares in the row are two 1s and 2 Voltorbs. The unflipped squares in the column are two 3s and 2 Voltorbs. The card where the row and column intersect cannot be a 1 or a 3, so it has to be a Voltorb."

Look for intersections of rows and columns that have high points and few Voltorbs for the best chances of flipping over a multiplier. [7] X Research source Example : If an 8 point/1 Voltorb column intersects with a 7 point/1 Voltorb row, then the card has a good chance of being a multiplier."
