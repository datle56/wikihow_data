Continue by sweeping the device from the corner of your lips to your temple, and also from the corner of your nostril to the end of your cheekbone. Always hold the NuFACE Trinity in place until the device beeps. Glide the device in straight, smooth lines for the most effective results.

Each time, bring the NuFACE Trinity to the top of your forehead and hold it there until you hear a beeping sound. You’ll be working along the curve of your eye, going from the thickest portion of your brow to the thinnest.
