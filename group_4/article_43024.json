      "content": "It depends on how she feels about herself. If she has been gaining weight, she almost certainly knows it. Putting her down isn’t going to fix anything. The key question isn’t whether she’s gaining weight or not, but how she feels about her weight gain. [1] X Research source If she’s perfectly happy with her body , you telling her she has a problem implies that your opinion about her body matters more than how she feels—which is unreasonable. If she’s not happy about the weight gain , you can definitely have a productive conversation about her weight. But just coming right out and saying, “You’re fat,” is going to make her feel even worse about it. You want to be loving and supportive, not cruel. How do I know how she feels? You can tell how she feels about herself by paying attention to how she talks about her body. If she excessively looks for reassurance (she asks you if clothing makes her look fat, or she complains about how she looks), she’s not happy about her weight"

      "content": "Do not bring up her weight if she’s happy with who she is. If she’s not interested in losing weight because she likes the way she looks, it’s not your place to tell her she needs to change. That doesn’t mean you can’t encourage healthy behavior that may lead to weight loss. It does mean that you shouldn’t directly address her weight, though. [2] X Research source By modeling healthy behavior and encouraging the two of you to do things that will lead to weight loss, you’ll help her lose weight without telling her she needs to lose weight in the first place."

      "title": "Avoid the word “fat” if you do address this directly.",
      "content": "Avoid the word “fat” if you do address this directly. The f-word is just going to make her feel down about the situation, and you gain nothing from making your girlfriend feel bad. It’s okay to have an honest conversation if she’s open to it, but that doesn’t mean you should be cruel. [3] X Research source Avoid the pronoun “you” as much as possible if you choose to be upfront. Include yourself whenever possible to soften the blow. Use phrases like “we’ve put on some weight” or “we aren’t as healthy as we could be” instead of “you’re fat” or “you’re overweight.” Women get so many negative messages about their bodies from media, advertising, music, and movies. Do not add to that negativity."

      "title": "Keep any conversations about weight loss centered on health.",
      "content": "Keep any conversations about weight loss centered on health. It’s better for her to be excited about being healthy than ashamed for being overweight, which is what’s going to happen if you guide the conversation towards the way she looks. It’s a lot easier to lose weight if you think you’re working towards something productive (being healthy), than away from something negative (being fat). [4] X Research source Think about it this way. Are you more likely to do a good job if you’re trying to earn a promotion or if you were just trying to avoid being fired? Positivity wins out every time, so focus on physical wellbeing."

      "title": "Use the pronoun “we” to include yourself in the convo.",
      "content": "Use the pronoun “we” to include yourself in the convo. If you focus entirely on her body, her decisions, or her lifestyle, she’s going to feel attacked. Keep the convo centered on both of you so that it’s about your relationship, not her body. Use plenty of “I think” and “we should” language instead of “you…” This will keep her from feeling like she’s being put under a microscope or unfairly criticized. [5] X Research source Instead of saying, “You’re overweight,” you might say, “We’re not as healthy as we used to be,” or, “I think we could eat better.” You might say, “We should try to be healthier” instead of, “You need to be healthier.” “Let’s work out more often. I think I'd be more motivated to exercise if we did it together” sounds a lot better than, “You need to hit the gym.”"

      "content": "Wait for her to bring it up or start the convo when she’s calm. Focus on her health and how she feels about herself, not on how you feel about her. If possible, take it slow and let her weight up, since she’ll be more open to the conversation if it’s her idea. Come from a place of respect, love, and empathy. [6] X Research source You might say: “Hey, I know you’ve been thinking about losing weight lately. I know we’ve both gained some weight the past year, and I think changing our diet to get to a healthier place is a great idea.” “I don’t think you’re overweight. I do think we could probably be healthier, though. Let’s make some changes together! It’ll be fun!” “I know you’ve been worried lately about your weight. I don’t think you’re overweight, but I get it if you want to be healthier. I’ve been thinking about changing my diet, too. Do you want to make some changes with me?”"

      "title": "Make it super clear that you still love her.",
      "content": "Make it super clear that you still love her. Encouragement is key. If she gets it in her head that you don’t like her anymore, it can put her in a really negative emotional space. Your goal isn’t to shame her, so use a ton of positive reminders and qualifiers as the two of you have this conversation. [7] X Research source You might say: “You know I still think you’re beautiful, right? This is really just about getting healthier. I want us to feel our best and be safe.” “I love you so much, I’d be lost if anything ever happened to you. That’s why I just want us to be healthy.”"

      "content": "Own the blame if she takes it the wrong way. It is very difficult to discuss someone’s weight without them getting angry or sad at you, and reasonably so. If this happens, explain that you’ve made a mistake. Then, own up for it and soften the blow by pointing out some fault in you. By taking ownership, you’ll take the sting out of the conversation. [8] X Research source You can say things like: “Maybe I’m giving you the wrong impression. I don’t think you’ve got a ‘problem’ or anything. I just think we could exercise more often.” “Ugh, I’m sorry. Hold on. I’m really doing a bad job of saying what I mean; I apologize. Look—I’m trying to be more healthy. I just want the best for us. This is for me, not you.” “Of course I’m still attracted to you! I’ve just noticed that we’ve both been really tired lately. I think if we eat a healthier diet and work out more often, we’ll have more energy.”"

If she has gained weight due to stress, try meditation and other ways to reduce stress . Keep in mind that this will take time. You should only aim to lose 1–2 pounds (0.45–0.91 kg) a week, so don’t get discouraged, and keep her motivated with a positive and upbeat attitude. If she’s not into the idea of losing weight, drop it. You can’t make this decision for her and you’re only going to harm your relationship if you keep pressuring to do something she isn’t ready to do."

Don’t even comment on her body; just ask her to help you make the changes you want to make. This is a good way to inadvertently encourage weight loss , and you’ll improve your overall health in the process! You might say, “I feel like I’ve been gaining weight over the past few months and I want to make some changes. I don’t know if I have the willpower to do it alone, though. Do you want to start working out with me? I could really use the support.” If you’re already rail-thin, don’t do this.

Come up with some innocuous reason to need to go to the doctor and suggest that your girlfriend should schedule an appointment as well. If your girlfriend is truly overweight, the doctor will talk to her about it. Hearing that she needs to lose weight from a neutral third party may be the encouragement she needs to get motivated.

After you’ve transitioned from the honeymoon phase to a steady relationship, the odds are extremely high that you and your girlfriend will both gain weight. This is natural and common—the two of you are no longer trying to impress everyone and you know that your partner cares about you (which gives each of you a little less anxiety about gaining weight). [14] X Research source There are many health factors that can also contribute, especially for women. Things like hormonal changes, certain medical conditions (like hypothyroidism or PCOS), and even certain medications can cause weight gain."

Nobody actively chooses who (or what) turns them on sexually, so if you’re losing some of your attraction to your girlfriend due to her weight gain, don’t be hard on yourself. At the same time, it’s important to recognize that your loss of interest is purely physical—this is still the same woman you fell for, and a few changes to lifestyle and diet will have you two going at it again in no time. [15] X Research source If you choose to discuss this with her, be extremely kind. Nobody wants to hear that the person they care about most has lost interest in them physically. If you do decide to discuss this with your girlfriend (which may be unavoidable if you’ve been dodging intimate time), be extremely kind and cushion your comments with tons of love and compliments."

Family medicine specialist Dr. Pouya Shafipour explains, “Start by exploring what the causes of weight gain are. Is it just an excess intake of calories and larger meals? Is it night snacking? is it a sedentary lifestyle? Is it snacking throughout the day or a combination?”"
