      "content": "You don't need an account to view profiles and posts on Bluesky's site. Bluesky profiles follow the format https://bsky.app/profile/<username>.bsky.social . Just replace <username> with the username of the Bluesky user whose profile you want to see. For example, to check out the user bodegacats on Bluesky without an account, you'd go to https://bsky.app/profile/bodegacats.bsky.social . Bluesky posts begin with the profile URL of the person who created the post, followed by /post/ and a series of letters and numbers. For example, https://bsky.app/profile/bodegacats.bsky.social/post/3kj2ycmduga25 is a post by the Bluesky user bodegacats . You can also search Google for the person's username (or full name, if you don't know it) and \"Bluesky\" to find their profile and posts."

      "content": "You can search Bluesky and filter live content without an account. Unlike rival Twitter/X , developers are encouraged to create apps that make Bluesky content useful to everyone. You don't need a Bluesky account to search for keywords and usernames, or even to view live conversations as they happen. Check out these Bluesky \"fire hose\" tools: Firesky is a fast-scrolling site that reshares everything that's posted to Bluesky in real time. If you want to track keywords and conversations as they're happening, click Filter at the top-right, then enter the keyword or other filter terms. Skyview is a site where you can view Bluesky threads unrolled, which means they'll be combined together like paragraphs. This can make it easier to read longer threads. You can also tag the Skyview Bluesky account in a thread to get a link to a thread as a tree, unrolled, or as an embed."

      "content": "Bluesky posts are public by default. Unlike X/Twitter, which lets users make their tweets private , Bluesky posts are visible to anyone on Bluesky—at least for now. [1] X Research source If you don't want people who don't have accounts to find your posts, you can enable a feature that discourages developers from showing your posts in their apps—think apps like Firesky and Bsky Pulse). [2] X Research source To make your posts more private, click or tap Moderation and select \"Discourage apps from showing my account to logged-out users.\" Keep in mind that this is not fail-proof. Some app developers may ignore this setting and show your posts in their web apps. This setting will also not prevent people from going directly to your Bluesky profile or post in a web browser."
