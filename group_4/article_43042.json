      "title": "Assess your reasons.",
      "content": "Assess your reasons. Ask yourself why you want to tell your parents you have an eating disorder. Is it so that they will treat you differently? Is it to ask for their support? Or do you need to ask if they will pay for you to see a mental health professional to help you overcome your disorder? When you have a sense of what your goals are, you can more readily steer the conversation in the way that you want it to go."

      "content": "Prepare materials. Collect some reading material that explains what eating disorders are and how they are addressed. The material should provide details about what people usually do in this matter. Print something off the internet or, if you have one, ask your counselor for some relevant pamphlets. Your parents might not know much about what eating disorders are, so this way you can educate them with the most up-to-date information. Here is an option for some materials to review: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/resource-center/"

      "content": "Find a quiet place and time. Have in mind a private and quiet spot where you can have the conversation.

[7] X Research source If you don't know the answer to one of their questions, it's fine to say that you don't know. If you don't want to answer one of their questions, tell them this.
