      "title": "A taper is a haircut that gradually shortens toward the base of the neck.",
      "content": "A taper is a haircut that gradually shortens toward the base of the neck. Typically, a taper starts with longer hair at the top of the head, with the hair on the sides and back of the head transitioning to a shorter length. This change can be as subtle or dramatic as you like, making this a versatile cut that allows for plenty of volume on top while keeping things neat down below. [1] X Research source Tapers are generally cut using clippers of gradually decreasing size, but can also be done freehanded with scissors or shears for a more natural look."

      "title": "Tapers often come as high, mid, and low cuts.",
      "content": "Tapers often come as high, mid, and low cuts. These terms describe where on the head the change in length is most dramatic. With a high taper, the change occurs high on the head, going from long to short hair right away. With a low taper, the hair stays longer further down, then becomes shorter around the base of the neck. A Mid Taper Fade [1] happens—you guessed it—toward the middle of the head. [2] X Research source Tapers can also accommodate different lengths of hair, from a generally short cut, to a cut that leaves much more hair on the top and sides. A taper cut can work on pretty much anyone, regardless of gender or hair texture. This makes it an incredibly popular and fashionable style."

      "title": "A fade is a transition from longer hair to very short hair or bare skin.",
      "content": "A fade is a transition from longer hair to very short hair or bare skin. Like a taper, the length of hair transitions from long to short as it moves down the head. However, a fade ends with an extremely short cut that exposes the skin around the base of the neck, often making for a higher hairline in the back. [3] X Research source A barber achieves this by starting with a large clipper, then using smaller and smaller clippers that gradually cut the hair shorter further down. In other words, a fade is a very dramatic type of taper. Fade lengths are often identified by the size of the last clipper guard used. For example, a #1 fade ends with a clipper guard that leaves 0.25 in (0.64 cm) of hair at the base of the taper, since this is the size of the #1 clipper guard."

      "title": "Fades also come as high, mid, and low cuts.",
      "content": "Fades also come as high, mid, and low cuts. That said, the change is much more dramatic, and the differences between each cut are much more noticeable. For example, a high fade becomes very short, very high on the scalp, exposing quite a bit of skin on the back and sides of the head. A low fade, on the other hand, preserves more hair and fades to bare skin closer to the base of the neck. [4] X Research source A skin fade fades to bare skin. A drop fade creates a U-shaped neckline from ear to ear. A burst fade creates a circular fade around the ears, and commonly transitions to a faux-hawk up top. A temple fade is a simple style that fades at the temple, elongating the face shape."

      "title": "Choose a taper for a low-fuss style with fairly easy upkeep.",
      "content": "Choose a taper for a low-fuss style with fairly easy upkeep. A taper can be worn messy on top, or styled with hair gel or cream for a more put-together look, but either way your hair will be on-point. They do take a bit of upkeep, and you’ll need to get to the barber about every 4 weeks to keep it looking fresh. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Opt for a fade if you want a bolder, more striking style.",
      "content": "Opt for a fade if you want a bolder, more striking style. A fade takes a bit more skill on the barber’s part, and a good fade is an absolute flex. That said, they do take a little more TLC—they’ll look a bit less sharp just 3 days after a cut, and some at-home maintenance on the neckline with a simple shaving razor is recommended. If you ask for a fade , be prepared to visit a barber every 2 weeks to keep it fresh. Touch-up cuts for both fades and tapers generally cost much less than a full cut. Just ask your barber about their touch-up options and pricing."

      "title": "A “taper-fade” is actually just a taper.",
      "content": "A “taper-fade” is actually just a taper. The term caught on because people tend to confuse the 2 styles, and so would use their names interchangeably. However, if you ask a barber for a taper-fade, they’ll most likely just give you some form of a taper. Or better, they’ll ask you to clarify what sort of style you’d like. It’s probably best to just avoid the term and ask for either a taper or a fade. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "“Blending” means merging hair lengths without an obvious line.",
      "content": "“Blending” means merging hair lengths without an obvious line. When your barber is making that short section meet the long section just right to create the perfect fade or taper, they’re “blending” the hair so that the transition is gradual and smooth. An inexperienced barber may leave behind lines or noticeable “steps” between clipper sizes. A “blend” haircut may refer to a cut that combines both a taper and a fade, with long hair on top transitioning to shorter hair around the sides, and a neckline that quickly fades to skin. This is also commonly just called a low fade."
