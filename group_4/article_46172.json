      "content": "Scoop some lip scrub out of its container using your finger. Ensure your finger is clean so you don't contaminate the scrub. The amount you apply depends on how rough or flaky your lips are. Flakier lips call for a liberal amount of lip scrub, whereas relatively smooth lips require only a small amount of lip scrub to do the job. Assess your current situation and make an informed decision. If your lips are peeling , but not raw, use your lip scrub generously to get rid of the dead skin. If your lips are raw, cracked or bleeding , wait for them to heal before using any lip scrub. You do not want to cause any further damage. Cracked lips will take 2-3 weeks to fully heal if you treat them properly.

In the meantime, you can practice other forms of lip care that are more gentle on your delicate skin."

      "content": "Spread the lip scrub evenly around your lips using one finger. Ensure that both the top lip and bottom lip have an equal coating. However, if one lip is particularly flakier than the other, it will not hurt to apply a more liberal amount to that one. Be careful not to apply too much pressure when doing this. [3] X Research source The skin of your lips is sensitive and can break easily if too much force is used."

      "title": "Rub your lips together.",
      "content": "Rub your lips together. Press your lips together and rub your bottom lip against your top lip in a circular motion. Continue this motion for around 30 seconds. Done correctly, this is will scrape off any dead skin cells and flakes you have. [4] X Research source Ensure you do this firmly, but not too hard, or you may risk damaging your lips. If you feel your skin rip while you are rubbing them together, stop immediately. This is a sign that you might have applied too much force. Wait for them to heal before using lip scrub again. When you do, either rub more gently, or for a shorter period of time."

      "content": "Get rid of the excess lip scrub. If your lip scrub is edible - which is often the case - you can simply lick it off. If not, gently rinse it off using your hands and some lukewarm water. To avoid making a mess, it is suggested that you lean over a sink or basin when doing this."

      "title": "Dab your lips dry.",
      "content": "Dab your lips dry. The best way to do this is to use a soft towel or tissue. Make sure this is done gently and with care. Avoid drying them by quickly rubbing them back and forth. Although this may make them dry faster, it is not worth it in the end. This will only lead you ripping your skin and making your lips bleed. Try not to use any rough materials against your lips. This may cause the skin to break. However, if this is your last resort because you cannot find a soft towel or tissue, gently press your lips against the material until they are dry. Remember that this is your last option and you should not use it unless absolutely necessary. Using rough materials can also lead to dry, irritated lips. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Moisturize your lips.",
      "content": "Moisturize your lips. An effective and simple way to do this after exfoliation is to apply a hydrating lip balm or lotion . This step is not only important for keeping your lips smooth and soft , but also to reduce your risk of getting chapped lips. Lip scrubs are mainly for exfoliating your lips, and although many have moisturizing ingredients in them such as natural oils (olive oil, almond oil, coconut oil, etc.), it is more effective to hydrate your lips with a lip balm or lotion. Products with petroleum jelly , such as Vaseline, seal the moisture in your lips for hours. [6] X Research source This is helpful if you have or are prone to particularly dry or cracked lips . Not only does petroleum jelly have multiple skincare benefits, it is also inexpensive and found in most drugstores and pharmacies. Hence, it is a very useful product to have at home.

However, it is important to refrain from using lip scrub any more than the recommendation as exfoliating too often will damage your lips. Cinnamon is a great ingredient for plumper lips. It irritates your mucus membrane, increases blood circulation in the area, and makes your lips look fuller. The shelf life of a homemade lip scrub depends on the ingredients used in the recipe. If you use 100% natural ingredients and do not put preservatives, a lip scrub based on coconut or avocado oil should last for about two weeks if it's being refrigerated."
