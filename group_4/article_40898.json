      "content": "Wipe grease and debris from your oven when it’s cool. Use a damp rag to wipe down the inside of your oven. Concentrate on removing only debris and grease that comes off easily. The steam cleaning process will loosen up the more stubborn, caked-on grime. [1] X Research source Be sure to wait until your oven is completely cool before starting to clean it. You can also use a vacuum with a hose attachment to suck up loose debris."

      "content": "Put 1 cup (240 mL) of distilled or filtered water into your oven. If you have an oven with a steam cleaning setting, you can pour the water directly into the bottom of your oven. If you have an oven without a steam cleaning setting, on the other hand, fill an oven-safe pot or bowl, like a casserole dish, with water and put it on a rack in your oven. [2] X Research source Refer to the owner’s manual for specific instructions regarding how much water you should use when cleaning your oven with steam. Using distilled or filtered water instead of water from your tap will keep your oven free of water spots and mineral deposits.You can purchase distilled water at most grocery stores. [3] X Research source If you’re filling an oven-safe dish with water, you can also pour in 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of vinegar for extra cleaning power. Or, if your oven is extremely dirty, you can use 1 cup (240 mL) of vinegar only."

      "content": "Push the “Steam Clean” button on your oven if your oven has one. Some oven models, especially newer ones, will have a separate setting for steam cleaning your oven, often found near the self-clean button. If yours has such a button, refer to the owner’s manual for model-specific instructions about how to use it. If your oven doesn’t have a steam cleaning setting, heat it to 450 °F (232 °C) for 20 minutes. [4] X Research source With some oven models with a separate steam clean setting, you may have to press the steam clean button first and then add water when the oven display prompts you to do so. [5] X Research source For most ovens with a steam cleaning setting, the process will last anywhere from 20-30 minutes. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Wipe down the inside of your oven once it cools. Your oven will beep when the steam clean process has completed. Once you hear this, or after about 20-30 minutes, turn off your oven. Let your oven cool down, and then use a sponge or dish rag to clean up any excess water or food particles. [7] X Research source Use a rag or sponge that you don’t mind getting stained. This step may get pretty messy, so be sure to put on some old clothes and keep a garbage can nearby. Make sure to clean any racks or pans that are in the oven as well."

If the stainless-steel attachment doesn’t seem to be strong enough to clear up the gunk in your oven, try using a scraper attachment. [10] X Research source A steam cleaner designed for household cleaning should work well for oven cleaning. Always use caution when using a steam cleaner as the hot steam can scald you or people around you."

      "content": "Select a high temperature and pressure setting and let the water heat up. The high temperature and pressure will help loosen up years of grime caked on your oven. You can always start on lower settings to see how they work and then gradually increase the temperature and pressure as needed. [11] X Research source On cheaper household models, you’ll probably need to use the maximum setting. If you’re using a more expensive model that is designed to be used commercially, on the other hand, you might want to start on a lower setting to begin with."

[12] X Research source Wipe off grime with a cleaning cloth or sponge as you loosen it up. The steam will be safe on all surfaces in your oven, including enamel, glass, and stainless steel. Be sure to read the instruction manual for your specific steam cleaner before using it."

Then, sprinkle baking soda on top of the vinegar-coated surface. After letting the vinegar and baking soda mix sit for 30 minutes, use a sponge or cleaning pad to thoroughly scrub the surface until it’s clean. [13] X Research source You can also use a product like Bar Keepers Friend if you’d prefer. If you don’t like the smell of vinegar, use lemon juice instead."
