Chances are, when you’re having fun, you’re not really thinking about what “type” of fun you’re having—that’s what the Fun Scale is for! [1] X Research source Geologist Rainer Newberry coined the term “Fun Scale” in his novel Climbing Dictionary: Mountaineering Slang, Terms, Neologisms & Lingo in 1985. [2] X Research source The Fun Scale was originally applied to outdoor or adventure activities and has three main levels of fun: Types 1, 2, and 3. Each level weighs how rewarding and memorable an activity is based on the overall experience: [3] X Research source Type 1 fun is fun in the moment and is pleasant to remember. Type 2 fun is not fun in the moment but is fun or pleasant to remember. Type 3 fun is not fun at all in the moment and you don’t look back on it fondly (but it may make for a great story). Some Fun Scale enthusiasts add a Type 4 fun, which is fun in the moment but unpleasant to look back on or something you regret doing later. While the scale has a general premise, everyone’s interpretation of the scale can be different based on personal experiences and expectations. In other words, what you find to be Type 2 fun may be a friend’s Type 1."

An activity that’s Type 1 is fun to do in the moment and is equally as fun when you think about it. It’s carefree and enjoyable—something you’d do again in a heartbeat.

Chances are, if you do something and want to quickly do it again, it’s a Type 1 activity. Type 1 activities vary per person, so find what clicks for you. Maybe that’s coloring, going for a walk with your dog, or skateboarding."

But when you reflect on the activity, you feel fulfilled and think of it as fun. This type of fun usually comes with a sense of accomplishment or achievement.

Type 2 activities feel uncomfortable at first, but they’re the most rewarding. Set goals of what you hope to gain and accomplish. Then, do what it takes to make them happen! [6] X Research source This can look like setting a goal to run a 5k or go on an overnight backpacking trip alone."

This type of fun can be scary and dangerous in the moment. It likely starts from an activity you thought would be Type 2 fun but quickly becomes something you didn’t expect (and likely something you’ll never do again). [7] X Research source Examples: Getting lost in the woods while hiking Meeting a bear in the wild Climbing a steep mountain in the snow Benefits: Improves confidence Builds character and resilience Provides lasting memories"

      "content": "How to have Type 3 fun Let Type 3 activities come your way—don’t force them. Type 3 fun is the most difficult and challenging level on the Fun Scale. It comes when you least expect it, often branching out of what you’d expect to be Type 2 fun. So, let it come naturally and face the challenge head-on when it does. Remember, it’ll make for one epic story. For instance, maybe you plan on going camping with friends. As the camping adventure goes on, you start to have less and less fun, turning into a Type 2 activity. When you think things can’t get any worse, a skunk attacks your tent, making it a Type 3. Don’t try to seek out dangerous activities just for the sake of having Type 3 fun. At their worst, Type 3 activities can cause injury, psychological distress, or potentially even death if things go truly awry."

      "content": "Type 4 fun is fun in the moment, but only in the moment. While Type 4 fun isn’t technically a part of the Fun Scale, many argue it should be included. Internet users categorize this bonus level of fun as something that feels like “the best time ever” in the moment, but makes you feel absolutely horrible afterward. You may experience this type of fun as you get older and realize you can’t do the same things you used to do when you were young. Examples: Going out for a few to many drinks with friends Staying up all night to binge-watch a show Eating 3 cheeseburgers back-to-back Benefits: Provides quality memories Improves self-boundaries Enhances self-awareness Tip: Type 4 fun isn’t recommended to chase after, which is likely why it isn’t included in the Fun Scale. This level of fun is learned from, not sought after."

Type 2 fun is challenging but rewarding, helping you step outside your comfort zone and learn more about yourself. Type 3 fun is the ultimate challenge that teaches you lessons and makes you feel like you can accomplish anything (even if you never want to do that activity again). [8] X Research source Each type creates memories and life lessons—they build character. While you may not realize it, you crave these activities to create a fulfilling, well-rounded, and liberating life."

Try your best to avoid thinking about what type of fun you’re having while you’re having it. Instead, simply do something you think will be fun rather than worrying about what type of fun it’ll be. [9] X Research source “We can learn to create or nurture [feelings of happiness],” Reichard says. “Do more activities that invoke positive emotions, like spending time with people you love or playing and being active.”"

[10] X Research source Reichard recommends getting “in touch with that part of you that is fun and likes to have fun. Then, let yourself enjoy life from that part of you. Encourage yourself to look for the fun or funny, the light and positive, and you’ll find it.”"

The more fun you have in your everyday life, the happier you’ll be. [11] X Research source “It’s really about self-care,” explains Panlilio, “and having that opportunity to focus on you for a few minutes.” Whether you’ve had a good or bad day, you can do something you enjoy to decompress and feel happier."

Years down the road, you may look back on horrible Type 3 activities with a smile!"
