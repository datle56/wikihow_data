Are there loud noises such as fireworks? Your pet may be feeling nervous; they need a safe place to hide out. [6] X Research source Look for other signs of anxiety in your dog. Symptoms include excessive panting, licking their lips, shying away, loss of appetite, and persistently scanning the room. When an anxious canine is driven from their den, it may either pace restlessly, freeze in place, or immediately try to hide again.
