      "content": "Contact a local Army recruiter. If you are interested in moving from the reserves to active duty, the first person you should talk to is a recruiter. They can assess your eligibility for special programs and help you to decide what direction you would like to go in while on active duty. Since you are already in the reserves, you will likely fulfill all the general requirements for entering the military, such as being between the ages of 17 and 35, having a high school diploma, and being a citizen.

      "title": "Review the prior service business rules with your recruiter.",
      "content": "Review the prior service business rules with your recruiter. These rules limit the number of military members that can reenlist after a term of service. These numbers are determined by the member's work specialty, called the military occupational specialty (MOS), and current vacancies in positions and training programs. Whether or not the prior service business rules apply to you depends on how much reserve training you have done and if you've had break in service. Talk to your recruiter about exceptions to the prior business service rules. For instance, being considered a new enlistment instead of a reenlistment could mean you are eligible for signing bonuses and other perks."

      "title": "Determine if there are openings in your active duty unit.",
      "content": "Determine if there are openings in your active duty unit. In order to move from reserve to active duty, there has to be an open position for you to move into. If there is not an opening for your military occupational specialty at your pay grade, then the request may be denied. Talk to your recruiter about where you might fit when moving to active duty. When moving from reserves to active duty, you can also request to receive training in a new specialty. However, there has to be space in the training program for you to be accepted and for your transfer to be approved."

One of these is the Call to Active Duty Program, which assesses the skills and training of exceptional reserve members and allows those that have performed exceptionally in the reserves to choose their specialty training when entering active duty. [2] X Research source This is a program specifically for commissioned, warrant, and non-commissioned officers.

      "content": "Consider joining the active guard reserve program. If you would like to work for the army full time but in the reserve system, you can apply to the active guard reserve program. This program allows you to serve full time, get the benefits associated with active duty, and be stationed in the United States while serving your tour. Like other branches of the army, the active guard reserve program has ample opportunities for training and development. If your goal is to rise in the ranks, it can be done in this program."

When attempting to move from reserves to active duty, you may want to consider how your specialized training will impact your position in the army. Those in the reserves who have received specialized training and have a good record are more likely to be allowed to transfer to active duty than those with no specialized training."

      "title": "Get the support of your chain of command.",
      "content": "Get the support of your chain of command. Once you have determined what active duty position you would like to pursue, talk to your direct supervisor about your plans. You will need to have your first general level officer sign off on the transition, so it's important to have a good report with them and explain clearly why you want to become an active duty member. Begin the conversation by asking your supervisor if you could schedule a time to talk to them privately. When you do have this meeting, state clearly \"I want to transfer to active duty.\" Then give them specific examples of how your time in the reserves has led you to this decision. Also tell them how your long term goals can be served by this transition. Keep in mind, it may be that you are needed in your reserve unit and your commander will not approve the transfer."
