Low-end mobile: Choose this option to emulate a slower 3G connection and throttle the CPU 6 times slower than normal. Both throttling options are relative to the CPU in your computer. In other words, choosing one of these options on a computer with an ultra-fast CPU will yield faster results than the same test on a slower computer. [2] X Research source"
