      "title": "The sticker should say the name of the hue.",
      "content": "The sticker should say the name of the hue. The sticker on authentic MAC lipsticks is round. An imposter might have a square or oval sticker, or the name might be printed directly on the box. [1] X Research source The name of the fake product may sound generic like “MAC Red” or “MAC Fuschia.” Authentic MAC lipsticks have names like “Petal Power” or “Lovelorn.”"

      "title": "Fake MAC lipstick might have a printed barcode.",
      "content": "Fake MAC lipstick might have a printed barcode. Turn the lipstick box on its side and look carefully at the barcode. It will be a sticker on authentic MAC lipsticks. If the barcode is printed directly on the box, it's a fake. [2] X Research source The imitation lipstick may have a supplementary sticker near the barcode that reads the name of the product, a serial number, or false factory information."
    },
    {
      "title": "On a genuine MAC, it should start with A, B, or C.",
      "content": "On a genuine MAC, it should start with A, B, or C. Look at the base of the tube to find the serial number located just below the sheen and name of the lipstick. Genuine MAC lipsticks have serial numbers starting with A, B, or C, usually followed by two numbers (e.g. \"A44\" or “B32”). A counterfeit may start with another letter that’s not A, B, or C or only list a random set of numbers. [3] X Research source The bottom sticker of a dupe will also appear more shiny, silvery, and reflective while the authentic one is a grayish-white matte color. [4] X Research source The genuine sticker lists the finish at the top, the name of the lipstick in the center, and the serial number toward the bottom (e.g., \"Satin\", \"Myth\", \"A78\"). [5] X Research source Actual MAC lipsticks are manufactured in Toronto, Canada. If the bottom sticker doesn't have that information around the edges of the sticker, it's a knockoff."

    {
      "title": "The real tube's font is much smaller in height and closer together.",
      "content": "The real tube's font is much smaller in height and closer together. A fake tube will have similar font but it will be a slightly taller and more spread out from the “M” to the “C”. [6] X Research source If you only have 1 tube, look up photos of authentic or imitation tubes online for comparison. The actual MAC logo looks like it's almost carved into the cap of the tube. A fake may look more like it's printed or stuck onto it and the logo may fade over time. The dots on either side of the \"A\" should also be perfectly round. Sham versions may have oblong or smudged dots. [7] X Research source The logo of a fake MAC lipstick may also be positioned a few millimeters higher than the logo on an authentic MAC lipstick.

      "title": "A real MAC lipstick tube will be smooth.",
      "content": "A real MAC lipstick tube will be smooth. Hold the tube in one hand and run your thumb up and down it to see if it feels silky like the top of a polished fingernail. If it's not smooth or plastic-feeling, it's a knockoff. [9] X Research source Original MAC lipsticks are coated with a silky sheen to give them a soft, delicate feel. Similarly, hold the tube under direct lighting. A real MAC lipstick tube will be shiny. If it's matte or dull, it's a fake."

    {
      "title": "It should fit the same if it's a real MAC lipstick.",
      "content": "It should fit the same if it's a real MAC lipstick. If you have two MAC lipsticks and suspect one of them is counterfeit, try to switch the caps. The fake one’s cap will loosely fit over the actual MAC lipstick’s applicator, but the authentic one’s cap will be too small to fit over the counterfeit’s applicator. With close inspection, you may be able to see that the authentic tube of MAC lipstick has a thinner metallic section. [10] X Research source The MAC logo printed on the silver part of a mock-up will also be much taller and spread out."

    {
      "title": "A phony MAC lipstick will have a dull applicator.",
      "content": "A phony MAC lipstick will have a dull applicator. However, the real one should be shiny and silvery. This is because the applicator of authentic MAC lipsticks is often made from an alloy like aluminum and steel. [11] X Research source Because of the alloy used to make MAC lipsticks, it should feel heavier than a counterfeit tube."

    {
      "title": "You should be able to feel the ring on a real MAC.",
      "content": "You should be able to feel the ring on a real MAC. Move your finger from the top to the bottom over the silver ring separating the cap from the applicator. If you feel a slight bump, you know it's a genuine MAC lipstick. If it's smooth, it's a fake. [12] X Research source If you look at an actual MAC lipstick tube closely, you may notice the silver ring slightly protrudes from the tube."
    },
    {
      "title": "On a real MAC, the plastic lining will be simple.",
      "content": "On a real MAC, the plastic lining will be simple. Turn the bottom of the tube so the lipstick retracts as much as possible and look at the inside of the tube. The imitation will have several hooks and cutouts lining the inside of the tube. The inner plastic part on a genuine MAC lipstick is much less busy, only having a crevice in the shape of a line with a small hook towards the top. [13] X Research source The inner plastic lining of the knockoff lipstick may also be stark white and opaque as opposed to the more translucent gray-white plastic on the inside of the original MAC lipstick."

    {
      "title": "Turn the base of the tube so the lipstick is fully exposed.",
      "content": "Turn the base of the tube so the lipstick is fully exposed. The plastic ring around the base should be clear. If it's white or opaque in color, you know it's a fake. [14] X Research source The small plastic ring on the counterfeit may also be a little thicker than the one on the real MAC lipstick."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the lipstick up to your nose and give it a big whiff.",
      "content": "Hold the lipstick up to your nose and give it a big whiff. If it's genuine, you'll notice a soft vanilla scent. Fake MAC lipsticks might smell like fruit or candy. [15] X Research source Some knockoffs may even smell like nothing at all."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay attention to how the lipstick goes onto your skin.",
      "content": "Pay attention to how the lipstick goes onto your skin. Feel it with your finger afterward to check the consistency. A legitimate MAC lipstick will go on with a light, creamy consistency while an imitation will feel heavier and less buttery. [16] X Research source The counterfeit MAC may also show signs of clumping or the color may look uneven."

    {
      "title": "Put the lipstick on your lips and rub them together to get a sense of the texture.",
      "content": "Put the lipstick on your lips and rub them together to get a sense of the texture. Pseudo MAC lipsticks will feel glossy and greasy (likely due to the addition of petroleum jelly) while real MAC lipsticks feel like suede or soft butter without added grease. Keep in mind that the finish also matters. Genuine matte lipsticks should feel true to their description (that is, a “powder finish” variety should feel velvety and light while a “mattene” finish should feel silky and suede-like)."

    {
      "title": "If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.",
      "content": "If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. For instance, if you see a tube of MAC lipstick for $10, it’s likely a fake. Actual MAC lipsticks cost at least $20 a tube or $40 and up for a package of 3 or 4 lip products. [17] X Research source Authentic MAC lipstick minis typically cost $12 and up. A counterfeit vendor may try to sell them for $6 to $8."

      "title": "That way you can be sure the product is legit.",
      "content": "That way you can be sure the product is legit. Avoid buying MAC lipsticks from individual sellers, flea markets, street vendors, internet auctions, or independent boutiques because MAC doesn’t sell any of its products via these methods. [18] X Expert Source Hannah Metz Professional Makeup & Hair Artist Expert Interview. 14 December 2021. [19] X Research source Beauty-supply stores like ULTA or Sephora or department stores like Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Macy's, and Neiman Marcus all carry authentic MAC lipsticks. Report any counterfeit lipsticks to MAC by calling 1-800-387-6707 (option 8) or by emailing consumercare-us@gcc.maccosmetics.com."
