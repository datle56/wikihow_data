It is not the aerobic exercise that brings the benefits of a brisk walk, but a meditative activity that centers the mind and calms the nervous system. You can do this anywhere, but for best results find a place to walk where you will not encounter people to talk to or obstacles that may distract you from your meditation. [4] X Research source To practice walking meditation, start by being aware of your physical body as you stand. Feel the way your feet connect to the ground, and the way the air feels against your skin. Walk forward at a gentle pace. Continue to notice the way your body feels as you move. Breathe through your nostrils, maintaining awareness of the feeling of your breath flowing through your nostrils and into your lungs. Come to a stop, and notice how it feels to cease movement. Repeat this exercise until your attention wanders. Over time you'll develop the ability to practice this meditation for longer periods of time."
