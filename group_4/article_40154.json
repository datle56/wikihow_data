      "title": "Wash your face with cold water.",
      "content": "Wash your face with cold water. Splashing cold water on your face doesn’t actually wake you up directly. Instead, this initially causes constriction or narrowing of facial arteries, so you are actually decreasing the blood flow to your face. This lack of blood flow sets off a nervous system reflex to become more alert and fight to get out of this environment. Reduction of blood flow to the eyes reduces inflammation to the eyes. [1] X Research source Natural tears are produced when your eyes are closed during this period of time. With prolonged periods of being awake, eyes can become dry and tired. Strategies that increase eye closure reduce dryness and spread tear film. Test the water temperature before splashing. The water should be cold but not freezing. Splash the water at least three times to get results. Keep in mind, however, that you will only get slight relief from this method. Too few splashes may cause no change at all."
