      "content": "Nourish hair with a mixture of eucalyptus oil and a carrier oil. Combine 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of eucalyptus essential oil with 4 tablespoons (59 ml) of coconut or olive oil, which will act as a carrier oil to dilute and hold the essential oil. Gently massage the mixture into your scalp and hair and let it sit for an hour. Then take a shower and wash it out with shampoo and conditioner. The combination of eucalyptus oil and a carrier oil will help moisturize and nourish brittle, dry, or dull hair. The extra moisture can be helpful to rehydrate a dry scalp and prevent itching and flaking."
