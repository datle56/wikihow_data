      "content": "Apply heat protectant spray. Start by applying some heat protectant spray to your wet hair after washing it. These products create a barrier around the surface of your hair (AKA the cuticle), so they essentially act as a shield against the high temperatures of your blow dryer and curling iron. [1] X Research source Here are some heat protectant products to try out: Living Proof Restore Perfecting Spray Pros: Has conditioning and detangling properties, great for dry, damaged, or tangle-prone hair. Cons: Only protects up to 400°F (204°C), a bit pricey. Customer Ratings: 4.6 star average on Amazon.com. Tresemmé Keratin Smooth Heat Protectant Spray Pros: Heat protection up to 450°F (232°C), smoothes and eliminates frizz, least expensive option. Cons: Reviewers mention that the nozzle doesn’t create a very fine mist, so it does get your hair pretty wet when you apply it. Customer Ratings: 4.7 star average on Amazon.com. Morrocanoil Perfect Defense Thermal Protection Spray Pros: Protects up to 450°F (232°C), is a dry aerosol spray, so it can be applied to dry hair before straightening. Cons: Has a stronger scent (which some people enjoy), but may be overwhelming if you like products with more subtle scents. Customer Ratings: 4.6 star average on Amazon.com [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Blow dry your hair. To achieve this look, you’ll want to start with completely dry hair. You can let your hair air dry if you prefer, but if you want a super smooth, polished look, it’s best to blow dry it . Almona recommends using a blow dryer that has a nozzle to direct the heat in the right direction. You can find a blow dryer with a nozzle attachment at most beauty supply stores."

      "title": "Curl your hair using a curling iron with a clamp.",
      "content": "Curl your hair using a curling iron with a clamp. When creating Utah curls, you’ll need to use a 1 or 1 ⁄ 4 inch (25.4 or 6.4 mm) curling iron with a clamp , rather than a curling wand. Clamp your hair a little over midway down, leaving the ends out—remember, you want the ends to stay straight! Curl the hair away from your face and allow it to heat for 2-3 seconds. Finally, twist the curling iron around the section of hair as you unravel it (this movement can be a bit hard to master, but this TikTok video shows it pretty well if you need a visual reference). Here are some popular curling irons to try out: Hot Tools Pro Artist Black Gold Digital Salon Curling Iron Pros: Heats up quickly, reasonably priced, extra-long cord for easier maneuvering. Cons: People with finer hair may find that their hair slips out of the clamp a bit during use. Customer Ratings: 4.3 rating on Amazon.com InfinitiPro by Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron Pros: Inexpensive, reliable results, creates soft and shiny curls. Cons: The clamp is detachable, and it may come off sometimes if not securely fastened. Customer Ratings: 4.4 star average on Amazon.com Drybar The 3-Day Bender Curling Iron Pros: Has a rotating base, which makes curling quicker and easier. Cons: The priciest option on this list. Customer Ratings: 3.9 star average on Amazon.com [3] X Research source Be careful not to put your curling iron on too hot of a setting. Van den Abbeel explains that this is “the biggest mistake people make with their curling iron.” For many hair types, the 400°F (204°C) is a good place to start, but for finer hair types, you may need to subtract 10-20 degrees, and for coarser or denser hair types, you may need to add 10-20 degrees. For color-treated hair, you’ll want to stick to 350°F (176°C). [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Run a wide-toothed comb through your hair to separate the curls. Utah curls are meant to be loose and beachy, so you’ll want to comb through them after you’re done curling to achieve this laid-back look. [5] X Research source A wide-toothed comb is perfect for this, but you can run your fingers through your hair instead if you don’t have one."

      "content": "Finish with hairspray. A light-hold hairspray or texturizing spray can help your curls last without giving you that crunchy feeling of regular hairspray (we’ll go over some recommendations below). And that’s it! You should now have a full head of Utah curls. Not Your Mother’s Texturizing Sea Salt Spray : Pros: Adds volume without frizziness, also acts as a UV protectant, least pricey option. Cons: Only has a light hold, so may not be the best option if your hair doesn’t hold a curl or wave very well. Customer Ratings: 4.4 star average on Amazon.com Ouai Wave Spray : Pros: Sprays on in a very fine mist, perfume-like scent of bergamot, Italian lemon, rose de mai, and violet, hydrates and defines waves. Cons: Even though many people love the scent, it may be a bit strong for some people, or it could clash with your daily perfume. Customer Ratings: 4.2 star average on Amazon.com Drybar Triple Sec 3-in-1 Finishing Spray : Pros: Acts as dry shampoo while also adding volume and texture. Cons: If you spray it too close to your hair, it could leave a tacky residue. Customer Ratings: 4.5 star average on Amazon.com [6] X Research source If your hair starts to look a little flat after a day or two without washing, try freshening it up with some dry shampoo . “I think people live on dry shampoo, and it’s awesome,” says Van den Abbeel. “It really does work. And the benefit for a lot of people, especially with fine hair, is that it gives just a touch of grittiness on second or third-day hair, which gives them a little bit more volume.”"

      "title": "Utah curls are slightly different from beachy waves.",
      "content": "Utah curls are slightly different from beachy waves. Both styles involve loose, laid-back waves (rather than tightly coiled curls), but there’s one key difference: the ends. To achieve Utah curls, you’ll leave the end of each curl straight. Beachy waves, on the other hand, usually continue all the way down to the bottom of your hair. Utah curls are different from regular curls as well since they’re more of a looser wave than typical coiled curls. Most curl hairstyles also continue all the way down to the bottom of the hair, while Utah curls leave the ends straight."
