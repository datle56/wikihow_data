      "content": "Check the expiry date on the bacon packet. Look for either a “sell by” or “use by” date, and compare the indicated with the current calendar date. Don’t eat any bacon that’s past its “use by” date. The “sell by” date is a little different: properly stored bacon can be eaten up to 7 days past its “sell by” date. [1] X Trustworthy Source Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA Food safety information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Go to source Note that properly frozen bacon can last far beyond its \"sell by\" or \"use by\" dates. Also check to make sure the packaging is still sealed and has no holes or tears, which may expose your bacon to bacteria and cause it to spoil prematurely."

      "content": "Check for a sour smell. Open up your bacon and give it a good whiff. Spoiled bacon will have a distinct, sour smell. If your bacon smells even a bit rotten or off, it’s best to toss it. [2] X Research source Unspoiled bacon has a mild, savory smell that you can’t miss."

      "content": "Examine the bacon for discoloration or other imperfections. Bring the bacon to a well-lit area and remove it from its packaging. Fresh, uncooked bacon is light pink and white in color, while unspoiled precooked bacon has darker red veining. If your bacon matches these descriptions, it’s safe to eat.

      "title": "Touch the bacon and check for a slimy texture.",
      "content": "Touch the bacon and check for a slimy texture. Unspoiled bacon is fairly dry or rough in texture, though it may have some condensation or juices on its surface. Spoiled bacon, on the other hand, often has a distinct slimy, viscous feel. This is because lactic acid bacteria has begun to grow and break down the bacon, lending it that unpleasant, sticky texture. Always handle raw meat with clean hands, and be sure to wash your hands afterward, as well."

Place your opened bacon in an airtight container, like a sealable freezer bag or tupperware , and keep it in the fridge at 40 °F (4 °C) or below for up to a week after opening.

      "title": "Keep cooked bacon fresh in the fridge for an additional 7 days.",
      "content": "Keep cooked bacon fresh in the fridge for an additional 7 days. Extend your bacon’s shelf life by cooking it before its expiration date, and then storing it in the fridge in an airtight, resealable container. In addition, wrap the bacon strips in a paper towel to absorb any excess grease that may make your bacon soggy during its stay in the fridge. Bacon will stay fresh for different amounts of time, depending on how it’s been prepared. Cooked bacon in strips lasts for about a week in the fridge, and up to 6 months in the freezer, while bacon bits will last for about 6 weeks in the fridge, and 6 months in the freezer."

Then, use your leftover bacon fat to add flavor to other dishes, like vegetable stir fries or as a tasty substitute for shortening.
