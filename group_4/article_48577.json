      "title": "Aquarius",
      "content": "Aquarius The intellectual water bearer can balance their mental and emotional stressors when they put their mind to it.

That’s okay, though—a little self-reflection can go a long way with this sign. Emotional Advice: Don’t just go through the motions by asking a friend for advice.

      "title": "Scorpio",
      "content": "Scorpio As the resident scorpion of the zodiac, Scorpios are great at presenting themselves in a strong, untouchable light. They are very willful about the personal power they wield. However, plenty of Scorpios use this façade to hide and downplay the validity of their feelings, which doesn’t leave them in an emotionally strong position. Emotional Advice: Scorpios tend to be tense. Push past this natural instinct and give yourself permission to feel your feelings! Crying after a tough day or bad argument doesn’t make you weak—it shows that you care enough about the world around you to get upset when things go wrong."
