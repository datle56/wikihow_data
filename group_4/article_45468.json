      "content": "Know the different categories of traffic signs. [1] X Research source Regulatory signs regulate the flow of traffic and movement. They come in an assortment of shapes and colors. The most common regulatory signs are stop, yield, do not enter, one way, speed limit and school zone signs. Warning signs warn drivers of upcoming traffic hazards, dangerous roads, and other situations that require caution. They are generally yellow or orange and diamond-shaped. Marker signs announce the route number of a highway/freeway or the direction a particular road can lead to. They are usually white or green. Route markers are blue with a red strip on top. Guide signs inform drivers of destinations and distance, expressways and freeways, and work zones. They are generally rectangular and can come in a variety of colors. Recreational and cultural interest signs are brown with white text, and they signal nearby points of interest. These are usually directed towards travelers, and highlight restaurants, gas stations, areas with potable water, lodging, land/water/winter recreation, and other services."

      "content": "Stop signs are red and octagonal with white text. They tell drivers to come to a complete stop at the white line on the street. Drivers should look both ways to yield to pedestrians and oncoming traffic before proceeding. Each stop sign comes with a label at the bottom that indicates how many cars at the intersection have a stop sign. Two-way signs tell you that two cars do; you and the car traveling opposite you on the same street. You must both yield to all cars on the cross street. Three-way signs are generally only present at intersections that have three streets, so they function in the same way as four-way and all-way stop signs. The car that arrives at the intersection first can leave first after coming to a complete stop. If two cars arrive at the same time, the one on the right has the right of way."
