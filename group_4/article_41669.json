      "content": "Separate your hair into sections if it’s thick. To ensure you straighten your entire head of hair evenly and quickly, separate your hair into at least 2 sections. You can either split your hair down the middle, or you can tie up the top layer using a hair clip or tie. [1] X Research source If you have super thick hair, consider separating your hair into 4 sections. Tie up the top layer of your hair into 2 buns on top of your head, and then separate the bottom layer into 2 sections as well. If you split your hair down the middle, you can simply pull each side in front of each shoulder to keep it in place for longer hair. If you have short hair that doesn’t reach your shoulders, use a hair tie or hair clip to keep your hair in sections."

After you've pulled your hair into a low ponytail, just clamp down on the top of the ponytail and straighten the length of it. Once the ponytail is straight, undo it and straighten the top of your hair and any other bumps."

      "content": "Set the flat iron to the right temperature based on your hair texture. Instead of cranking the heat up as high as it will go, take your hair texture into consideration when heating up your flat iron. [2] X Research source If your hair is thin or fine, the temperature should be below 360 °F (182 °C). If you have normal to medium hair, set the temperature between 360 to 390 °F (182 to 199 °C). For thick hair, use a temperature of 390 to 410 °F (199 to 210 °C)."

      "content": "Dry your hair completely before using a flat iron. If your hair is damp at all while you're using a flat iron, not only will it damage your hair, but it will also take you much longer to get it straight. To dry your hair quickly, use a blow dryer with the nozzle aimed downwards. [9] X Research source Hair dryers can be damaging on your hair — always move the nozzle back and forth when drying your hair, never aiming it directly at a strand."

      "content": "Brush your hair thoroughly before using the flat iron. If your hair isn't brushed beforehand, you'll end up with bumps or jagged angles where the flat iron went over hair that's going in different directions, slowing down your straightening process. Take the time to brush or comb through your hair to remove any knots or tangles before straightening it for the best results."

Chase combs (also sometimes called straightening combs) comb your hair and separate it evenly for you as you're straightening your hair. [10] X Research source If you have medium or coarse hair, a chase comb is an ideal tool for straightening your hair. Use 1 hand to insert a strand of hair into the chase comb and clamp the comb closed starting at the top of the strand. With your other hand, you'll begin straightening the strand, pulling both the chase comb and straightener down the section of hair."
