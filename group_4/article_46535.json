      "content": "Fill the steamer with water, turn it on, and wait for it to heat up. Pour cold water into the water tank of your clothing steamer. Then, make sure all of the parts of the steamer are secured properly so water doesn’t leak all over the place. Simply plug the steamer in to let the water heat and start to steam. [1] X Research source Steamers usually heat up fairly quickly (2-3 minutes). Allow your steamer to heat up all the way until steam begins to form; this helps prevent sputters and spills. Check that the machine is producing a steady stream of steam before you use it. Simply pull the trigger on the handle or press the button to see how much steam comes out. If there is no sputtering, the steamer is ready. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Run the steamer in downward strokes along the fabric.",
      "content": "Run the steamer in downward strokes along the fabric. Pull the bottom of the garment down to keep the fabric taut. Then, hold the steamer against the fabric and slide it down your garment while pressing the steam button. You don't need to press hard or push the fabric against anything, as the steam gently removes the wrinkles on its own. [4] X Research source Steam delicate fabrics inside out and 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) away from the steamer. This helps protect fabrics like silk, chiffon, and velvet from potential heat and water damage. If you’re dealing with extremely wrinkled clothing , turn the garment inside out and steam the inside of the fabric. The weight of the fabric against the steam helps get the wrinkles out more quickly. When steaming fabrics with embellishments such as pleats and ruffles, hold the steamer 1 to 2 (2.5-5 cm) inches away from the fabric. This allows the fabric to keep its shape while the steam de-wrinkles it. If the garment is extremely wrinkled, also turn it inside out to steam the fabric without damaging the embellishments. Optional tip : Use a handheld pad as a surface to steam your clothes on. It may be helpful when you are steaming extremely dense or wrinkly fabrics. If you decide to use a pad, slip it over one hand and use your other hand to hold the steamer."

[6] X Research source Note : Always check the garment’s care label to see if it is safe to steam. If you’re unsure if your fabric can be steamed, carefully test the steamer on a small corner of the fabric before using it on the entire garment. Tip : Use any nozzle or brush attachments that come with your steamer. These are often made for specific fabrics to help prevent damage."

      "content": "Use distilled water in the steamer. While it’s okay to use regular tap water in your clothes steamer, many manufacturers recommend that you use distilled water. Tap water contains minerals that can build up inside your machine and clog the nozzle. Distilled water is purified, so there are no minerals to cause buildup. [8] X Research source Soft tap water is preferred to hard tap water, which has a higher concentration of minerals. If you have hard water, consider using a water softener to remove the excess minerals."

      "content": "Use an upright steamer . Upright steamers are sometimes referred to as floor steamers, as their base sits on the floor. These steamers typically include a base where the water tank sits, a hose attached to a nozzle, and a pole with a clothing hanger at the top. These steamers usually sit on wheels so that they can be moved more easily. [13] X Research source If you plan on keeping your steamer in one location, upright steamers are the ideal choice. They are larger than handheld steamers, but are very convenient because of their features (the clothing hanger, nozzle, etc.). However, they can be transported if you don't mind moving something that's a bit larger. These steamers are also ideal if you are steaming numerous pieces of clothing. Their water base is large and usually doesn't need to be refilled often. Most upright steamers come with attachments, such as different types of brushes for different kinds of fabrics. Upright steamers are typically the most expensive of all steamers, ranging from $50-$200."

      "content": "Use a steamer instead of an iron to de-wrinkle a larger variety of clothing. Irons and steamers are both meant to take the wrinkles out of clothing, though they each have their own perks. Irons are typically best on less delicate fabrics (like cotton or denim). Stocker says they are also ideal for pressing creases and pleats into clothing. Steamers work on a larger variety of fabrics as they are gentler and less likely to damage fabrics. Steamers are typically used on fabric while it is hanging, so they don't work well if you want to press or crease your clothing. [17] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Green Cleaning Expert Expert Interview. 20 April 2020.
